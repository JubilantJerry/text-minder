-Who?
You remember?
You"re gonna lose.
Stilwell, angel!
My goodness!
Where"s your mom?
Mom died a couple of years ago.
I"m sorry.
She was a real nice lady.
And a damn fine ballplayer.
When I heard about this, I felt like I owed it to her to be here.
She always said it was the best time she had in her whole life.
Come here.
Recognize yourself?
-Can I get one of these?
-Sure.
Ladies!
It"s a pleasure to welcome you here today.
It"s taken years, but you are the first women ever to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame!
-And now--
-Wait.
Wait a minute.
This really isn"t right.
Mr. Lowenstein since you kept the league going all those years you do it.
-There you go, Ira.
-Thank you, Bob.
Ladies it"s my honour.
Mr. Capadino, look!
That"s when you changed my life, honey!
Stilwell, angel, smile!

Take a picture.
Let"s take a picture of the whole team.
The original Peaches!
Strike!
That was clear inside.
It was clear inside, clear inside.
-l told you three times.
-That"s my opinion.
Yesterday or tomorrow, that might"ve been a ball but today, it was a strike!

Where"d you find this?
It was in one of those cartons.
Needs oil.
Who doesn"t?
You ready?
-l"m not going.
-Mom!
I"ve got two children, I don"t need a third.
Why is it so important that I go?
For one thing, it"d be nice if you just left the room.
Besides, these are your old friends.
They probably won"t remember me.
The ""Queen of Diamonds,"" Dottie Hinson?
Margaret, it just isn"t a good idea.
Come on, Mom.
You"ll get to see Aunt Kit.
-You never see each other.
-We still won"t.
She"ll be traveling around with that husband of hers.
Frank.
He has a name.
He"s always been very nice to you.
He makes me nervous.
There"s a lot of reasons why I can"t go.
Honey I"m not comfortable about this.
I"m not really part of it.
It was never that important.
It was just something I did.
When will you realize how special it was, how much it all meant?
I know how you feel. I really do.
But you"re going.
Car.
-Car, train, bus. I"m tired already.
-Sleep on the plane.
Grandma"s out.
is there a fire?
Wisenheimer.
Julie"s watching you.
I don"t want any bad reports.
-Bye, Grandma.
-Bye.
Jeffrey, come here.
No matter what your brother does, he"s littler than you.
Give him a chance to shoot.
Promise?
Bobby, come here.
Kill him.
Come on, you"ll miss your plane.
I still think I shouldn"t go.
Get a hit, Beans!
I"m coming, Mae!
I"m coming!
This week in the world of sports.
With the boys overseas and off to war baseball pitches in for the war effort.
Trading bats for bullets, Yankee Joe DiMaggio promises to give those Nazis a jolt.
Ace fireballer Bob Feller has traded Cleveland gray for Navy blue.
Baseball"s biggest stars say ""Look out, Mr. Hitler.
The Yanks are coming. ""
Not to mention the Indians, Red Sox and Tigers.
And they won"t come back till it"s over, over there.
Meanwhile, Chicago club owner Walter Harvey, the candy-bar king met with other team owners at the Harvey Mansion as rumours persist that baseball may be shut down for the duration of the war.
Harvey"s promotional whiz kid, Ira Lowenstein has been given the job of figuring out how to keep baseball going.
Good luck, Mr. Lowenstein.
Strike 2!
Hey, fatso!
Get the hell out of the way!
What are you, crazy?
Strike 3!
Kit!
-Sis, don"t swing at her high pitch.
-l can hit it.
-You can"t.
-l can.
This bat"s too heavy.
You"ll never get it around.
I will!
Listen.
There"s a big hole on the right side.
Don"t look.
-Unless she pitches inside, pull it.
-l know.
Batter up!
No high ones.
I like the high ones!
-Mule!
-Nag!
Come on, Kit.
Keep your eye on the ball.
Strike 1 !
Strike 2!
Too high.
All right, Kit.
Look it over!
Look it over there!
Strike 3!
All right, 2 outs, everybody.
Two away!
Better luck next time!
Knock it out of here!
Okay, Dottie!
Batter up!
Right in here!
Bring them in there, Dottie!
Ball!
Keep your eye on it, Dottie!
One hit and we win!
That"s it, Dottie!
You did it!
That"s the ball game!
Hey, Kit!
What are you swinging those high ones for?
Good thing your sister bailed you out.
How about the two bucks you owe me for this game?
Kit!
Wait up, I"ll give you a ride!
Stop kicking the rocks.
I"m sorry.
-That game just made me so mad.
-We won.
Get mad if we lose.
That last pitch was right down the middle.
If I"d have swung at that, I"d be the hero.
-You got me so crazy-- -l only said lay off the high ones.
""Good thing your sister bailed you out.""
"" Kit, why don"t you get your sister to teach you how to hit?""
""Why can"t you be beautiful like your sister?""
What idiot said that?
No one.
-But that"s what they were thinking.
-No, it"s not!
You ever hear Dad introduce us to people?
""This is our daughter Dottie.
This is our other daughter, Dottie"s sister.""
Should"ve just had you and bought a dog.
-Mitch Swaley likes you.
-He"s one step up from dating pigs.
But an important step.
-Why are you walking so fast?
-Why are you?
-Because you are.
-Can"t even let me walk faster than you?
Girls, you got chores to do.
Don"t run!
You"ll scare the chickens!
I don"t have time for these games.
-Why are you running?
-You can go faster than that.
Your legs are longer.
-l win!
-Barely.
Hey!
Hey, yourself.
Doesn"t that hurt them?
Doesn"t seem to.
It would bruise the hell out of me.
Who are you?
I"m Ernie Capadino, baseball scout.
I saw you playing today.
Not bad, not bad.
Ever hear of Walter Harvey?
Harvey Bars?
You know, the candy?
Yeah, we feed them to the cows when they"re constipated.
He"s starting a girls" baseball league so we can make a buck while the boys are overseas.
Wanna play?
Nice retort.
Tryouts are in Chicago.
It"s a real league, professional.
Professional baseball?
They"ll pay you $75 a week.
We only make $30 at the dairy.
Then this would be more, wouldn"t it?
Interested?
Come on. $75 a week?
Pull her leg.
Mine are long enough.
Look, your country needs you.
You can not only play ball, but you"re kind of a dolly.
Oh, now I get it.
Listen, mister.
I"m a married woman.
My husband"s overseas.
Oh, relax!
I"m talking lookie, no touchie.
We want girls easy on the eye.
I"ll go. I"m ready now.
I gotta sign something?
I don"t want you!
I want her!
The one who hit the ball!
You can climb back under the cow.
She"s good.
She"s very good.
She pitches.
She didn"t today, because she did yesterday.
Thanks for that special glimpse into her life.
I want you.
You I saw, you I like.
The train leaves for Chicago tomorrow.
What do you say?
Are you in?
No, thanks.
"" No, thanks""?
Hey, no skin off my Ashtabula.
If you wanna pluck cows, that"s your business.
You know something?
You"re not nice.
That one hurt.
So long, milkmaids.
No, wait!
Just watch me pitch.
Dottie, get your mitt!
I"ll throw him a few.
Now look I know the goods when I see the goods, and she"s the goods.
I"m sorry.
Will you shut up?
!
You"re a pitcher, huh?
I"ll tell you what.
If she comes, you can come too.
If you stink, it only costs us the train ticket.
Get these wild animals away from me!
Haven"t you ever heard of a leash?
Come on, Dottie.
You got the whole rest of your life to hang around here.
Never go anywhere.
Never do anything.
I"m married. I"m happy.
It"s what I want.
Don"t confuse things.
But can"t you just have this first?
Just so you can say you once did something?
Something special?
Goodness sake, Kit!
Keep your voice down.
Your father"s listening to the radio.
Please, Dottie?
I gotta get out of here.
I"m nothing here.
In the Pacific Northwest, my territory we have increased sales 1 06% in the last 1 2-month period.
And this with a war on!
You know, if I had your job, I"d kill myself.
Sit here. I"ll see if I can dig up a pistol.
Every trip I take, I gotta sit next to one of these guys.
I"m just too friendly.
Hey, isn"t that--?
Well, I"ll say one thing for them.
They can run.
Mr. Capadino!
I got her!
Look!
-Sir, your knee.
-Like it?
Stop the train!
Come on!
Come on!
Give me that bag!
Did you promise the cows you"d write?
When do we get to Chicago?
We gotta make a stop.
Fort Collins, Colorado.
Gotta look at another girl.
Hope you"re not jealous.
I"m sorry.
It"s okay, honey.
That was good form.
Thattagirl!
Good, honey.
Good.
Nice, nice.
That"s a rope, honey.
Good girl.
Good, good.
Right, too high.
She"s got an eye like DiMaggio.
Okay, Marla.
Now lefty.
She"s really good.
She"s your daughter?
Her mom"s dead.
It"s just the two of us.
Coach said if she was a boy, she"d go to the state tournament.
I said, "" lf she was a boy, I"d talk to the Yankees instead of living here.""
That"s enough.
You can bring her over.
Okay, Marla.
Come here.
Boys!
Hit the showers!
Take off your hat, honey.
We"ll let you know.
Daddy, I"m sorry.
Let"s go.
We"ll miss the train.
Let"s move, move, move!
What"s the matter?
I can"t use her.
She"s great.
Why not?
What"s the problem?
You know General Omar Bradley?
There"s too strong a resemblance.
You ain"t taking her because she ain"t pretty?
Well, look who just caught up!
All right.
Come on, let"s go.
Pick those suitcases up!
Come on!
I"m not kidding.
Move!
-One foot in front of the other.
-Mister?
I know my girl ain"t so pretty as these girls.
But that"s my fault.
I raised her like I would a boy.
I didn"t know any better.
She loves to play.
Don"t make my girl suffer because I messed up raising her.
Please?
I wish you had a decent mitt.
I think maybe I"d better not go.
No, you can relace it.
It"ll be okay.
I mean, who"s gonna take care of you?
Cook?
Help you take care of the equipment?
Don"t you worry about me.
You"ll play baseball.
I"m not gonna know anybody.
Nothing"s ever gonna happen here.
You gotta go where things happen.
I love you, Daddy.
Let"s go, let"s go.
Come on, honey.
Are you coming?
See, how it works is, the train moves, not the station.
This is making me sick.
Write to me, honey.
I love you.
Hey, cowgirls, see the grass?
Don"t eat it.
Okay, girls, this is it.
Harvey Field.
Tryouts.
Get out there.
Show them what you got.
Don"t embarrass me.
It"s been a thin slice of heaven.
Goodbye.
Wait.
You"re going?
Dry your eyes.
I"m going home.
Grab a shower and a shave.
Give the wife a pickle-tickle, and I"m on my way. I"ll see you.
-But--
-But what?
Field!
Tryouts!
Play!
That"s it!
Get lost!
I hate when they get attached to me like that.
-Hey, Mae.
-What?
-Come look at this.
-Wait a second, Doris.
I can"t wait much longer, so get up.
Yeah, so?
Yeah, so I ain"t done yet.
Watch this.
-That"s it?
-You can"t do it, Mae.
I could do it.
How long you been working on that, Doris?
Took me a year.
Not counting the two months I was in the hospital.
Bat hit me right in the head.
Your head and not your behind?
That looks really swollen.
-What kind of thing is that to say?
-l"m joking, okay?
I"m nervous.
-What are you looking at?
-Yeah, what?
Nothing.
That"s right, nothing.
All these girls gonna be in the league?
-You wish.
-You do wish.
-Four teams.
Sixteen girls to a team.
-That"s right.
Sixty-four girls.
What are you, a genius?
They got over 1 00 girls here, so some of youse will have to go home.
-Sorry about that.
-Come on, Doris.
What do you mean, ""some of us""?
-Okay, some of them are going home.
-How"d you do that?
Excuse me.
You caught that.
Hello?
Let"s go practice.
She caught it with her bare hand.
And now, from Chicago, The Mutual presents another social commentary by Miss Maida Gilespie.
Careers and higher education are leading to the masculinization of women with enormously dangerous consequences to the home, the children and our country.
When our boys come home from war what kind of girls will they be coming home to?
And now, the most disgusting example of this sexual confusion, Mr. Walter Harvey, of Harvey Bars is presenting us with women"s baseball.
Right here in Chicago, young girls plucked from their families are gathered at Harvey Field to see which one of them can be the most masculine.
Mr. Harvey, like your candy bars, you are completely nuts.
ery good.
Try another.
Nice throw!
Your name will be on one of those five lists.
Okay, find your name.
If we could just form two or three parallel lines....
l"m a Peach!
A Rockford Peach!
I made it!
I can stay!
Are you a newspaper guy?
This is my friend Mae.
She made the team.
Come on, we got a lot to do.
Let"s settle down.
Now, you"re the first--
Honey, are you supposed to be here, or are you on the cut list?
Look, I"m sorry.
If you"re on the cut list, you have to leave the field.
Well, are you cut?
Look on the list. lt"s either Rockford, Racine, Kenosha or South Bend.
Can you read, honey?
No.
All right, what"s your name?
Shirley Baker.
Let"s just take a look.
This is you.
You"re with us.
You"re a Rockford Peach.
Go join your team.
Settle down.
We got a lot to go over.
First, congratulations.
You are the first members of the All-American Girls" Baseball League.
I"m Charlie Collins.
I"ll be managing the Racine team when the season starts.
The other teams will have managers soon.
At the end of practice today you all have to get fitted for your uniforms.
And this is what they"ll look like.
Pretty darn nifty, if you ask me.
You can"t slide in that.
That"s a dress.
It"s half a dress.
That"s not a baseball uniform.
What do you think we are, ballplayers or ballerinas?
It"s awfully short.
Short?
I"m gonna have to squat in that thing.
I can"t!
My husband will kill me.
Ladies!
Excuse me.
You can"t play ball in this, you can"t play ball with us.
There are 38 girls getting tickets home who"ll play in a bathing suit if I ask.
There"s no pockets for my cigarettes.
There is no smoking.
There is also no drinking and no men.
Your social engagements will be cleared through your team chaperones.
You"ll have regular classes at charm and beauty school.
For what?
Every girl in this league will be a lady.
And gracefully and grandly.
Gracefully and grandly.
All right, now go back!
And sip.
Down.
Don"t slurp.
Sip.
Down.
Don"t slurp.
Stop that!
It"s good.
Posture!
Heads up.
Backs straight.
And sit.
Right over left.
Legs always together.
A lady reveals nothing.
The hair.
Soften and shorten.
The eyebrows.
Thin and separate.
There should be two.
ery nice.
ery nice!
Lovely!
What do you suggest?
A lot of night games.
I wanna show you the grounds.
You know, I always--
Jimmy, come on.
I"m showing you around.
Beautiful, huh?
Place used to be a golf course.
I never cared for the game, but I love grass.
It costs a fortune, with the mowing and trimming.
But I grew up in an apartment.
I had one lousy plant in a cheese box.
Now look. I got a park.
These are my in-laws.
Hello!
They can"t hear nothing.
Enough socializing.
Jimmy, I"m thinking of giving you another managing job.
Mr. Harvey, I guarantee I"ll do a better job than last time.
You kind of let me down on that San Antonio job.
I had no right to sell off the team"s equipment like that.
It won"t happen again.
Let me be blunt.
Are you still a fall-down drunk?
Well, that is blunt.
No, sir. I"ve quit drinking.
You"ve seen the error of your ways?
No, I just can"t afford it.
That"s funny to you?
Your drinking is funny?
You"re a young man.
You still could be playing if you just would"ve laid off the booze.
Well, it"s not exactly like that.
I hurt my knee.
You fell out of a hotel.
That"s how you hurt it!
There was a fire.
Which you started, which I paid for.
I was gonna send you a thank-you card, but I wasn"t allowed anything sharp to write with.
I want you to manage one of the new girls" baseball teams.
Don"t look so stunned.
Face it.
You"re still a name.
You step out of the dugout before every game.
You wave your little hat.
You give the people a thrill.
Get an organ grinder.
I can hop around and dance.
If your knees are up to it, go ahead.
Mr. Harvey I hit 487 home runs for your baseball club.
Three in the World Series, two in game 4 alone.
I know that.
That"s why I"m giving you this job.
Take it or leave it.
I gotta feed the fish.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the first game of the All-American Girls" Baseball League!
The South Bend Blue Sox against your own Rockford Peaches.
-Where is he?
-l can"t believe he"s our manager.
I was listening to the radio when he hit that home run to win the pennant.
I"m asking him to sign my husband"s baseball card.
Do you mind?
Could I take a look at that?
Just be careful with it.
If anything happens, he"ll come back from the Pacific and kill me.
-Mr.
Dugan--
-Mr.
Dugan, I"m simply....
Do something, Mae.
Time him.
Give me your watch.
Could be a record.
That counts.
How long?
I ain"t gonna ask you again.
Shut up, Doris.
Keep timing.
Hey, Mae, how long?
Boy, that was some good peeing.
Hey, coach.
Mr. Dugan?
Could you sign my husband"s baseball card for me?
Great to meet you!
What"ll we do?
He didn"t give us a lineup.
We can"t play without one.
I"ll pitch. I can pitch.
-l thought I was playing centre field.
-No, I am.
Hey, you guys.
Come on.
How hard can it be to make a lineup?
Oh, yeah?
Why don"t you do it, Oregon?
-Me?
-Yeah, you.
All right.
Mae, centre field, lead off.
She"s good.
And now, the manager of the Peaches former six-time National League Home Run Champ Jimmy Dugan!
Jimmy, look up here!
We love you!
Bullshit.
You can all kiss my ass.
That"s right.
Kiss my big hairy ass.
And the Rockford Peaches!
Doris Murphy takes the field!
Lift up your skirt!
This"ll be something.
Ain"t too many people here.
-You nervous, Doris?
-Yeah.
I ain"t.
-Are they laughing at us?
-Yeah, they"re laughing at us.
-They hate us.
-Just keep smiling.
Hey, glamour puss!
Can you throw the ball?
All right, ladies, let"s play ball!
-Let"s play ball.
-Dirt in the skirt!
And now, the lineup for Rockford:
Leading off and playing centre field, number 5, Mae Mordabito!
Batting second and playing 3rd base, number 22, Doris Murphy!
Batting third, the catcher, number 8, Dottie Hinson!
Batting fourth and playing 2nd base, number 32, Marla Hooch.
Girls can"t play ball!
Batting fifth....
Look at me!
I"m a ballplayer!
Better look out, I might break a nail!
--number 1 , Ellen Sue Gotlander.
-lt slipped!
-Batting ninth, pitcher number 23, Kit Keller!
Count"s 2 balls and no strikes to Rockford"s big catcher, Dottie Hinson.
And it"s in the dirt. 3 and 0.
Let"s see if Jimmy Dugan gives her the green light on 3 and 0 or gives her the take sign.
Game"s tied 2-2, the bottom of the 9th with two runners in scoring position and only 1 out.
From the belt, here"s the delivery.
Oh, baby!
She hit the cream cheese out of that one!
Jimmy Dugan, master strategist, had her swinging away!
He sure knows his baseball.
Come on, Dottie!
Make me proud!
A 3-run clout for Dottie Hinson and Rockford wins it, 5 to 2.
Dottie, ladies and gentlemen!
Dottie!
I couldn"t believe you hit it right out there!
Can we have your autograph?
Can we, Jimmy?
Not today, boys.
Come back next game.
Nice piece of coaching.
Especially in the 5th inning when you scratched your balls for an hour.
Anything worth doing is worth doing right.
Yes, indeed.
Until you did that, I couldn"t tell if you were drunk or dead.
It was made very clear to me what I"m supposed to do here.
I smile wave my little hat, and I did that.
So when do I get paid?
You have some good ballplayers.
If you"ll only--
Ballplayers!
I haven"t got ballplayers!
I"ve got girls!
Girls are what you sleep with after the game, not what you coach during it.
If we paid you more, could you be just a little more disgusting?
I could certainly use the money.
On the home front they find them everywhere North, East, South and West, and even Canada.:
Players for the new All-American Girls" Baseball League.
After a month of play the shine still isn"t off these Diamond Gals.
Alice ""Skeeter"" Gaspers says ""Legging out a triple is no reason to let your nose get shiny. ""
Betty Grable has nothing on these gals.
Helen Haley has not only been on several championship amateur teams she"s also an accomplished coffeemaker.
With her husband in the Pacific Betty Horn enjoys cooking spaghetti and knitting.
Her teammates call her ""Betty Spaghetti. ""
Ellen Sue Gotlander is a former Miss Georgia.
Then there"s pretty Dottie Hinson who plays like Gehrig and looks like Garbo.
Fellas, keep your mitts to yourselves.
She"s married.
And there"s her kid sister Kit, who"s as single as they come.
Enough concentrated ""oomph"" for a whole carload of Hollywood starlets.
And how about Marla Hooch?
What a hitter!
What a lead!
But girls playing baseball?
-Enjoy that?
-Yeah!
Good.
Come back next game, will you?
I"m Evelyn Gardner.
I play right field.
For us.
I just spoke to my husband last night.
He says I can"t leave our son with him at home anymore.
See, he says he"s too busy reading the want ads and I should just take him with me and shut up about it.
So can I?
Take my son with me on road trips?
Ballplayers...!
He"s the sweetest little boy.
Everyone"s just gonna love him.
Get this brat off of me!
That"s it!
I quit!
Stilwell, angel, come to Mommy.
-You"re too young to drive.
-l will.
Watch.
Evelyn!
I"m sorry, but I"m gonna have to kill your son!
Wait!
The girls have a game!
You can"t leave us like this!
Please, Mr. Goosatelli!
Get over here, Stilwell!
I"m gonna kill you!
You can"t catch me!
Don"t use my bat, use Marla"s!
It"s heavier!
-Evelyn, why is he so wild?
-l don"t know.
Stilwell, angel, have another chocolate bar.
Gimme!
Gimme!
You can"t leave us like this.
We"re in the middle of nowhere!
-We can"t be here!
-No!
Keep him away from me!
He"s really a sweetie, Dottie.
-l hope I have five just like him.
-Don"t eat the wrapper, honey.
-You gonna come?
-Where you going?
A roadhouse called the Suds Bucket.
No, I"m married. I"m....
Come on, you ain"t on the farm anymore.
Live a little bit.
Girls!
Please!
Mr. Goosatelli shan"t be returning.
How you gonna get past Miss Cuthbert?
Mae"s gonna poison her dinner.
What is it, baby?
What the hell is going on?
!
Why are we stopped?
Lou quit.
Who"s Lou?
The driver.
A car could"ve came by now.
-Get on the bus!
-Was that English?
I loved you in The Wizard of Oz.
In the 43 years I"ve practised medicine, I never saw a woman throw up that much.
Maybe that"s how she entertains herself, doc.
Hurry!
Come on!
Quiet!
Mae, what did you give her?
Who cares?
It"s working.
I"m going, baby!
Come on, way to go, Mae!
I"m coming in!
Catch me!
Did you see me, Kit?
I pretzeled!
-How"d you learn to do that?
-She taught me.
My father owns a dance hall, upstate.
innie"s Dance Girls Deluxe.
She was a dancer, I was a bouncer.
You were great!
-Thanks for the ride, kid.
-What"s your rush, dollbody?
What do you say we slip in the back seat and you make a man out of me?
What do you say I smack you around?
Can"t we do both?
No, I"m not hot. lt"s fine.
It"s really cold.
-That"s better.
-Where"s Kit?
I think she"s on the dance floor.
There she is.
I got my truck parked outside.
Sorry, we gotta go.
Come on.
Alice, come on.
We gotta go.
We got trouble.
-l knew it.
You killed Miss Cuthbert.
-We"ll bury her. I know a guy--
Lowenstein"s coming.
He catches us, we"re out of the league.
Let"s make like a bread truck and haul buns, ladies.
Let"s duck out the back door.
is this all?
Marla didn"t come?
She came.
Well, where is she?
There.
Thinkin" of you
Some others I"ve seen
What did you do to her?
We just gave her a dress.
And a lot of liquor!
You guys go ahead. I"ll get Marla.
Hurry up, ladies!
Thanks.
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
It had to be you
It had to be you
Marla, honey?
We gotta go.
I"m singing to Nelson!
Ain"t l, baby?
You sure are.
I could take her home.
It"d be an honour.
Ain"t he something?
Could make me be blue
That"s the second time he dropped that Bible since she"s been in there.
Come on, girls.
Mae, what"d you say?
Everything.
"" Here"s a good job for you, Jimmy.
Managing girl ballplayers.
You go out there and you wave your little hat around.
Don"t drink!""
Why would I want to drink?
I"m a goddamn Peach!
God, double play.
Now I"m hitting like a girl.
"" But be nice to them.
They"re good ballplayers.""
There, catch that, blondie!
Now batting for the Rockford Peaches number 5, centre fielder Mae Mordabito!
Here"s the pitch.
There"s a shot into right centre!
It"s up the alley!
She"s turning around 1 st!
She"s digging up the dirt!
She"s heading past 2nd.
She"s heading into 3rd!
Dirt in the skirt, Mae!
Dirt in the skirt!
-Safe!
-She"s in there with a triple!
Boy, did she smack that one right on the kisser.
No wonder they call her ""All-the-Way"" Mae.
Triple.
Next batter number 32, 2nd baseman, Marla Hooch.
Evelyn, look at this!
I"ve got Stilwell"s snack on my cleat!
What are you, stupid?
Somebody"s gotta run the team.
Someone who actually watches the games.
You"re gonna squeeze bunt with our best hitter?
What"s the sign to swing away?
Hey, blond girl!
What"s the sign?
It"s the letters.
A squeeze"ll work.
Stop thinking with your tits.
Batter!
Time!
Come on!
Who is the goddamn manager here?
I am!
Then act like it, you big lush!
-You tell him, Dottie!
-About time someone told him.
-l"m ready now.
-Play ball!
Way to go, whatever your name is!
Good bluff!
But I still say you"re not ballplayers.
Cemetery boneyard!
Cross your fingers or you"ll never get another hit.
Sound it out.
Kimono.
Kimono off and gra-bed...
Grabbed.
...her milky milky white....
What are you giving her to read?
What"s the difference?
She"s reading.
That"s the important thing.
Go away!
Go!
Shoo!
Go ahead, Shirley.
Thanks.
Milky white breasts.
It gets really good after that.
-A delivery boy walks in....
-What are you doing?
I"m writing a song.
Really?
What"s it about?
About us.
Could you teach it to me?
Doris, is this your boyfriend?
is it out of focus?
No, that"s how he looks.
Looks aren"t the most important thing.
Right.
The important thing is he"s stupid, out of work and treats me bad.
Then why...?
Why?
What do you think?
Because none of the other boys ever....
Always made me feel like I was wrong.
Like I was some sort of a weird girl or a strange girl or not even a girl, just because I could play.
I believed them too.
But not anymore.
I mean, look.
There"s a lot of us.
I think we"re all all right.
We are.
Give me that.
So long, Charlie!
So with 2 runs in the 6th, South Bend gets even.
I"ve gotta go!
I"ve gotta go!
You shake it off.
Shake it off.
Say, Evelyn, can I ask you a question?
Which team do you play for?
-l"m a Peach.
-Well, I was just wondering because I couldn"t figure out why you"d throw home when we"ve got a 2-run lead!
You let the tying run get on 2nd, and we lost the lead!
You start using your head!
That"s that lump that"s three feet above your ass!
Are you crying?
Are you crying?
There"s no crying!
There"s no crying in baseball!
Leave her alone, Jimmy.
You zip it, Doris!
Rogers Hornsby, my manager, called me a ""talking pile of pig shit"" !
That was when my parents came from Michigan to see me play the game!
And did I cry?
No!
Do you know why?
Because there"s no crying in baseball.
No crying in baseball!
No crying!
What"s the matter?
She"s crying, sir.
I didn"t mean to do that.
Perhaps you chastised her too vehemently.
Good rule of thumb:
Treat each of them as you would your mother.
Anyone ever tell you you look like a penis with a hat on?
You"re out of here!
-l heard that!
-You misunderstood.
-Ten seconds!
-You misunderstood!
You can"t throw me out knowing you"ve got a strike!
Off this field!
I can"t believe no one ever called you that before!
That"s where you belong.
I"m in charge now.
The crowd"s light today, what with the tractor show in town.
If you"re nearby, and you must be, since this isn"t a powerful radio station...
People better start showing up.
We don"t have fans, we don"t have a league.
Ladies you all look wonderful.
There"s a reporter and a photographer in the stands from Life magazine.
-We"re famous!
-Life magazine?
Don"t waste your time.
Dottie, I"m trying to get them to do a story about you.
Me?
Why me?
You"re the ""Queen of Diamonds."" That"s what I"m calling you.
Did you tell them about me?
I told them how at first, the scout didn"t even want you but how Dottie wouldn"t come without her kid sister.
They really loved it.
A real human-interest story.
Will you just try to give them something spectacular out there?
Anything.
What"s the matter?
Well, we"re not doing so well.
Harvey and the other owners think they"ve made a mistake.
They might close you down.
What are you talking about?
They can"t close us down here.
-What kind of a thing is that?
-What"s it mean?
They"re businessmen.
No profit, no product.
And what am I supposed to do?
Go back to taxi dancing?
Ten cents so some slob can sweat gin all over me?
I"m never doing that again!
So you tell old rich Mr. Chocolate Man that he ain"t closing me down!
They can"t keep us from playing!
We"ll show them how we play.
I"m sorry. I"m very sorry.
I am trying my best.
So will you just give them everything you"ve got?
We always do.
A slick play by Alice Gaspers and there"s 2 gone in the 3rd.
That"ll bring up Dee Lynch.
Lynch is the most consistent Belles hitter this year.
Settles in.
Pops it up!
Foul.
Hinson should have no trouble with this.
She"s under it.
Uncle Elmore"s socks!
What did she do?
I can"t do that.
Who can?
-What is her name?
-Dottie Hinson.
D-O-T-T-l-E....
What the hell was that?
I just thought it might help the league.
A goddamn circus!
A double would be nice--
All right!
God knows we have a game.
It"s not like any of this helps, believe me.
That was really nice!
Let"s go, girls.
Dozens of people are waiting for the game to start.
Batter!
What is her name?
Hey you, tall girl!
Beverly!
Look sharp, tall-- What is her name?
Beverly.
Good.
Five bucks!
Five bucks!
What if, at a key moment in the game, my uniform bursts open and my bosoms fly out?
That might draw a crowd, right?
Think there"s men who ain"t seen your bosoms?
Thank you.
-Marla, what you got?
-What about me?
I got a letter from Nelson!
Fly ball as Dottie Hinson brings the crowd to its feet with a home run!
22!
We love you, 22!
-Come on!
-Open your mouth!
The kid ate the lineup!
Right here.
I"m so happy!
Thank you.
I love you.
I"ll be back next season.
See you next season!
Slide!
Slide!
Safe!
Thank you!
Let it up.
Let it up.
That was a good one.
It"s a fly ball to left!
Betty Spaghetti makes the catch!
Heads up!
Spaghetti makes the throw!
It"s gonna be close!
Aunt Edna"s bridgework!
She is out!
Dottie Hinson held onto the ball!
Oh, doctor!
A lot of ballplayers use it.
High foul pop.
It"s coming back!
She caught it!
Unbelievable!
Full house on its feet cheering Dottie Hinson!
That sounded good.
-You haven"t got a curve ball left.
-l don"t?
!
You haven"t had one since--
Safe!
Safe!
He"s good-looking.
-What"s he do when not in the Army?
-Dairy assistant manager.
He"ll be manager.
He"s smart.
So he"s good-looking and smart.
There"s so few of us.
Where did you say he was?
Italy?
I think. I haven"t got a letter from him in three weeks.
I used to get one every week.
That doesn"t mean anything.
If he"s in combat, it"s not like there"s a mailbox on every corner.
If something happened, you would"ve got a telegram.
Oh, God, don"t--
But he"s fine.
No, he"s fine.
How come you"re not in the Army?
I have no cartilage in my knee.
You don"t need it to shoot Nazis.
You need this, right?
Trigger finger.
I could do that.
How did I get so useless so fast?
Boys like this on your fingers?
Works for me.
Your sister"s not gonna be mad?
I don"t care.
Listen, when...
-Bob.
-...
Bob comes back will you keep playing?
You could just quit?
Sure.
You play like you love it.
-Does he know how good you are?
-Bob?
No, Hitler.
Yes, Bob.
How good am I?
You stink.
You"re lousy.
You"re only the best player in the league.
You don"t know that?
You ever been married?
Let me think.
Yeah, twice.
Any children?
One of them was.
is she out?
I think it"s time for a drink.
Hang on.
Hang on.
These really don"t mix.
-Good, huh?
-Oh, yeah.
It"s great.
Fair ball!
Time!
Jimmy Dugan pops his head out of the dugout.
He"s on his way to talk to his hurler.
Kit Keller looks mighty tired.
Game"s getting exciting.
I"ll finish it right here.
I"ll strike this turkey out.
Betty"s ready to come in.
Come on. I"ve never been taken out before.
Ask Dottie.
I really wanna finish this game.
Please?
What do you think?
Well, you know, she"s battling.
What do you think?
She"s throwing grapefruits.
It looks like Keller"s coming out of the game, and she is not happy about it!
Nice job, Kit!
Betty Horn sprints in from the left-field bullpen.
Look at this crowd.
This is great!
They"re jumping, cheering and they paid to get in.
You did a fabulous job.
I won"t forget this.
Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey.
I appreciate it, coming from you.
But to be perfectly honest, I think the girls deserve most of the credit.
They"re great.
Fortunately, we won"t need them anymore.
Do you want a peanut?
No.
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We"re winning the war.
Our situation changed.
Roosevelt himself said, "" Men"s baseball won"t be shut down.""
So we won"t need the girls next year.
Bases loaded.
Bottom of the 9th.
Rockford up, 6 to 2.
Two men out.
No balls, 2 strikes.
Strike 3!
And that is the ball game!
Rockford is in the playoffs!
I love these girls.
I don"t need them, but I love them.
Come on.
Let"s go.
Look at me. I"m full of peanuts!
I"ve got peanuts all over myself.
This is what it"s gonna be like in the factories too.
"" Men are back.
Turn in your rivets.""
First, it was their patriotic duty to get out and go to work.
When the men come back, they"re sent back to the kitchen.
Should we send the boys returning from war back to the kitchen?
Come on.
Do you know how dedicated they are?
What they go through?
They play with sprained ankles, broken fingers.
They ride a bus all night to play a double-header the next day!
I"ll make it up to them.
What?
With Harvey Bars?
I"m getting tired of listening to you, Ira.
I"d like your permission to take over the league.
Do you understand?
All of the owners are getting out.
There"s no point to it anymore.
Just let them finish the season, and that"s it!
I sold your product when there was no product.
This is a product!
There is no room for girls" baseball in this country once the war is over.
They"re through.
I think you"re wrong.
And I"m gonna prove it to you, Mr. Harvey!
Hi, my name"s Mae.
That"s more than a name, that"s an attitude.
Here"s my friend Doris.
Best player on the team.
-Thank you.
-You"re the best.
-The game put us in the playoffs.
-l could"ve finished.
Stilwell could"ve hit off you.
What"s the matter?
Too big to finish your own games now?
Don"t start with me, Kit!
Don"t you start with me!
Kit, come on, cut it out!
What the hell are you doing?
!
-Get your sister off of her!
-Stay out of it!
You just wait, Doris!
Let me down!
Let me down!
You stay down there and you cool off!
-Why"d she do it?
-She was vulnerable.
You provoked her.
-Shut up, Helen!
-You"re making her more upset.
Really!
-l don"t need it from Helen.
-Take a shower.
-l"m not taking a shower.
-She reminds me of my husband.
Save some hot water for me, you guys.
You okay?
My rear end hurts where he dropped me.
You acted like a baby.
You treat me like one.
I treated you like a pitcher who"d lost her stuff.
When Betty"s in trouble, you back her up every pitch!
I seem to remember last week, somebody throwing a resin bag in my face.
Told me to get my fat ass behind the plate.
Was that you or the umpire?
You could"ve backed me up today instead of holding me back.
I hold you back?
It"s like at home.
It"s like if you"re here, then I"m not here.
What"s that mean?
I don"t know what I mean.
I know I"m wrong.
I know you"re right and I"m wrong.
I know that. I just-- l just get so mad!
Why do you gotta be so good?
Dottie, here you are.
You weren"t on the bus.
Can I speak to you a minute?
I have to leave.
Don"t worry.
The bus wouldn"t leave without you.
I"m leaving the team.
What?
-Why?
What-- -l have to go home.
Home?
You can"t go home now.
This couldn"t come at a worse time.
We"re in a bit of a crisis, and I have to try to pull something off.
It"s not a good time to lose our most popular player.
-What"s the problem?
-l don"t want to talk about it.
It"s personal?
It"s one of the girls, isn"t it?
It"s Mae, right?
Kit, that"s it.
I"ve noticed there"s some friction.
That"s fine.
No problem.
Doesn"t mean you have to quit.
I can arrange a trade.
Racine?
Kenosha?
South Bend?
Trade me or whatever.
But figure it out by tomorrow, or I"m going home.
Tomorrow?
Fine!
I"ll work everything out by tomorrow.
You really gave me a scare for a second.
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Mae, your date"s here.
-How do I look?
-Where"d you get that dress?
-Borrowed it.
-lt don"t fit.
Too tight.
I don"t plan on wearing it that long.
I don"t know why you get dressed at all.
Where"s Dottie?
In there.
Wanna go to the movies with me?
You bitch!
I"ve been traded to Racine!
You?
I told them to trade me.
They"d really trade you.
Miss Star, Miss Perfect.
You knew what would happen!
-l didn"t!
-This"ll be better than the movies.
-l"ll quit. ls that what you want?
-They"ll blame me for you quitting!
What do you want me to do?
Stay away from me.
Leave me alone!
That"s what I want you to do!
Kit, listen.
It was all a mistake.
A big mistake.
-l was getting too good.
-You won"t listen.
I knew if I did too good, you"d do something to push me down!
Kit, blow it out your rear end!
I"m sick of you blaming me.
I got you into this league!
She got her in the league!
-l didn"t wanna be here!
-Then why are you still here?
Kit wants to know why she"s playing.
My train leaves at 8.
I got 1 0 minutes to pack.
If you have trouble, you know who to blame.
See you in the World Series.
You bet you will.
Don"t look at her.
Has anyone seen my new red hat?
Piss on your hat!
Well, that seemed uncalled for.
Just keep it down.
-Kit"s off our team.
-She"s not!
Yes, she is.
Are you deaf?
You need any help in there?
Don"t act like this.
You"re still in the league.
You"re just on another team, that"s all.
Batter up
Hear that call
The time has come
For one and all
To play
Ball
For we"re the members of
The All-American League We come from cities
Near and far
We got Canadians
Irish ones and Swedes
We"re all for one, we"re one for all We"re All-Americans
Each girl stands Her head so proudly high
Her motto.:
Do or Die
She"s not the one to use Or need an alibi
Our chaperones are not too soft They"re not too tough
Our managers are on the ball
Miss Cuthbert....
You gorgeous stack of pancakes!
Man on the floor!
Already dressed.
Get Stilwell away.
I don"t know what he"s doing.
Get him away from the tapes!
Angel, come here now.
All right.
Everybody, let"s listen up.
I was in the toilet reading my contract, and it turns out I get a bonus when we get to the World Series.
Let"s play hard!
Play smart!
Use your heads!
That"s that lump three feet above our ass, right?
Some more prominent than others.
Come in.
Excuse me!
I got a telegram from the War Department.
Oh, my God!
Ernie!
Boy, I hate these.
These are the worst.
The Army could at least send someone to tell you your husband"s dead.
Darn!
I had the name right here!
I gotta go back and straighten this out.
Sorry.
-Just give me the telegram.
-l can"t. I don"t have a name.
Just give me the telegram.
This is official.
This is from the War Department!
Come on!
That"s official business!
I"m coming--
-l"m sorry, Betty.
-No, it"s George!
It"s George!
All right, come on.
We still got a game to play.
Come in.
Hi, cutie.
How did you...?
Bob!
Oh, my God!
What happened?
-l"m fine.
-What is it?
It was a sniper.
I was lucky though.
He got seven of us before we got him.
Oh, sweetie!
It"s all right. I made it.
I missed you so much.
I"ve been discharged.
I didn"t think I"d ever see you again.
It"s all over. I"m here, baby.
Well, listen.
You have to sit down here.
I"ll clear all this stuff off.
I almost forgot how beautiful you are.
-Oh, no. I look terrible!
-You look beautiful.
You"re the most beautiful thing I"ve ever seen.
I love you.
Can we just hold each other for the rest of our lives?
That"s my plan.
Why am I the only one on this bus?
What are we waiting for?
Are you physically unable to show up on time?
Coming, Jimmy.
If you think you can do without the batting practice, think again.
Not the way you hit.
Let"s not go to the World Series without Stilwell"s toys!
-Alice, what time is it where you live?
-lt"s bad luck to yell before a game.
-Could you sign my baseball?
-Sure.
""Avoid the clap.
Jimmy Dugan.""
That"s good advice!
Write to us.
We"ll miss you.
We will.
Thanks.
Good luck in the World Series.
Taking a little day trip?
Bob and I are driving home to Oregon.
I thought you were a ballplayer.
You were wrong.
Was I?
It is only a game.
It"s only a game, and I don"t need this.
I have Bob. I don"t need this.
I gave away five years at the end of my career to drinking.
Five years.
There isn"t anything I wouldn"t give to get back any one day of it.
Well, we"re different.
Chickenshit!
You wanna go home and make 1 00 babies, great.
I can"t tell anyone how to live.
But sneaking out like this, quitting....
You"ll regret it all your life.
Baseball is what gets inside you.
It"s what lights you up.
You can"t deny that.
It just got too hard.
It"s supposed to be hard.
If it wasn"t hard, everyone would do it.
The hard is what makes it great.
Everything all right?
Yeah, fine.
Fine.
Bye, Jimmy.
First game of the first women"s baseball World Series.
This is history in the making.
History in the making!
This is for you.
We brought you these also.
For me?
Thank them!
-Cut it out!
-l"m sorry.
Two box seats on the 3rd base line.
I got two box seats.
Who wants them?
-How much?
-1 0 bucks.
That"s my daughter, 3rd baseman, Doris Murphy.
Best one they got.
-Where you from?
-Staten Island.
After the game, I"m taking her out for a steak dinner.
All right, all right, all right!
Time for the song and dance.
What"s that smell?
Alice thinks it"s bad luck to change her socks.
So we all suffer?
Get away, get away.
Outfielders, play deep a few steps.
Don"t give up anything long.
Alice?
If the lead-off hitter gets on, they"re gonna bunt.
Be ready.
Now, I"d like to....
l"d like to lead you in prayer.
-Come on.
-A prayer?
Come on.
Yes, a little prayer.
Come on!
Come on!
In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost....
Lord hallowed be Thy name.
May our feet be swift.
May our bats be mighty.
May our balls be plentiful.
And, Lord I"d just like to thank you for that waitress in South Bend.
You know who she is.
She kept calling Your name.
And, God these are good girls, and they work hard.
Help them see it all the way through.
Okay, that"s it.
-Let"s go.
-Amen.
Go Peaches!
Last game.
Now or never, ladies.
Alice, you"re killing me.
You"re killing me, Alice!
You"re goddamn killing me!
And the rocket"s red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh, say does that star-spangled
Banner yet wave
O"er the land of the free
And the home of the brave
This is it, folks.
One game for the whole ball of string.
There is no tomorrow.
Someone will walk out league champions, and someone else will just walk out.
You"re gonna lose!
You"re gonna lose!
You keep that kid away from me for just one game!
Ellen Sue, how"s it looking?
-Good.
-Feeling good?
Looking good!
Nice and warm?
Good.
Alice, if Ellen Sue doesn"t have anything, don"t keep it a secret.
Tell me right away.
You understand me?
Do you hear me?
!
You"re screaming. I hear you.
Where"d you come from?
We got to Yellowstone and turned back.
Have trouble with the bears, did you?
I was fine until that scout walked into our barn. I"m no quitter.
Wait a minute!
Hold it!
Who said you could play?
Alice has been catching the last six games.
She looks pretty good.
You don"t want me to play?
Well, you"re already dressed.
Hell, if you want to play I don"t care.
You can play.
Well, then, I"ll play.
Good.
-Fine.
-Fine.
Go play.
You look like shit.
Don"t you ever shave?
We"re gonna win.
We"re gonna win!
You"re gonna lose!
You stink!
Got him!
Lineup change!
-lt"s okay.
-Evelyn, he deserved it.
Stilwell, you gonna stay out here or come in the dugout?
Strike!
Strike!
You"re out!
3!
Strike!
You"re out!
You"re out!
You"re out, Brenda!
You are out!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Good, Mae!
Good catch!
Thank goodness.
2 down!
2 down!
Base hit.
Gardner"s up with it.
Wallace"ll stop at 3rd.
Gardner"s throw is way off line!
Go!
Go!
All the way!
I"m sorry!
Shoot!
Wallace scampers home, and the Belles take the lead, 1 to nothing!
They"re dancing in the aisles here in Racine!
I know. I know.
You"re still missing the cutoff man.
That"s something I would like you to work on before next season.
All right.
Thanks.
Thank you, Mr. Dugan.
All right, let"s get this one!
All right, come on!
We need some runs out there.
Make something happen, Mae!
All-the-Way Mae!
-They love her.
-Let"s go, let"s go!
ery cute.
Thanks.
Safe!
She"s safe!
Way to play!
Way to run!
Way to make something happen!
Safe!
You get a hit, I"ll baby-sit that little porker!
Come on!
You"re out!
Come on!
Bring me home, Helen!
Out!
Peaches are down to their final out.
Only tying and go-ahead runs in scoring position.
Big Dottie Hinson striding to the plate.
Let"s get out of this inning!
Come on!
Throw smoke, Kit!
Throw smoke!
Here"s the pitch.
Bite me on the butt and call me an apple!
She nearly took her head off!
Mordabito scores!
Murphy, she will score!
Rockford has taken the lead, 2 to 1 !
That"s my wife!
One more!
Keep it going!
Put it past the little queen here.
Right past her!
There"s a fly ball to left field.
She"ll have to go for this one!
That"s the final out.
But the damage has been done.
Right here in Racine, Rockford leads our Belles, 2 to 1 as we go to the bottom of the 9th.
Come on, it"s okay.
You gotta bat now.
Relax!
One run and we are back in this ball game.
Shake it off.
You gotta hit.
It"s okay, Kit.
Strike her out!
Bad eye!
Bat at that, blond girl!
She drives it to deep centre!
Mordabito goes to the wall and makes the catch!
Beautiful catch!
Beautiful!
Gotlander"s pitch and it is in the dirt!
Ball 1 !
That looked good to me, Ellen Sue!
Shake that one off!
That ain"t nothing!
Gotlander, she delivers.
It"s a ground ball between 1 st and 2nd.
This ball is hot!
Hendricks will go up at 1 st with a base hit.
That"s all right. 1 down!
We got 1 down!
Let"s go!
Foul ball!
Hinson"s taking after it.
That does it!
Did she get it?
She got it!
She got it!
There"s no question who the star of this game is.
Dottie Hinson has her team 1 out from the title.
Come on, Kit, you"re up.
You"re the hitter now.
Let"s go.
The last batter standing in Rockford"s way is Kit Keller.
Kit is 1 for 3 today.
-Can I have time-out?
-Time!
High fastballs.
She can"t hit them, can"t lay off them.
All right.
All right, if we just hold them now, we got it!
Come on!
Come on, Ellen Sue!
One, two, three!
Play ball!
-Strike!
-Swing and a miss.
Strike 1 !
Yes!
Thank you, God!
Lay off the high ones!
Here"s the pitch.
Swing and a miss!
Strike 2!
One more!
One more!
Here"s the pitch.
It is a long fly ball.
Back, back, back.
It falls in there!
No one"ll get to this ball!
This should tie it up!
Hendricks is rounding 3rd!
She will score!
Keller to 3rd!
Gardner hits the relay man with a frozen rope!
The coach is giving Keller the stop sign at 3rd!
But she is not stopping!
She runs through the stop sign!
She is not stopping!
Here comes the throw!
It should be in time!
Safe!
She is safe!
I can"t believe it!
Hinson dropped the ball!
Hinson dropped the ball!
The ball game is over!
Racine has won the game, 3 to 2 and the World Series!
Take me home, Mama, and put me to bed!
I have seen enough to know I have seen too much!
You played a good game.
Well, what do you say?
All right, Ira.
We"ll stick with it.
My mother always used to say, "" lf at first you don"t succeed--""
You don"t have to spend six months in Saskatchewan.
-Alice, you told me it"s lovely.
-lf you like icicles.
I thought we were gonna win.
-We didn"t.
-Up to that last inning, we had it.
I"m so depressed, I could eat a cow.
It"s all right.
You did good.
Get dressed.
See you on the bus.
Thanks.
Wanna be a ballplayer when you get big?
-What"s your name?
-Angelina.
Gotta practice really hard.
What"s your name?
-How much?
-Help yourself.
Thank you.
-Hitting!
-You all like hitting better?
-What"s your name?
-Mary.
-Who you rooting for?
-Racine!
That"s what I thought you said.
You guys be good.
Get dirty.
-l"m sorry I knocked you over.
-No, you"re not.
You blocked the entire plate!
How do you--
You did what you had to.
You beat me.
You wanted it more than me.
I jammed my shoulder, if it makes you feel any better.
A little.
Bob and I are driving back to Oregon.
You"re welcome to come with us.
You two should be alone.
I"d just be in the way.
When will you be coming home?
Some of the girls talked about staying around here and getting jobs.
I really like it here.
Christmas?
I don"t know.
You"ll come back next year, right?
I wanna have kids.
We wanna have kids.
You got plenty of time to have kids.
You couldn"t give this up.
You"d miss it.
Miss it?
Miss putting on all this gear?
Catching a double-header in 1 00-degree heat?
Pushing the bus in mud?
Getting slammed into every other day by a base runner?
Think I"m gonna miss that?
I"ll tell you what I"ll miss.
I"ll miss the girls.
I"ll miss you.
Me?
How many sisters do you think I have?
I love you, Kit.
Really?
Just when I want you to stay, you"re leaving.
Thanks for getting me in the league.
You got yourself in the league.
I got you on the train.
Play great.
Like you.
You stay in touch.
Come home every once in a while.
If you don"t, I"ll come back and hit line drives at your head.
I love you.
And you are gonna miss this.
I don"t care what you say.
There"s the winner!
Good game, Jimmy.
Hi, I"m a big fan of yours.
I"m Dottie"s husband.
Well, then I"m a big fan of yours.
Old man Harvey just offered me a job managing next year in Wichita.
Triple A?
Great.
Good luck.
Turned him down.
Why?
What do you mean, why?
I already got a job.
I"ll see you.
Miss Cuthbert, save me my special seat, now, cutie!
Meet you at the hotel.
Did you see Mae"s catch, Dad?
I"d rather see you play ball instead of what you used to do.
What are you saying that for?
You make her feel bad!
Steak dinner.
On you. I"ll see you later.
Kit, over here!
Come on, let"s go!
That was Bob, huh?
Nice guy.
Lay off of those high ones.
I like the high ones.
-Mule!
-Nag!
Hey, Mae.
Come here.
-What do you want?
-Come here.
-What is it?
-Look at her.
It"s Dottie.
Hey, Doris.
Mae?
All-the-Way Mae?
-No one"s called me that since--
-Last night!
I"m a married woman now.
Yeah, about eight times.
Girls!
Look who"s here!
Shirley?
Helen Haley!
-lt"s Dr. Haley now. I"m a doctor.
-l always knew you would be.
-Who"s that?
-Dottie Hinson.
Betty Spaghetti?
Best ballplayer in the league.
-l don"t remember her.
-She only played one year.
Ellen Sue!
You haven"t changed one bit.
I married a plastic surgeon.
Having you here is good luck.
Thanks, Alice!
Marla!
I"m so glad you"re here.
-How"s...?
-Nelson?
He"s good.
He"s retired.
Our son runs the business.
How"s Bob?
He"s....
When?
Just this winter.
I"m sorry.
Oh, Shirley, I"m so excited.
I"ve got butterflies in my stomach!
They"ve got a ""Women ln Baseball"" thing up there. lsn"t it neat?
Baseball Hall of Fame.
I"m shaking.
Wait a minute here.
-Guess who that is?
-Who?
You remember?
You"re gonna lose.
Stilwell, angel!
My goodness!
Where"s your mom?
Mom died a couple of years ago.
I"m sorry.
She was a real nice lady.
And a damn fine ballplayer.
When I heard about this, I felt like I owed it to her to be here.
She always said it was the best time she had in her whole life.
Come here.
Recognize yourself?
-Can I get one of these?
-Sure.
Ladies!
It"s a pleasure to welcome you here today.
It"s taken years, but you are the first women ever to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame!
-And now--
-Wait.
Wait a minute.
This really isn"t right.
Mr. Lowenstein since you kept the league going all those years you do it.
-There you go, Ira.
-Thank you, Bob.
Ladies it"s my honour.
Mr. Capadino, look!
That"s when you changed my life, honey!
Stilwell, angel, smile!

Hi, Aunt Dottie.
Take a picture.
Let"s take a picture of the whole team.
The original Peaches!
Strike!
That was clear inside.
It was clear inside, clear inside.
-l told you three times.
-That"s my opinion.
Yesterday or tomorrow, that might"ve been a ball but today, it was a strike!
Subtitles by GELULA CO., Inc.
You might need that.
Where'd you find this?
It was in one of those cartons.
Needs oil.
Who doesn't?
You ready?
- I'm not going.
- Mom!
I've got two children, I don't need a third.
Why is it so important that I go?
For one thing, it'd be nice if you just left the room.
Besides, these are your old friends.
They probably won't remember me.
The "Queen of Diamonds," Dottie Hinson?
Margaret, it just isn't a good idea.
Come on, Mom.
You'll get to see Aunt Kit.
- You never see each other.
- We still won't.
She'll be traveling around with that husband of hers.
Frank.
He has a name.
He's always been very nice to you.
He makes me nervous.
There's a lot of reasons why I can't go.
Honey I'm not comfortable about this.
I'm not really part of it.
It was never that important.
It was just something I did.
When will you realize how special it was, how much it all meant?
I know how you feel.
I really do.
But you're going.
Car.
- Car, train, bus.
I'm tired already.
- Sleep on the plane.
Grandma's out.
Is there a fire?
Wisenheimer.
Julie's watching you.
I don't want any bad reports.
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye.
Jeffrey, come here.
No matter what your brother does, he's littler than you.
Give him a chance to shoot.
Promise?
Bobby, come here.
Kill him.
Come on, you'll miss your plane.
I still think I shouldn't go.
Get a hit, Beans!
I'm coming, Mae!
I'm coming!
This week in the world of sports.
With the boys overseas and off to war baseball pitches in for the war effort.
Trading bats for bullets, Yankee Joe DiMaggio promises to give those Nazis a jolt.
Ace fireballer Bob Feller has traded Cleveland gray for Navy blue.
Baseball's biggest stars say "Look out, Mr. Hitler.
The Yanks are coming. "
Not to mention the Indians, Red Sox and Tigers.
And they won't come back till it's over, over there.
Meanwhile, Chicago club owner Walter Harvey, the candy-bar king met with other team owners at the Harvey Mansion as rumours persist that baseball may be shut down for the duration of the war.
Harvey's promotional whiz kid, Ira Lowenstein has been given the job of figuring out how to keep baseball going.
Good luck, Mr. Lowenstein.
Strike 2!
Hey, fatso!
Get the hell out of the way!
What are you, crazy?
Strike 3!
Kit!
- Sis, don't swing at her high pitch.
- I can hit it.
- You can't.
- I can.
This bat's too heavy.
You'll never get it around.
I will!
Listen.
There's a big hole on the right side.
Don't look.
- Unless she pitches inside, pull it.
- I know.
Batter up!
No high ones.
I like the high ones!
- Mule!
- Nag!
Come on, Kit.
Keep your eye on the ball.
Strike 1!
Strike 2!
Too high.
All right, Kit.
Look it over!
Look it over there!
Strike 3!
All right, 2 outs, everybody.
Two away!
Better luck next time!
Knock it out of here!
Okay, Dottie!
Batter up!
Right in here!
Bring them in there, Dottie!
Ball!
Keep your eye on it, Dottie!
One hit and we win!
That's it, Dottie!
You did it!
That's the ball game!
Hey, Kit!
What are you swinging those high ones for?
Good thing your sister bailed you out.
How about the two bucks you owe me for this game?
Kit!
Wait up, I'll give you a ride!
Stop kicking the rocks.
I'm sorry.
- That game just made me so mad.
- We won.
Get mad if we lose.
That last pitch was right down the middle.
If I'd have swung at that, I'd be the hero.
- You got me so crazy-
- I only said lay off the high ones.
"Good thing your sister bailed you out. "
"Kit, why don't you get your sister to teach you how to hit?"
"Why can't you be beautiful like your sister?"
What idiot said that?
No one.
- But that's what they were thinking.
- No, it's not!
You ever hear Dad introduce us to people?
"This is our daughter Dottie.
This is our other daughter, Dottie's sister.
Should've just had you and bought a dog.
- Mitch Swaley likes you.
- He's one step up from dating pigs.
But an important step.
- Why are you walking so fast?
- Why are you?
- Because you are.
- Can't even let me walk faster than you?
Girls, you got chores to do.
Don't run!
You'll scare the chickens!
I don't have time for these games.
- Why are you running?
- You can go faster than that.
Your legs are longer.
- I win!
- Barely.
Hey!
Hey, yourself.
Doesn't that hurt them?
Doesn't seem to.
It would bruise the hell out of me.
Who are you?
I'm Ernie Capadino, baseball scout.
I saw you playing today.
Not bad, not bad.
Ever hear of Walter Harvey?
Harvey Bars?
You know, the candy?
Yeah, we feed them to the cows when they're constipated.
He's starting a girls' baseball league so we can make a buck while the boys are overseas.
Wanna play?
Nice retort.
Tryouts are in Chicago.
It's a real league, professional.
Professional baseball?
They'll pay you $75 a week.
We only make $30 at the dairy.
Then this would be more, wouldn't it?
Interested?
Come on. $75 a week?
Pull her leg.
Mine are long enough.
Look, your country needs you.
You can not only play ball, but you're kind of a dolly.
Oh, now I get it.
Listen, mister.
I'm a married woman.
My husband's overseas.
Oh, relax!
I'm talking lookie, no touchie.
We want girls easy on the eye.
I'll go.
I'm ready now.
I gotta sign something?
I don't want you!
I want her!
The one who hit the ball!
You can climb back under the cow.
She's good.
She's very good.
She pitches.
She didn't today, because she did yesterday.
Thanks for that special glimpse into her life.
I want you.
You I saw, you I like.
The train leaves for Chicago tomorrow.
What do you say?
Are you in?
No, thanks.
"No, thanks"?
Hey, no skin off my Ashtabula.
If you wanna pluck cows, that's your business.
You know something?
You're not nice.
That one hurt.
So long, milkmaids.
No, wait!
Just watch me pitch.
Dottie, get your mitt!
I'll throw him a few.
Now look I know the goods when I see the goods, and she's the goods.
I'm sorry.
Will you shut up?
!
You're a pitcher, huh?
I'll tell you what.
If she comes, you can come too.
If you stink, it only costs us the train ticket.
Get these wild animals away from me!
Haven't you ever heard of a leash?
Come on, Dottie.
You got the whole rest of your life to hang around here.
Never go anywhere.
Never do anything.
I'm married.
I'm happy.
It's what I want.
Don't confuse things.
But can't you just have this first?
Just so you can say you once did something?
Something special?
Goodness sake, Kit!
Keep your voice down.
Your father's listening to the radio.
Please, Dottie?
I gotta get out of here.
I'm nothing here.
In the Pacific Northwest, my territory we have increased sales 106% in the last 12-month period.
And this with a war on!
You know, if I had your job, I'd kill myself.
Sit here.
I'll see if I can dig up a pistol.
Every trip I take, I gotta sit next to one of these guys.
I'm just too friendly.
Hey, isn't that-?
Well, I'll say one thing for them.
They can run.
Mr. Capadino!
I got her!
Look!
- Sir, your knee.
- Like it?
Stop the train!
Come on!
Come on!
Give me that bag!
Did you promise the cows you'd write?
When do we get to Chicago?
We gotta make a stop.
Fort Collins, Colorado.
Gotta look at another girl.
Hope you're not jealous.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, honey.
That was good form.
Thattagirl!
Good, honey.
Good.
Nice, nice.
That's a rope, honey.
Good girl.
Good, good.
Right, too high.
She's got an eye like DiMaggio.
Okay, Marla.
Now lefty.
She's really good.
She's your daughter?
Her mom's dead.
It's just the two of us.
Coach said if she was a boy, she'd go to the state tournament.
I said, "If she was a boy, I'd talk to the Yankees instead of living here."
That's enough.
You can bring her over.
Okay, Marla.
Come here.
Boys!
Hit the showers!
Take off your hat, honey.
We'll let you know.
Daddy, I'm sorry.
Let's go.
We'll miss the train.
Let's move, move, move!
What's the matter?
I can't use her.
She's great.
Why not?
What's the problem?
You know General Omar Bradley?
There's too strong a resemblance.
You ain't taking her because she ain't pretty?
Well, look who just caught up!
All right.
Come on, let's go.
Pick those suitcases up!
Come on!
I'm not kidding.
Move!
- One foot in front of the other.
- Mister?
I know my girl ain't so pretty as these girls.
But that's my fault.
I raised her like I would a boy.
I didn't know any better.
She loves to play.
Don't make my girl suffer because I messed up raising her.
Please?
I wish you had a decent mitt.
I think maybe I'd better not go.
No, you can relace it.
It'll be okay.
I mean, who's gonna take care of you?
Cook?
Help you take care of the equipment?
Don't you worry about me.
You'll play baseball.
I'm not gonna know anybody.
Nothing's ever gonna happen here.
You gotta go where things happen.
I love you, Daddy.
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, honey.
Are you coming?
See, how it works is, the train moves, not the station.
This is making me sick.
Write to me, honey.
I love you.
Hey, cowgirls, see the grass?
Don't eat it.
Okay, girls, this is it.
Harvey Field.
Tryouts.
Get out there.
Show them what you got.
Don't embarrass me.
It's been a thin slice of heaven.
Goodbye.
Wait.
You're going?
Dry your eyes.
I'm going home.
Grab a shower and a shave.
Give the wife a pickle-tickle, and I'm on my way.
I'll see you.
- But-
- But what?
Field!
Tryouts!
Play!
That's it!
Get lost!
I hate when they get attached to me like that.
- Hey, Mae.
- What?
- Come look at this.
- Wait a second, Doris.
I can't wait much longer, so get up.
Yeah, so?
Yeah, so I ain't done yet.
Watch this.
- That's it?
- You can't do it, Mae.
I could do it.
How long you been working on that, Doris?
Took me a year.
Not counting the two months I was in the hospital.
Bat hit me right in the head.
Your head and not your behind?
That looks really swollen.
- What kind of thing is that to say?
- I'm joking, okay?
I'm nervous.
- What are you looking at?
- Yeah, what?
Nothing.
That's right, nothing.
All these girls gonna be in the league?
- You wish.
- You do wish.
- Four teams.
Sixteen girls to a team.
- That's right.
Sixty-four girls.
What are you, a genius?
They got over 100 girls here, so some of youse will have to go home.
- Sorry about that.
- Come on, Doris.
What do you mean, "some of us"?
- Okay, some of them are going home.
- How'd you do that?
Excuse me.
You caught that.
Hello?
Let's go practice.
She caught it with her bare hand.
And now, from Chicago, The Mutual presents another social commentary by Miss Maida Gilespie.
Careers and higher education are leading to the masculinization of women with enormously dangerous consequences to the home, the children and our country.
When our boys come home from war what kind of girls will they be coming home to?
And now, the most disgusting example of this sexual confusion, Mr. Walter Harvey, of Harvey Bars is presenting us with women's baseball.
Right here in Chicago, young girls plucked from their families are gathered at Harvey Field to see which one of them can be the most masculine.
Mr. Harvey, like your candy bars, you are completely nuts.
Very good.
Try another.
Nice throw!
Your name will be on one of those five lists.
Okay, find your name.
If we could just form two or three parallel lines...
I'm a Peach!
A Rockford Peach!
I made it!
I can stay!
Are you a newspaper guy?
This is my friend Mae.
She made the team.
Come on, we got a lot to do.
Let's settle down.
Now, you're the first-
Honey, are you supposed to be here, or are you on the cut list?
Look, I'm sorry.
If you're on the cut list, you have to leave the field.
Well, are you cut?
Look on the list.
It's either Rockford, Racine, Kenosha or South Bend.
Can you read, honey?
No.
All right, what's your name?
Shirley Baker.
Let's just take a look.
This is you.
You're with us.
You're a Rockford Peach.
Go join your team.
Settle down.
We got a lot to go over.
First, congratulations.
You are the first members of the All-American Girls' Baseball League.
I'm Charlie Collins.
I'll be managing the Racine team when the season starts.
The other teams will have managers soon.
At the end of practice today you all have to get fitted for your uniforms.
And this is what they'll look like.
Pretty darn nifty, if you ask me.
You can't slide in that.
That's a dress.
It's half a dress.
That's not a baseball uniform.
What do you think we are, ballplayers or ballerinas?
It's awfully short.
Short?
I'm gonna have to squat in that thing.
I can't!
My husband will kill me.
Ladies!
Excuse me.
You can't play ball in this, you can't play ball with us.
There are 38 girls getting tickets home who'll play in a bathing suit if I ask.
There's no pockets for my cigarettes.
There is no smoking.
There is also no drinking and no men.
Your social engagements will be cleared through your team chaperones.
You'll have regular classes at charm and beauty school.
For what?
Every girl in this league will be a lady.
And gracefully and grandly.
Gracefully and grandly.
All right, now go back!
And sip.
Down.
Don't slurp.
Sip.
Down.
Don't slurp.
Stop that!
It's good.
Posture!
Heads up.
Backs straight.
And sit.
Right over left.
Legs always together.
A lady reveals nothing.
The hair.
Soften and shorten.
The eyebrows.
Thin and separate.
There should be two.
ery nice.
ery nice!
Lovely!
What do you suggest?
A lot of night games.
I wanna show you the grounds.
You know, I always-
Jimmy, come on.
I'm showing you around.
Beautiful, huh?
Place used to be a golf course.
I never cared for the game, but I love grass.
It costs a fortune, with the mowing and trimming.
But I grew up in an apartment.
I had one lousy plant in a cheese box.
Now look.
I got a park.
These are my in-laws.
Hello!
They can't hear nothing.
Enough socializing.
Jimmy, I'm thinking of giving you another managing job.
Mr. Harvey, I guarantee I'll do a better job than last time.
You kind of let me down on that San Antonio job.
I had no right to sell off the team's equipment like that.
It won't happen again.
Let me be blunt.
Are you still a fall-down drunk?
Well, that is blunt.
No, sir.
I've quit drinking.
You've seen the error of your ways?
No, I just can't afford it.
That's funny to you?
Your drinking is funny?
You're a young man.
You still could be playing if you just would've laid off the booze.
Well, it's not exactly like that.
I hurt my knee.
You fell out of a hotel.
That's how you hurt it!
There was a fire.
Which you started, which I paid for.
I was gonna send you a thank-you card, but I wasn't allowed anything sharp to write with.
I want you to manage one of the new girls' baseball teams.
Don't look so stunned.
Face it.
You're still a name.
You step out of the dugout before every game.
You wave your little hat.
You give the people a thrill.
Get an organ grinder.
I can hop around and dance.
If your knees are up to it, go ahead.
Mr. Harvey I hit 487 home runs for your baseball club.
Three in the World Series, two in game 4 alone.
I know that.
That's why I'm giving you this job.
Take it or leave it.
I gotta feed the fish.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the first game of the All-American Girls' Baseball League!
The South Bend Blue Sox against your own Rockford Peaches.
- Where is he?
- I can't believe he's our manager.
I was listening to the radio when he hit that home run to win the pennant.
I'm asking him to sign my husband's baseball card.
Do you mind?
Could I take a look at that?
Just be careful with it.
If anything happens, he'll come back from the Pacific and kill me.
- Mr. Dugan-
- Mr. Dugan, I'm simply...
Do something, Mae.
Time him.
Give me your watch.
Could be a record.
That counts.
How long?
I ain't gonna ask you again.
Shut up, Doris.
Keep timing.
Hey, Mae, how long?
Boy, that was some good peeing.
Hey, coach.
Mr. Dugan?
Could you sign my husband's baseball card for me?
Great to meet you!
What'll we do?
He didn't give us a lineup.
We can't play without one.
I'll pitch.
I can pitch.
- I thought I was playing centre field.
- No, I am.
Hey, you guys.
Come on.
How hard can it be to make a lineup?
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you do it, Oregon?
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
All right.
Mae, centre field, lead off.
She's good.
And now, the manager of the Peaches former six-time National League Home Run Champ Jimmy Dugan!
Jimmy, look up here!
We love you!
Bullshit.
You can all kiss my ass.
That's right.
Kiss my big hairy ass.
And the Rockford Peaches!
Doris Murphy takes the field!
Lift up your skirt!
This'll be something.
Ain't too many people here.
- You nervous, Doris?
- Yeah.
I ain't.
- Are they laughing at us?
- Yeah, they're laughing at us.
- They hate us.
- Just keep smiling.
Hey, glamour puss!
Can you throw the ball?
All right, ladies, let's play ball!
- Let's play ball.
- Dirt in the skirt!
And now, the lineup for Rockford:
Leading off and playing centre field, number 5, Mae Mordabito!
Batting second and playing 3rd base, number 22, Doris Murphy!
Batting third, the catcher, number 8, Dottie Hinson!
Batting fourth and playing 2nd base, number 32, Marla Hooch.
Girls can't play ball!
Batting fifth...
Look at me!
I'm a ballplayer!
Better look out, I might break a nail!
- number 1, Ellen Sue Gotlander.
- It slipped!
- Batting ninth, pitcher number 23, Kit Keller!
Count's 2 balls and no strikes to Rockford's big catcher, Dottie Hinson.
And it's in the dirt. 3 and 0.
Let's see if Jimmy Dugan gives her the green light on 3 and 0 or gives her the take sign.
Game's tied 2-2, the bottom of the 9th with two runners in scoring position and only 1 out.
From the belt, here's the delivery.
Oh, baby!
She hit the cream cheese out of that one!
Jimmy Dugan, master strategist, had her swinging away!
He sure knows his baseball.
Come on, Dottie!
Make me proud!
A 3-run clout for Dottie Hinson and Rockford wins it, 5 to 2.
Dottie, ladies and gentlemen!
Dottie!
I couldn't believe you hit it right out there!
Can we have your autograph?
Can we, Jimmy?
Not today, boys.
Come back next game.
Nice piece of coaching.
Especially in the 5th inning when you scratched your balls for an hour.
Anything worth doing is worth doing right.
Yes, indeed.
Until you did that, I couldn't tell if you were drunk or dead.
It was made very clear to me what I'm supposed to do here.
I smile wave my little hat, and I did that.
So when do I get paid?
You have some good ballplayers.
If you'll only-
Ballplayers!
I haven't got ballplayers!
I've got girls!
Girls are what you sleep with after the game, not what you coach during it.
If we paid you more, could you be just a little more disgusting?
I could certainly use the money.
On the home front they find them everywhere North, East, South and West, and even Canada.:
Players for the new All-American Girls' Baseball League.
After a month of play the shine still isn't off these Diamond Gals.
Alice "Skeeter" Gaspers says "Legging out a triple is no reason to let your nose get shiny. "
Betty Grable has nothing on these gals.
Helen Haley has not only been on several championship amateur teams she's also an accomplished coffeemaker.
With her husband in the Pacific Betty Horn enjoys cooking spaghetti and knitting.
Her teammates call her "Betty Spaghetti. "
Ellen Sue Gotlander is a former Miss Georgia.
Then there's pretty Dottie Hinson who plays like Gehrig and looks like Garbo.
Fellas, keep your mitts to yourselves.
She's married.
And there's her kid sister Kit, who's as single as they come.
Enough concentrated "oomph" for a whole carload of Hollywood starlets.
And how about Marla Hooch?
What a hitter!
What a lead!
But girls playing baseball?
- Enjoy that?
- Yeah!
Good.
Come back next game, will you?
I'm Evelyn Gardner.
I play right field.
For us.
I just spoke to my husband last night.
He says I can't leave our son with him at home anymore.
See, he says he's too busy reading the want ads and I should just take him with me and shut up about it.
So can I?
Take my son with me on road trips?
Ballplayers...!
He's the sweetest little boy.
Everyone's just gonna love him.
Get this brat off of me!
That's it!
I quit!
Stilwell, angel, come to Mommy.
- You're too young to drive.
- I will.
Watch.
Evelyn!
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to kill your son!
Wait!
The girls have a game!
You can't leave us like this!
Please, Mr. Goosatelli!
Get over here, Stilwell!
I'm gonna kill you!
You can't catch me!
Don't use my bat, use Marla's!
It's heavier!
- Evelyn, why is he so wild?
- I don't know.
Stilwell, angel, have another chocolate bar.
Gimme!
Gimme!
You can't leave us like this.
We're in the middle of nowhere!
- We can't be here!
- No!
Keep him away from me!
He's really a sweetie, Dottie.
- I hope I have five just like him.
- Don't eat the wrapper, honey.
- You gonna come?
- Where you going?
A roadhouse called the Suds Bucket.
No, I'm married.
I'm...
Come on, you ain't on the farm anymore.
Live a little bit.
Girls!
Please!
Mr. Goosatelli shan't be returning.
How you gonna get past Miss Cuthbert?
Mae's gonna poison her dinner.
What is it, baby?
What the hell is going on?
!
Why are we stopped?
Lou quit.
Who's Lou?
The driver.
A car could've came by now.
- Get on the bus!
- Was that English?
I loved you in The Wizard of Oz.
In the 43 years I've practised medicine, I never saw a woman throw up that much.
Maybe that's how she entertains herself, doc.
Hurry!
Come on!
Quiet!
Mae, what did you give her?
Who cares?
It's working.
I'm going, baby!
Come on, way to go, Mae!
I'm coming in!
Catch me!
Did you see me, Kit?
I pretzeled!
- How'd you learn to do that?
- She taught me.
My father owns a dance hall, upstate.
innie's Dance Girls Deluxe.
She was a dancer, I was a bouncer.
You were great!
- Thanks for the ride, kid.
- What's your rush, dollbody?
What do you say we slip in the back seat and you make a man out of me?
What do you say I smack you around?
Can't we do both?
No, I'm not hot.
It's fine.
It's really cold.
- That's better.
- Where's Kit?
I think she's on the dance floor.
There she is.
I got my truck parked outside.
Sorry, we gotta go.
Come on.
Alice, come on.
We gotta go.
We got trouble.
- I knew it.
You killed Miss Cuthbert.
- We'll bury her.
I know a guy-
Lowenstein's coming.
He catches us, we're out of the league.
Let's make like a bread truck and haul buns, ladies.
Let's duck out the back door.
Is this all?
Marla didn't come?
She came.
Well, where is she?
There.
Thinkin' of you
Some others I've seen
What did you do to her?
We just gave her a dress.
And a lot of liquor!
You guys go ahead.
I'll get Marla.
Hurry up, ladies!
Thanks.
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
It had to be you
It had to be you
Marla, honey?
We gotta go.
I'm singing to Nelson!
Ain't I, baby?
You sure are.
I could take her home.
It'd be an honour.
Ain't he something?
Could make me be blue
That's the second time he dropped that Bible since she's been in there.
Come on, girls.
Mae, what'd you say?
Everything.
Here's a good job for you, Jimmy.
Managing girl ballplayers.
You go out there and you wave your little hat around.
Don't drink!
Why would I want to drink?
I'm a goddamn Peach!
God, double play.
Now I'm hitting like a girl.
"But be nice to them.
They're good ballplayers."
There, catch that, blondie!
Now batting for the Rockford Peaches number 5, centre fielder Mae Mordabito!
Here's the pitch.
There's a shot into right centre!
It's up the alley!
She's turning around 1 st!
She's digging up the dirt!
She's heading past 2nd.
She's heading into 3rd!
Dirt in the skirt, Mae!
Dirt in the skirt!
- Safe!
- She's in there with a triple!
Boy, did she smack that one right on the kisser.
No wonder they call her "All-the-Way" Mae.
Triple.
Next batter number 32, 2nd baseman, Marla Hooch.
Evelyn, look at this!
I've got Stilwell's snack on my cleat!
What are you, stupid?
Somebody's gotta run the team.
Someone who actually watches the games.
You're gonna squeeze bunt with our best hitter?
What's the sign to swing away?
Hey, blond girl!
What's the sign?
It's the letters.
A squeeze'll work.
Stop thinking with your tits.
Batter!
Time!
Come on!
Who is the goddamn manager here?
I am!
Then act like it, you big lush!
- You tell him, Dottie!
- About time someone told him.
- I'm ready now.
- Play ball!
Way to go, whatever your name is!
Good bluff!
But I still say you're not ballplayers.
Cemetery boneyard!
Cross your fingers or you'll never get another hit.
Sound it out.
Kimono.
Kimono off and gra-bed...
Grabbed.
...her milky milky white...
What are you giving her to read?
What's the difference?
She's reading.
That's the important thing.
Go away!
Go!
Shoo!
Go ahead, Shirley.
Thanks.
Milky white breasts.
It gets really good after that.
- A delivery boy walks in...
- What are you doing?
I'm writing a song.
Really?
What's it about?
About us.
Could you teach it to me?
Doris, is this your boyfriend?
Is it out of focus?
No, that's how he looks.
Looks aren't the most important thing.
Right.
The important thing is he's stupid, out of work and treats me bad.
Then why...?
Why?
What do you think?
Because none of the other boys ever...
Always made me feel like I was wrong.
Like I was some sort of a weird girl or a strange girl or not even a girl, just because I could play.
I believed them too.
But not anymore.
I mean, look.
There's a lot of us.
I think we're all all right.
We are.
Give me that.
So long, Charlie!
So with 2 runs in the 6th, South Bend gets even.
I've gotta go!
I've gotta go!
You shake it off.
Shake it off.
Say, Evelyn, can I ask you a question?
Which team do you play for?
- I'm a Peach.
- Well, I was just wondering because I couldn't figure out why you'd throw home when we've got a 2-run lead!
You let the tying run get on 2nd, and we lost the lead!
You start using your head!
That's that lump that's three feet above your ass!
Are you crying?
Are you crying?
There's no crying!
There's no crying in baseball!
Leave her alone, Jimmy.
You zip it, Doris!
Rogers Hornsby, my manager, called me a 'talking pile of pig shit'!
That was when my parents came from Michigan to see me play the game!
And did I cry?
No!
Do you know why?
Because there's no crying in baseball.
No crying in baseball!
No crying!
What's the matter?
She's crying, sir.
I didn't mean to do that.
Perhaps you chastised her too vehemently.
Good rule of thumb:
Treat each of them as you would your mother.
Anyone ever tell you you look like a penis with a hat on?
You're out of here!
- I heard that!
- You misunderstood.
- Ten seconds!
- You misunderstood!
You can't throw me out knowing you've got a strike!
Off this field!
I can't believe no one ever called you that before!
That's where you belong.
I'm in charge now.
The crowd's light today, what with the tractor show in town.
If you're nearby, and you must be, since this isn't a powerful radio station...
People better start showing up.
We don't have fans, we don't have a league.
Ladies you all look wonderful.
There's a reporter and a photographer in the stands from Life magazine.
- We're famous!
- Life magazine?
Don't waste your time.
Dottie, I'm trying to get them to do a story about you.
Me?
Why me?
You're the "Queen of Diamonds." That's what I'm calling you.
Did you tell them about me?
I told them how at first, the scout didn't even want you but how Dottie wouldn't come without her kid sister.
They really loved it.
A real human-interest story.
Will you just try to give them something spectacular out there?
Anything.
What's the matter?
Well, we're not doing so well.
Harvey and the other owners think they've made a mistake.
They might close you down.
What are you talking about?
They can't close us down here.
- What kind of a thing is that?
- What's it mean?
They're businessmen.
No profit, no product.
And what am I supposed to do?
Go back to taxi dancing?
Ten cents so some slob can sweat gin all over me?
I'm never doing that again!
So you tell old rich Mr. Chocolate Man that he ain't closing me down!
They can't keep us from playing!
We'll show them how we play.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
I am trying my best.
So will you just give them everything you've got?
We always do.
A slick play by Alice Gaspers and there's 2 gone in the 3rd.
That'll bring up Dee Lynch.
Lynch is the most consistent Belles hitter this year.
Settles in.
Pops it up!
Foul.
Hinson should have no trouble with this.
She's under it.
Uncle Elmore's socks!
What did she do?
I can't do that.
Who can?
- What is her name?
- Dottie Hinson.
D-O-T-T-I-E...
What the hell was that?
I just thought it might help the league.
A goddamn circus!
A double would be nice-
All right!
God knows we have a game.
It's not like any of this helps, believe me.
That was really nice!
Let's go, girls.
Dozens of people are waiting for the game to start.
Batter!
What is her name?
Hey you, tall girl!
Beverly!
Look sharp, tall- What is her name?
Beverly.
Good.
Five bucks!
Five bucks!
What if, at a key moment in the game, my uniform bursts open and my bosoms fly out?
That might draw a crowd, right?
Think there's men who ain't seen your bosoms?
Thank you.
- Marla, what you got?
- What about me?
I got a letter from Nelson!
Fly ball as Dottie Hinson brings the crowd to its feet with a home run!
22!
We love you, 22!
- Come on!
- Open your mouth!
The kid ate the lineup!
Right here.
I'm so happy!
Thank you.
I love you.
I'll be back next season.
See you next season!
Slide!
Slide!
Safe!
Thank you!
Let it up.
Let it up.
That was a good one.
It's a fly ball to left!
Betty Spaghetti makes the catch!
Heads up!
Spaghetti makes the throw!
It's gonna be close!
Aunt Edna's bridgework!
She is out!
Dottie Hinson held onto the ball!
Oh, doctor!
A lot of ballplayers use it.
High foul pop.
It's coming back!
She caught it!
Unbelievable!
Full house on its feet cheering Dottie Hinson!
That sounded good.
- You haven't got a curve ball left.
- I don't?
!
You haven't had one since-
Safe!
Safe!
He's good-looking.
- What's he do when not in the Army?
- Dairy assistant manager.
He'll be manager.
He's smart.
So he's good-looking and smart.
There's so few of us.
Where did you say he was?
Italy?
I think.
I haven't got a letter from him in three weeks.
I used to get one every week.
That doesn't mean anything.
If he's in combat, it's not like there's a mailbox on every corner.
If something happened, you would've got a telegram.
Oh, God, don't-
But he's fine.
No, he's fine.
How come you're not in the Army?
I have no cartilage in my knee.
You don't need it to shoot Nazis.
You need this, right?
Trigger finger.
I could do that.
How did I get so useless so fast?
Boys like this on your fingers?
Works for me.
Your sister's not gonna be mad?
I don't care.
Listen, when...
- Bob.
- ...
Bob comes back will you keep playing?
You could just quit?
Sure.
You play like you love it.
- Does he know how good you are?
- Bob?
No, Hitler.
Yes, Bob.
How good am I?
You stink.
You're lousy.
You're only the best player in the league.
You don't know that?
You ever been married?
Let me think.
Yeah, twice.
Any children?
One of them was.
Is she out?
I think it's time for a drink.
Hang on.
Hang on.
These really don't mix.
- Good, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
It's great.
Fair ball!
Time!
Jimmy Dugan pops his head out of the dugout.
He's on his way to talk to his hurler.
Kit Keller looks mighty tired.
Game's getting exciting.
I'll finish it right here.
I'll strike this turkey out.
Betty's ready to come in.
Come on.
I've never been taken out before.
Ask Dottie.
I really wanna finish this game.
Please?
What do you think?
Well, you know, she's battling.
What do you think?
She's throwing grapefruits.
It looks like Keller's coming out of the game, and she is not happy about it!
Nice job, Kit!
Betty Horn sprints in from the left-field bullpen.
Look at this crowd.
This is great!
They're jumping, cheering and they paid to get in.
You did a fabulous job.
I won't forget this.
Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey.
I appreciate it, coming from you.
But to be perfectly honest, I think the girls deserve most of the credit.
They're great.
Fortunately, we won't need them anymore.
Do you want a peanut?
No.
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We're winning the war.
Our situation changed.
Roosevelt himself said, "Men's baseball won't be shut down."
So we won't need the girls next year.
Bases loaded.
Bottom of the 9th.
Rockford up, 6 to 2.
Two men out.
No balls, 2 strikes.
Strike 3!
And that is the ball game!
Rockford is in the playoffs!
I love these girls.
I don't need them, but I love them.
Come on.
Let's go.
Look at me.
I'm full of peanuts!
I've got peanuts all over myself.
This is what it's gonna be like in the factories too.
"Men are back.
Turn in your rivets."
First, it was their patriotic duty to get out and go to work.
When the men come back, they're sent back to the kitchen.
Should we send the boys returning from war back to the kitchen?
Come on.
Do you know how dedicated they are?
What they go through?
They play with sprained ankles, broken fingers.
They ride a bus all night to play a double-header the next day!
I'll make it up to them.
What?
With Harvey Bars?
I'm getting tired of listening to you, Ira.
I'd like your permission to take over the league.
Do you understand?
All of the owners are getting out.
There's no point to it anymore.
Just let them finish the season, and that's it!
I sold your product when there was no product.
This is a product!
There is no room for girls' baseball in this country once the war is over.
They're through.
I think you're wrong.
And I'm gonna prove it to you, Mr. Harvey!
Hi, my name's Mae.
That's more than a name, that's an attitude.
Here's my friend Doris.
Best player on the team.
- Thank you.
- You're the best.
- The game put us in the playoffs.
- I could've finished.
Stilwell could've hit off you.
What's the matter?
Too big to finish your own games now?
Don't start with me, Kit!
Don't you start with me!
Kit, come on, cut it out!
What the hell are you doing?
!
- Get your sister off of her!
- Stay out of it!
You just wait, Doris!
Let me down!
Let me down!
You stay down there and you cool off!
- Why'd she do it?
- She was vulnerable.
You provoked her.
- Shut up, Helen!
- You're making her more upset.
Really!
- I don't need it from Helen.
- Take a shower.
- I'm not taking a shower.
- She reminds me of my husband.
Save some hot water for me, you guys.
You okay?
My rear end hurts where he dropped me.
You acted like a baby.
You treat me like one.
I treated you like a pitcher who'd lost her stuff.
When Betty's in trouble, you back her up every pitch!
I seem to remember last week, somebody throwing a resin bag in my face.
Told me to get my fat ass behind the plate.
Was that you or the umpire?
You could've backed me up today instead of holding me back.
I hold you back?
It's like at home.
It's like if you're here, then I'm not here.
What's that mean?
I don't know what I mean.
I know I'm wrong.
I know you're right and I'm wrong.
I know that.
I just-
I just get so mad!
Why do you gotta be so good?
Dottie, here you are.
You weren't on the bus.
Can I speak to you a minute?
I have to leave.
Don't worry.
The bus wouldn't leave without you.
I'm leaving the team.
What?
- Why?
What-
- I have to go home.
Home?
You can't go home now.
This couldn't come at a worse time.
We're in a bit of a crisis, and I have to try to pull something off.
It's not a good time to lose our most popular player.
- What's the problem?
- I don't want to talk about it.
It's personal?
It's one of the girls, isn't it?
It's Mae, right?
Kit, that's it.
I've noticed there's some friction.
That's fine.
No problem.
Doesn't mean you have to quit.
I can arrange a trade.
Racine?
Kenosha?
South Bend?
Trade me or whatever.
But figure it out by tomorrow, or I'm going home.
Tomorrow?
Fine!
I'll work everything out by tomorrow.
You really gave me a scare for a second.
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Mae, your date's here.
- How do I look?
- Where'd you get that dress?
- Borrowed it.
- It don't fit.
Too tight.
I don't plan on wearing it that long.
I don't know why you get dressed at all.
Where's Dottie?
In there.
Wanna go to the movies with me?
You bitch!
I've been traded to Racine!
You?
I told them to trade me.
They'd really trade you.
Miss Star, Miss Perfect.
You knew what would happen!
- I didn't!
- This'll be better than the movies.
- I'll quit.
Is that what you want?
- They'll blame me for you quitting!
What do you want me to do?
Stay away from me.
Leave me alone!
That's what I want you to do!
Kit, listen.
It was all a mistake.
A big mistake.
- I was getting too good.
- You won't listen.
I knew if I did too good, you'd do something to push me down!
Kit, blow it out your rear end!
I'm sick of you blaming me.
I got you into this league!
She got her in the league!
- I didn't wanna be here!
- Then why are you still here?
Kit wants to know why she's playing.
My train leaves at 8.
I got 10 minutes to pack.
If you have trouble, you know who to blame.
See you in the World Series.
You bet you will.
Don't look at her.
Has anyone seen my new red hat?
Piss on your hat!
Well, that seemed uncalled for.
Just keep it down.
- Kit's off our team.
- She's not!
Yes, she is.
Are you deaf?
You need any help in there?
Don't act like this.
You're still in the league.
You're just on another team, that's all.
Batter up
Hear that call
The time has come
For one and all
To play
Ball
For we're the members of
The All-American League We come from cities
Near and far
We got Canadians
Irish ones and Swedes
We're all for one, we're one for all We're All-Americans
Each girl stands Her head so proudly high
Her motto.:
Do or Die
She's not the one to use Or need an alibi
Our chaperones are not too soft They're not too tough
Our managers are on the ball
Miss Cuthbert...
You gorgeous stack of pancakes!
Man on the floor!
Already dressed.
Get Stilwell away.
I don't know what he's doing.
Get him away from the tapes!
Angel, come here now.
All right.
Everybody, let's listen up.
I was in the toilet reading my contract, and it turns out I get a bonus when we get to the World Series.
Let's play hard!
Play smart!
Use your heads!
That's that lump three feet above our ass, right?
Some more prominent than others.
Come in.
Excuse me!
I got a telegram from the War Department.
Oh, my God!
Ernie!
Boy, I hate these.
These are the worst.
The Army could at least send someone to tell you your husband's dead.
Darn!
I had the name right here!
I gotta go back and straighten this out.
Sorry.
- Just give me the telegram.
- I can't.
I don't have a name.
Just give me the telegram.
This is official.
This is from the War Department!
Come on!
That's official business!
I'm coming-
- I'm sorry, Betty.
- No, it's George!
It's George!
All right, come on.
We still got a game to play.
Come in.
Hi, cutie.
How did you...?
Bob!
Oh, my God!
What happened?
- I'm fine.
- What is it?
It was a sniper.
I was lucky though.
He got seven of us before we got him.
Oh, sweetie!
It's all right.
I made it.
I missed you so much.
I've been discharged.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
It's all over.
I'm here, baby.
Well, listen.
You have to sit down here.
I'll clear all this stuff off.
I almost forgot how beautiful you are.
- Oh, no.
I look terrible!
- You look beautiful.
You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I love you.
Can we just hold each other for the rest of our lives?
That's my plan.
Why am I the only one on this bus?
What are we waiting for?
Are you physically unable to show up on time?
Coming, Jimmy.
If you think you can do without the batting practice, think again.
Not the way you hit.
Let's not go to the World Series without Stilwell's toys!
- Alice, what time is it where you live?
- It's bad luck to yell before a game.
- Could you sign my baseball?
- Sure.
"Avoid the clap.
Jimmy Dugan. "
That's good advice!
Write to us.
We'll miss you.
We will.
Thanks.
Good luck in the World Series.
Taking a little day trip?
Bob and I are driving home to Oregon.
I thought you were a ballplayer.
You were wrong.
Was I?
It is only a game.
It's only a game, and I don't need this.
I have Bob.
I don't need this.
I gave away five years at the end of my career to drinking.
Five years.
There isn't anything I wouldn't give to get back any one day of it.
Well, we're different.
Chickenshit!
You wanna go home and make 100 babies, great.
I can't tell anyone how to live.
But sneaking out like this, quitting...
You'll regret it all your life.
Baseball is what gets inside you.
It's what lights you up.
You can't deny that.
It just got too hard.
It's supposed to be hard.
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it.
The hard is what makes it great.
Everything all right?
Yeah, fine.
Fine.
Bye, Jimmy.
First game of the first women's baseball World Series.
This is history in the making.
History in the making!
This is for you.
We brought you these also.
For me?
Thank them!
- Cut it out!
- I'm sorry.
Two box seats on the 3rd base line.
I got two box seats.
Who wants them?
- How much?
-10 bucks.
That's my daughter, 3rd baseman, Doris Murphy.
Best one they got.
- Where you from?
- Staten Island.
After the game, I'm taking her out for a steak dinner.
All right, all right, all right!
Time for the song and dance.
What's that smell?
Alice thinks it's bad luck to change her socks.
So we all suffer?
Get away, get away.
Outfielders, play deep a few steps.
Don't give up anything long.
Alice?
If the lead-off hitter gets on, they're gonna bunt.
Be ready.
Now, I'd like to...
I'd like to lead you in prayer.
- Come on.
- A prayer?
Come on.
Yes, a little prayer.
Come on!
Come on!
In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost...
Lord hallowed be Thy name.
May our feet be swift.
May our bats be mighty.
May our balls be plentiful.
And, Lord I'd just like to thank you for that waitress in South Bend.
You know who she is.
She kept calling Your name.
And, God these are good girls, and they work hard.
Help them see it all the way through.
Okay, that's it.
- Let's go.
- Amen.
Go Peaches!
Last game.
Now or never, ladies.
Alice, you're killing me.
You're killing me, Alice!
You're goddamn killing me!
And the rocket's red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh, say does that star-spangled
Banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave
This is it, folks.
One game for the whole ball of string.
There is no tomorrow.
Someone will walk out league champions, and someone else will just walk out.
You're gonna lose!
You're gonna lose!
You keep that kid away from me for just one game!
Ellen Sue, how's it looking?
- Good.
- Feeling good?
Looking good!
Nice and warm?
Good.
Alice, if Ellen Sue doesn't have anything, don't keep it a secret.
Tell me right away.
You understand me?
Do you hear me?
!
You're screaming.
I hear you.
Where'd you come from?
We got to Yellowstone and turned back.
Have trouble with the bears, did you?
I was fine until that scout walked into our barn.
I'm no quitter.
Wait a minute!
Hold it!
Who said you could play?
Alice has been catching the last six games.
She looks pretty good.
You don't want me to play?
Well, you're already dressed.
Hell, if you want to play I don't care.
You can play.
Well, then, I'll play.
Good.
- Fine.
- Fine.
Go play.
You look like shit.
Don't you ever shave?
We're gonna win.
We're gonna win!
You're gonna lose!
You stink!
Got him!
Lineup change!
- It's okay.
- Evelyn, he deserved it.
Stilwell, you gonna stay out here or come in the dugout?
Strike!
Strike!
You're out!
3!
Strike!
You're out!
You're out!
You're out, Brenda!
You are out!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Good, Mae!
Good catch!
Thank goodness.
2 down!
2 down!
Base hit.
Gardner's up with it.
Wallace'll stop at 3rd.
Gardner's throw is way off line!
Go!
Go!
All the way!
I'm sorry!
Shoot!
Wallace scampers home, and the Belles take the lead, 1 to nothing!
They're dancing in the aisles here in Racine!
I know.
I know.
You're still missing the cutoff man.
That's something I would like you to work on before next season.
All right.
Thanks.
Thank you, Mr. Dugan.
All right, let's get this one!
All right, come on!
We need some runs out there.
Make something happen, Mae!
All-the-Way Mae!
- They love her.
- Let's go, let's go!
Very cute.
Thanks.
Safe!
She's safe!
Way to play!
Way to run!
Way to make something happen!
Safe!
You get a hit, I'll baby-sit that little porker!
Come on!
You're out!
Come on!
Bring me home, Helen!
Out!
Peaches are down to their final out.
Only tying and go-ahead runs in scoring position.
Big Dottie Hinson striding to the plate.
Let's get out of this inning!
Come on!
Throw smoke, Kit!
Throw smoke!
Here's the pitch.
Bite me on the butt and call me an apple!
She nearly took her head off!
Mordabito scores!
Murphy, she will score!
Rockford has taken the lead, 2 to 1!
That's my wife!
One more!
Keep it going!
Put it past the little queen here.
Right past her!
There's a fly ball to left field.
She'll have to go for this one!
That's the final out.
But the damage has been done.
Right here in Racine, Rockford leads our Belles, 2 to 1 as we go to the bottom of the 9th.
Come on, it's okay.
You gotta bat now.
Relax!
One run and we are back in this ball game.
Shake it off.
You gotta hit.
It's okay, Kit.
Strike her out!
Bad eye!
Bat at that, blond girl!
She drives it to deep centre!
Mordabito goes to the wall and makes the catch!
Beautiful catch!
Beautiful!
Gotlander's pitch and it is in the dirt!
Ball 1!
That looked good to me, Ellen Sue!
Shake that one off!
That ain't nothing!
Gotlander, she delivers.
It's a ground ball between 1 st and 2nd.
This ball is hot!
Hendricks will go up at 1 st with a base hit.
That's all right. 1 down!
We got 1 down!
Let's go!
Foul ball!
Hinson's taking after it.
That does it!
Did she get it?
She got it!
She got it!
There's no question who the star of this game is.
Dottie Hinson has her team 1 out from the title.
Come on, Kit, you're up.
You're the hitter now.
Let's go.
The last batter standing in Rockford's way is Kit Keller.
Kit is 1 for 3 today.
- Can I have time-out?
- Time!
High fastballs.
She can't hit them, can't lay off them.
All right.
All right, if we just hold them now, we got it!
Come on!
Come on, Ellen Sue!
One, two, three!
Play ball!
- Strike!
- Swing and a miss.
Strike 1!
Yes!
Thank you, God!
Lay off the high ones!
Here's the pitch.
Swing and a miss!
Strike 2!
One more!
One more!
Here's the pitch.
It is a long fly ball.
Back, back, back.
It falls in there!
No one'll get to this ball!
This should tie it up!
Hendricks is rounding 3rd!
She will score!
Keller to 3rd!
Gardner hits the relay man with a frozen rope!
The coach is giving Keller the stop sign at 3rd!
But she is not stopping!
She runs through the stop sign!
She is not stopping!
Here comes the throw!
It should be in time!
Safe!
She is safe!
I can't believe it!
Hinson dropped the ball!
Hinson dropped the ball!
The ball game is over!
Racine has won the game, 3 to 2 and the World Series!
Take me home, Mama, and put me to bed!
I have seen enough to know I have seen too much!
You played a good game.
Well, what do you say?
All right, Ira.
We'll stick with it.
My mother always used to say, "If at first you don't succeed-"
You don't have to spend six months in Saskatchewan.
- Alice, you told me it's lovely.
- If you like icicles.
I thought we were gonna win.
- We didn't.
- Up to that last inning, we had it.
I'm so depressed, I could eat a cow.
It's all right.
You did good.
Get dressed.
See you on the bus.
Thanks.
Wanna be a ballplayer when you get big?
- What's your name?
- Angelina.
Gotta practice really hard.
What's your name?
- How much?
- Help yourself.
Thank you.
- Hitting!
- You all like hitting better?
- What's your name?
- Mary.
- Who you rooting for?
- Racine!
That's what I thought you said.
You guys be good.
Get dirty.
- I'm sorry I knocked you over.
- No, you're not.
You blocked the entire plate!
How do you-
You did what you had to.
You beat me.
You wanted it more than me.
I jammed my shoulder, if it makes you feel any better.
A little.
Bob and I are driving back to Oregon.
You're welcome to come with us.
You two should be alone.
I'd just be in the way.
When will you be coming home?
Some of the girls talked about staying around here and getting jobs.
I really like it here.
Christmas?
I don't know.
You'll come back next year, right?
I wanna have kids.
We wanna have kids.
You got plenty of time to have kids.
You couldn't give this up.
You'd miss it.
Miss it?
Miss putting on all this gear?
Catching a double-header in 100-degree heat?
Pushing the bus in mud?
Getting slammed into every other day by a base runner?
Think I'm gonna miss that?
I'll tell you what I'll miss.
I'll miss the girls.
I'll miss you.
Me?
How many sisters do you think I have?
I love you, Kit.
Really?
Just when I want you to stay, you're leaving.
Thanks for getting me in the league.
You got yourself in the league.
I got you on the train.
Play great.
Like you.
You stay in touch.
Come home every once in a while.
If you don't, I'll come back and hit line drives at your head.
I love you.
And you are gonna miss this.
I don't care what you say.
There's the winner!
Good game, Jimmy.
Hi, I'm a big fan of yours.
I'm Dottie's husband.
Well, then I'm a big fan of yours.
Old man Harvey just offered me a job managing next year in Wichita.
Triple A?
Great.
Good luck.
Turned him down.
Why?
What do you mean, why?
I already got a job.
I'll see you.
Miss Cuthbert, save me my special seat, now, cutie!
Meet you at the hotel.
Did you see Mae's catch, Dad?
I'd rather see you play ball instead of what you used to do.
What are you saying that for?
You make her feel bad!
Steak dinner.
On you.
I'll see you later.
Kit, over here!
Come on, let's go!
That was Bob, huh?
Nice guy.
Lay off of those high ones.
I like the high ones.
- Mule!
- Nag!
Hey, Mae.
Come here.
- What do you want?
- Come here.
- What is it?
- Look at her.
It's Dottie.
Hey, Doris.
Mae?
All-the-Way Mae?
- No one's called me that since-
- Last night!
I'm a married woman now.
Yeah, about eight times.
Girls!
Look who's here!
Shirley?
Helen Haley!
- It's Dr. Haley now.
I'm a doctor.
- I always knew you would be.
- Who's that?
- Dottie Hinson.
Betty Spaghetti?
Best ballplayer in the league.
- I don't remember her.
- She only played one year.
Ellen Sue!
You haven't changed one bit.
I married a plastic surgeon.
Having you here is good luck.
Thanks, Alice!
Marla!
I'm so glad you're here.
- How's...?
- Nelson?
He's good.
He's retired.
Our son runs the business.
How's Bob?
He's...
When?
Just this winter.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Shirley, I'm so excited.
I've got butterflies in my stomach!
They've got a "Women In Baseball" thing up there.
Isn't it neat?
Baseball Hall of Fame.
I'm shaking.
Wait a minute here.
- Guess who that is?
- Who?
You remember?
You're gonna lose.
Stilwell, angel!
My goodness!
Where's your mom?
Mom died a couple of years ago.
I'm sorry.
She was a real nice lady.
And a damn fine ballplayer.
When I heard about this, I felt like I owed it to her to be here.
She always said it was the best time she had in her whole life.
Come here.
Recognize yourself?
- Can I get one of these?
- Sure.
Ladies!
It's a pleasure to welcome you here today.
It's taken years, but you are the first women ever to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame!
- And now-
- Wait.
Wait a minute.
This really isn't right.
Mr. Lowenstein since you kept the league going all those years you do it.
- There you go, Ira.
- Thank you, Bob.
Ladies it's my honour.
Mr. Capadino, look!
That's when you changed my life, honey!
Stilwell, angel, smile!
Batter up
Hear that call
The time has come
For one and all
To play
Ball
We're the members of
The All-American League
We come from cities
Near and far
We've got Canadians
Irish ones and Swedes
We're all for one We're one for all
We're All-Americans
Is that you, Grandma?
I'm so glad you came.
Hi, Aunt Dottie.
Take a picture.
Let's take a picture of the whole team.
The original Peaches!
You might need that.
Where'd you find this?
It was in one of those cartons.
Needs oil.
Who doesn't?
You ready?
-l'm not going.
-Mom!
I've got two children, I don't need a third.
Why is it so important that I go?
For one thing, it'd be nice if you just left the room.
Besides, these are your old friends.
They probably won't remember me.
The "Queen of Diamonds," Dottie Hinson?
Margaret, it just isn't a good idea.
Come on, Mom.
You'll get to see Aunt Kit.
-You never see each other.
-We still won't.
She'll be traveling around with that husband of hers.
Frank.
He has a name.
He's always been very nice to you.
He makes me nervous.
There's a lot of reasons why I can't go.
Honey I'm not comfortable about this.
I'm not really part of it.
It was never that important.
It was just something I did.
When will you realize how special it was, how much it all meant?
I know how you feel. I really do.
But you're going.
Car.
-Car, train, bus. I'm tired already.
-Sleep on the plane.
Grandma's out.
is there a fire?
Wisenheimer.
Julie's watching you.
I don't want any bad reports.
-Bye, Grandma.
-Bye.
Jeffrey, come here.
No matter what your brother does, he's littler than you.
Give him a chance to shoot.
Promise?
Bobby, come here.
Kill him.
Come on, you'll miss your plane.
I still think I shouldn't go.
Get a hit, Beans!
I'm coming, Mae!
I'm coming!
This week in the world of sports.
With the boys overseas and off to war baseball pitches in for the war effort.
Trading bats for bullets, Yankee Joe DiMaggio promises to give those Nazis a jolt.
Ace fireballer Bob Feller has traded Cleveland gray for Navy blue.
Baseball's biggest stars say "Look out, Mr. Hitler.
The Yanks are coming. "
Not to mention the Indians, Red Sox and Tigers.
And they won't come back till it's over, over there.
Meanwhile, Chicago club owner Walter Harvey, the candy-bar king met with other team owners at the Harvey Mansion as rumours persist that baseball may be shut down for the duration of the war.
Harvey's promotional whiz kid, Ira Lowenstein has been given the job of figuring out how to keep baseball going.
Good luck, Mr. Lowenstein.
## --- RM 1 ----
Strike 2!
Hey, fatso!
Get the hell out of the way!
What are you, crazy?
Strike 3!
Kit!
-Sis, don't swing at her high pitch.
-l can hit it.
-You can't.
-l can.
This bat's too heavy.
You'll never get it around.
I will!
Listen.
There's a big hole on the right side.
Don't look.
-Unless she pitches inside, pull it.
-l know.
Batter up!
No high ones.
I like the high ones!
-Mule!
-Nag!
Come on, Kit.
Keep your eye on the ball.
Strike 1 !
Strike 2!
Too high.
All right, Kit.
Look it over!
Look it over there!
Strike 3!
All right, 2 outs, everybody.
Two away!
Better luck next time!
Knock it out of here!
Okay, Dottie!
Batter up!
Right in here!
Bring them in there, Dottie!
Ball!
Keep your eye on it, Dottie!
One hit and we win!
That's it, Dottie!
You did it!
That's the ball game!
Hey, Kit!
What are you swinging those high ones for?
Good thing your sister bailed you out.
How about the two bucks you owe me for this game?
Kit!
Wait up, I'll give you a ride!
Stop kicking the rocks.
I'm sorry.
-That game just made me so mad.
-We won.
Get mad if we lose.
That last pitch was right down the middle.
If I'd have swung at that, I'd be the hero.
-You got me so crazy-- -l only said lay off the high ones.
"Good thing your sister bailed you out."
" Kit, why don't you get your sister to teach you how to hit?"
"Why can't you be beautiful like your sister?"
What idiot said that?
No one.
-But that's what they were thinking.
-No, it's not!
You ever hear Dad introduce us to people?
"This is our daughter Dottie.
This is our other daughter, Dottie's sister."
Should've just had you and bought a dog.
-Mitch Swaley likes you.
-He's one step up from dating pigs.
But an important step.
-Why are you walking so fast?
-Why are you?
-Because you are.
-Can't even let me walk faster than you?
Girls, you got chores to do.
Don't run!
You'll scare the chickens!
I don't have time for these games.
-Why are you running?
-You can go faster than that.
Your legs are longer.
-l win!
-Barely.
Hey!
Hey, yourself.
Doesn't that hurt them?
Doesn't seem to.
It would bruise the hell out of me.
Who are you?
I'm Ernie Capadino, baseball scout.
I saw you playing today.
Not bad, not bad.
Ever hear of Walter Harvey?
Harvey Bars?
You know, the candy?
Yeah, we feed them to the cows when they're constipated.
He's starting a girls' baseball league so we can make a buck while the boys are overseas.
Wanna play?
Nice retort.
Tryouts are in Chicago.
It's a real league, professional.
Professional baseball?
They'll pay you $75 a week.
We only make $30 at the dairy.
Then this would be more, wouldn't it?
Interested?
Come on. $75 a week?
Pull her leg.
Mine are long enough.
Look, your country needs you.
You can not only play ball, but you're kind of a dolly.
Oh, now I get it.
Listen, mister.
I'm a married woman.
My husband's overseas.
Oh, relax!
I'm talking lookie, no touchie.
We want girls easy on the eye.
I'll go. I'm ready now.
I gotta sign something?
I don't want you!
I want her!
The one who hit the ball!
You can climb back under the cow.
She's good.
She's very good.
She pitches.
She didn't today, because she did yesterday.
Thanks for that special glimpse into her life.
I want you.
You I saw, you I like.
The train leaves for Chicago tomorrow.
What do you say?
Are you in?
No, thanks.
" No, thanks"?
Hey, no skin off my Ashtabula.
If you wanna pluck cows, that's your business.
You know something?
You're not nice.
That one hurt.
So long, milkmaids.
No, wait!
Just watch me pitch.
Dottie, get your mitt!
I'll throw him a few.
Now look I know the goods when I see the goods, and she's the goods.
I'm sorry.
Will you shut up?
!
You're a pitcher, huh?
I'll tell you what.
If she comes, you can come too.
If you stink, it only costs us the train ticket.
Get these wild animals away from me!
Haven't you ever heard of a leash?
Come on, Dottie.
You got the whole rest of your life to hang around here.
Never go anywhere.
Never do anything.
I'm married. I'm happy.
It's what I want.
Don't confuse things.
But can't you just have this first?
Just so you can say you once did something?
Something special?
Goodness sake, Kit!
Keep your voice down.
Your father's listening to the radio.
Please, Dottie?
I gotta get out of here.
I'm nothing here.
In the Pacific Northwest, my territory we have increased sales 106% in the last 12-month period.
And this with a war on!
You know, if I had your job, I'd kill myself.
Sit here. I'll see if I can dig up a pistol.
Every trip I take, I gotta sit next to one of these guys.
I'm just too friendly.
Hey, isn't that--?
Well, I'll say one thing for them.
They can run.
Mr. Capadino!
I got her!
Look!
-Sir, your knee.
-Like it?
Stop the train!
Come on!
Come on!
Give me that bag!
Did you promise the cows you'd write?
When do we get to Chicago?
We gotta make a stop.
Fort Collins, Colorado.
Gotta look at another girl.
Hope you're not jealous.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, honey.
That was good form.
Thattagirl!
Good, honey.
Good.
Nice, nice.
That's a rope, honey.
Good girl.
Good, good.
Right, too high.
She's got an eye like DiMaggio.
Okay, Marla.
Now lefty.
She's really good.
She's your daughter?
Her mom's dead.
It's just the two of us.
Coach said if she was a boy, she'd go to the state tournament.
I said, " lf she was a boy, I'd talk to the Yankees instead of living here."
That's enough.
You can bring her over.
Okay, Marla.
Come here.
Boys!
Hit the showers!
Take off your hat, honey.
We'll let you know.
Daddy, I'm sorry.
Let's go.
We'll miss the train.
Let's move, move, move!
What's the matter?
I can't use her.
She's great.
Why not?
What's the problem?
You know General Omar Bradley?
There's too strong a resemblance.
You ain't taking her because she ain't pretty?
Well, look who just caught up!
All right.
Come on, let's go.
Pick those suitcases up!
Come on!
I'm not kidding.
Move!
-One foot in front of the other.
-Mister?
I know my girl ain't so pretty as these girls.
But that's my fault.
I raised her like I would a boy.
I didn't know any better.
She loves to play.
Don't make my girl suffer because I messed up raising her.
Please?
I wish you had a decent mitt.
I think maybe I'd better not go.
No, you can relace it.
It'll be okay.
I mean, who's gonna take care of you?
Cook?
Help you take care of the equipment?
Don't you worry about me.
You'll play baseball.
I'm not gonna know anybody.
Nothing's ever gonna happen here.
You gotta go where things happen.
I love you, Daddy.
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, honey.
Are you coming?
See, how it works is, the train moves, not the station.
This is making me sick.
Write to me, honey.
I love you.
Hey, cowgirls, see the grass?
Don't eat it.
Okay, girls, this is it.
Harvey Field.
Tryouts.
Get out there.
Show them what you got.
Don't embarrass me.
It's been a thin slice of heaven.
Goodbye.
Wait.
You're going?
Dry your eyes.
I'm going home.
Grab a shower and a shave.
Give the wife a pickle-tickle, and I'm on my way. I'll see you.
-But--
-But what?
Field!
Tryouts!
Play!
That's it!
Get lost!
I hate when they get attached to me like that.
-Hey, Mae.
-What?
-Come look at this.
-Wait a second, Doris.
I can't wait much longer, so get up.
Yeah, so?
Yeah, so I ain't done yet.
Watch this.
-That's it?
-You can't do it, Mae.
I could do it.
How long you been working on that, Doris?
Took me a year.
Not counting the two months I was in the hospital.
Bat hit me right in the head.
Your head and not your behind?
That looks really swollen.
-What kind of thing is that to say?
-l'm joking, okay?
I'm nervous.
-What are you looking at?
-Yeah, what?
Nothing.
That's right, nothing.
All these girls gonna be in the league?
-You wish.
-You do wish.
-Four teams.
Sixteen girls to a team.
-That's right.
Sixty-four girls.
What are you, a genius?
They got over 1 00 girls here, so some of youse will have to go home.
-Sorry about that.
-Come on, Doris.
What do you mean, "some of us"?
-Okay, some of them are going home.
-How'd you do that?
Excuse me.
You caught that.
Hello?
Let's go practice.
She caught it with her bare hand.
And now, from Chicago, The Mutual presents another social commentary by Miss Maida Gilespie.
Careers and higher education are leading to the masculinization of women with enormously dangerous consequences to the home, the children and our country.
When our boys come home from war what kind of girls will they be coming home to?
And now, the most disgusting example of this sexual confusion, Mr. Walter Harvey, of Harvey Bars is presenting us with women's baseball.
Right here in Chicago, young girls plucked from their families are gathered at Harvey Field to see which one of them can be the most masculine.
Mr. Harvey, like your candy bars, you are completely nuts.
ery good.
Try another.
Nice throw!
Your name will be on one of those five lists.
Okay, find your name.
If we could just form two or three parallel lines....
l'm a Peach!
A Rockford Peach!
I made it!
I can stay!
Are you a newspaper guy?
This is my friend Mae.
She made the team.
Come on, we got a lot to do.
Let's settle down.
Now, you're the first--
Honey, are you supposed to be here, or are you on the cut list?
Look, I'm sorry.
If you're on the cut list, you have to leave the field.
Well, are you cut?
Look on the list. lt's either Rockford, Racine, Kenosha or South Bend.
Can you read, honey?
No.
All right, what's your name?
Shirley Baker.
Let's just take a look.
This is you.
You're with us.
You're a Rockford Peach.
Go join your team.
Settle down.
We got a lot to go over.
First, congratulations.
You are the first members of the All-American Girls' Baseball League.
I'm Charlie Collins.
I'll be managing the Racine team when the season starts.
The other teams will have managers soon.
At the end of practice today you all have to get fitted for your uniforms.
And this is what they'll look like.
Pretty darn nifty, if you ask me.
You can't slide in that.
That's a dress.
It's half a dress.
That's not a baseball uniform.
What do you think we are, ballplayers or ballerinas?
It's awfully short.
Short?
I'm gonna have to squat in that thing.
I can't!
My husband will kill me.
Ladies!
Excuse me.
You can't play ball in this, you can't play ball with us.
There are 38 girls getting tickets home who'll play in a bathing suit if I ask.
There's no pockets for my cigarettes.
There is no smoking.
There is also no drinking and no men.
Your social engagements will be cleared through your team chaperones.
You'll have regular classes at charm and beauty school.
For what?
Every girl in this league will be a lady.
And gracefully and grandly.
Gracefully and grandly.
All right, now go back!
And sip.
Down.
Don't slurp.
Sip.
Down.
Don't slurp.
Stop that!
It's good.
Posture!
Heads up.
Backs straight.
And sit.
Right over left.
Legs always together.
A lady reveals nothing.
The hair.
Soften and shorten.
The eyebrows.
Thin and separate.
There should be two.
ery nice.
ery nice!
Lovely!
What do you suggest?
A lot of night games.
I wanna show you the grounds.
You know, I always--
Jimmy, come on.
I'm showing you around.
Beautiful, huh?
Place used to be a golf course.
I never cared for the game, but I love grass.
It costs a fortune, with the mowing and trimming.
But I grew up in an apartment.
I had one lousy plant in a cheese box.
Now look. I got a park.
These are my in-laws.
Hello!
They can't hear nothing.
Enough socializing.
Jimmy, I'm thinking of giving you another managing job.
Mr. Harvey, I guarantee I'll do a better job than last time.
You kind of let me down on that San Antonio job.
I had no right to sell off the team's equipment like that.
It won't happen again.
Let me be blunt.
Are you still a fall-down drunk?
Well, that is blunt.
No, sir. I've quit drinking.
You've seen the error of your ways?
No, I just can't afford it.
That's funny to you?
Your drinking is funny?
You're a young man.
You still could be playing if you just would've laid off the booze.
Well, it's not exactly like that.
I hurt my knee.
You fell out of a hotel.
That's how you hurt it!
There was a fire.
Which you started, which I paid for.
I was gonna send you a thank-you card, but I wasn't allowed anything sharp to write with.
I want you to manage one of the new girls' baseball teams.
Don't look so stunned.
Face it.
You're still a name.
You step out of the dugout before every game.
You wave your little hat.
You give the people a thrill.
Get an organ grinder.
I can hop around and dance.
If your knees are up to it, go ahead.
Mr. Harvey I hit 487 home runs for your baseball club.
Three in the World Series, two in game 4 alone.
I know that.
That's why I'm giving you this job.
Take it or leave it.
I gotta feed the fish.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the first game of the All-American Girls' Baseball League!
The South Bend Blue Sox against your own Rockford Peaches.
-Where is he?
-l can't believe he's our manager.
I was listening to the radio when he hit that home run to win the pennant.
I'm asking him to sign my husband's baseball card.
Do you mind?
Could I take a look at that?
Just be careful with it.
If anything happens, he'll come back from the Pacific and kill me.
-Mr.
Dugan--
-Mr.
Dugan, I'm simply....
Do something, Mae.
Time him.
Give me your watch.
Could be a record.
That counts.
How long?
I ain't gonna ask you again.
Shut up, Doris.
Keep timing.
Hey, Mae, how long?
Boy, that was some good peeing.
Hey, coach.
Mr. Dugan?
Could you sign my husband's baseball card for me?
Great to meet you!
What'll we do?
He didn't give us a lineup.
We can't play without one.
I'll pitch. I can pitch.
-l thought I was playing centre field.
-No, I am.
Hey, you guys.
Come on.
How hard can it be to make a lineup?
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you do it, Oregon?
-Me?
-Yeah, you.
All right.
Mae, centre field, lead off.
She's good.
And now, the manager of the Peaches former six-time National League Home Run Champ Jimmy Dugan!
Jimmy, look up here!
We love you!
Bullshit.
You can all kiss my ass.
That's right.
Kiss my big hairy ass.
And the Rockford Peaches!
Doris Murphy takes the field!
Lift up your skirt!
This'll be something.
Ain't too many people here.
-You nervous, Doris?
-Yeah.
I ain't.
-Are they laughing at us?
-Yeah, they're laughing at us.
-They hate us.
-Just keep smiling.
Hey, glamour puss!
Can you throw the ball?
All right, ladies, let's play ball!
-Let's play ball.
-Dirt in the skirt!
And now, the lineup for Rockford:
Leading off and playing centre field, number 5, Mae Mordabito!
Batting second and playing 3rd base, number 22, Doris Murphy!
Batting third, the catcher, number 8, Dottie Hinson!
Batting fourth and playing 2nd base, number 32, Marla Hooch.
Girls can't play ball!
Batting fifth....
Look at me!
I'm a ballplayer!
Better look out, I might break a nail!
--number 1 , Ellen Sue Gotlander.
-lt slipped!
-Batting ninth, pitcher number 23, Kit Keller!
Count's 2 balls and no strikes to Rockford's big catcher, Dottie Hinson.
And it's in the dirt. 3 and 0.
Let's see if Jimmy Dugan gives her the green light on 3 and 0 or gives her the take sign.
Game's tied 2-2, the bottom of the 9th with two runners in scoring position and only 1 out.
From the belt, here's the delivery.
Oh, baby!
She hit the cream cheese out of that one!
Jimmy Dugan, master strategist, had her swinging away!
He sure knows his baseball.
Come on, Dottie!
Make me proud!
A 3-run clout for Dottie Hinson and Rockford wins it, 5 to 2.
Dottie, ladies and gentlemen!
Dottie!
I couldn't believe you hit it right out there!
Can we have your autograph?
Can we, Jimmy?
Not today, boys.
Come back next game.
Nice piece of coaching.
Especially in the 5th inning when you scratched your balls for an hour.
Anything worth doing is worth doing right.
Yes, indeed.
Until you did that, I couldn't tell if you were drunk or dead.
It was made very clear to me what I'm supposed to do here.
I smile wave my little hat, and I did that.
So when do I get paid?
You have some good ballplayers.
If you'll only--
Ballplayers!
I haven't got ballplayers!
I've got girls!
Girls are what you sleep with after the game, not what you coach during it.
If we paid you more, could you be just a little more disgusting?
I could certainly use the money.
On the home front they find them everywhere North, East, South and West, and even Canada.:
Players for the new All-American Girls' Baseball League.
After a month of play the shine still isn't off these Diamond Gals.
Alice "Skeeter" Gaspers says "Legging out a triple is no reason to let your nose get shiny. "
Betty Grable has nothing on these gals.
Helen Haley has not only been on several championship amateur teams she's also an accomplished coffeemaker.
With her husband in the Pacific Betty Horn enjoys cooking spaghetti and knitting.
Her teammates call her "Betty Spaghetti. "
Ellen Sue Gotlander is a former Miss Georgia.
Then there's pretty Dottie Hinson who plays like Gehrig and looks like Garbo.
Fellas, keep your mitts to yourselves.
She's married.
And there's her kid sister Kit, who's as single as they come.
Enough concentrated "oomph" for a whole carload of Hollywood starlets.
And how about Marla Hooch?
What a hitter!
What a lead!
But girls playing baseball?
-Enjoy that?
-Yeah!
Good.
Come back next game, will you?
I'm Evelyn Gardner.
I play right field.
For us.
I just spoke to my husband last night.
He says I can't leave our son with him at home anymore.
See, he says he's too busy reading the want ads and I should just take him with me and shut up about it.
So can I?
Take my son with me on road trips?
Ballplayers...!
He's the sweetest little boy.
Everyone's just gonna love him.
Get this brat off of me!
That's it!
I quit!
Stilwell, angel, come to Mommy.
-You're too young to drive.
-l will.
Watch.
Evelyn!
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to kill your son!
Wait!
The girls have a game!
You can't leave us like this!
Please, Mr. Goosatelli!
Get over here, Stilwell!
I'm gonna kill you!
You can't catch me!
Don't use my bat, use Marla's!
It's heavier!
-Evelyn, why is he so wild?
-l don't know.
Stilwell, angel, have another chocolate bar.
Gimme!
Gimme!
You can't leave us like this.
We're in the middle of nowhere!
-We can't be here!
-No!
Keep him away from me!
He's really a sweetie, Dottie.
-l hope I have five just like him.
-Don't eat the wrapper, honey.
-You gonna come?
-Where you going?
A roadhouse called the Suds Bucket.
No, I'm married. I'm....
Come on, you ain't on the farm anymore.
Live a little bit.
Girls!
Please!
Mr. Goosatelli shan't be returning.
How you gonna get past Miss Cuthbert?
Mae's gonna poison her dinner.
What is it, baby?
What the hell is going on?
!
Why are we stopped?
Lou quit.
Who's Lou?
The driver.
A car could've came by now.
-Get on the bus!
-Was that English?
I loved you in The Wizard of Oz.
In the 43 years I've practised medicine, I never saw a woman throw up that much.
Maybe that's how she entertains herself, doc.
Hurry!
Come on!
Quiet!
Mae, what did you give her?
Who cares?
It's working.
I'm going, baby!
Come on, way to go, Mae!
I'm coming in!
Catch me!
Did you see me, Kit?
I pretzeled!
-How'd you learn to do that?
-She taught me.
My father owns a dance hall, upstate.
innie's Dance Girls Deluxe.
She was a dancer, I was a bouncer.
You were great!
-Thanks for the ride, kid.
-What's your rush, dollbody?
What do you say we slip in the back seat and you make a man out of me?
What do you say I smack you around?
Can't we do both?
No, I'm not hot. lt's fine.
It's really cold.
-That's better.
-Where's Kit?
I think she's on the dance floor.
There she is.
I got my truck parked outside.
Sorry, we gotta go.
Come on.
Alice, come on.
We gotta go.
We got trouble.
-l knew it.
You killed Miss Cuthbert.
-We'll bury her. I know a guy--
Lowenstein's coming.
He catches us, we're out of the league.
Let's make like a bread truck and haul buns, ladies.
Let's duck out the back door.
is this all?
Marla didn't come?
She came.
Well, where is she?
There.
Thinkin' of you
Some others I've seen
What did you do to her?
We just gave her a dress.
And a lot of liquor!
You guys go ahead. I'll get Marla.
Hurry up, ladies!
Thanks.
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
It had to be you
It had to be you
Marla, honey?
We gotta go.
I'm singing to Nelson!
Ain't I, baby?
You sure are.
I could take her home.
It'd be an honour.
Ain't he something?
Could make me be blue
That's the second time he dropped that Bible since she's been in there.
Come on, girls.
Mae, what'd you say?
Everything.
" Here's a good job for you, Jimmy.
Managing girl ballplayers.
You go out there and you wave your little hat around.
Don't drink!"
Why would I want to drink?
I'm a goddamn Peach!
God, double play.
Now I'm hitting like a girl.
" But be nice to them.
They're good ballplayers."
There, catch that, blondie!
Now batting for the Rockford Peaches number 5, centre fielder Mae Mordabito!
Here's the pitch.
There's a shot into right centre!
It's up the alley!
She's turning around 1 st!
She's digging up the dirt!
She's heading past 2nd.
She's heading into 3rd!
Dirt in the skirt, Mae!
Dirt in the skirt!
-Safe!
-She's in there with a triple!
Boy, did she smack that one right on the kisser.
No wonder they call her "All-the-Way" Mae.
Triple.
Next batter number 32, 2nd baseman, Marla Hooch.
Evelyn, look at this!
I've got Stilwell's snack on my cleat!
What are you, stupid?
Somebody's gotta run the team.
Someone who actually watches the games.
You're gonna squeeze bunt with our best hitter?
What's the sign to swing away?
Hey, blond girl!
What's the sign?
It's the letters.
A squeeze'll work.
Stop thinking with your tits.
Batter!
Time!
Come on!
Who is the goddamn manager here?
I am!
Then act like it, you big lush!
-You tell him, Dottie!
-About time someone told him.
-l'm ready now.
-Play ball!
Way to go, whatever your name is!
Good bluff!
But I still say you're not ballplayers.
Cemetery boneyard!
Cross your fingers or you'll never get another hit.
Sound it out.
Kimono.
Kimono off and gra-bed...
Grabbed.
...her milky milky white....
What are you giving her to read?
What's the difference?
She's reading.
That's the important thing.
Go away!
Go!
Shoo!
Go ahead, Shirley.
Thanks.
Milky white breasts.
It gets really good after that.
-A delivery boy walks in....
-What are you doing?
I'm writing a song.
Really?
What's it about?
About us.
Could you teach it to me?
Doris, is this your boyfriend?
is it out of focus?
No, that's how he looks.
Looks aren't the most important thing.
Right.
The important thing is he's stupid, out of work and treats me bad.
Then why...?
Why?
What do you think?
Because none of the other boys ever....
Always made me feel like I was wrong.
Like I was some sort of a weird girl or a strange girl or not even a girl, just because I could play.
I believed them too.
But not anymore.
I mean, look.
There's a lot of us.
I think we're all all right.
We are.
Give me that.
So long, Charlie!
So with 2 runs in the 6th, South Bend gets even.
I've gotta go!
I've gotta go!
You shake it off.
Shake it off.
Say, Evelyn, can I ask you a question?
Which team do you play for?
-l'm a Peach.
-Well, I was just wondering because I couldn't figure out why you'd throw home when we've got a 2-run lead!
You let the tying run get on 2nd, and we lost the lead!
You start using your head!
That's that lump that's three feet above your ass!
Are you crying?
Are you crying?
There's no crying!
There's no crying in baseball!
Leave her alone, Jimmy.
You zip it, Doris!
Rogers Hornsby, my manager, called me a "talking pile of pig shit" !
That was when my parents came from Michigan to see me play the game!
And did I cry?
No!
Do you know why?
Because there's no crying in baseball.
No crying in baseball!
No crying!
What's the matter?
She's crying, sir.
I didn't mean to do that.
Perhaps you chastised her too vehemently.
Good rule of thumb:
Treat each of them as you would your mother.
Anyone ever tell you you look like a penis with a hat on?
You're out of here!
-l heard that!
-You misunderstood.
-Ten seconds!
-You misunderstood!
You can't throw me out knowing you've got a strike!
Off this field!
I can't believe no one ever called you that before!
That's where you belong.
I'm in charge now.
The crowd's light today, what with the tractor show in town.
If you're nearby, and you must be, since this isn't a powerful radio station...
People better start showing up.
We don't have fans, we don't have a league.
Ladies you all look wonderful.
There's a reporter and a photographer in the stands from Life magazine.
-We're famous!
-Life magazine?
Don't waste your time.
Dottie, I'm trying to get them to do a story about you.
Me?
Why me?
You're the "Queen of Diamonds." That's what I'm calling you.
Did you tell them about me?
I told them how at first, the scout didn't even want you but how Dottie wouldn't come without her kid sister.
They really loved it.
A real human-interest story.
Will you just try to give them something spectacular out there?
Anything.
What's the matter?
Well, we're not doing so well.
Harvey and the other owners think they've made a mistake.
They might close you down.
What are you talking about?
They can't close us down here.
-What kind of a thing is that?
-What's it mean?
They're businessmen.
No profit, no product.
And what am I supposed to do?
Go back to taxi dancing?
Ten cents so some slob can sweat gin all over me?
I'm never doing that again!
So you tell old rich Mr. Chocolate Man that he ain't closing me down!
They can't keep us from playing!
We'll show them how we play.
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
I am trying my best.
So will you just give them everything you've got?
We always do.
A slick play by Alice Gaspers and there's 2 gone in the 3rd.
That'll bring up Dee Lynch.
Lynch is the most consistent Belles hitter this year.
Settles in.
Pops it up!
Foul.
Hinson should have no trouble with this.
She's under it.
Uncle Elmore's socks!
What did she do?
I can't do that.
Who can?
-What is her name?
-Dottie Hinson.
D-O-T-T-l-E....
What the hell was that?
I just thought it might help the league.
A goddamn circus!
A double would be nice--
All right!
God knows we have a game.
It's not like any of this helps, believe me.
That was really nice!
Let's go, girls.
Dozens of people are waiting for the game to start.
Batter!
What is her name?
Hey you, tall girl!
Beverly!
Look sharp, tall-- What is her name?
Beverly.
Good.
Five bucks!
Five bucks!
What if, at a key moment in the game, my uniform bursts open and my bosoms fly out?
That might draw a crowd, right?
Think there's men who ain't seen your bosoms?
Thank you.
-Marla, what you got?
-What about me?
I got a letter from Nelson!
Fly ball as Dottie Hinson brings the crowd to its feet with a home run!
22!
We love you, 22!
-Come on!
-Open your mouth!
The kid ate the lineup!
Right here.
I'm so happy!
Thank you.
I love you.
I'll be back next season.
See you next season!
Slide!
Slide!
Safe!
Thank you!
Let it up.
Let it up.
That was a good one.
It's a fly ball to left!
Betty Spaghetti makes the catch!
Heads up!
Spaghetti makes the throw!
It's gonna be close!
Aunt Edna's bridgework!
She is out!
Dottie Hinson held onto the ball!
Oh, doctor!
A lot of ballplayers use it.
High foul pop.
It's coming back!
She caught it!
Unbelievable!
Full house on its feet cheering Dottie Hinson!
That sounded good.
-You haven't got a curve ball left.
-l don't?
!
You haven't had one since--
Safe!
Safe!
He's good-looking.
-What's he do when not in the Army?
-Dairy assistant manager.
He'll be manager.
He's smart.
So he's good-looking and smart.
There's so few of us.
Where did you say he was?
Italy?
I think. I haven't got a letter from him in three weeks.
I used to get one every week.
That doesn't mean anything.
If he's in combat, it's not like there's a mailbox on every corner.
If something happened, you would've got a telegram.
Oh, God, don't--
But he's fine.
No, he's fine.
How come you're not in the Army?
I have no cartilage in my knee.
You don't need it to shoot Nazis.
You need this, right?
Trigger finger.
I could do that.
How did I get so useless so fast?
Boys like this on your fingers?
Works for me.
Your sister's not gonna be mad?
I don't care.
Listen, when...
-Bob.
-...
Bob comes back will you keep playing?
You could just quit?
Sure.
You play like you love it.
-Does he know how good you are?
-Bob?
No, Hitler.
Yes, Bob.
How good am I?
You stink.
You're lousy.
You're only the best player in the league.
You don't know that?
You ever been married?
Let me think.
Yeah, twice.
Any children?
One of them was.
is she out?
I think it's time for a drink.
Hang on.
Hang on.
These really don't mix.
-Good, huh?
-Oh, yeah.
It's great.
Fair ball!
Time!
Jimmy Dugan pops his head out of the dugout.
He's on his way to talk to his hurler.
Kit Keller looks mighty tired.
Game's getting exciting.
I'll finish it right here.
I'll strike this turkey out.
Betty's ready to come in.
Come on. I've never been taken out before.
Ask Dottie.
I really wanna finish this game.
Please?
What do you think?
Well, you know, she's battling.
What do you think?
She's throwing grapefruits.
It looks like Keller's coming out of the game, and she is not happy about it!
Nice job, Kit!
Betty Horn sprints in from the left-field bullpen.
Look at this crowd.
This is great!
They're jumping, cheering and they paid to get in.
You did a fabulous job.
I won't forget this.
Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey.
I appreciate it, coming from you.
But to be perfectly honest, I think the girls deserve most of the credit.
They're great.
Fortunately, we won't need them anymore.
Do you want a peanut?
No.
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We're winning the war.
Our situation changed.
Roosevelt himself said, " Men's baseball won't be shut down."
So we won't need the girls next year.
Bases loaded.
Bottom of the 9th.
Rockford up, 6 to 2.
Two men out.
No balls, 2 strikes.
Strike 3!
And that is the ball game!
Rockford is in the playoffs!
I love these girls.
I don't need them, but I love them.
Come on.
Let's go.
Look at me. I'm full of peanuts!
I've got peanuts all over myself.
This is what it's gonna be like in the factories too.
" Men are back.
Turn in your rivets."
First, it was their patriotic duty to get out and go to work.
When the men come back, they're sent back to the kitchen.
Should we send the boys returning from war back to the kitchen?
Come on.
Do you know how dedicated they are?
What they go through?
They play with sprained ankles, broken fingers.
They ride a bus all night to play a double-header the next day!
I'll make it up to them.
What?
With Harvey Bars?
I'm getting tired of listening to you, Ira.
I'd like your permission to take over the league.
Do you understand?
All of the owners are getting out.
There's no point to it anymore.
Just let them finish the season, and that's it!
I sold your product when there was no product.
This is a product!
There is no room for girls' baseball in this country once the war is over.
They're through.
I think you're wrong.
And I'm gonna prove it to you, Mr. Harvey!
Hi, my name's Mae.
That's more than a name, that's an attitude.
Here's my friend Doris.
Best player on the team.
-Thank you.
-You're the best.
-The game put us in the playoffs.
-l could've finished.
Stilwell could've hit off you.
What's the matter?
Too big to finish your own games now?
Don't start with me, Kit!
Don't you start with me!
Kit, come on, cut it out!
What the hell are you doing?
!
-Get your sister off of her!
-Stay out of it!
You just wait, Doris!
Let me down!
Let me down!
You stay down there and you cool off!
-Why'd she do it?
-She was vulnerable.
You provoked her.
-Shut up, Helen!
-You're making her more upset.
Really!
-l don't need it from Helen.
-Take a shower.
-l'm not taking a shower.
-She reminds me of my husband.
Save some hot water for me, you guys.
You okay?
My rear end hurts where he dropped me.
You acted like a baby.
You treat me like one.
I treated you like a pitcher who'd lost her stuff.
When Betty's in trouble, you back her up every pitch!
I seem to remember last week, somebody throwing a resin bag in my face.
Told me to get my fat ass behind the plate.
Was that you or the umpire?
You could've backed me up today instead of holding me back.
I hold you back?
It's like at home.
It's like if you're here, then I'm not here.
What's that mean?
I don't know what I mean.
I know I'm wrong.
I know you're right and I'm wrong.
I know that. I just-- l just get so mad!
Why do you gotta be so good?
Dottie, here you are.
You weren't on the bus.
Can I speak to you a minute?
I have to leave.
Don't worry.
The bus wouldn't leave without you.
I'm leaving the team.
What?
-Why?
What-- -l have to go home.
Home?
You can't go home now.
This couldn't come at a worse time.
We're in a bit of a crisis, and I have to try to pull something off.
It's not a good time to lose our most popular player.
-What's the problem?
-l don't want to talk about it.
It's personal?
It's one of the girls, isn't it?
It's Mae, right?
Kit, that's it.
I've noticed there's some friction.
That's fine.
No problem.
Doesn't mean you have to quit.
I can arrange a trade.
Racine?
Kenosha?
South Bend?
Trade me or whatever.
But figure it out by tomorrow, or I'm going home.
Tomorrow?
Fine!
I'll work everything out by tomorrow.
You really gave me a scare for a second.
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Mae, your date's here.
-How do I look?
-Where'd you get that dress?
-Borrowed it.
-lt don't fit.
Too tight.
I don't plan on wearing it that long.
I don't know why you get dressed at all.
Where's Dottie?
In there.
Wanna go to the movies with me?
You bitch!
I've been traded to Racine!
You?
I told them to trade me.
They'd really trade you.
Miss Star, Miss Perfect.
You knew what would happen!
-l didn't!
-This'll be better than the movies.
-l'll quit. ls that what you want?
-They'll blame me for you quitting!
What do you want me to do?
Stay away from me.
Leave me alone!
That's what I want you to do!
Kit, listen.
It was all a mistake.
A big mistake.
-l was getting too good.
-You won't listen.
I knew if I did too good, you'd do something to push me down!
Kit, blow it out your rear end!
I'm sick of you blaming me.
I got you into this league!
She got her in the league!
-l didn't wanna be here!
-Then why are you still here?
Kit wants to know why she's playing.
My train leaves at 8.
I got 1 0 minutes to pack.
If you have trouble, you know who to blame.
See you in the World Series.
You bet you will.
Don't look at her.
Has anyone seen my new red hat?
Piss on your hat!
Well, that seemed uncalled for.
Just keep it down.
-Kit's off our team.
-She's not!
Yes, she is.
Are you deaf?
You need any help in there?
Don't act like this.
You're still in the league.
You're just on another team, that's all.
Batter up
Hear that call
The time has come
For one and all
To play
Ball
For we're the members of
The All-American League We come from cities
Near and far
We got Canadians
Irish ones and Swedes
We're all for one, we're one for all We're All-Americans
Each girl stands Her head so proudly high
Her motto.:
Do or Die
She's not the one to use Or need an alibi
Our chaperones are not too soft They're not too tough
Our managers are on the ball
Miss Cuthbert....
You gorgeous stack of pancakes!
Man on the floor!
Already dressed.
Get Stilwell away.
I don't know what he's doing.
Get him away from the tapes!
Angel, come here now.
All right.
Everybody, let's listen up.
I was in the toilet reading my contract, and it turns out I get a bonus when we get to the World Series.
Let's play hard!
Play smart!
Use your heads!
That's that lump three feet above our ass, right?
Some more prominent than others.
Come in.
Excuse me!
I got a telegram from the War Department.
Oh, my God!
Ernie!
Boy, I hate these.
These are the worst.
The Army could at least send someone to tell you your husband's dead.
Darn!
I had the name right here!
I gotta go back and straighten this out.
Sorry.
-Just give me the telegram.
-l can't. I don't have a name.
Just give me the telegram.
This is official.
This is from the War Department!
Come on!
That's official business!
I'm coming--
-l'm sorry, Betty.
-No, it's George!
It's George!
All right, come on.
We still got a game to play.
Come in.
Hi, cutie.
How did you...?
Bob!
Oh, my God!
What happened?
-l'm fine.
-What is it?
It was a sniper.
I was lucky though.
He got seven of us before we got him.
Oh, sweetie!
It's all right. I made it.
I missed you so much.
I've been discharged.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
It's all over. I'm here, baby.
Well, listen.
You have to sit down here.
I'll clear all this stuff off.
I almost forgot how beautiful you are.
-Oh, no. I look terrible!
-You look beautiful.
You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I love you.
Can we just hold each other for the rest of our lives?
That's my plan.
Why am I the only one on this bus?
What are we waiting for?
Are you physically unable to show up on time?
Coming, Jimmy.
If you think you can do without the batting practice, think again.
Not the way you hit.
Let's not go to the World Series without Stilwell's toys!
-Alice, what time is it where you live?
-lt's bad luck to yell before a game.
-Could you sign my baseball?
-Sure.
"Avoid the clap.
Jimmy Dugan."
That's good advice!
Write to us.
We'll miss you.
We will.
Thanks.
Good luck in the World Series.
Taking a little day trip?
Bob and I are driving home to Oregon.
I thought you were a ballplayer.
You were wrong.
Was I?
It is only a game.
It's only a game, and I don't need this.
I have Bob. I don't need this.
I gave away five years at the end of my career to drinking.
Five years.
There isn't anything I wouldn't give to get back any one day of it.
Well, we're different.
Chickenshit!
You wanna go home and make 1 00 babies, great.
I can't tell anyone how to live.
But sneaking out like this, quitting....
You'll regret it all your life.
Baseball is what gets inside you.
It's what lights you up.
You can't deny that.
It just got too hard.
It's supposed to be hard.
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it.
The hard is what makes it great.
Everything all right?
Yeah, fine.
Fine.
Bye, Jimmy.
First game of the first women's baseball World Series.
This is history in the making.
History in the making!
This is for you.
We brought you these also.
For me?
Thank them!
-Cut it out!
-l'm sorry.
Two box seats on the 3rd base line.
I got two box seats.
Who wants them?
-How much?
-1 0 bucks.
That's my daughter, 3rd baseman, Doris Murphy.
Best one they got.
-Where you from?
-Staten Island.
After the game, I'm taking her out for a steak dinner.
All right, all right, all right!
Time for the song and dance.
What's that smell?
Alice thinks it's bad luck to change her socks.
So we all suffer?
Get away, get away.
Outfielders, play deep a few steps.
Don't give up anything long.
Alice?
If the lead-off hitter gets on, they're gonna bunt.
Be ready.
Now, I'd like to....
l'd like to lead you in prayer.
-Come on.
-A prayer?
Come on.
Yes, a little prayer.
Come on!
Come on!
In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost....
Lord hallowed be Thy name.
May our feet be swift.
May our bats be mighty.
May our balls be plentiful.
And, Lord I'd just like to thank you for that waitress in South Bend.
You know who she is.
She kept calling Your name.
And, God these are good girls, and they work hard.
Help them see it all the way through.
Okay, that's it.
-Let's go.
-Amen.
Go Peaches!
Last game.
Now or never, ladies.
Alice, you're killing me.
You're killing me, Alice!
You're goddamn killing me!
And the rocket's red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh, say does that star-spangled
Banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave
This is it, folks.
One game for the whole ball of string.
There is no tomorrow.
Someone will walk out league champions, and someone else will just walk out.
You're gonna lose!
You're gonna lose!
You keep that kid away from me for just one game!
Ellen Sue, how's it looking?
-Good.
-Feeling good?
Looking good!
Nice and warm?
Good.
Alice, if Ellen Sue doesn't have anything, don't keep it a secret.
Tell me right away.
You understand me?
Do you hear me?
!
You're screaming. I hear you.
Where'd you come from?
We got to Yellowstone and turned back.
Have trouble with the bears, did you?
I was fine until that scout walked into our barn. I'm no quitter.
Wait a minute!
Hold it!
Who said you could play?
Alice has been catching the last six games.
She looks pretty good.
You don't want me to play?
Well, you're already dressed.
Hell, if you want to play I don't care.
You can play.
Well, then, I'll play.
Good.
-Fine.
-Fine.
Go play.
You look like shit.
Don't you ever shave?
We're gonna win.
We're gonna win!
You're gonna lose!
You stink!
Got him!
Lineup change!
-lt's okay.
-Evelyn, he deserved it.
Stilwell, you gonna stay out here or come in the dugout?
Strike!
Strike!
You're out!
3!
Strike!
You're out!
You're out!
You're out, Brenda!
You are out!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Good, Mae!
Good catch!
Thank goodness.
2 down!
2 down!
Base hit.
Gardner's up with it.
Wallace'll stop at 3rd.
Gardner's throw is way off line!
Go!
Go!
All the way!
I'm sorry!
Shoot!
Wallace scampers home, and the Belles take the lead, 1 to nothing!
They're dancing in the aisles here in Racine!
I know. I know.
You're still missing the cutoff man.
That's something I would like you to work on before next season.
All right.
Thanks.
Thank you, Mr. Dugan.
All right, let's get this one!
All right, come on!
We need some runs out there.
Make something happen, Mae!
All-the-Way Mae!
-They love her.
-Let's go, let's go!
ery cute.
Thanks.
Safe!
She's safe!
Way to play!
Way to run!
Way to make something happen!
Safe!
You get a hit, I'll baby-sit that little porker!
Come on!
You're out!
Come on!
Bring me home, Helen!
Out!
Peaches are down to their final out.
Only tying and go-ahead runs in scoring position.
Big Dottie Hinson striding to the plate.
Let's get out of this inning!
Come on!
Throw smoke, Kit!
Throw smoke!
Here's the pitch.
Bite me on the butt and call me an apple!
She nearly took her head off!
Mordabito scores!
Murphy, she will score!
Rockford has taken the lead, 2 to 1 !
That's my wife!
One more!
Keep it going!
Put it past the little queen here.
Right past her!
There's a fly ball to left field.
She'll have to go for this one!
That's the final out.
But the damage has been done.
Right here in Racine, Rockford leads our Belles, 2 to 1 as we go to the bottom of the 9th.
Come on, it's okay.
You gotta bat now.
Relax!
One run and we are back in this ball game.
Shake it off.
You gotta hit.
It's okay, Kit.
Strike her out!
Bad eye!
Bat at that, blond girl!
She drives it to deep centre!
Mordabito goes to the wall and makes the catch!
Beautiful catch!
Beautiful!
Gotlander's pitch and it is in the dirt!
Ball 1 !
That looked good to me, Ellen Sue!
Shake that one off!
That ain't nothing!
Gotlander, she delivers.
It's a ground ball between 1 st and 2nd.
This ball is hot!
Hendricks will go up at 1 st with a base hit.
That's all right. 1 down!
We got 1 down!
Let's go!
Foul ball!
Hinson's taking after it.
That does it!
Did she get it?
She got it!
She got it!
There's no question who the star of this game is.
Dottie Hinson has her team 1 out from the title.
Come on, Kit, you're up.
You're the hitter now.
Let's go.
The last batter standing in Rockford's way is Kit Keller.
Kit is 1 for 3 today.
-Can I have time-out?
-Time!
High fastballs.
She can't hit them, can't lay off them.
All right.
All right, if we just hold them now, we got it!
Come on!
Come on, Ellen Sue!
One, two, three!
Play ball!
-Strike!
-Swing and a miss.
Strike 1 !
Yes!
Thank you, God!
Lay off the high ones!
Here's the pitch.
Swing and a miss!
Strike 2!
One more!
One more!
Here's the pitch.
It is a long fly ball.
Back, back, back.
It falls in there!
No one'll get to this ball!
This should tie it up!
Hendricks is rounding 3rd!
She will score!
Keller to 3rd!
Gardner hits the relay man with a frozen rope!
The coach is giving Keller the stop sign at 3rd!
But she is not stopping!
She runs through the stop sign!
She is not stopping!
Here comes the throw!
It should be in time!
Safe!
She is safe!
I can't believe it!
Hinson dropped the ball!
Hinson dropped the ball!
The ball game is over!
Racine has won the game, 3 to 2 and the World Series!
Take me home, Mama, and put me to bed!
I have seen enough to know I have seen too much!
You played a good game.
Well, what do you say?
All right, Ira.
We'll stick with it.
My mother always used to say, " lf at first you don't succeed--"
You don't have to spend six months in Saskatchewan.
-Alice, you told me it's lovely.
-lf you like icicles.
I thought we were gonna win.
-We didn't.
-Up to that last inning, we had it.
I'm so depressed, I could eat a cow.
It's all right.
You did good.
Get dressed.
See you on the bus.
Thanks.
Wanna be a ballplayer when you get big?
-What's your name?
-Angelina.
Gotta practice really hard.
What's your name?
-How much?
-Help yourself.
Thank you.
-Hitting!
-You all like hitting better?
-What's your name?
-Mary.
-Who you rooting for?
-Racine!
That's what I thought you said.
You guys be good.
Get dirty.
-l'm sorry I knocked you over.
-No, you're not.
You blocked the entire plate!
How do you--
You did what you had to.
You beat me.
You wanted it more than me.
I jammed my shoulder, if it makes you feel any better.
A little.
Bob and I are driving back to Oregon.
You're welcome to come with us.
You two should be alone.
I'd just be in the way.
When will you be coming home?
Some of the girls talked about staying around here and getting jobs.
I really like it here.
Christmas?
I don't know.
You'll come back next year, right?
I wanna have kids.
We wanna have kids.
You got plenty of time to have kids.
You couldn't give this up.
You'd miss it.
Miss it?
Miss putting on all this gear?
Catching a double-header in 1 00-degree heat?
Pushing the bus in mud?
Getting slammed into every other day by a base runner?
Think I'm gonna miss that?
I'll tell you what I'll miss.
I'll miss the girls.
I'll miss you.
Me?
How many sisters do you think I have?
I love you, Kit.
Really?
Just when I want you to stay, you're leaving.
Thanks for getting me in the league.
You got yourself in the league.
I got you on the train.
Play great.
Like you.
You stay in touch.
Come home every once in a while.
If you don't, I'll come back and hit line drives at your head.
I love you.
And you are gonna miss this.
I don't care what you say.
There's the winner!
Good game, Jimmy.
Hi, I'm a big fan of yours.
I'm Dottie's husband.
Well, then I'm a big fan of yours.
Old man Harvey just offered me a job managing next year in Wichita.
Triple A?
Great.
Good luck.
Turned him down.
Why?
What do you mean, why?
I already got a job.
I'll see you.
Miss Cuthbert, save me my special seat, now, cutie!
Meet you at the hotel.
Did you see Mae's catch, Dad?
I'd rather see you play ball instead of what you used to do.
What are you saying that for?
You make her feel bad!
Steak dinner.
On you. I'll see you later.
Kit, over here!
Come on, let's go!
That was Bob, huh?
Nice guy.
Lay off of those high ones.
I like the high ones.
-Mule!
-Nag!
Hey, Mae.
Come here.
-What do you want?
-Come here.
-What is it?
-Look at her.
It's Dottie.
Hey, Doris.
Mae?
All-the-Way Mae?
-No one's called me that since--
-Last night!
I'm a married woman now.
Yeah, about eight times.
Girls!
Look who's here!
Shirley?
Helen Haley!
-lt's Dr. Haley now. I'm a doctor.
-l always knew you would be.
-Who's that?
-Dottie Hinson.
Betty Spaghetti?
Best ballplayer in the league.
-l don't remember her.
-She only played one year.
Ellen Sue!
You haven't changed one bit.
I married a plastic surgeon.
Having you here is good luck.
Thanks, Alice!
Marla!
I'm so glad you're here.
-How's...?
-Nelson?
He's good.
He's retired.
Our son runs the business.
How's Bob?
He's....
When?
Just this winter.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Shirley, I'm so excited.
I've got butterflies in my stomach!
They've got a "Women ln Baseball" thing up there. lsn't it neat?
Baseball Hall of Fame.
I'm shaking.
Wait a minute here.
-Guess who that is?
-Who?
You remember?
You're gonna lose.
Stilwell, angel!
My goodness!
Where's your mom?
Mom died a couple of years ago.
I'm sorry.
She was a real nice lady.
And a damn fine ballplayer.
When I heard about this, I felt like I owed it to her to be here.
She always said it was the best time she had in her whole life.
Come here.
Recognize yourself?
-Can I get one of these?
-Sure.
Ladies!
It's a pleasure to welcome you here today.
It's taken years, but you are the first women ever to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame!
-And now--
-Wait.
Wait a minute.
This really isn't right.
Mr. Lowenstein since you kept the league going all those years you do it.
-There you go, Ira.
-Thank you, Bob.
Ladies it's my honour.
Mr. Capadino, look!
That's when you changed my life, honey!
Stilwell, angel, smile!
Batter up
Hear that call
The time has come
For one and all
To play
Ball
We're the members of
The All-American League
We come from cities
Near and far
We've got Canadians
Irish ones and Swedes
We're all for one We're one for all
We're All-Americans ls that you, Grandma?
I'm so glad you came.
Hi, Aunt Dottie.
Take a picture.
Let's take a picture of the whole team.
The original Peaches!
Strike!
That was clear inside.
It was clear inside, clear inside.
-l told you three times.
-That's my opinion.
Yesterday or tomorrow, that might've been a ball but today, it was a strike!
You might need that.
Where"d you find this?
It was in one of those cartons.
Needs oil.
Who doesn"t?
You ready?
-l"m not going.
-Mom!
I"ve got two children, I don"t need a third.
Why is it so important that I go?
For one thing, it"d be nice if you just left the room.
Besides, these are your old friends.
They probably won"t remember me.
The ""Queen of Diamonds,"" Dottie Hinson?
Margaret, it just isn"t a good idea.
Come on, Mom.
You"ll get to see Aunt Kit.
-You never see each other.
-We still won"t.
She"ll be traveling around with that husband of hers.
Frank.
He has a name.
He"s always been very nice to you.
He makes me nervous.
There"s a lot of reasons why I can"t go.
Honey I"m not comfortable about this.
I"m not really part of it.
It was never that important.
It was just something I did.
When will you realize how special it was, how much it all meant?
I know how you feel. I really do.
But you"re going.
Car.
-Car, train, bus. I"m tired already.
-Sleep on the plane.
Grandma"s out.
is there a fire?
Wisenheimer.
Julie"s watching you.
I don"t want any bad reports.
-Bye, Grandma.
-Bye.
Jeffrey, come here.
No matter what your brother does, he"s littler than you.
Give him a chance to shoot.
Promise?
Bobby, come here.
Kill him.
Come on, you"ll miss your plane.
I still think I shouldn"t go.
Get a hit, Beans!
I"m coming, Mae!
I"m coming!
This week in the world of sports.
With the boys overseas and off to war baseball pitches in for the war effort.
Trading bats for bullets, Yankee Joe DiMaggio promises to give those Nazis a jolt.
Ace fireballer Bob Feller has traded Cleveland gray for Navy blue.
Baseball"s biggest stars say ""Look out, Mr. Hitler.
The Yanks are coming. ""
Not to mention the Indians, Red Sox and Tigers.
And they won"t come back till it"s over, over there.
Meanwhile, Chicago club owner Walter Harvey, the candy-bar king met with other team owners at the Harvey Mansion as rumours persist that baseball may be shut down for the duration of the war.
Harvey"s promotional whiz kid, Ira Lowenstein has been given the job of figuring out how to keep baseball going.
Good luck, Mr. Lowenstein.
Strike 2!
Hey, fatso!
Get the hell out of the way!
What are you, crazy?
Strike 3!
Kit!
-Sis, don"t swing at her high pitch.
-l can hit it.
-You can"t.
-l can.
This bat"s too heavy.
You"ll never get it around.
I will!
Listen.
There"s a big hole on the right side.
Don"t look.
-Unless she pitches inside, pull it.
-l know.
Batter up!
No high ones.
I like the high ones!
-Mule!
-Nag!
Come on, Kit.
Keep your eye on the ball.
Strike 1 !
Strike 2!
Too high.
All right, Kit.
Look it over!
Look it over there!
Strike 3!
All right, 2 outs, everybody.
Two away!
Better luck next time!
Knock it out of here!
Okay, Dottie!
Batter up!
Right in here!
Bring them in there, Dottie!
Ball!
Keep your eye on it, Dottie!
One hit and we win!
That"s it, Dottie!
You did it!
That"s the ball game!
Hey, Kit!
What are you swinging those high ones for?
Good thing your sister bailed you out.
How about the two bucks you owe me for this game?
Kit!
Wait up, I"ll give you a ride!
Stop kicking the rocks.
I"m sorry.
-That game just made me so mad.
-We won.
Get mad if we lose.
That last pitch was right down the middle.
If I"d have swung at that, I"d be the hero.
-You got me so crazy-- -l only said lay off the high ones.
""Good thing your sister bailed you out.""
"" Kit, why don"t you get your sister to teach you how to hit?""
""Why can"t you be beautiful like your sister?""
What idiot said that?
No one.
-But that"s what they were thinking.
-No, it"s not!
You ever hear Dad introduce us to people?
""This is our daughter Dottie.
This is our other daughter, Dottie"s sister.""
Should"ve just had you and bought a dog.
-Mitch Swaley likes you.
-He"s one step up from dating pigs.
But an important step.
-Why are you walking so fast?
-Why are you?
-Because you are.
-Can"t even let me walk faster than you?
Girls, you got chores to do.
Don"t run!
You"ll scare the chickens!
I don"t have time for these games.
-Why are you running?
-You can go faster than that.
Your legs are longer.
-l win!
-Barely.
Hey!
Hey, yourself.
Doesn"t that hurt them?
Doesn"t seem to.
It would bruise the hell out of me.
Who are you?
I"m Ernie Capadino, baseball scout.
I saw you playing today.
Not bad, not bad.
Ever hear of Walter Harvey?
Harvey Bars?
You know, the candy?
Yeah, we feed them to the cows when they"re constipated.
He"s starting a girls" baseball league so we can make a buck while the boys are overseas.
Wanna play?
Nice retort.
Tryouts are in Chicago.
It"s a real league, professional.
Professional baseball?
They"ll pay you $75 a week.
We only make $30 at the dairy.
Then this would be more, wouldn"t it?
Interested?
Come on. $75 a week?
Pull her leg.
Mine are long enough.
Look, your country needs you.
You can not only play ball, but you"re kind of a dolly.
Oh, now I get it.
Listen, mister.
I"m a married woman.
My husband"s overseas.
Oh, relax!
I"m talking lookie, no touchie.
We want girls easy on the eye.
I"ll go. I"m ready now.
I gotta sign something?
I don"t want you!
I want her!
The one who hit the ball!
You can climb back under the cow.
She"s good.
She"s very good.
She pitches.
She didn"t today, because she did yesterday.
Thanks for that special glimpse into her life.
I want you.
You I saw, you I like.
The train leaves for Chicago tomorrow.
What do you say?
Are you in?
No, thanks.
"" No, thanks""?
Hey, no skin off my Ashtabula.
If you wanna pluck cows, that"s your business.
You know something?
You"re not nice.
That one hurt.
So long, milkmaids.
No, wait!
Just watch me pitch.
Dottie, get your mitt!
I"ll throw him a few.
Now look I know the goods when I see the goods, and she"s the goods.
I"m sorry.
Will you shut up?
!
You"re a pitcher, huh?
I"ll tell you what.
If she comes, you can come too.
If you stink, it only costs us the train ticket.
Get these wild animals away from me!
Haven"t you ever heard of a leash?
Come on, Dottie.
You got the whole rest of your life to hang around here.
Never go anywhere.
Never do anything.
I"m married. I"m happy.
It"s what I want.
Don"t confuse things.
But can"t you just have this first?
Just so you can say you once did something?
Something special?
Goodness sake, Kit!
Keep your voice down.
Your father"s listening to the radio.
Please, Dottie?
I gotta get out of here.
I"m nothing here.
In the Pacific Northwest, my territory we have increased sales 1 06% in the last 1 2-month period.
And this with a war on!
You know, if I had your job, I"d kill myself.
Sit here. I"ll see if I can dig up a pistol.
Every trip I take, I gotta sit next to one of these guys.
I"m just too friendly.
Hey, isn"t that--?
Well, I"ll say one thing for them.
They can run.
Mr. Capadino!
I got her!
Look!
-Sir, your knee.
-Like it?
Stop the train!
Come on!
Come on!
Give me that bag!
Did you promise the cows you"d write?
When do we get to Chicago?
We gotta make a stop.
Fort Collins, Colorado.
Gotta look at another girl.
Hope you"re not jealous.
I"m sorry.
It"s okay, honey.
That was good form.
Thattagirl!
Good, honey.
Good.
Nice, nice.
That"s a rope, honey.
Good girl.
Good, good.
Right, too high.
She"s got an eye like DiMaggio.
Okay, Marla.
Now lefty.
She"s really good.
She"s your daughter?
Her mom"s dead.
It"s just the two of us.
Coach said if she was a boy, she"d go to the state tournament.
I said, "" lf she was a boy, I"d talk to the Yankees instead of living here.""
That"s enough.
You can bring her over.
Okay, Marla.
Come here.
Boys!
Hit the showers!
Take off your hat, honey.
We"ll let you know.
Daddy, I"m sorry.
Let"s go.
We"ll miss the train.
Let"s move, move, move!
What"s the matter?
I can"t use her.
She"s great.
Why not?
What"s the problem?
You know General Omar Bradley?
There"s too strong a resemblance.
You ain"t taking her because she ain"t pretty?
Well, look who just caught up!
All right.
Come on, let"s go.
Pick those suitcases up!
Come on!
I"m not kidding.
Move!
-One foot in front of the other.
-Mister?
I know my girl ain"t so pretty as these girls.
But that"s my fault.
I raised her like I would a boy.
I didn"t know any better.
She loves to play.
Don"t make my girl suffer because I messed up raising her.
Please?
I wish you had a decent mitt.
I think maybe I"d better not go.
No, you can relace it.
It"ll be okay.
I mean, who"s gonna take care of you?
Cook?
Help you take care of the equipment?
Don"t you worry about me.
You"ll play baseball.
I"m not gonna know anybody.
Nothing"s ever gonna happen here.
You gotta go where things happen.
I love you, Daddy.
Let"s go, let"s go.
Come on, honey.
Are you coming?
See, how it works is, the train moves, not the station.
This is making me sick.
Write to me, honey.
I love you.
Hey, cowgirls, see the grass?
Don"t eat it.
Okay, girls, this is it.
Harvey Field.
Tryouts.
Get out there.
Show them what you got.
Don"t embarrass me.
It"s been a thin slice of heaven.
Goodbye.
Wait.
You"re going?
Dry your eyes.
I"m going home.
Grab a shower and a shave.
Give the wife a pickle-tickle, and I"m on my way. I"ll see you.
-But--
-But what?
Field!
Tryouts!
Play!
That"s it!
Get lost!
I hate when they get attached to me like that.
-Hey, Mae.
-What?
-Come look at this.
-Wait a second, Doris.
I can"t wait much longer, so get up.
Yeah, so?
Yeah, so I ain"t done yet.
Watch this.
-That"s it?
-You can"t do it, Mae.
I could do it.
How long you been working on that, Doris?
Took me a year.
Not counting the two months I was in the hospital.
Bat hit me right in the head.
Your head and not your behind?
That looks really swollen.
-What kind of thing is that to say?
-l"m joking, okay?
I"m nervous.
-What are you looking at?
-Yeah, what?
Nothing.
That"s right, nothing.
All these girls gonna be in the league?
-You wish.
-You do wish.
-Four teams.
Sixteen girls to a team.
-That"s right.
Sixty-four girls.
What are you, a genius?
They got over 100 girls here, so some of youse will have to go home.
-Sorry about that.
-Come on, Doris.
What do you mean, ""some of us""?
-Okay, some of them are going home.
-How"d you do that?
Excuse me.
You caught that.
Hello?
Let"s go practice.
She caught it with her bare hand.
And now, from Chicago, The Mutual presents another social commentary by Miss Maida Gilespie.
Careers and higher education are leading to the masculinization of women with enormously dangerous consequences to the home, the children and our country.
When our boys come home from war what kind of girls will they be coming home to?
And now, the most disgusting example of this sexual confusion, Mr. Walter Harvey, of Harvey Bars is presenting us with women"s baseball.
Right here in Chicago, young girls plucked from their families are gathered at Harvey Field to see which one of them can be the most masculine.
Mr. Harvey, like your candy bars, you are completely nuts.
ery good.
Try another.
Nice throw!
Your name will be on one of those five lists.
Okay, find your name.
If we could just form two or three parallel lines....
l"m a Peach!
A Rockford Peach!
I made it!
I can stay!
Are you a newspaper guy?
This is my friend Mae.
She made the team.
Come on, we got a lot to do.
Let"s settle down.
Now, you"re the first--
Honey, are you supposed to be here, or are you on the cut list?
Look, I"m sorry.
If you"re on the cut list, you have to leave the field.
Well, are you cut?
Look on the list. lt"s either Rockford, Racine, Kenosha or South Bend.
Can you read, honey?
No.
All right, what"s your name?
Shirley Baker.
Let"s just take a look.
This is you.
You"re with us.
You"re a Rockford Peach.
Go join your team.
Settle down.
We got a lot to go over.
First, congratulations.
You are the first members of the All-American Girls" Baseball League.
I"m Charlie Collins.
I"ll be managing the Racine team when the season starts.
The other teams will have managers soon.
At the end of practice today you all have to get fitted for your uniforms.
And this is what they"ll look like.
Pretty darn nifty, if you ask me.
You can"t slide in that.
That"s a dress.
It"s half a dress.
That"s not a baseball uniform.
What do you think we are, ballplayers or ballerinas?
It"s awfully short.
Short?
I"m gonna have to squat in that thing.
I can"t!
My husband will kill me.
Ladies!
Excuse me.
You can"t play ball in this, you can"t play ball with us.
There are 38 girls getting tickets home who"ll play in a bathing suit if I ask.
There"s no pockets for my cigarettes.
There is no smoking.
There is also no drinking and no men.
Your social engagements will be cleared through your team chaperones.
You"ll have regular classes at charm and beauty school.
For what?
Every girl in this league will be a lady.
And gracefully and grandly.
Gracefully and grandly.
All right, now go back!
And sip.
Down.
Don"t slurp.
Sip.
Down.
Don"t slurp.
Stop that!
It"s good.
Posture!
Heads up.
Backs straight.
And sit.
Right over left.
Legs always together.
A lady reveals nothing.
The hair.
Soften and shorten.
The eyebrows.
Thin and separate.
There should be two.
ery nice.
ery nice!
Lovely!
What do you suggest?
A lot of night games.
I wanna show you the grounds.
You know, I always--
Jimmy, come on.
I"m showing you around.
Beautiful, huh?
Place used to be a golf course.
I never cared for the game, but I love grass.
It costs a fortune, with the mowing and trimming.
But I grew up in an apartment.
I had one lousy plant in a cheese box.
Now look. I got a park.
These are my in-laws.
Hello!
They can"t hear nothing.
Enough socializing.
Jimmy, I"m thinking of giving you another managing job.
Mr. Harvey, I guarantee I"ll do a better job than last time.
You kind of let me down on that San Antonio job.
I had no right to sell off the team"s equipment like that.
It won"t happen again.
Let me be blunt.
Are you still a fall-down drunk?
Well, that is blunt.
No, sir. I"ve quit drinking.
You"ve seen the error of your ways?
No, I just can"t afford it.
That"s funny to you?
Your drinking is funny?
You"re a young man.
You still could be playing if you just would"ve laid off the booze.
Well, it"s not exactly like that.
I hurt my knee.
You fell out of a hotel.
That"s how you hurt it!
There was a fire.
Which you started, which I paid for.
I was gonna send you a thank-you card, but I wasn"t allowed anything sharp to write with.
I want you to manage one of the new girls" baseball teams.
Don"t look so stunned.
Face it.
You"re still a name.
You step out of the dugout before every game.
You wave your little hat.
You give the people a thrill.
Get an organ grinder.
I can hop around and dance.
If your knees are up to it, go ahead.
Mr. Harvey I hit 487 home runs for your baseball club.
Three in the World Series, two in game 4 alone.
I know that.
That"s why I"m giving you this job.
Take it or leave it.
I gotta feed the fish.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the first game of the All-American Girls" Baseball League!
The South Bend Blue Sox against your own Rockford Peaches.
-Where is he?
-l can"t believe he"s our manager.
I was listening to the radio when he hit that home run to win the pennant.
I"m asking him to sign my husband"s baseball card.
Do you mind?
Could I take a look at that?
Just be careful with it.
If anything happens, he"ll come back from the Pacific and kill me.
-Mr.
Dugan--
-Mr.
Dugan, I"m simply....
Do something, Mae.
Time him.
Give me your watch.
Could be a record.
That counts.
How long?
I ain"t gonna ask you again.
Shut up, Doris.
Keep timing.
Hey, Mae, how long?
Boy, that was some good peeing.
Hey, coach.
Mr. Dugan?
Could you sign my husband"s baseball card for me?
Great to meet you!
What"ll we do?
He didn"t give us a lineup.
We can"t play without one.
I"ll pitch. I can pitch.
-l thought I was playing centre field.
-No, I am.
Hey, you guys.
Come on.
How hard can it be to make a lineup?
Oh, yeah?
Why don"t you do it, Oregon?
-Me?
-Yeah, you.
All right.
Mae, centre field, lead off.
She"s good.
And now, the manager of the Peaches former six-time National League Home Run Champ Jimmy Dugan!
Jimmy, look up here!
We love you!
Bullshit.
You can all kiss my ass.
That"s right.
Kiss my big hairy ass.
And the Rockford Peaches!
Doris Murphy takes the field!
Lift up your skirt!
This"ll be something.
Ain"t too many people here.
-You nervous, Doris?
-Yeah.
I ain"t.
-Are they laughing at us?
-Yeah, they"re laughing at us.
-They hate us.
-Just keep smiling.
Hey, glamour puss!
Can you throw the ball?
All right, ladies, let"s play ball!
-Let"s play ball.
-Dirt in the skirt!
And now, the lineup for Rockford:
Leading off and playing centre field, number 5, Mae Mordabito!
Batting second and playing 3rd base, number 22, Doris Murphy!
Batting third, the catcher, number 8, Dottie Hinson!
Batting fourth and playing 2nd base, number 32, Marla Hooch.
Girls can"t play ball!
Batting fifth....
Look at me!
I"m a ballplayer!
Better look out, I might break a nail!
--number 1 , Ellen Sue Gotlander.
-lt slipped!
-Batting ninth, pitcher number 23, Kit Keller!
Count"s 2 balls and no strikes to Rockford"s big catcher, Dottie Hinson.
And it"s in the dirt. 3 and 0.
Let"s see if Jimmy Dugan gives her the green light on 3 and 0 or gives her the take sign.
Game"s tied 2-2, the bottom of the 9th with two runners in scoring position and only 1 out.
From the belt, here"s the delivery.
Oh, baby!
She hit the cream cheese out of that one!
Jimmy Dugan, master strategist, had her swinging away!
He sure knows his baseball.
Come on, Dottie!
Make me proud!
A 3-run clout for Dottie Hinson and Rockford wins it, 5 to 2.
Dottie, ladies and gentlemen!
Dottie!
I couldn"t believe you hit it right out there!
Can we have your autograph?
Can we, Jimmy?
Not today, boys.
Come back next game.
Nice piece of coaching.
Especially in the 5th inning when you scratched your balls for an hour.
Anything worth doing is worth doing right.
Yes, indeed.
Until you did that, I couldn"t tell if you were drunk or dead.
It was made very clear to me what I"m supposed to do here.
I smile wave my little hat, and I did that.
So when do I get paid?
You have some good ballplayers.
If you"ll only--
Ballplayers!
I haven"t got ballplayers!
I"ve got girls!
Girls are what you sleep with after the game, not what you coach during it.
If we paid you more, could you be just a little more disgusting?
I could certainly use the money.
On the home front they find them everywhere North, East, South and West, and even Canada.:
Players for the new All-American Girls" Baseball League.
After a month of play the shine still isn"t off these Diamond Gals.
Alice ""Skeeter"" Gaspers says ""Legging out a triple is no reason to let your nose get shiny. ""
Betty Grable has nothing on these gals.
Helen Haley has not only been on several championship amateur teams she"s also an accomplished coffeemaker.
With her husband in the Pacific Betty Horn enjoys cooking spaghetti and knitting.
Her teammates call her ""Betty Spaghetti. ""
Ellen Sue Gotlander is a former Miss Georgia.
Then there"s pretty Dottie Hinson who plays like Gehrig and looks like Garbo.
Fellas, keep your mitts to yourselves.
She"s married.
And there"s her kid sister Kit, who"s as single as they come.
Enough concentrated ""oomph"" for a whole carload of Hollywood starlets.
And how about Marla Hooch?
What a hitter!
What a lead!
But girls playing baseball?
-Enjoy that?
-Yeah!
Good.
Come back next game, will you?
I"m Evelyn Gardner.
I play right field.
For us.
I just spoke to my husband last night.
He says I can"t leave our son with him at home anymore.
See, he says he"s too busy reading the want ads and I should just take him with me and shut up about it.
So can I?
Take my son with me on road trips?
Ballplayers...!
He"s the sweetest little boy.
Everyone"s just gonna love him.
Get this brat off of me!
That"s it!
I quit!
Stilwell, angel, come to Mommy.
-You"re too young to drive.
-l will.
Watch.
Evelyn!
I"m sorry, but I"m gonna have to kill your son!
Wait!
The girls have a game!
You can"t leave us like this!
Please, Mr. Goosatelli!
Get over here, Stilwell!
I"m gonna kill you!
You can"t catch me!
Don"t use my bat, use Marla"s!
It"s heavier!
-Evelyn, why is he so wild?
-l don"t know.
Stilwell, angel, have another chocolate bar.
Gimme!
Gimme!
You can"t leave us like this.
We"re in the middle of nowhere!
-We can"t be here!
-No!
Keep him away from me!
He"s really a sweetie, Dottie.
-l hope I have five just like him.
-Don"t eat the wrapper, honey.
-You gonna come?
-Where you going?
A roadhouse called the Suds Bucket.
No, I"m married. I"m....
Come on, you ain"t on the farm anymore.
Live a little bit.
Girls!
Please!
Mr. Goosatelli shan"t be returning.
How you gonna get past Miss Cuthbert?
Mae"s gonna poison her dinner.
What is it, baby?
What the hell is going on?
!
Why are we stopped?
Lou quit.
Who"s Lou?
The driver.
A car could"ve came by now.
-Get on the bus!
-Was that English?
I loved you in The Wizard of Oz.
In the 43 years I"ve practised medicine, I never saw a woman throw up that much.
Maybe that"s how she entertains herself, doc.
Hurry!
Come on!
Quiet!
Mae, what did you give her?
Who cares?
It"s working.
I"m going, baby!
Come on, way to go, Mae!
I"m coming in!
Catch me!
Did you see me, Kit?
I pretzeled!
-How"d you learn to do that?
-She taught me.
My father owns a dance hall, upstate.
innie"s Dance Girls Deluxe.
She was a dancer, I was a bouncer.
You were great!
-Thanks for the ride, kid.
-What"s your rush, dollbody?
What do you say we slip in the back seat and you make a man out of me?
What do you say I smack you around?
Can"t we do both?
No, I"m not hot. lt"s fine.
It"s really cold.
-That"s better.
-Where"s Kit?
I think she"s on the dance floor.
There she is.
I got my truck parked outside.
Sorry, we gotta go.
Come on.
Alice, come on.
We gotta go.
We got trouble.
-l knew it.
You killed Miss Cuthbert.
-We"ll bury her. I know a guy--
Lowenstein"s coming.
He catches us, we"re out of the league.
Let"s make like a bread truck and haul buns, ladies.
Let"s duck out the back door.
is this all?
Marla didn"t come?
She came.
Well, where is she?
There.
Thinkin" of you
Some others I"ve seen
What did you do to her?
We just gave her a dress.
And a lot of liquor!
You guys go ahead. I"ll get Marla.
Hurry up, ladies!
Thanks.
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
It had to be you
It had to be you
Marla, honey?
We gotta go.
I"m singing to Nelson!
Ain"t l, baby?
You sure are.
I could take her home.
It"d be an honour.
Ain"t he something?
Could make me be blue
That"s the second time he dropped that Bible since she"s been in there.
Come on, girls.
Mae, what"d you say?
Everything.
"" Here"s a good job for you, Jimmy.
Managing girl ballplayers.
You go out there and you wave your little hat around.
Don"t drink!""
Why would I want to drink?
I"m a goddamn Peach!
God, double play.
Now I"m hitting like a girl.
"" But be nice to them.
They"re good ballplayers.""
There, catch that, blondie!
Now batting for the Rockford Peaches number 5, centre fielder Mae Mordabito!
Here"s the pitch.
There"s a shot into right centre!
It"s up the alley!
She"s turning around 1 st!
She"s digging up the dirt!
She"s heading past 2nd.
She"s heading into 3rd!
Dirt in the skirt, Mae!
Dirt in the skirt!
-Safe!
-She"s in there with a triple!
Boy, did she smack that one right on the kisser.
No wonder they call her ""All-the-Way"" Mae.
Triple.
Next batter number 32, 2nd baseman, Marla Hooch.
Evelyn, look at this!
I"ve got Stilwell"s snack on my cleat!
What are you, stupid?
Somebody"s gotta run the team.
Someone who actually watches the games.
You"re gonna squeeze bunt with our best hitter?
What"s the sign to swing away?
Hey, blond girl!
What"s the sign?
It"s the letters.
A squeeze"ll work.
Stop thinking with your tits.
Batter!
Time!
Come on!
Who is the goddamn manager here?
I am!
Then act like it, you big lush!
-You tell him, Dottie!
-About time someone told him.
-l"m ready now.
-Play ball!
Way to go, whatever your name is!
Good bluff!
But I still say you"re not ballplayers.
Cemetery boneyard!
Cross your fingers or you"ll never get another hit.
Sound it out.
Kimono.
Kimono off and gra-bed...
Grabbed.
...her milky milky white....
What are you giving her to read?
What"s the difference?
She"s reading.
That"s the important thing.
Go away!
Go!
Shoo!
Go ahead, Shirley.
Thanks.
Milky white breasts.
It gets really good after that.
-A delivery boy walks in....
-What are you doing?
I"m writing a song.
Really?
What"s it about?
About us.
Could you teach it to me?
Doris, is this your boyfriend?
is it out of focus?
No, that"s how he looks.
Looks aren"t the most important thing.
Right.
The important thing is he"s stupid, out of work and treats me bad.
Then why...?
Why?
What do you think?
Because none of the other boys ever....
Always made me feel like I was wrong.
Like I was some sort of a weird girl or a strange girl or not even a girl, just because I could play.
I believed them too.
But not anymore.
I mean, look.
There"s a lot of us.
I think we"re all all right.
We are.
Give me that.
So long, Charlie!
So with 2 runs in the 6th, South Bend gets even.
I"ve gotta go!
I"ve gotta go!
You shake it off.
Shake it off.
Say, Evelyn, can I ask you a question?
Which team do you play for?
-l"m a Peach.
-Well, I was just wondering because I couldn"t figure out why you"d throw home when we"ve got a 2-run lead!
You let the tying run get on 2nd, and we lost the lead!
You start using your head!
That"s that lump that"s three feet above your ass!
Are you crying?
Are you crying?
There"s no crying!
There"s no crying in baseball!
Leave her alone, Jimmy.
You zip it, Doris!
Rogers Hornsby, my manager, called me a ""talking pile of pig shit"" !
That was when my parents came from Michigan to see me play the game!
And did I cry?
No!
Do you know why?
Because there"s no crying in baseball.
No crying in baseball!
No crying!
What"s the matter?
She"s crying, sir.
I didn"t mean to do that.
Perhaps you chastised her too vehemently.
Good rule of thumb:
Treat each of them as you would your mother.
Anyone ever tell you you look like a penis with a hat on?
You"re out of here!
-l heard that!
-You misunderstood.
-Ten seconds!
-You misunderstood!
You can"t throw me out knowing you"ve got a strike!
Off this field!
I can"t believe no one ever called you that before!
That"s where you belong.
I"m in charge now.
The crowd"s light today, what with the tractor show in town.
If you"re nearby, and you must be, since this isn"t a powerful radio station...
People better start showing up.
We don"t have fans, we don"t have a league.
Ladies you all look wonderful.
There"s a reporter and a photographer in the stands from Life magazine.
-We"re famous!
-Life magazine?
Don"t waste your time.
Dottie, I"m trying to get them to do a story about you.
Me?
Why me?
You"re the ""Queen of Diamonds."" That"s what I"m calling you.
Did you tell them about me?
I told them how at first, the scout didn"t even want you but how Dottie wouldn"t come without her kid sister.
They really loved it.
A real human-interest story.
Will you just try to give them something spectacular out there?
Anything.
What"s the matter?
Well, we"re not doing so well.
Harvey and the other owners think they"ve made a mistake.
They might close you down.
What are you talking about?
They can"t close us down here.
-What kind of a thing is that?
-What"s it mean?
They"re businessmen.
No profit, no product.
And what am I supposed to do?
Go back to taxi dancing?
Ten cents so some slob can sweat gin all over me?
I"m never doing that again!
So you tell old rich Mr. Chocolate Man that he ain"t closing me down!
They can"t keep us from playing!
We"ll show them how we play.
I"m sorry. I"m very sorry.
I am trying my best.
So will you just give them everything you"ve got?
We always do.
A slick play by Alice Gaspers and there"s 2 gone in the 3rd.
That"ll bring up Dee Lynch.
Lynch is the most consistent Belles hitter this year.
Settles in.
Pops it up!
Foul.
Hinson should have no trouble with this.
She"s under it.
Uncle Elmore"s socks!
What did she do?
I can"t do that.
Who can?
-What is her name?
-Dottie Hinson.
D-O-T-T-l-E....
What the hell was that?
I just thought it might help the league.
A goddamn circus!
A double would be nice--
All right!
God knows we have a game.
It"s not like any of this helps, believe me.
That was really nice!
Let"s go, girls.
Dozens of people are waiting for the game to start.
Batter!
What is her name?
Hey you, tall girl!
Beverly!
Look sharp, tall-- What is her name?
Beverly.
Good.
Five bucks!
Five bucks!
What if, at a key moment in the game, my uniform bursts open and my bosoms fly out?
That might draw a crowd, right?
Think there"s men who ain"t seen your bosoms?
Thank you.
-Marla, what you got?
-What about me?
I got a letter from Nelson!
Fly ball as Dottie Hinson brings the crowd to its feet with a home run!
22!
We love you, 22!
-Come on!
-Open your mouth!
The kid ate the lineup!
Right here.
I"m so happy!
Thank you.
I love you.
I"ll be back next season.
See you next season!
Slide!
Slide!
Safe!
Thank you!
Let it up.
Let it up.
That was a good one.
It"s a fly ball to left!
Betty Spaghetti makes the catch!
Heads up!
Spaghetti makes the throw!
It"s gonna be close!
Aunt Edna"s bridgework!
She is out!
Dottie Hinson held onto the ball!
Oh, doctor!
A lot of ballplayers use it.
High foul pop.
It"s coming back!
She caught it!
Unbelievable!
Full house on its feet cheering Dottie Hinson!
That sounded good.
-You haven"t got a curve ball left.
-l don"t?
!
You haven"t had one since--
Safe!
Safe!
He"s good-looking.
-What"s he do when not in the Army?
-Dairy assistant manager.
He"ll be manager.
He"s smart.
So he"s good-looking and smart.
There"s so few of us.
Where did you say he was?
Italy?
I think. I haven"t got a letter from him in three weeks.
I used to get one every week.
That doesn"t mean anything.
If he"s in combat, it"s not like there"s a mailbox on every corner.
If something happened, you would"ve got a telegram.
Oh, God, don"t--
But he"s fine.
No, he"s fine.
How come you"re not in the Army?
I have no cartilage in my knee.
You don"t need it to shoot Nazis.
You need this, right?
Trigger finger.
I could do that.
How did I get so useless so fast?
Boys like this on your fingers?
Works for me.
Your sister"s not gonna be mad?
I don"t care.
Listen, when...
-Bob.
-...
Bob comes back will you keep playing?
You could just quit?
Sure.
You play like you love it.
-Does he know how good you are?
-Bob?
No, Hitler.
Yes, Bob.
How good am I?
You stink.
You"re lousy.
You"re only the best player in the league.
You don"t know that?
You ever been married?
Let me think.
Yeah, twice.
Any children?
One of them was.
is she out?
I think it"s time for a drink.
Hang on.
Hang on.
These really don"t mix.
-Good, huh?
-Oh, yeah.
It"s great.
Fair ball!
Time!
Jimmy Dugan pops his head out of the dugout.
He"s on his way to talk to his hurler.
Kit Keller looks mighty tired.
Game"s getting exciting.
I"ll finish it right here.
I"ll strike this turkey out.
Betty"s ready to come in.
Come on. I"ve never been taken out before.
Ask Dottie.
I really wanna finish this game.
Please?
What do you think?
Well, you know, she"s battling.
What do you think?
She"s throwing grapefruits.
It looks like Keller"s coming out of the game, and she is not happy about it!
Nice job, Kit!
Betty Horn sprints in from the left-field bullpen.
Look at this crowd.
This is great!
They"re jumping, cheering and they paid to get in.
You did a fabulous job.
I won"t forget this.
Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey.
I appreciate it, coming from you.
But to be perfectly honest, I think the girls deserve most of the credit.
They"re great.
Fortunately, we won"t need them anymore.
Do you want a peanut?
No.
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We"re winning the war.
Our situation changed.
Roosevelt himself said, "" Men"s baseball won"t be shut down.""
So we won"t need the girls next year.
Bases loaded.
Bottom of the 9th.
Rockford up, 6 to 2.
Two men out.
No balls, 2 strikes.
Strike 3!
And that is the ball game!
Rockford is in the playoffs!
I love these girls.
I don"t need them, but I love them.
Come on.
Let"s go.
Look at me. I"m full of peanuts!
I"ve got peanuts all over myself.
This is what it"s gonna be like in the factories too.
"" Men are back.
Turn in your rivets.""
First, it was their patriotic duty to get out and go to work.
When the men come back, they"re sent back to the kitchen.
Should we send the boys returning from war back to the kitchen?
Come on.
Do you know how dedicated they are?
What they go through?
They play with sprained ankles, broken fingers.
They ride a bus all night to play a double-header the next day!
I"ll make it up to them.
What?
With Harvey Bars?
I"m getting tired of listening to you, Ira.
I"d like your permission to take over the league.
Do you understand?
All of the owners are getting out.
There"s no point to it anymore.
Just let them finish the season, and that"s it!
I sold your product when there was no product.
This is a product!
There is no room for girls" baseball in this country once the war is over.
They"re through.
I think you"re wrong.
And I"m gonna prove it to you, Mr. Harvey!
Hi, my name"s Mae.
That"s more than a name, that"s an attitude.
Here"s my friend Doris.
Best player on the team.
-Thank you.
-You"re the best.
-The game put us in the playoffs.
-l could"ve finished.
Stilwell could"ve hit off you.
What"s the matter?
Too big to finish your own games now?
Don"t start with me, Kit!
Don"t you start with me!
Kit, come on, cut it out!
What the hell are you doing?
!
-Get your sister off of her!
-Stay out of it!
You just wait, Doris!
Let me down!
Let me down!
You stay down there and you cool off!
-Why"d she do it?
-She was vulnerable.
You provoked her.
-Shut up, Helen!
-You"re making her more upset.
Really!
-l don"t need it from Helen.
-Take a shower.
-l"m not taking a shower.
-She reminds me of my husband.
Save some hot water for me, you guys.
You okay?
My rear end hurts where he dropped me.
You acted like a baby.
You treat me like one.
I treated you like a pitcher who"d lost her stuff.
When Betty"s in trouble, you back her up every pitch!
I seem to remember last week, somebody throwing a resin bag in my face.
Told me to get my fat ass behind the plate.
Was that you or the umpire?
You could"ve backed me up today instead of holding me back.
I hold you back?
It"s like at home.
It"s like if you"re here, then I"m not here.
What"s that mean?
I don"t know what I mean.
I know I"m wrong.
I know you"re right and I"m wrong.
I know that. I just-- l just get so mad!
Why do you gotta be so good?
Dottie, here you are.
You weren"t on the bus.
Can I speak to you a minute?
I have to leave.
Don"t worry.
The bus wouldn"t leave without you.
I"m leaving the team.
What?
-Why?
What-- -l have to go home.
Home?
You can"t go home now.
This couldn"t come at a worse time.
We"re in a bit of a crisis, and I have to try to pull something off.
It"s not a good time to lose our most popular player.
-What"s the problem?
-l don"t want to talk about it.
It"s personal?
It"s one of the girls, isn"t it?
It"s Mae, right?
Kit, that"s it.
I"ve noticed there"s some friction.
That"s fine.
No problem.
Doesn"t mean you have to quit.
I can arrange a trade.
Racine?
Kenosha?
South Bend?
Trade me or whatever.
But figure it out by tomorrow, or I"m going home.
Tomorrow?
Fine!
I"ll work everything out by tomorrow.
You really gave me a scare for a second.
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Mae, your date"s here.
-How do I look?
-Where"d you get that dress?
-Borrowed it.
-lt don"t fit.
Too tight.
I don"t plan on wearing it that long.
I don"t know why you get dressed at all.
Where"s Dottie?
In there.
Wanna go to the movies with me?
You bitch!
I"ve been traded to Racine!
You?
I told them to trade me.
They"d really trade you.
Miss Star, Miss Perfect.
You knew what would happen!
-l didn"t!
-This"ll be better than the movies.
-l"ll quit. ls that what you want?
-They"ll blame me for you quitting!
What do you want me to do?
Stay away from me.
Leave me alone!
That"s what I want you to do!
Kit, listen.
It was all a mistake.
A big mistake.
-l was getting too good.
-You won"t listen.
I knew if I did too good, you"d do something to push me down!
Kit, blow it out your rear end!
I"m sick of you blaming me.
I got you into this league!
She got her in the league!
-l didn"t wanna be here!
-Then why are you still here?
Kit wants to know why she"s playing.
My train leaves at 8.
I got 1 0 minutes to pack.
If you have trouble, you know who to blame.
See you in the World Series.
You bet you will.
Don"t look at her.
Has anyone seen my new red hat?
Piss on your hat!
Well, that seemed uncalled for.
Just keep it down.
-Kit"s off our team.
-She"s not!
Yes, she is.
Are you deaf?
You need any help in there?
Don"t act like this.
You"re still in the league.
You"re just on another team, that"s all.
Batter up
Hear that call
The time has come
For one and all
To play
Ball
For we"re the members of
The All-American League We come from cities
Near and far
We got Canadians
Irish ones and Swedes
We"re all for one, we"re one for all We"re All-Americans
Each girl stands Her head so proudly high
Her motto.:
Do or Die
She"s not the one to use Or need an alibi
Our chaperones are not too soft They"re not too tough
Our managers are on the ball
Miss Cuthbert....
You gorgeous stack of pancakes!
Man on the floor!
Already dressed.
Get Stilwell away.
I don"t know what he"s doing.
Get him away from the tapes!
Angel, come here now.
All right.
Everybody, let"s listen up.
I was in the toilet reading my contract, and it turns out I get a bonus when we get to the World Series.
Let"s play hard!
Play smart!
Use your heads!
That"s that lump three feet above our ass, right?
Some more prominent than others.
Come in.
Excuse me!
I got a telegram from the War Department.
Oh, my God!
Ernie!
Boy, I hate these.
These are the worst.
The Army could at least send someone to tell you your husband"s dead.
Darn!
I had the name right here!
I gotta go back and straighten this out.
Sorry.
-Just give me the telegram.
-l can"t. I don"t have a name.
Just give me the telegram.
This is official.
This is from the War Department!
Come on!
That"s official business!
I"m coming--
-l"m sorry, Betty.
-No, it"s George!
It"s George!
All right, come on.
We still got a game to play.
Come in.
Hi, cutie.
How did you...?
Bob!
Oh, my God!
What happened?
-l"m fine.
-What is it?
It was a sniper.
I was lucky though.
He got seven of us before we got him.
Oh, sweetie!
It"s all right. I made it.
I missed you so much.
I"ve been discharged.
I didn"t think I"d ever see you again.
It"s all over. I"m here, baby.
Well, listen.
You have to sit down here.
I"ll clear all this stuff off.
I almost forgot how beautiful you are.
-Oh, no. I look terrible!
-You look beautiful.
You"re the most beautiful thing I"ve ever seen.
I love you.
Can we just hold each other for the rest of our lives?
That"s my plan.
Why am I the only one on this bus?
What are we waiting for?
Are you physically unable to show up on time?
Coming, Jimmy.
If you think you can do without the batting practice, think again.
Not the way you hit.
Let"s not go to the World Series without Stilwell"s toys!
-Alice, what time is it where you live?
-lt"s bad luck to yell before a game.
-Could you sign my baseball?
-Sure.
""Avoid the clap.
Jimmy Dugan.""
That"s good advice!
Write to us.
We"ll miss you.
We will.
Thanks.
Good luck in the World Series.
Taking a little day trip?
Bob and I are driving home to Oregon.
I thought you were a ballplayer.
You were wrong.
Was I?
It is only a game.
It"s only a game, and I don"t need this.
I have Bob. I don"t need this.
I gave away five years at the end of my career to drinking.
Five years.
There isn"t anything I wouldn"t give to get back any one day of it.
Well, we"re different.
Chickenshit!
You wanna go home and make 1 00 babies, great.
I can"t tell anyone how to live.
But sneaking out like this, quitting....
You"ll regret it all your life.
Baseball is what gets inside you.
It"s what lights you up.
You can"t deny that.
It just got too hard.
It"s supposed to be hard.
If it wasn"t hard, everyone would do it.
The hard is what makes it great.
Everything all right?
Yeah, fine.
Fine.
Bye, Jimmy.
First game of the first women"s baseball World Series.
This is history in the making.
History in the making!
This is for you.
We brought you these also.
For me?
Thank them!
-Cut it out!
-l"m sorry.
Two box seats on the 3rd base line.
I got two box seats.
Who wants them?
-How much?
-1 0 bucks.
That"s my daughter, 3rd baseman, Doris Murphy.
Best one they got.
-Where you from?
-Staten Island.
After the game, I"m taking her out for a steak dinner.
All right, all right, all right!
Time for the song and dance.
What"s that smell?
Alice thinks it"s bad luck to change her socks.
So we all suffer?
Get away, get away.
Outfielders, play deep a few steps.
Don"t give up anything long.
Alice?
If the lead-off hitter gets on, they"re gonna bunt.
Be ready.
Now, I"d like to....
l"d like to lead you in prayer.
-Come on.
-A prayer?
Come on.
Yes, a little prayer.
Come on!
Come on!
In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost....
Lord hallowed be Thy name.
May our feet be swift.
May our bats be mighty.
May our balls be plentiful.
And, Lord I"d just like to thank you for that waitress in South Bend.
You know who she is.
She kept calling Your name.
And, God these are good girls, and they work hard.
Help them see it all the way through.
Okay, that"s it.
-Let"s go.
-Amen.
Go Peaches!
Last game.
Now or never, ladies.
Alice, you"re killing me.
You"re killing me, Alice!
You"re goddamn killing me!
And the rocket"s red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh, say does that star-spangled
Banner yet wave
O"er the land of the free
And the home of the brave
This is it, folks.
One game for the whole ball of string.
There is no tomorrow.
Someone will walk out league champions, and someone else will just walk out.
You"re gonna lose!
You"re gonna lose!
You keep that kid away from me for just one game!
Ellen Sue, how"s it looking?
-Good.
-Feeling good?
Looking good!
Nice and warm?
Good.
Alice, if Ellen Sue doesn"t have anything, don"t keep it a secret.
Tell me right away.
You understand me?
Do you hear me?
!
You"re screaming. I hear you.
Where"d you come from?
We got to Yellowstone and turned back.
Have trouble with the bears, did you?
I was fine until that scout walked into our barn. I"m no quitter.
Wait a minute!
Hold it!
Who said you could play?
Alice has been catching the last six games.
She looks pretty good.
You don"t want me to play?
Well, you"re already dressed.
Hell, if you want to play I don"t care.
You can play.
Well, then, I"ll play.
Good.
-Fine.
-Fine.
Go play.
You look like shit.
Don"t you ever shave?
We"re gonna win.
We"re gonna win!
You"re gonna lose!
You stink!
Got him!
Lineup change!
-lt"s okay.
-Evelyn, he deserved it.
Stilwell, you gonna stay out here or come in the dugout?
Strike!
Strike!
You"re out!
3!
Strike!
You"re out!
You"re out!
You"re out, Brenda!
You are out!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Good, Mae!
Good catch!
Thank goodness.
2 down!
2 down!
Base hit.
Gardner"s up with it.
Wallace"ll stop at 3rd.
Gardner"s throw is way off line!
Go!
Go!
All the way!
I"m sorry!
Shoot!
Wallace scampers home, and the Belles take the lead, 1 to nothing!
They"re dancing in the aisles here in Racine!
I know. I know.
You"re still missing the cutoff man.
That"s something I would like you to work on before next season.
All right.
Thanks.
Thank you, Mr. Dugan.
All right, let"s get this one!
All right, come on!
We need some runs out there.
Make something happen, Mae!
All-the-Way Mae!
-They love her.
-Let"s go, let"s go!
ery cute.
Thanks.
Safe!
She"s safe!
Way to play!
Way to run!
Way to make something happen!
Safe!
You get a hit, I"ll baby-sit that little porker!
Come on!
You"re out!
Come on!
Bring me home, Helen!
Out!
Peaches are down to their final out.
Only tying and go-ahead runs in scoring position.
Big Dottie Hinson striding to the plate.
Let"s get out of this inning!
Come on!
Throw smoke, Kit!
Throw smoke!
Here"s the pitch.
Bite me on the butt and call me an apple!
She nearly took her head off!
Mordabito scores!
Murphy, she will score!
Rockford has taken the lead, 2 to 1 !
That"s my wife!
One more!
Keep it going!
Put it past the little queen here.
Right past her!
There"s a fly ball to left field.
She"ll have to go for this one!
That"s the final out.
But the damage has been done.
Right here in Racine, Rockford leads our Belles, 2 to 1 as we go to the bottom of the 9th.
Come on, it"s okay.
You gotta bat now.
Relax!
One run and we are back in this ball game.
Shake it off.
You gotta hit.
It"s okay, Kit.
Strike her out!
Bad eye!
Bat at that, blond girl!
She drives it to deep centre!
Mordabito goes to the wall and makes the catch!
Beautiful catch!
Beautiful!
Gotlander"s pitch and it is in the dirt!
Ball 1 !
That looked good to me, Ellen Sue!
Shake that one off!
That ain"t nothing!
Gotlander, she delivers.
It"s a ground ball between 1 st and 2nd.
This ball is hot!
Hendricks will go up at 1 st with a base hit.
That"s all right. 1 down!
We got 1 down!
Let"s go!
Foul ball!
Hinson"s taking after it.
That does it!
Did she get it?
She got it!
She got it!
There"s no question who the star of this game is.
Dottie Hinson has her team 1 out from the title.
Come on, Kit, you"re up.
You"re the hitter now.
Let"s go.
The last batter standing in Rockford"s way is Kit Keller.
Kit is 1 for 3 today.
-Can I have time-out?
-Time!
High fastballs.
She can"t hit them, can"t lay off them.
All right.
All right, if we just hold them now, we got it!
Come on!
Come on, Ellen Sue!
One, two, three!
Play ball!
-Strike!
-Swing and a miss.
Strike 1 !
Yes!
Thank you, God!
Lay off the high ones!
Here"s the pitch.
Swing and a miss!
Strike 2!
One more!
One more!
Here"s the pitch.
It is a long fly ball.
Back, back, back.
It falls in there!
No one"ll get to this ball!
This should tie it up!
Hendricks is rounding 3rd!
She will score!
Keller to 3rd!
Gardner hits the relay man with a frozen rope!
The coach is giving Keller the stop sign at 3rd!
But she is not stopping!
She runs through the stop sign!
She is not stopping!
Here comes the throw!
It should be in time!
Safe!
She is safe!
I can"t believe it!
Hinson dropped the ball!
Hinson dropped the ball!
The ball game is over!
Racine has won the game, 3 to 2 and the World Series!
Take me home, Mama, and put me to bed!
I have seen enough to know I have seen too much!
You played a good game.
Well, what do you say?
All right, Ira.
We"ll stick with it.
My mother always used to say, "" lf at first you don"t succeed--""
You don"t have to spend six months in Saskatchewan.
-Alice, you told me it"s lovely.
-lf you like icicles.
I thought we were gonna win.
-We didn"t.
-Up to that last inning, we had it.
I"m so depressed, I could eat a cow.
It"s all right.
You did good.
Get dressed.
See you on the bus.
Thanks.
Wanna be a ballplayer when you get big?
-What"s your name?
-Angelina.
Gotta practice really hard.
What"s your name?
-How much?
-Help yourself.
Thank you.
-Hitting!
-You all like hitting better?
-What"s your name?
-Mary.
-Who you rooting for?
-Racine!
That"s what I thought you said.
You guys be good.
Get dirty.
-l"m sorry I knocked you over.
-No, you"re not.
You blocked the entire plate!
How do you--
You did what you had to.
You beat me.
You wanted it more than me.
I jammed my shoulder, if it makes you feel any better.
A little.
Bob and I are driving back to Oregon.
You"re welcome to come with us.
You two should be alone.
I"d just be in the way.
When will you be coming home?
Some of the girls talked about staying around here and getting jobs.
I really like it here.
Christmas?
I don"t know.
You"ll come back next year, right?
I wanna have kids.
We wanna have kids.
You got plenty of time to have kids.
You couldn"t give this up.
You"d miss it.
Miss it?
Miss putting on all this gear?
Catching a double-header in 100-degree heat?
Pushing the bus in mud?
Getting slammed into every other day by a base runner?
Think I"m gonna miss that?
I"ll tell you what I"ll miss.
I"ll miss the girls.
I"ll miss you.
Me?
How many sisters do you think I have?
I love you, Kit.
Really?
Just when I want you to stay, you"re leaving.
Thanks for getting me in the league.
You got yourself in the league.
I got you on the train.
Play great.
Like you.
You stay in touch.
Come home every once in a while.
If you don"t, I"ll come back and hit line drives at your head.
I love you.
And you are gonna miss this.
I don"t care what you say.
There"s the winner!
Good game, Jimmy.
Hi, I"m a big fan of yours.
I"m Dottie"s husband.
Well, then I"m a big fan of yours.
Old man Harvey just offered me a job managing next year in Wichita.
Triple A?
Great.
Good luck.
Turned him down.
Why?
What do you mean, why?
I already got a job.
I"ll see you.
Miss Cuthbert, save me my special seat, now, cutie!
Meet you at the hotel.
Did you see Mae"s catch, Dad?
I"d rather see you play ball instead of what you used to do.
What are you saying that for?
You make her feel bad!
Steak dinner.
On you. I"ll see you later.
Kit, over here!
Come on, let"s go!
That was Bob, huh?
Nice guy.
Lay off of those high ones.
I like the high ones.
-Mule!
-Nag!
Hey, Mae.
Come here.
-What do you want?
-Come here.
-What is it?
-Look at her.
It"s Dottie.
Hey, Doris.
Mae?
All-the-Way Mae?
-No one"s called me that since--
-Last night!
I"m a married woman now.
Yeah, about eight times.
Girls!
Look who"s here!
Shirley?
Helen Haley!
-lt"s Dr. Haley now. I"m a doctor.
-l always knew you would be.
-Who"s that?
-Dottie Hinson.
Betty Spaghetti?
Best ballplayer in the league.
-l don"t remember her.
-She only played one year.
Ellen Sue!
You haven"t changed one bit.
I married a plastic surgeon.
Having you here is good luck.
Thanks, Alice!
Marla!
I"m so glad you"re here.
-How"s...?
-Nelson?
He"s good.
He"s retired.
Our son runs the business.
How"s Bob?
He"s....
When?
Just this winter.
I"m sorry.
Oh, Shirley, I"m so excited.
I"ve got butterflies in my stomach!
They"ve got a ""Women ln Baseball"" thing up there. lsn"t it neat?
Baseball Hall of Fame.
I"m shaking.
Wait a minute here.
-Guess who that is?
-Who?
You remember?
You"re gonna lose.
Stilwell, angel!
My goodness!
Where"s your mom?
Mom died a couple of years ago.
I"m sorry.
She was a real nice lady.
And a damn fine ballplayer.
When I heard about this, I felt like I owed it to her to be here.
She always said it was the best time she had in her whole life.
Come here.
Recognize yourself?
-Can I get one of these?
-Sure.
Ladies!
It"s a pleasure to welcome you here today.
It"s taken years, but you are the first women ever to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame!
-And now--
-Wait.
Wait a minute.
This really isn"t right.
Mr. Lowenstein since you kept the league going all those years you do it.
-There you go, Ira.
-Thank you, Bob.
Ladies it"s my honour.
Mr. Capadino, look!
That"s when you changed my life, honey!
Stilwell, angel, smile!
Batter up

Near and far
We"ve got Canadians
Irish ones and Swedes
We"re all for one We"re one for all
We"re All-Americans ls that you, Grandma?
I"m so glad you came.
Hi, Aunt Dottie.
Take a picture.
Let"s take a picture of the whole team.
The original Peaches!
Strike!
That was clear inside.
It was clear inside, clear inside.
-l told you three times.
-That"s my opinion.
Yesterday or tomorrow, that might"ve been a ball but today, it was a strike!
You might need that.
Where"d you find this?
It was in one of those cartons.
Needs oil.
Who doesn"t?
You ready?
-l"m not going.
-Mom!
I"ve got two children, I don"t need a third.
Why is it so important that I go?
For one thing, it"d be nice if you just left the room.
Besides, these are your old friends.
They probably won"t remember me.
The ""Queen of Diamonds,"" Dottie Hinson?
Margaret, it just isn"t a good idea.
Come on, Mom.
You"ll get to see Aunt Kit.
-You never see each other.
-We still won"t.
She"ll be traveling around with that husband of hers.
Frank.
He has a name.
He"s always been very nice to you.
He makes me nervous.
There"s a lot of reasons why I can"t go.
Honey I"m not comfortable about this.
I"m not really part of it.
It was never that important.
It was just something I did.
When will you realize how special it was, how much it all meant?
I know how you feel. I really do.
But you"re going.
Car.
-Car, train, bus. I"m tired already.
-Sleep on the plane.
Grandma"s out.
is there a fire?
Wisenheimer.
Julie"s watching you.
I don"t want any bad reports.
-Bye, Grandma.
-Bye.
Jeffrey, come here.
No matter what your brother does, he"s littler than you.
Give him a chance to shoot.
Promise?
Bobby, come here.
Kill him.
Come on, you"ll miss your plane.
I still think I shouldn"t go.
Get a hit, Beans!
I"m coming, Mae!
I"m coming!
This week in the world of sports.
With the boys overseas and off to war baseball pitches in for the war effort.
Trading bats for bullets, Yankee Joe DiMaggio promises to give those Nazis a jolt.
Ace fireballer Bob Feller has traded Cleveland gray for Navy blue.
Baseball"s biggest stars say ""Look out, Mr. Hitler.
The Yanks are coming. ""
Not to mention the Indians, Red Sox and Tigers.
And they won"t come back till it"s over, over there.
Meanwhile, Chicago club owner Walter Harvey, the candy-bar king met with other team owners at the Harvey Mansion as rumours persist that baseball may be shut down for the duration of the war.
Harvey"s promotional whiz kid, Ira Lowenstein has been given the job of figuring out how to keep baseball going.
Good luck, Mr. Lowenstein.
Strike 2!
Hey, fatso!
Get the hell out of the way!
What are you, crazy?
Strike 3!
Kit!
-Sis, don"t swing at her high pitch.
-l can hit it.
-You can"t.
-l can.
This bat"s too heavy.
You"ll never get it around.
I will!
Listen.
There"s a big hole on the right side.
Don"t look.
-Unless she pitches inside, pull it.
-l know.
Batter up!
No high ones.
I like the high ones!
-Mule!
-Nag!
Come on, Kit.
Keep your eye on the ball.
Strike 1 !
Strike 2!
Too high.
All right, Kit.
Look it over!
Look it over there!
Strike 3!
All right, 2 outs, everybody.
Two away!
Better luck next time!
Knock it out of here!
Okay, Dottie!
Batter up!
Right in here!
Bring them in there, Dottie!
Ball!
Keep your eye on it, Dottie!
One hit and we win!
That"s it, Dottie!
You did it!
That"s the ball game!
Hey, Kit!
What are you swinging those high ones for?
Good thing your sister bailed you out.
How about the two bucks you owe me for this game?
Kit!
Wait up, I"ll give you a ride!
Stop kicking the rocks.
I"m sorry.
-That game just made me so mad.
-We won.
Get mad if we lose.
That last pitch was right down the middle.
If I"d have swung at that, I"d be the hero.
-You got me so crazy-- -l only said lay off the high ones.
""Good thing your sister bailed you out.""
"" Kit, why don"t you get your sister to teach you how to hit?""
""Why can"t you be beautiful like your sister?""
What idiot said that?
No one.
-But that"s what they were thinking.
-No, it"s not!
You ever hear Dad introduce us to people?
""This is our daughter Dottie.
This is our other daughter, Dottie"s sister.""
Should"ve just had you and bought a dog.
-Mitch Swaley likes you.
-He"s one step up from dating pigs.
But an important step.
-Why are you walking so fast?
-Why are you?
-Because you are.
-Can"t even let me walk faster than you?
Girls, you got chores to do.
Don"t run!
You"ll scare the chickens!
I don"t have time for these games.
-Why are you running?
-You can go faster than that.
Your legs are longer.
-l win!
-Barely.
Hey!
Hey, yourself.
Doesn"t that hurt them?
Doesn"t seem to.
It would bruise the hell out of me.
Who are you?
I"m Ernie Capadino, baseball scout.
I saw you playing today.
Not bad, not bad.
Ever hear of Walter Harvey?
Harvey Bars?
You know, the candy?
Yeah, we feed them to the cows when they"re constipated.
He"s starting a girls" baseball league so we can make a buck while the boys are overseas.
Wanna play?
Nice retort.
Tryouts are in Chicago.
It"s a real league, professional.
Professional baseball?
They"ll pay you $75 a week.
We only make $30 at the dairy.
Then this would be more, wouldn"t it?
Interested?
Come on. $75 a week?
Pull her leg.
Mine are long enough.
Look, your country needs you.
You can not only play ball, but you"re kind of a dolly.
Oh, now I get it.
Listen, mister.
I"m a married woman.
My husband"s overseas.
Oh, relax!
I"m talking lookie, no touchie.
We want girls easy on the eye.
I"ll go. I"m ready now.
I gotta sign something?
I don"t want you!
I want her!
The one who hit the ball!
You can climb back under the cow.
She"s good.
She"s very good.
She pitches.
She didn"t today, because she did yesterday.
Thanks for that special glimpse into her life.
I want you.
You I saw, you I like.
The train leaves for Chicago tomorrow.
What do you say?
Are you in?
No, thanks.
"" No, thanks""?
Hey, no skin off my Ashtabula.
If you wanna pluck cows, that"s your business.
You know something?
You"re not nice.
That one hurt.
So long, milkmaids.
No, wait!
Just watch me pitch.
Dottie, get your mitt!
I"ll throw him a few.
Now look I know the goods when I see the goods, and she"s the goods.
I"m sorry.
Will you shut up?
!
You"re a pitcher, huh?
I"ll tell you what.
If she comes, you can come too.
If you stink, it only costs us the train ticket.
Get these wild animals away from me!
Haven"t you ever heard of a leash?
Come on, Dottie.
You got the whole rest of your life to hang around here.
Never go anywhere.
Never do anything.
I"m married. I"m happy.
It"s what I want.
Don"t confuse things.
But can"t you just have this first?
Just so you can say you once did something?
Something special?
Goodness sake, Kit!
Keep your voice down.
Your father"s listening to the radio.
Please, Dottie?
I gotta get out of here.
I"m nothing here.
In the Pacific Northwest, my territory we have increased sales 1 06% in the last 1 2-month period.
And this with a war on!
You know, if I had your job, I"d kill myself.
Sit here. I"ll see if I can dig up a pistol.
Every trip I take, I gotta sit next to one of these guys.
I"m just too friendly.
Hey, isn"t that--?
Well, I"ll say one thing for them.
They can run.
Mr. Capadino!
I got her!
Look!
-Sir, your knee.
-Like it?
Stop the train!
Come on!
Come on!
Give me that bag!
Did you promise the cows you"d write?
When do we get to Chicago?
We gotta make a stop.
Fort Collins, Colorado.
Gotta look at another girl.
Hope you"re not jealous.
I"m sorry.
It"s okay, honey.
That was good form.
Thattagirl!
Good, honey.
Good.
Nice, nice.
That"s a rope, honey.
Good girl.
Good, good.
Right, too high.
She"s got an eye like DiMaggio.
Okay, Marla.
Now lefty.
She"s really good.
She"s your daughter?
Her mom"s dead.
It"s just the two of us.
Coach said if she was a boy, she"d go to the state tournament.
I said, "" lf she was a boy, I"d talk to the Yankees instead of living here.""
That"s enough.
You can bring her over.
Okay, Marla.
Come here.
Boys!
Hit the showers!
Take off your hat, honey.
We"ll let you know.
Daddy, I"m sorry.
Let"s go.
We"ll miss the train.
Let"s move, move, move!
What"s the matter?
I can"t use her.
She"s great.
Why not?
What"s the problem?
You know General Omar Bradley?
There"s too strong a resemblance.
You ain"t taking her because she ain"t pretty?
Well, look who just caught up!
All right.
Come on, let"s go.
Pick those suitcases up!
Come on!
I"m not kidding.
Move!
-One foot in front of the other.
-Mister?
I know my girl ain"t so pretty as these girls.
But that"s my fault.
I raised her like I would a boy.
I didn"t know any better.
She loves to play.
Don"t make my girl suffer because I messed up raising her.
Please?
I wish you had a decent mitt.
I think maybe I"d better not go.
No, you can relace it.
It"ll be okay.
I mean, who"s gonna take care of you?
Cook?
Help you take care of the equipment?
Don"t you worry about me.
You"ll play baseball.
I"m not gonna know anybody.
Nothing"s ever gonna happen here.
You gotta go where things happen.
I love you, Daddy.
Let"s go, let"s go.
Come on, honey.
Are you coming?
See, how it works is, the train moves, not the station.
This is making me sick.
Write to me, honey.
I love you.
Hey, cowgirls, see the grass?
Don"t eat it.
Okay, girls, this is it.
Harvey Field.
Tryouts.
Get out there.
Show them what you got.
Don"t embarrass me.
It"s been a thin slice of heaven.
Goodbye.
Wait.
You"re going?
Dry your eyes.
I"m going home.
Grab a shower and a shave.
Give the wife a pickle-tickle, and I"m on my way. I"ll see you.
-But--
-But what?
Field!
Tryouts!
Play!
That"s it!
Get lost!
I hate when they get attached to me like that.
-Hey, Mae.
-What?
-Come look at this.
-Wait a second, Doris.
I can"t wait much longer, so get up.
Yeah, so?
Yeah, so I ain"t done yet.
Watch this.
-That"s it?
-You can"t do it, Mae.
I could do it.
How long you been working on that, Doris?
Took me a year.
Not counting the two months I was in the hospital.
Bat hit me right in the head.
Your head and not your behind?
That looks really swollen.
-What kind of thing is that to say?
-l"m joking, okay?
I"m nervous.
-What are you looking at?
-Yeah, what?
Nothing.
That"s right, nothing.
All these girls gonna be in the league?
-You wish.
-You do wish.
-Four teams.
Sixteen girls to a team.
-That"s right.
Sixty-four girls.
What are you, a genius?
They got over 1 00 girls here, so some of youse will have to go home.
-Sorry about that.
-Come on, Doris.
What do you mean, ""some of us""?
-Okay, some of them are going home.
-How"d you do that?
Excuse me.
You caught that.
Hello?
Let"s go practice.
She caught it with her bare hand.
And now, from Chicago, The Mutual presents another social commentary by Miss Maida Gilespie.
Careers and higher education are leading to the masculinization of women with enormously dangerous consequences to the home, the children and our country.
When our boys come home from war what kind of girls will they be coming home to?
And now, the most disgusting example of this sexual confusion, Mr. Walter Harvey, of Harvey Bars is presenting us with women"s baseball.
Right here in Chicago, young girls plucked from their families are gathered at Harvey Field to see which one of them can be the most masculine.
Mr. Harvey, like your candy bars, you are completely nuts.
ery good.
Try another.
Nice throw!
Your name will be on one of those five lists.
Okay, find your name.
If we could just form two or three parallel lines....
l"m a Peach!
A Rockford Peach!
I made it!
I can stay!
Are you a newspaper guy?
This is my friend Mae.
She made the team.
Come on, we got a lot to do.
Let"s settle down.
Now, you"re the first--
Honey, are you supposed to be here, or are you on the cut list?
Look, I"m sorry.
If you"re on the cut list, you have to leave the field.
Well, are you cut?
Look on the list. lt"s either Rockford, Racine, Kenosha or South Bend.
Can you read, honey?
No.
All right, what"s your name?
Shirley Baker.
Let"s just take a look.
This is you.
You"re with us.
You"re a Rockford Peach.
Go join your team.
Settle down.
We got a lot to go over.
First, congratulations.
You are the first members of the All-American Girls" Baseball League.
I"m Charlie Collins.
I"ll be managing the Racine team when the season starts.
The other teams will have managers soon.
At the end of practice today you all have to get fitted for your uniforms.
And this is what they"ll look like.
Pretty darn nifty, if you ask me.
You can"t slide in that.
That"s a dress.
It"s half a dress.
That"s not a baseball uniform.
What do you think we are, ballplayers or ballerinas?
It"s awfully short.
Short?
I"m gonna have to squat in that thing.
I can"t!
My husband will kill me.
Ladies!
Excuse me.
You can"t play ball in this, you can"t play ball with us.
There are 38 girls getting tickets home who"ll play in a bathing suit if I ask.
There"s no pockets for my cigarettes.
There is no smoking.
There is also no drinking and no men.
Your social engagements will be cleared through your team chaperones.
You"ll have regular classes at charm and beauty school.
For what?
Every girl in this league will be a lady.
And gracefully and grandly.
Gracefully and grandly.
All right, now go back!
And sip.
Down.
Don"t slurp.
Sip.
Down.
Don"t slurp.
Stop that!
It"s good.
Posture!
Heads up.
Backs straight.
And sit.
Right over left.
Legs always together.
A lady reveals nothing.
The hair.
Soften and shorten.
The eyebrows.
Thin and separate.
There should be two.
ery nice.
ery nice!
Lovely!
What do you suggest?
A lot of night games.
I wanna show you the grounds.
You know, I always--
Jimmy, come on.
I"m showing you around.
Beautiful, huh?
Place used to be a golf course.
I never cared for the game, but I love grass.
It costs a fortune, with the mowing and trimming.
But I grew up in an apartment.
I had one lousy plant in a cheese box.
Now look. I got a park.
These are my in-laws.
Hello!
They can"t hear nothing.
Enough socializing.
Jimmy, I"m thinking of giving you another managing job.
Mr. Harvey, I guarantee I"ll do a better job than last time.
You kind of let me down on that San Antonio job.
I had no right to sell off the team"s equipment like that.
It won"t happen again.
Let me be blunt.
Are you still a fall-down drunk?
Well, that is blunt.
No, sir. I"ve quit drinking.
You"ve seen the error of your ways?
No, I just can"t afford it.
That"s funny to you?
Your drinking is funny?
You"re a young man.
You still could be playing if you just would"ve laid off the booze.
Well, it"s not exactly like that.
I hurt my knee.
You fell out of a hotel.
That"s how you hurt it!
There was a fire.
Which you started, which I paid for.
I was gonna send you a thank-you card, but I wasn"t allowed anything sharp to write with.
I want you to manage one of the new girls" baseball teams.
Don"t look so stunned.
Face it.
You"re still a name.
You step out of the dugout before every game.
You wave your little hat.
You give the people a thrill.
Get an organ grinder.
I can hop around and dance.
If your knees are up to it, go ahead.
Mr. Harvey I hit 487 home runs for your baseball club.
Three in the World Series, two in game 4 alone.
I know that.
That"s why I"m giving you this job.
Take it or leave it.
I gotta feed the fish.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the first game of the All-American Girls" Baseball League!
The South Bend Blue Sox against your own Rockford Peaches.
-Where is he?
-l can"t believe he"s our manager.
I was listening to the radio when he hit that home run to win the pennant.
I"m asking him to sign my husband"s baseball card.
Do you mind?
Could I take a look at that?
Just be careful with it.
If anything happens, he"ll come back from the Pacific and kill me.
-Mr.
Dugan--
-Mr.
Dugan, I"m simply....
Do something, Mae.
Time him.
Give me your watch.
Could be a record.
That counts.
How long?
I ain"t gonna ask you again.
Shut up, Doris.
Keep timing.
Hey, Mae, how long?
Boy, that was some good peeing.
Hey, coach.
Mr. Dugan?
Could you sign my husband"s baseball card for me?
Great to meet you!
What"ll we do?
He didn"t give us a lineup.
We can"t play without one.
I"ll pitch. I can pitch.
-l thought I was playing centre field.
-No, I am.
Hey, you guys.
Come on.
How hard can it be to make a lineup?
Oh, yeah?
Why don"t you do it, Oregon?
-Me?
-Yeah, you.
All right.
Mae, centre field, lead off.
She"s good.
And now, the manager of the Peaches former six-time National League Home Run Champ Jimmy Dugan!
Jimmy, look up here!
We love you!
Bullshit.
You can all kiss my ass.
That"s right.
Kiss my big hairy ass.
And the Rockford Peaches!
Doris Murphy takes the field!
Lift up your skirt!
This"ll be something.
Ain"t too many people here.
-You nervous, Doris?
-Yeah.
I ain"t.
-Are they laughing at us?
-Yeah, they"re laughing at us.
-They hate us.
-Just keep smiling.
Hey, glamour puss!
Can you throw the ball?
All right, ladies, let"s play ball!
-Let"s play ball.
-Dirt in the skirt!
And now, the lineup for Rockford:
Leading off and playing centre field, number 5, Mae Mordabito!
Batting second and playing 3rd base, number 22, Doris Murphy!
Batting third, the catcher, number 8, Dottie Hinson!
Batting fourth and playing 2nd base, number 32, Marla Hooch.
Girls can"t play ball!
Batting fifth....
Look at me!
I"m a ballplayer!
Better look out, I might break a nail!
--number 1 , Ellen Sue Gotlander.
-lt slipped!
-Batting ninth, pitcher number 23, Kit Keller!
Count"s 2 balls and no strikes to Rockford"s big catcher, Dottie Hinson.
And it"s in the dirt. 3 and 0.
Let"s see if Jimmy Dugan gives her the green light on 3 and 0 or gives her the take sign.
Game"s tied 2-2, the bottom of the 9th with two runners in scoring position and only 1 out.
From the belt, here"s the delivery.
Oh, baby!
She hit the cream cheese out of that one!
Jimmy Dugan, master strategist, had her swinging away!
He sure knows his baseball.
Come on, Dottie!
Make me proud!
A 3-run clout for Dottie Hinson and Rockford wins it, 5 to 2.
Dottie, ladies and gentlemen!
Dottie!
I couldn"t believe you hit it right out there!
Can we have your autograph?
Can we, Jimmy?
Not today, boys.
Come back next game.
Nice piece of coaching.
Especially in the 5th inning when you scratched your balls for an hour.
Anything worth doing is worth doing right.
Yes, indeed.
Until you did that, I couldn"t tell if you were drunk or dead.
It was made very clear to me what I"m supposed to do here.
I smile wave my little hat, and I did that.
So when do I get paid?
You have some good ballplayers.
If you"ll only--
Ballplayers!
I haven"t got ballplayers!
I"ve got girls!
Girls are what you sleep with after the game, not what you coach during it.
If we paid you more, could you be just a little more disgusting?
I could certainly use the money.
On the home front they find them everywhere North, East, South and West, and even Canada.:
Players for the new All-American Girls" Baseball League.
After a month of play the shine still isn"t off these Diamond Gals.
Alice ""Skeeter"" Gaspers says ""Legging out a triple is no reason to let your nose get shiny. ""
Betty Grable has nothing on these gals.
Helen Haley has not only been on several championship amateur teams she"s also an accomplished coffeemaker.
With her husband in the Pacific Betty Horn enjoys cooking spaghetti and knitting.
Her teammates call her ""Betty Spaghetti. ""
Ellen Sue Gotlander is a former Miss Georgia.
Then there"s pretty Dottie Hinson who plays like Gehrig and looks like Garbo.
Fellas, keep your mitts to yourselves.
She"s married.
And there"s her kid sister Kit, who"s as single as they come.
Enough concentrated ""oomph"" for a whole carload of Hollywood starlets.
And how about Marla Hooch?
What a hitter!
What a lead!
But girls playing baseball?
-Enjoy that?
-Yeah!
Good.
Come back next game, will you?
I"m Evelyn Gardner.
I play right field.
For us.
I just spoke to my husband last night.
He says I can"t leave our son with him at home anymore.
See, he says he"s too busy reading the want ads and I should just take him with me and shut up about it.
So can I?
Take my son with me on road trips?
Ballplayers...!
He"s the sweetest little boy.
Everyone"s just gonna love him.
Get this brat off of me!
That"s it!
I quit!
Stilwell, angel, come to Mommy.
-You"re too young to drive.
-l will.
Watch.
Evelyn!
I"m sorry, but I"m gonna have to kill your son!
Wait!
The girls have a game!
You can"t leave us like this!
Please, Mr. Goosatelli!
Get over here, Stilwell!
I"m gonna kill you!
You can"t catch me!
Don"t use my bat, use Marla"s!
It"s heavier!
-Evelyn, why is he so wild?
-l don"t know.
Stilwell, angel, have another chocolate bar.
Gimme!
Gimme!
You can"t leave us like this.
We"re in the middle of nowhere!
-We can"t be here!
-No!
Keep him away from me!
He"s really a sweetie, Dottie.
-l hope I have five just like him.
-Don"t eat the wrapper, honey.
-You gonna come?
-Where you going?
A roadhouse called the Suds Bucket.
No, I"m married. I"m....
Come on, you ain"t on the farm anymore.
Live a little bit.
Girls!
Please!
Mr. Goosatelli shan"t be returning.
How you gonna get past Miss Cuthbert?
Mae"s gonna poison her dinner.
What is it, baby?
What the hell is going on?
!
Why are we stopped?
Lou quit.
Who"s Lou?
The driver.
A car could"ve came by now.
-Get on the bus!
-Was that English?
I loved you in The Wizard of Oz.
In the 43 years I"ve practised medicine, I never saw a woman throw up that much.
Maybe that"s how she entertains herself, doc.
Hurry!
Come on!
Quiet!
Mae, what did you give her?
Who cares?
It"s working.
I"m going, baby!
Come on, way to go, Mae!
I"m coming in!
Catch me!
Did you see me, Kit?
I pretzeled!
-How"d you learn to do that?
-She taught me.
My father owns a dance hall, upstate.
innie"s Dance Girls Deluxe.
She was a dancer, I was a bouncer.
You were great!
-Thanks for the ride, kid.
-What"s your rush, dollbody?
What do you say we slip in the back seat and you make a man out of me?
What do you say I smack you around?
Can"t we do both?
No, I"m not hot. lt"s fine.
It"s really cold.
-That"s better.
-Where"s Kit?
I think she"s on the dance floor.
There she is.
I got my truck parked outside.
Sorry, we gotta go.
Come on.
Alice, come on.
We gotta go.
We got trouble.
-l knew it.
You killed Miss Cuthbert.
-We"ll bury her. I know a guy--
Lowenstein"s coming.
He catches us, we"re out of the league.
Let"s make like a bread truck and haul buns, ladies.
Let"s duck out the back door.
is this all?
Marla didn"t come?
She came.
Well, where is she?
There.
Thinkin" of you
Some others I"ve seen
What did you do to her?
We just gave her a dress.
And a lot of liquor!
You guys go ahead. I"ll get Marla.
Hurry up, ladies!
Thanks.
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
It had to be you
It had to be you
Marla, honey?
We gotta go.
I"m singing to Nelson!
Ain"t l, baby?
You sure are.
I could take her home.
It"d be an honour.
Ain"t he something?
Could make me be blue
That"s the second time he dropped that Bible since she"s been in there.
Come on, girls.
Mae, what"d you say?
Everything.
"" Here"s a good job for you, Jimmy.
Managing girl ballplayers.
You go out there and you wave your little hat around.
Don"t drink!""
Why would I want to drink?
I"m a goddamn Peach!
God, double play.
Now I"m hitting like a girl.
"" But be nice to them.
They"re good ballplayers.""
There, catch that, blondie!
Now batting for the Rockford Peaches number 5, centre fielder Mae Mordabito!
Here"s the pitch.
There"s a shot into right centre!
It"s up the alley!
She"s turning around 1 st!
She"s digging up the dirt!
She"s heading past 2nd.
She"s heading into 3rd!
Dirt in the skirt, Mae!
Dirt in the skirt!
-Safe!
-She"s in there with a triple!
Boy, did she smack that one right on the kisser.
No wonder they call her ""All-the-Way"" Mae.
Triple.
Next batter number 32, 2nd baseman, Marla Hooch.
Evelyn, look at this!
I"ve got Stilwell"s snack on my cleat!
What are you, stupid?
Somebody"s gotta run the team.
Someone who actually watches the games.
You"re gonna squeeze bunt with our best hitter?
What"s the sign to swing away?
Hey, blond girl!
What"s the sign?
It"s the letters.
A squeeze"ll work.
Stop thinking with your tits.
Batter!
Time!
Come on!
Who is the goddamn manager here?
I am!
Then act like it, you big lush!
-You tell him, Dottie!
-About time someone told him.
-l"m ready now.
-Play ball!
Way to go, whatever your name is!
Good bluff!
But I still say you"re not ballplayers.
Cemetery boneyard!
Cross your fingers or you"ll never get another hit.
Sound it out.
Kimono.
Kimono off and gra-bed...
Grabbed.
...her milky milky white....
What are you giving her to read?
What"s the difference?
She"s reading.
That"s the important thing.
Go away!
Go!
Shoo!
Go ahead, Shirley.
Thanks.
Milky white breasts.
It gets really good after that.
-A delivery boy walks in....
-What are you doing?
I"m writing a song.
Really?
What"s it about?
About us.
Could you teach it to me?
Doris, is this your boyfriend?
is it out of focus?
No, that"s how he looks.
Looks aren"t the most important thing.
Right.
The important thing is he"s stupid, out of work and treats me bad.
Then why...?
Why?
What do you think?
Because none of the other boys ever....
Always made me feel like I was wrong.
Like I was some sort of a weird girl or a strange girl or not even a girl, just because I could play.
I believed them too.
But not anymore.
I mean, look.
There"s a lot of us.
I think we"re all all right.
We are.
Give me that.
So long, Charlie!
So with 2 runs in the 6th, South Bend gets even.
I"ve gotta go!
I"ve gotta go!
You shake it off.
Shake it off.
Say, Evelyn, can I ask you a question?
Which team do you play for?
-l"m a Peach.
-Well, I was just wondering because I couldn"t figure out why you"d throw home when we"ve got a 2-run lead!
You let the tying run get on 2nd, and we lost the lead!
You start using your head!
That"s that lump that"s three feet above your ass!
Are you crying?
Are you crying?
There"s no crying!
There"s no crying in baseball!
Leave her alone, Jimmy.
You zip it, Doris!
Rogers Hornsby, my manager, called me a ""talking pile of pig shit"" !
That was when my parents came from Michigan to see me play the game!
And did I cry?
No!
Do you know why?
Because there"s no crying in baseball.
No crying in baseball!
No crying!
What"s the matter?
She"s crying, sir.
I didn"t mean to do that.
Perhaps you chastised her too vehemently.
Good rule of thumb:
Treat each of them as you would your mother.
Anyone ever tell you you look like a penis with a hat on?
You"re out of here!
-l heard that!
-You misunderstood.
-Ten seconds!
-You misunderstood!
You can"t throw me out knowing you"ve got a strike!
Off this field!
I can"t believe no one ever called you that before!
That"s where you belong.
I"m in charge now.
The crowd"s light today, what with the tractor show in town.
If you"re nearby, and you must be, since this isn"t a powerful radio station...
People better start showing up.
We don"t have fans, we don"t have a league.
Ladies you all look wonderful.
There"s a reporter and a photographer in the stands from Life magazine.
-We"re famous!
-Life magazine?
Don"t waste your time.
Dottie, I"m trying to get them to do a story about you.
Me?
Why me?
You"re the ""Queen of Diamonds."" That"s what I"m calling you.
Did you tell them about me?
I told them how at first, the scout didn"t even want you but how Dottie wouldn"t come without her kid sister.
They really loved it.
A real human-interest story.
Will you just try to give them something spectacular out there?
Anything.
What"s the matter?
Well, we"re not doing so well.
Harvey and the other owners think they"ve made a mistake.
They might close you down.
What are you talking about?
They can"t close us down here.
-What kind of a thing is that?
-What"s it mean?
They"re businessmen.
No profit, no product.
And what am I supposed to do?
Go back to taxi dancing?
Ten cents so some slob can sweat gin all over me?
I"m never doing that again!
So you tell old rich Mr. Chocolate Man that he ain"t closing me down!
They can"t keep us from playing!
We"ll show them how we play.
I"m sorry. I"m very sorry.
I am trying my best.
So will you just give them everything you"ve got?
We always do.
A slick play by Alice Gaspers and there"s 2 gone in the 3rd.
That"ll bring up Dee Lynch.
Lynch is the most consistent Belles hitter this year.
Settles in.
Pops it up!
Foul.
Hinson should have no trouble with this.
She"s under it.
Uncle Elmore"s socks!
What did she do?
I can"t do that.
Who can?
-What is her name?
-Dottie Hinson.
D-O-T-T-l-E....
What the hell was that?
I just thought it might help the league.
A goddamn circus!
A double would be nice--
All right!
God knows we have a game.
It"s not like any of this helps, believe me.
That was really nice!
Let"s go, girls.
Dozens of people are waiting for the game to start.
Batter!
What is her name?
Hey you, tall girl!
Beverly!
Look sharp, tall-- What is her name?
Beverly.
Good.
Five bucks!
Five bucks!
What if, at a key moment in the game, my uniform bursts open and my bosoms fly out?
That might draw a crowd, right?
Think there"s men who ain"t seen your bosoms?
Thank you.
-Marla, what you got?
-What about me?
I got a letter from Nelson!
Fly ball as Dottie Hinson brings the crowd to its feet with a home run!
22!
We love you, 22!
-Come on!
-Open your mouth!
The kid ate the lineup!
Right here.
I"m so happy!
Thank you.
I love you.
I"ll be back next season.
See you next season!
Slide!
Slide!
Safe!
Thank you!
Let it up.
Let it up.
That was a good one.
It"s a fly ball to left!
Betty Spaghetti makes the catch!
Heads up!
Spaghetti makes the throw!
It"s gonna be close!
Aunt Edna"s bridgework!
She is out!
Dottie Hinson held onto the ball!
Oh, doctor!
A lot of ballplayers use it.
High foul pop.
It"s coming back!
She caught it!
Unbelievable!
Full house on its feet cheering Dottie Hinson!
That sounded good.
-You haven"t got a curve ball left.
-l don"t?
!
You haven"t had one since--
Safe!
Safe!
He"s good-looking.
-What"s he do when not in the Army?
-Dairy assistant manager.
He"ll be manager.
He"s smart.
So he"s good-looking and smart.
There"s so few of us.
Where did you say he was?
Italy?
I think. I haven"t got a letter from him in three weeks.
I used to get one every week.
That doesn"t mean anything.
If he"s in combat, it"s not like there"s a mailbox on every corner.
If something happened, you would"ve got a telegram.
Oh, God, don"t--
But he"s fine.
No, he"s fine.
How come you"re not in the Army?
I have no cartilage in my knee.
You don"t need it to shoot Nazis.
You need this, right?
Trigger finger.
I could do that.
How did I get so useless so fast?
Boys like this on your fingers?
Works for me.
Your sister"s not gonna be mad?
I don"t care.
Listen, when...
-Bob.
-...
Bob comes back will you keep playing?
You could just quit?
Sure.
You play like you love it.
-Does he know how good you are?
-Bob?
No, Hitler.
Yes, Bob.
How good am I?
You stink.
You"re lousy.
You"re only the best player in the league.
You don"t know that?
You ever been married?
Let me think.
Yeah, twice.
Any children?
One of them was.
is she out?
I think it"s time for a drink.
Hang on.
Hang on.
These really don"t mix.
-Good, huh?
-Oh, yeah.
It"s great.
Fair ball!
Time!
Jimmy Dugan pops his head out of the dugout.
He"s on his way to talk to his hurler.
Kit Keller looks mighty tired.
Game"s getting exciting.
I"ll finish it right here.
I"ll strike this turkey out.
Betty"s ready to come in.
Come on. I"ve never been taken out before.
Ask Dottie.
I really wanna finish this game.
Please?
What do you think?
Well, you know, she"s battling.
What do you think?
She"s throwing grapefruits.
It looks like Keller"s coming out of the game, and she is not happy about it!
Nice job, Kit!
Betty Horn sprints in from the left-field bullpen.
Look at this crowd.
This is great!
They"re jumping, cheering and they paid to get in.
You did a fabulous job.
I won"t forget this.
Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey.
I appreciate it, coming from you.
But to be perfectly honest, I think the girls deserve most of the credit.
They"re great.
Fortunately, we won"t need them anymore.
Do you want a peanut?
No.
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We"re winning the war.
Our situation changed.
Roosevelt himself said, "" Men"s baseball won"t be shut down.""
So we won"t need the girls next year.
Bases loaded.
Bottom of the 9th.
Rockford up, 6 to 2.
Two men out.
No balls, 2 strikes.
Strike 3!
And that is the ball game!
Rockford is in the playoffs!
I love these girls.
I don"t need them, but I love them.
Come on.
Let"s go.
Look at me. I"m full of peanuts!
I"ve got peanuts all over myself.
This is what it"s gonna be like in the factories too.
"" Men are back.
Turn in your rivets.""
First, it was their patriotic duty to get out and go to work.
When the men come back, they"re sent back to the kitchen.
Should we send the boys returning from war back to the kitchen?
Come on.
Do you know how dedicated they are?
What they go through?
They play with sprained ankles, broken fingers.
They ride a bus all night to play a double-header the next day!
I"ll make it up to them.
What?
With Harvey Bars?
I"m getting tired of listening to you, Ira.
I"d like your permission to take over the league.
Do you understand?
All of the owners are getting out.
There"s no point to it anymore.
Just let them finish the season, and that"s it!
I sold your product when there was no product.
This is a product!
There is no room for girls" baseball in this country once the war is over.
They"re through.
I think you"re wrong.
And I"m gonna prove it to you, Mr. Harvey!
Hi, my name"s Mae.
That"s more than a name, that"s an attitude.
Here"s my friend Doris.
Best player on the team.
-Thank you.
-You"re the best.
-The game put us in the playoffs.
-l could"ve finished.
Stilwell could"ve hit off you.
What"s the matter?
Too big to finish your own games now?
Don"t start with me, Kit!
Don"t you start with me!
Kit, come on, cut it out!
What the hell are you doing?
!
-Get your sister off of her!
-Stay out of it!
You just wait, Doris!
Let me down!
Let me down!
You stay down there and you cool off!
-Why"d she do it?
-She was vulnerable.
You provoked her.
-Shut up, Helen!
-You"re making her more upset.
Really!
-l don"t need it from Helen.
-Take a shower.
-l"m not taking a shower.
-She reminds me of my husband.
Save some hot water for me, you guys.
You okay?
My rear end hurts where he dropped me.
You acted like a baby.
You treat me like one.
I treated you like a pitcher who"d lost her stuff.
When Betty"s in trouble, you back her up every pitch!
I seem to remember last week, somebody throwing a resin bag in my face.
Told me to get my fat ass behind the plate.
Was that you or the umpire?
You could"ve backed me up today instead of holding me back.
I hold you back?
It"s like at home.
It"s like if you"re here, then I"m not here.
What"s that mean?
I don"t know what I mean.
I know I"m wrong.
I know you"re right and I"m wrong.
I know that. I just--
I just get so mad!
Why do you gotta be so good?
Dottie, here you are.
You weren"t on the bus.
Can I speak to you a minute?
I have to leave.
Don"t worry.
The bus wouldn"t leave without you.
I"m leaving the team.
What?
-Why?
What-- -l have to go home.
Home?
You can"t go home now.
This couldn"t come at a worse time.
We"re in a bit of a crisis, and I have to try to pull something off.
It"s not a good time to lose our most popular player.
-What"s the problem?
-l don"t want to talk about it.
It"s personal?
It"s one of the girls, isn"t it?
It"s Mae, right?
Kit, that"s it.
I"ve noticed there"s some friction.
That"s fine.
No problem.
Doesn"t mean you have to quit.
I can arrange a trade.
Racine?
Kenosha?
South Bend?
Trade me or whatever.
But figure it out by tomorrow, or I"m going home.
Tomorrow?
Fine!
I"ll work everything out by tomorrow.
You really gave me a scare for a second.
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Mae, your date"s here.
-How do I look?
-Where"d you get that dress?
-Borrowed it.
-lt don"t fit.
Too tight.
I don"t plan on wearing it that long.
I don"t know why you get dressed at all.
Where"s Dottie?
In there.
Wanna go to the movies with me?
You bitch!
I"ve been traded to Racine!
You?
I told them to trade me.
They"d really trade you.
Miss Star, Miss Perfect.
You knew what would happen!
-l didn"t!
-This"ll be better than the movies.
-l"ll quit. ls that what you want?
-They"ll blame me for you quitting!
What do you want me to do?
Stay away from me.
Leave me alone!
That"s what I want you to do!
Kit, listen.
It was all a mistake.
A big mistake.
-l was getting too good.
-You won"t listen.
I knew if I did too good, you"d do something to push me down!
Kit, blow it out your rear end!
I"m sick of you blaming me.
I got you into this league!
She got her in the league!
-l didn"t wanna be here!
-Then why are you still here?
Kit wants to know why she"s playing.
My train leaves at 8.
I got 1 0 minutes to pack.
If you have trouble, you know who to blame.
See you in the World Series.
You bet you will.
Don"t look at her.
Has anyone seen my new red hat?
Piss on your hat!
Well, that seemed uncalled for.
Just keep it down.
-Kit"s off our team.
-She"s not!
Yes, she is.
Are you deaf?
You need any help in there?
Don"t act like this.
You"re still in the league.
You"re just on another team, that"s all.
Batter up
Hear that call
The time has come
For one and all
To play
Ball
For we"re the members of
The All-American League We come from cities
Near and far
We got Canadians
Irish ones and Swedes
We"re all for one, we"re one for all We"re All-Americans
Each girl stands Her head so proudly high
Her motto.:
Do or Die
She"s not the one to use Or need an alibi
Our chaperones are not too soft They"re not too tough
Our managers are on the ball
Miss Cuthbert....
You gorgeous stack of pancakes!
Man on the floor!
Already dressed.
Get Stilwell away.
I don"t know what he"s doing.
Get him away from the tapes!
Angel, come here now.
All right.
Everybody, let"s listen up.
I was in the toilet reading my contract, and it turns out I get a bonus when we get to the World Series.
Let"s play hard!
Play smart!
Use your heads!
That"s that lump three feet above our ass, right?
Some more prominent than others.
Come in.
Excuse me!
I got a telegram from the War Department.
Oh, my God!
Ernie!
Boy, I hate these.
These are the worst.
The Army could at least send someone to tell you your husband"s dead.
Darn!
I had the name right here!
I gotta go back and straighten this out.
Sorry.
-Just give me the telegram.
-l can"t. I don"t have a name.
Just give me the telegram.
This is official.
This is from the War Department!
Come on!
That"s official business!
I"m coming--
-l"m sorry, Betty.
-No, it"s George!
It"s George!
All right, come on.
We still got a game to play.
Come in.
Hi, cutie.
How did you...?
Bob!
Oh, my God!
What happened?
-l"m fine.
-What is it?
It was a sniper.
I was lucky though.
He got seven of us before we got him.
Oh, sweetie!
It"s all right. I made it.
I missed you so much.
I"ve been discharged.
I didn"t think I"d ever see you again.
It"s all over. I"m here, baby.
Well, listen.
You have to sit down here.
I"ll clear all this stuff off.
I almost forgot how beautiful you are.
-Oh, no. I look terrible!
-You look beautiful.
You"re the most beautiful thing I"ve ever seen.
I love you.
Can we just hold each other for the rest of our lives?
That"s my plan.
Why am I the only one on this bus?
What are we waiting for?
Are you physically unable to show up on time?
Coming, Jimmy.
If you think you can do without the batting practice, think again.
Not the way you hit.
Let"s not go to the World Series without Stilwell"s toys!
-Alice, what time is it where you live?
-lt"s bad luck to yell before a game.
-Could you sign my baseball?
-Sure.
""Avoid the clap.
Jimmy Dugan.""
That"s good advice!
Write to us.
We"ll miss you.
We will.
Thanks.
Good luck in the World Series.
Taking a little day trip?
Bob and I are driving home to Oregon.
I thought you were a ballplayer.
You were wrong.
Was I?
It is only a game.
It"s only a game, and I don"t need this.
I have Bob. I don"t need this.
I gave away five years at the end of my career to drinking.
Five years.
There isn"t anything I wouldn"t give to get back any one day of it.
Well, we"re different.
Chickenshit!
You wanna go home and make 1 00 babies, great.
I can"t tell anyone how to live.
But sneaking out like this, quitting....
You"ll regret it all your life.
Baseball is what gets inside you.
It"s what lights you up.
You can"t deny that.
It just got too hard.
It"s supposed to be hard.
If it wasn"t hard, everyone would do it.
The hard is what makes it great.
Everything all right?
Yeah, fine.
Fine.
Bye, Jimmy.
First game of the first women"s baseball World Series.
This is history in the making.
History in the making!
This is for you.
We brought you these also.
For me?
Thank them!
-Cut it out!
-l"m sorry.
Two box seats on the 3rd base line.
I got two box seats.
Who wants them?
-How much?
-1 0 bucks.
That"s my daughter, 3rd baseman, Doris Murphy.
Best one they got.
-Where you from?
-Staten Island.
After the game, I"m taking her out for a steak dinner.
All right, all right, all right!
Time for the song and dance.
What"s that smell?
Alice thinks it"s bad luck to change her socks.
So we all suffer?
Get away, get away.
Outfielders, play deep a few steps.
Don"t give up anything long.
Alice?
If the lead-off hitter gets on, they"re gonna bunt.
Be ready.
Now, I"d like to....
l"d like to lead you in prayer.
-Come on.
-A prayer?
Come on.
Yes, a little prayer.
Come on!
Come on!
In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost....
Lord hallowed be Thy name.
May our feet be swift.
May our bats be mighty.
May our balls be plentiful.
And, Lord I"d just like to thank you for that waitress in South Bend.
You know who she is.
She kept calling Your name.
And, God these are good girls, and they work hard.
Help them see it all the way through.
Okay, that"s it.
-Let"s go.
-Amen.
Go Peaches!
Last game.
Now or never, ladies.
Alice, you"re killing me.
You"re killing me, Alice!
You"re goddamn killing me!
And the rocket"s red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh, say does that star-spangled
Banner yet wave
O"er the land of the free
And the home of the brave
This is it, folks.
One game for the whole ball of string.
There is no tomorrow.
Someone will walk out league champions, and someone else will just walk out.
You"re gonna lose!
You"re gonna lose!
You keep that kid away from me for just one game!
Ellen Sue, how"s it looking?
-Good.
-Feeling good?
Looking good!
Nice and warm?
Good.
Alice, if Ellen Sue doesn"t have anything, don"t keep it a secret.
Tell me right away.
You understand me?
Do you hear me?
!
You"re screaming. I hear you.
Where"d you come from?
We got to Yellowstone and turned back.
Have trouble with the bears, did you?
I was fine until that scout walked into our barn. I"m no quitter.
Wait a minute!
Hold it!
Who said you could play?
Alice has been catching the last six games.
She looks pretty good.
You don"t want me to play?
Well, you"re already dressed.
Hell, if you want to play I don"t care.
You can play.
Well, then, I"ll play.
Good.
-Fine.
-Fine.
Go play.
You look like shit.
Don"t you ever shave?
We"re gonna win.
We"re gonna win!
You"re gonna lose!
You stink!
Got him!
Lineup change!
-lt"s okay.
-Evelyn, he deserved it.
Stilwell, you gonna stay out here or come in the dugout?
Strike!
Strike!
You"re out!
3!
Strike!
You"re out!
You"re out!
You"re out, Brenda!
You are out!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Good, Mae!
Good catch!
Thank goodness.
2 down!
2 down!
Base hit.
Gardner"s up with it.
Wallace"ll stop at 3rd.
Gardner"s throw is way off line!
Go!
Go!
All the way!
I"m sorry!
Shoot!
Wallace scampers home, and the Belles take the lead, 1 to nothing!
They"re dancing in the aisles here in Racine!
I know. I know.
You"re still missing the cutoff man.
That"s something I would like you to work on before next season.
All right.
Thanks.
Thank you, Mr. Dugan.
All right, let"s get this one!
All right, come on!
We need some runs out there.
Make something happen, Mae!
All-the-Way Mae!
-They love her.
-Let"s go, let"s go!
ery cute.
Thanks.
Safe!
She"s safe!
Way to play!
Way to run!
Way to make something happen!
Safe!
You get a hit, I"ll baby-sit that little porker!
Come on!
You"re out!
Come on!
Bring me home, Helen!
Out!
Peaches are down to their final out.
Only tying and go-ahead runs in scoring position.
Big Dottie Hinson striding to the plate.
Let"s get out of this inning!
Come on!
Throw smoke, Kit!
Throw smoke!
Here"s the pitch.
Bite me on the butt and call me an apple!
She nearly took her head off!
Mordabito scores!
Murphy, she will score!
Rockford has taken the lead, 2 to 1 !
That"s my wife!
One more!
Keep it going!
Put it past the little queen here.
Right past her!
There"s a fly ball to left field.
She"ll have to go for this one!
That"s the final out.
But the damage has been done.
Right here in Racine, Rockford leads our Belles, 2 to 1 as we go to the bottom of the 9th.
Come on, it"s okay.
You gotta bat now.
Relax!
One run and we are back in this ball game.
Shake it off.
You gotta hit.
It"s okay, Kit.
Strike her out!
Bad eye!
Bat at that, blond girl!
She drives it to deep centre!
Mordabito goes to the wall and makes the catch!
Beautiful catch!
Beautiful!
Gotlander"s pitch and it is in the dirt!
Ball 1 !
That looked good to me, Ellen Sue!
Shake that one off!
That ain"t nothing!
Gotlander, she delivers.
It"s a ground ball between 1 st and 2nd.
This ball is hot!
Hendricks will go up at 1 st with a base hit.
That"s all right. 1 down!
We got 1 down!
Let"s go!
Foul ball!
Hinson"s taking after it.
That does it!
Did she get it?
She got it!
She got it!
There"s no question who the star of this game is.
Dottie Hinson has her team 1 out from the title.
Come on, Kit, you"re up.
You"re the hitter now.
Let"s go.
The last batter standing in Rockford"s way is Kit Keller.
Kit is 1 for 3 today.
-Can I have time-out?
-Time!
High fastballs.
She can"t hit them, can"t lay off them.
All right.
All right, if we just hold them now, we got it!
Come on!
Come on, Ellen Sue!
One, two, three!
Play ball!
-Strike!
-Swing and a miss.
Strike 1 !
Yes!
Thank you, God!
Lay off the high ones!
Here"s the pitch.
Swing and a miss!
Strike 2!
One more!
One more!
Here"s the pitch.
It is a long fly ball.
Back, back, back.
It falls in there!
No one"ll get to this ball!
This should tie it up!
Hendricks is rounding 3rd!
She will score!
Keller to 3rd!
Gardner hits the relay man with a frozen rope!
The coach is giving Keller the stop sign at 3rd!
But she is not stopping!
She runs through the stop sign!
She is not stopping!
Here comes the throw!
It should be in time!
Safe!
She is safe!
I can"t believe it!
Hinson dropped the ball!
Hinson dropped the ball!
The ball game is over!
Racine has won the game, 3 to 2 and the World Series!
Take me home, Mama, and put me to bed!
I have seen enough to know I have seen too much!
You played a good game.
Well, what do you say?
All right, Ira.
We"ll stick with it.
My mother always used to say, "" lf at first you don"t succeed--""
You don"t have to spend six months in Saskatchewan.
-Alice, you told me it"s lovely.
-lf you like icicles.
I thought we were gonna win.
-We didn"t.
-Up to that last inning, we had it.
I"m so depressed, I could eat a cow.
It"s all right.
You did good.
Get dressed.
See you on the bus.
Thanks.
Wanna be a ballplayer when you get big?
-What"s your name?
-Angelina.
Gotta practice really hard.
What"s your name?
-How much?
-Help yourself.
Thank you.
-Hitting!
-You all like hitting better?
-What"s your name?
-Mary.
-Who you rooting for?
-Racine!
That"s what I thought you said.
You guys be good.
Get dirty.
-l"m sorry I knocked you over.
-No, you"re not.
You blocked the entire plate!
How do you--
You did what you had to.
You beat me.
You wanted it more than me.
I jammed my shoulder, if it makes you feel any better.
A little.
Bob and I are driving back to Oregon.
You"re welcome to come with us.
You two should be alone.
I"d just be in the way.
When will you be coming home?
Some of the girls talked about staying around here and getting jobs.
I really like it here.
Christmas?
I don"t know.
You"ll come back next year, right?
I wanna have kids.
We wanna have kids.
You got plenty of time to have kids.
You couldn"t give this up.
You"d miss it.
Miss it?
Miss putting on all this gear?
Catching a double-header in 1 00-degree heat?
Pushing the bus in mud?
Getting slammed into every other day by a base runner?
Think I"m gonna miss that?
I"ll tell you what I"ll miss.
I"ll miss the girls.
I"ll miss you.
Me?
How many sisters do you think I have?
I love you, Kit.
Really?
Just when I want you to stay, you"re leaving.
Thanks for getting me in the league.
You got yourself in the league.
I got you on the train.
Play great.
Like you.
You stay in touch.
Come home every once in a while.
If you don"t, I"ll come back and hit line drives at your head.
I love you.
And you are gonna miss this.
I don"t care what you say.
There"s the winner!
Good game, Jimmy.
Hi, I"m a big fan of yours.
I"m Dottie"s husband.
Well, then I"m a big fan of yours.
Old man Harvey just offered me a job managing next year in Wichita.
Triple A?
Great.
Good luck.
Turned him down.
Why?
What do you mean, why?
I already got a job.
I"ll see you.
Miss Cuthbert, save me my special seat, now, cutie!
Meet you at the hotel.
Did you see Mae"s catch, Dad?
I"d rather see you play ball instead of what you used to do.
What are you saying that for?
You make her feel bad!
Steak dinner.
On you. I"ll see you later.
Kit, over here!
Come on, let"s go!
That was Bob, huh?
Nice guy.
Lay off of those high ones.
I like the high ones.
-Mule!
-Nag!
Hey, Mae.
Come here.
-What do you want?
-Come here.
-What is it?
-Look at her.
It"s Dottie.
Hey, Doris.
Mae?
All-the-Way Mae?
-No one"s called me that since--
-Last night!
I"m a married woman now.
Yeah, about eight times.
Girls!
Look who"s here!
Shirley?
Helen Haley!
-lt"s Dr. Haley now. I"m a doctor.
-l always knew you would be.
-Who"s that?
-Dottie Hinson.
Betty Spaghetti?
Best ballplayer in the league.
-l don"t remember her.
-She only played one year.
Ellen Sue!
You haven"t changed one bit.
I married a plastic surgeon.
Having you here is good luck.
Thanks, Alice!
Marla!
I"m so glad you"re here.
-How"s...?
-Nelson?
He"s good.
He"s retired.
Our son runs the business.
How"s Bob?
He"s....
When?
Just this winter.
I"m sorry.
Oh, Shirley, I"m so excited.
I"ve got butterflies in my stomach!
They"ve got a ""Women ln Baseball"" thing up there. lsn"t it neat?
Baseball Hall of Fame.
I"m shaking.
Wait a minute here.
-Guess who that is?
-Who?
You remember?
You"re gonna lose.
Stilwell, angel!
My goodness!
Where"s your mom?
Mom died a couple of years ago.
I"m sorry.
She was a real nice lady.
And a damn fine ballplayer.
When I heard about this, I felt like I owed it to her to be here.
She always said it was the best time she had in her whole life.
Come here.
Recognize yourself?
-Can I get one of these?
-Sure.
Ladies!
It"s a pleasure to welcome you here today.
It"s taken years, but you are the first women ever to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame!
-And now--
-Wait.
Wait a minute.
This really isn"t right.
Mr. Lowenstein since you kept the league going all those years you do it.
-There you go, Ira.
-Thank you, Bob.
Ladies it"s my honour.
Mr. Capadino, look!
That"s when you changed my life, honey!
Stilwell, angel, smile!

Take a picture.
Let"s take a picture of the whole team.
The original Peaches!
Strike!
That was clear inside.
It was clear inside, clear inside.
-l told you three times.
-That"s my opinion.
Yesterday or tomorrow, that might"ve been a ball but today, it was a strike!

Come here, Bobby.
Come on.
Give me...
MARGARET:
You might need that.
Where'd you find this?
It was in one of those cartons that came over after.
Needs oil.
Heh.
Who doesn't?
MARGARET:
You ready?
I'm not going.
Oh.
Mom!
I already got two children, I don't need a third.
Why is it so important that I go?
For one thing, it'd be nice if you just left the room.
Oh...
Besides, these are your old friends.
They probably won't even remember me.
Oh...
The "Queen of Diamonds," Dottie Hinson?
I just don't think this is a good idea.
MARGARET:
Oh, come on, Mom.
I mean, you're gonna get to see Aunt Kit.
You hardly ever see each other.
We still won't.
She'll be traveling around with that husband of hers.
MARGARET:
Frank.
He has a name.
Frank.
And he's always been very nice to you.
He makes me nervous.
There's a lot of reasons why I can't go.
Mom.
Honey,
I'm not comfortable about this.
I'm not really part of it.
It was never that important to me.
It was just something I did.
When are you gonna realize how special it was, how much it all meant?
I...
Yeah, I know how you feel.
I really do.
But you're going.
Car.
A car, a train, a bus.
I'm tired already.
Sleep on the plane.
Grandma's out.
Is there a fire?
Wisenheimer.
Julie next door is watching you.
I don't want any bad reports.
Okay.
Bye, Grandma.
Bye.
Jeffrey, come here.
No matter what your brother does, he's littler than you.
Give him a chance to shoot.
Promise?
Yeah.
Okay.
DOTTIE:
Bobby, come here.
Kill him.
Come on, you'll miss your plane.
Yeah!

ANNOUNCER:
This week in the world of sports.
With the boys overseas and off to war, baseball pitches in for the war effort.
Trading bats for bullets, Yankee Joe DiMaggio promises to give those Naxis a jolt.
Ace fireballer Bob Feller has traded Cleveland gray for Navy blue.
Baseball's biggest stars say:
"Look out, Mr. Hitler.
The Yanks are coming."
Not to mention the Indians, Red Sox and Tigers.
And they won't come back till it's over, over there.
Meanwhile, Chicago club owner Walter Harvey, the candy-bar king, met with other team owners at the Harvey Mansion as rumors persist that baseball may be shut down for the duration of the war.
Harvey's promotional whix kid, Ira Lowenstein, has been given the job of figuring out how to keep baseball going.
Good luck, Mr. Lowenstein.
Strike 2!
Hey!
MAN 1:
Hey, fatso!
Come on!
Get the hell out of the way!
What are you, crazy?
Strike 3!
Kit!
Kit!
- Sis, don't swing at that high pitch.
- I can hit it.
- You can't.
- I can.
This bat's too heavy.
You'll never get it around.
I will!
Kit, Kit.
Listen.
There's a big hole on the right side.
Don't look.
- Unless she pitches inside, pull it.
- I know.
Batter up!
No high ones.
I like the high ones!
- Mule!
- Nag!
WOMAN 1:
Come on, one more.
WOMAN 2:
Easy out, easy out.
Come on, Kit.
Keep your eye on the ball.
CATCHER:
Right in here, right here.
Strike 1!
Strike 2!
Too high.
No.
MAN 2:
All right, Kit.
Look it over!
Look it over there!
UMPIRE:
Strike 3!
CATCHER:
All right, two out, everybody.
That's two away!
MAN 3:
Better luck next time!
MAN 2:
Come on, Dottie!
Knock it out of here!
MAN 4:
Okay, Dottie!
UMPIRE:
Two outs.
Batter up!
WOMAN 3:
Dottie!
WOMAN 4:
You can do it.
UMPIRE:
Play ball.
CATCHER:
Right in here, Becky.
MAN 2:
Bring them in, bring them in!
Bring them in there, Dottie!
Ball!
MAN 5:
Keep your eye on it, Dottie!
CATCHER:
Come on, Becky.
MAN 2:
Come on, Dottie!
One hit and we win!
CATCHER:
Oh!
Oh!
Whoo!
Dottie!
MAN 2:
That's it, Dottie!
You did it!
Great.
That's the ball game!
ALL [CHANTING]:
Dottie, Dottie, Dottie, Dottie.
That was a swell hit.
Good job!
Hey, Kit!
What are you swinging those high ones for?
Good thing your sister bailed you out.
Heh-heh-heh.
MAN 6:
How about the two bucks you owe me for this game?
MITCH:
Kit!
Wait up, I'll give you a ride!
KIT:
Ow.
DOTTIE:
Stop kicking the rocks.
KIT:
I'm sorry.
- That game just made me so mad.
- Kit, we won.
Get mad if we lose.
That last pitch was right down the middle.
If I'd have swung at that, I'd be the big hero.
- You got me so crazy--
- All I said was lay off the high ones.
"Good thing your sister bailed you out, Kit.
Heh, heh."
"Kit, why don't you get your sister to teach you how to hit?"
"Why can't you be beautiful like your sister?"
What idiot said that?
No one.
- But that's what they were thinking.
- No, it's not!
No?
You ever hear Dad introduce us to people?
"This is our daughter Dottie.
This is our other daughter, Dottie's sister."
Should've just had you and bought a dog.
- Mitch Swaley likes you.
- Mitch Swaley's one step up from dating pigs.
But an important step.
- Why are you walking so fast?
- Why are you?
Because you are.
Can't even let me walk faster than you?
Sure.
MA:
Girls, you got chores to do.
Don't run!
You'll scare the chickens!
I don't have time for these games.
KIT:
Why are you running?
DOTTIE:
You can run faster.
KIT:
Your legs are longer.
DOTTIE:
I win!
KIT:
Barely.
ERNlE:
Hey.
Hey!
Hey, yourself.
Aw.
Doesn't that hurt them?
It doesn't seem to.
It would bruise the hell out of me.
DOTTIE:
Who are you?
ERNIE:
I'm Ernie Capadino, baseball scout.
I saw you playing today.
Not bad, not bad.
Ever hear of Walter Harvey?
Makes Harvey Bars?
You know, the candy?
Yeah, we feed them to the cows when they're constipated.
Thats the guy.
He's starting a girls' baseball league so we can make a buck while the boys are overseas.
- Wanna play?
- Huh?
Nice retort.
Tryouts are in Chicago.
It's a real league, professional.
Professional baseball?
ERNIE:
Mm-hm.
They'll pay you $75 a week.
We only make 30 at the dairy.
Well, then, this would be more, wouldn't it?
You interested?
Come on.
Seventy-five dollars a week?
Pull her leg.
Mine are long enough already.
ERNIE:
Look, your country needs you.
And you can not only play ball, but you're kind of a dolly.
DOTTIE:
Oh, now I get it.
Listen, mister.
I'm a married woman.
My husband's overseas.
Oh, relax!
I'm talking lookie, no touchie.
We want girls easy on the eye.
I'll go.
I'm ready now.
I gotta sign something?
I don't want you!
I want her!
The one who hit the ball!
You can climb back under the cow.
She's good.
She's very good.
She pitches.
She didn't today, because she did yesterday.
Thanks for that special glimpse into her life.
I want you.
You I saw, you I like.
What do you say?
The train leaves for Chicago tomorrow.
- What do you say?
Are you in?
- No, thanks.
Dottie.
"No, thanks"?
Heh.
Hey, no skin off my Ashtabula.
If you wanna stay here plucking cows, that's your business.
You know something?
You're not nice.
Ooh.
That one hurt.
So long, milkmaids.
No, wait!
Just watch me pitch.
Dottie, get your mitt!
I'll throw a few.
- I'll show you some pitches--
- No.
No, no, no.
Now look,
I know the goods when I see the goods, and she's the goods.
I'm sorry.
Hm.
Mm.
Will you shut up?
!
- You're a pitcher, huh?
- Yeah.
I'll tell you what.
If she comes, you can come too.
If you stink, it'll only cost us a train ticket.
Get these wild animals away from me!
Haven't you ever heard of a leash?
Come on, Dottie.
You got the whole rest of your life to hang around here.
Never go anywhere.
Never do anything.
I'm married.
I'm happy.
It's what I want.
Let's not confuse things.
Okay.
But can't you just have this first?
Just so you can say you once did something?
Something special?
Huh?
MA:
Goodness sake, Kit!
Keep your voice down.
Your father's listening to the radio.
Please, Dottie?
I gotta get out of here.
I'm nothing here.
In the Pacific Northwest, my territory, we have increased sales 106 percent in the last 12-month period.
And this with a war on!
You know, if I had your job, I'd kill myself.
Sit here.
I'll see if I can dig up a pistol.
Every trip I take, I gotta sit next to one of these guys.
I'm just too friendly.
Hey, isn't that--?
DOTTIE:
I'm coming!
KIT:
Let me in!
Stop!
Well, I'll say one thing for them.
They can run.
Mr. Capadino!
I got her!
Look!
WOMAN:
Sir, your knee.
- Like it?
Stop the train!
♪ And hear the lonesome whistle See the smoke from the stack ♪
Come on!
Come on!
♪ So take me right back To the track, Jack, choo choo ♪
DOTTIE:

Come on.
Come on, here.

ERNIE:
Did you promise the cows you'd write?
When do we get to Chicago?
We gotta make a stop.
Fort Collins, Colorado.
Gotta look at another girl.
Hope you're not jealous.
MARLA:
I'm sorry.
- It's okay, honey.
That was good form.
Thattagirl!
- Good, honey.
Good, good.
- Mm.
Nice, nice.
That's a rope, honey.
Ha-ha-ha.
Good girl.
Good, good.
Right, too high.
She's got an eye like DiMaggio.
Good.
Good, good.
Okay, Marla.
Now lefty.
PLAYERS:
Aw...
She's really good.
- She's your daughter?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Her mom's dead.
It's just the two of us.
Coach said if she was a boy, she'd go to the state tournament.
I said, "If she was a boy, I'd talk to the Yankees instead of living here."
That's enough.
You can bring her over.
Okay, Marla.
Come here.
Boys!
Hit the showers!
MAN 1:
You did good.
MAN 2:
I threw everything I had.
Take off your hat, honey.
Oh!
We'll let you know.
Daddy, I'm sorry.
ERNIE:
Come on, let's go.
We'll miss the train.
Let's move, move, move!
What's the matter?
I can't use her.
She's great.
Why not?
What's the problem?
You know General Omar Bradley?
- Yeah.
- There's too strong a resemblance.
You ain't taking her because she ain't pretty?
Well, look who just caught up!
All right.
Come on, let's go.
Pick those suitcases up!
Come on!
I'm not kidding.
Let's go.
Move!
- One foot in front of the other.
- Hey, mister?
Huh?
I know my girl ain't so pretty as these girls.
But that's my fault.
I raised her like I would a boy.
I didn't know any better.
She loves to play.
Don't make my little girl suffer because I messed up raising her.
Please?
ERNIE:
Come on, get on the train.
I wish you had a decent mitt.
I think maybe I'd better not go.
No, you can relace it.
It'll be okay.
No, I mean, who's gonna take care of you?
Cook?
Help you take care of the equipment?
Don't you worry about me.
You're gonna play baseball.
I'm not gonna know anybody.
Marla.
Nothing's ever gonna happen here.
You gotta go where things happen.
I love you, Daddy.
CONDUCTOR:
All aboard!
- Daddy.
- Let's go, let's go.
CONDUCTOR:
All aboard!
Come on, honey.
Are you coming?
See, how it works is, the train moves, not the station.
Bye, Daddy.
Oh!
This is making me sick.
DAVE:
Write to me, honey.
I love you.
[MOUTHING] Goodbye.
ERNIE:
Hey, cowgirls, see the grass?
Don't eat it.
Come on.
Okay, girls, this is it.
Harvey Field.
Tryouts.
Get out there.
Show them what you got.
Don't embarrass me.
It's been a thin slice of heaven.
Goodbye.
Wait.
You're going?
Aw, dry your eyes.
Yeah, I'm going home.
Grab a shower and a shave.
Give the wife a pickle-tickle, and I'm on my way.
I'll see you.
- But-- ERNIE:
But what?
Field!
Tryouts!
Play!
That's it!
Get lost!
Come on, guys.
ERNIE:
I hate when they get attached to me like that.
WOMAN:
You've got an arm.
- Hey, Mae.
WOMAN:
What?
- Come look at this.
WOMAN:
Wait a second, Doris.
I can't wait much longer, so get up.
Yeah, so?
Yeah, so I ain't done yet.
Watch this.
- That's it?
- You can't do it, Mae.
I could do it.
How long you been working on that, Doris?
- That?
Took me a year.
- Yeah.
Not counting the two months I was in the hospital.
Bat hit me right in the head.
Bam.
- Really?
- Yup.
Your head and not your behind?
That looks really swollen.
- What kind of thing is that to say?
- I'm joking.
I'm nervous, all right?
I don't--
What are you looking at?
Yeah, what?
Nothing.
Yeah, nothing.
That's right, nothing.
All these girls gonna be in the league?
- You wish.
- You do wish.
- Four teams.
Sixteen girls to a team.
- That's right.
Sixty-four girls.
Yeah.
What are you, a genius?
Ha-ha-ha.
They got over 100 girls here, so some of youse will have to go home.
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- Come on, Doris.
- What do you mean, "some of us"?
- Do it.
- Okay, some of them are going home.
- Hey.
How did you do that?
Excuse me.
Hey.
Hey.
You caught that.
Hello?
Doris.
- Did you see?
Jeez.
- Let's go practice.
- She caught it with her bare hand.
- Okay, okay.
Shh.
Be quiet.
ANNOUNCER:
And now, from Chicago, The Mutual presents another social commentary by Miss Maida Gilespie.
MAIDA [OVER RADIO]:
Careers and higher education are leading to the masculinixation of women with enormously dangerous consequences to the home, the children and our country.
When our boys come home from war, what kind of girls will they be coming home to?
And now, the most disgusting example of this sexual confusion, Mr. Walter Harvey of Harvey Bars is presenting us with women's baseball.
Right here in Chicago, young girls plucked from their families are gathered at Harvey Field to see which one of them can be the most masculine.
Mr. Harvey, like your candy bars, you are completely nuts.
MAN 1:
Come on, come on, come on.
WOMAN 1:
Heads up, heads up.
Very good.
Try another.
Ow.
MAN 3:
Nice throw!
WOMAN 2:
Come on!
MAN 4:
Your name will be on one of those five lists.
Okay, find your name.
WOMAN:
If we could just form two or three parallel lines...
Yeah!
Yes!
I'm a Peach!
- What?
- A Rockford Peach!
I made it!
I can stay!
Are you a newspaper guy?
This is my friend Mae.
She made the team.
Hi.
Pleased to meet you, Mae.
Okay, come on, we got a lot to do.
Let's settle down.
Now, you're the first--
Honey, are you supposed to be here, or are you on the cut list?
Look, I'm sorry.
If you're on the cut list, you have to leave the field.
Well, are you cut?
Look on the list.
It's either Rockford, Racine, Kenosha or South Bend.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Uh, can you read, honey?
No.
All right, what's your name?
- Shirley Baker.
- Shirley Baker.
Shirley Baker.
Let's just take a look.
This is you.
You're with us.
You're a Rockford Peach.
Ha-ha-ha.
Go join your team.
Okay, ladies.
Let's settle down.
We got a lot to go over.
First, congratulations.
You are the first members of the All-American Girls' Baseball League.
I'm Charlie Collins.
I'll be managing the Racine team when the season starts.
The other teams will have managers soon.
At the end of practice today, y'all will have to get fitted for your uniforms.
And this is what they're gonna look like.
Pretty darn nifty, if you ask me.
WOMAN 1:
You can't slide in that.
DORIS:
Hey, that's a dress.
MAE:
It's half a dress.
That's not a baseball uniform.
What do you think we are, ballplayers or ballerinas?
It's awfully short.
Short?
I'm gonna have to squat in that thing.
WOMAN 2:
I can't wear that.
My husband will kill me.
Ladies!
Ladies!
WOMAN 3:
Excuse me, sir.
WOMAN 3:
Excuse me.
If you can't play ball in this, you can't play ball with us.
There are 38 girls getting train tickets home who'll play in a bathing suit if I ask them.
There's no pockets for my cigarettes.
There is no smoking.
There is also no drinking and no men.
Your social engagements will be cleared through your team chaperones.
Plus each of you will have regular classes at charm and beauty school.
- For what?
- Every girl in this league will be a lady.
And gracefully and grandly.
Gracefully and grandly.
All right, girls, now go back!
And sip.
Down.
Don't slurp.
Sip.
Down.
Don't slurp.
Sip.
Down.
Don't slurp.
Sip.
- Stop that!
- Why?
It's good.
Posture.
Heads up.
Backs straight.
And sit.
Right over left.
Legs always together.
A lady reveals nothing.
Ha-ha-ha!
Stop it.
And...
The hair.
Soften and shorten.
The eyebrows.
Thin and separate.
There should be two.
Mm-hm.
Very nice.
Very nice!
Lovely!
What do you suggest?
A lot of night games.
MAN:
Come on, I wanna show you the grounds.
You know, I always--
Jimmy, come on.
I'm showing you around.
Beautiful, huh?
- Mm-hm.
- Place used to be a golf course.
I never cared for the game myself, but I love grass.
It costs a fortune to keep like this, with the mowing and trimming.
But I grew up in an apartment.
I had one lousy plant in a cheese box.
Now look.
I got a park.
These are my in-laws.
Hello!
They can't hear nothing.
Enough socializing.
Jimmy, I'm thinking of giving you another managing job.
Oh, well, Mr. Harvey,
I guarantee I'll do a better job than last time.
You kind of let me down on that San Antonio job.
Yeah, yeah.
I had no right to sell off the team's equipment like that.
- That won't happen again.
- Let me be blunt.
Are you still a fall-down drunk?
Well, that is blunt.
Ahem.
No, sir.
I've quit drinking.
You've seen the error of your ways?
No, I just can't afford it.
That's funny to you?
Your drinking is funny?
You're a young man, Jimmy.
You still could be playing if you just would've laid off the booze.
Well, it's not exactly like that.
I hurt my knee.
You fell out of a hotel.
That's how you hurt it!
JIMMY:
There was a fire.
Which you started, which I had to pay for.
JIMMY:
I was gonna send you a thank-you card, but I wasn't allowed anything sharp to write with.
Look, Jimmy, I want you to manage one of the new girls' baseball teams.
Don't look so stunned.
Face it.
You're still a name.
You step out of the dugout before every game.
You wave your little hat.
You give the people a thrill.
Why not get an organ grinder?
I can hop around and dance.
If your knees are up to it, go ahead.
Mr. Harvey,
I hit 487 home runs for your baseball club.
Three in the World Series, two in Game 4 alone.
I know that.
That's why I'm giving you this job.
Take it or leave it.
I gotta feed the fish.
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first game of the All-American Girls' Baseball League.
The South Bend Blue Sox against your own Rockford Peaches.
Where is he?
It's game time.
WOMAN 1:
I can't believe he's our manager.
I was listening to the radio when he hit that home run to win the pennant.
Oh, yes.
Mm-hm.
I'll get him to sign my husband's baseball card.
Oh.
Do you mind?
Could I take a look at that?
All right, but just be careful.
If anything happens to that, George'll come back from the Pacific and kill me.
Ugh.
Uh, Mr. Dugan-- Mr. Dugan, I'm simply...
Hi.
Get down from there.
WOMAN 2:
I can't believe he's doing that.
DORIS:
Do something, Mae.
- Oh, yeah.
- Time him at least.
- Give me your watch.
DORIS:
Could be a record.
That counts.
How long?
I ain't gonna ask you again.
Shut up, Doris.
DORIS:
Keep timing.
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Mae, how long?
- Doris.
Boy, that was some good peeing.
Hey, coach.
Mr. Dugan?
Could you sign my husband's baseball card for me?
DORIS:
Hey, great to meet you!
What'll we do?
He didn't give us a lineup.
- We can't play without a lineup.
KIT:
I'll pitch.
I can pitch.
- I thought I was playing center field.
- No, I would like center field.
Hey, hey.
Hey, you guys.
Come on.
How hard can it be to make a lineup?
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you do it, Oregon?
- Me?
MAE DORIS:
Yeah, you.
All right.
Mae, center field, lead off.
She's good.
ANNOUNCER:
And now, the manager of the Peaches, former six-time National League home run champ,
Jimmy Dugan!
MAN 1:
Yeah, Dugan!
Dugan!
WOMAN 1:
Hey, Jimmy, look up here!
We love you!
JIMMY:
Bullshit.
You can all kiss my ass.
That's right.
Kiss my big hairy ass.
MAN 2:
You're the best, Jimmy!
And the Rockford Peaches!
Doris Murphy takes the field!
MAN 3:
Hey, lift up your skirt!
This should be something.
Ain't too many people here.
- You nervous, Doris?
- Yeah.
I ain't.
- Are they laughing at us?
- Yeah, they're laughing at us.
WOMAN 2:
What makes you think you can play baseball?
- They hate us.
- Just keep smiling.
MAN 4:
Hey, glamour puss!
Can you throw the ball?
All right, ladies, let's play ball!
DORIS:
Let's play ball.

Let's go.

ANNOUNCER:
Batting fifth and playing left field...
Look at me!
I'm a ballplayer!
MEN:
Ha-ha-ha!
Whoo!
MAN 6:
Get a load of that.
HECKLER:
Girls, look at these legs!
Better look out, I might break a nail!
Ha-ha-ha!
ANNOUNCER:

DORIS:

VENDOR:
Fresh roasted peanuts!
Get your peanuts!
ANNOUNCER:
Count's 2 balls and no strikes to Rockford's big catcher, Dottie Hinson.
And it's in the dirt. 3 and 0.
Let's see if Jimmy Dugan gives her the green light on 3 and 0 or gives her the take sign.
Game's tied 2-2, the bottom of the 9th with two runners in scoring position and only 1 out.
From the belt, here's the delivery.
Wow!
ANNOUNCER:
Oh, baby!
She hit the cream cheese out of that one!
Jimmy Dugan, master strategist, had her swinging away!
Boy, he sure knows his baseball.
MAE:
Come on, Dottie!
Come on, make me proud!
ANNOUNCER:
A 3-run clout for Dottie Hinson and Rockford wins it, 5 to 2.
Hey!
All right, Dottie!
That's the way to play!
Dottie, ladies and gentlemen!
Dottie!
I couldn't believe you hit it right out there!
BOY 1:
Jimmy, can we have your autograph?
BOY 2:
Can we have your autograph?
BOY 1:
Jimmy, please?
- Not today, boys.
Come back next game.
Nice piece of coaching, Jimmy.
Especially in the 5th inning when you scratched your balls for an hour.
Yeah, well, anything worth doing is worth doing right.
Yes, indeed.
Until you did that, I couldn't tell if you were drunk or dead.
It was made very clear to me what I'm supposed to do here.
I smile, wave my little hat, and I did that.
So when do I get paid?
You have some good ballplayers.
If you'll only give them--
Ballplayers!
I haven't got ballplayers!
I've got girls!
Girls are what you sleep with after the game, not what you coach during it.
If we paid you more, could you be just a little more disgusting?
Well, I could certainly use the money.
ANNOUNCER:
On the home front, they find them everywhere,
North, East, South and West, and even Canada:
Players for the new All-American Girls' Baseball League.

Alice "Skeeter" Gaspers says:

Betty Grable has nothing on these gals.
Helen Haley has not only been on several championship amateur teams, she's also an accomplished coffeemaker.

Betty Horn enjoys cooking spaghetti and knitting.
Her teammates call her "Betty Spaghetti."

Yow.
Then there's pretty Dottie Hinson, who plays like Gehrig and looks like Garbo.
Uh-uh, fellas, keep your mitts to yourself.
She's married.
And there's her kid sister Kit, who's as single as they come.
Enough concentrated "oomph" for a whole carload of Hollywood starlets.
And how about Marla Hooch?
What a hitter!
What a league!
- But girls playing baseball?
- She's out!
She's out!
Yeah!
Game ball!
That's good work.
She can hit that ball.
- Enjoy that?
- Yeah!
Good.
Come back next game, will you?
Good hitting.
Good hitting.
Take care.
Take care.
Uh, Mr. Dugan?
I'm Evelyn Gardner.
Yeah.
I play right field.
For us.
I see--
I just spoke to my husband last night.
He says I can't leave our son with him at home anymore.
See, he says he's too busy reading the want ads and-
- And, um,
I should just take him with me and shut up about it.
So can I?
Take my son with me on road trips?
Ballplayers...
Well, he's the sweetest little boy.
Everyone's just gonna love him.
BUS DRIVER:
What's going on?
Hey!
Get this brat off of me!
DORIS:
Oh, thank God.
WOMAN:
Are you all right?
That's it!
I quit!
EVELYN:
Stilwell, come to Mommy.
DORIS:
That kid is trouble.
EVELYN:
You're too young to drive.
MAE:
I will.
Watch.
Evelyn.
Evelyn!
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to kill your son!
No, Mae!
Mae!
Wait!
The girls have a game!
You can't leave like this!
Please, Mr. Goosatelli!
Get over here, Stilwell!
I'm gonna kill you!
Mae!
STILWELL:
You can't catch me!
DORIS:
Don't use my bat, use Marla's!
It's heavier!
DOTTIE:
Evelyn, why is he so wild?
EVELYN:
I don't know.
Stilwell, angel, have another chocolate bar.
STILWELL:
Gimme!
Gimme!
Gimme!
You can't.
You can't leave us like this.
We're in the middle of nowhere!
- We can't be here!
Please!
Ew.
- No!
No.
MAE:
Keep him away from me.
He's really a sweetie, Dottie.
- I hope I have five just like him.
EVELYN:
Don't eat the wrapper.
MAE:
Dottie.
- You gonna come with us?
- Where you going?
A roadhouse called the Suds Bucket.
No, you know, I'm married.
I'm...
Come on, Dottie, you ain't on the farm anymore.
Live a little bit.
Girls!
Girls!
Please!
Mr. Goosatelli shan't be returning.
How are you gonna get past Miss Cuthbert?
Oh.
- Mae's gonna poison her dinner.
- What?
Mr. Dugan.
Mr. Dugan.
- Mr. Dugan!
- What is it, baby?
Mm!
Mm!
Mm!
Oh!
Oh, oh!
What the hell is going on?
!
- Why are we stopped?
- Lou quit.
Who's Lou?
The driver.
A car could've came by now.
- Come on, you girls!
DORIS:
What?
Get on the bus!
DORIS:
What did he say?
Was that English?
I loved you in The Wizard of Oz.
WOMAN:
Hey, who's in my seat?
In the 43 years I've practiced medicine, never saw a woman throw up that much.
Maybe that's how she entertains herself, doc.
Oh, yes, yeah.
There we go.
Good, good.
[WHISPERING] Hurry, come on.
Quiet.
DORIS:
Mae, what did you give her?
JIMMY:
Oh, now, what a shame.
MAE:
Who cares?
It's working.
JIMMY:
I wouldn't wear those shoes again.
MAE:
I'm going, baby!
Come on, way to go, Mae!
I'm coming in, Mae!
Come on, doll.
God.
Catch me!
Did you see me, Kit?
I pretzeled!
Doris.
Look how Mae is...
- How did you learn how to do that?
- She taught me.
My father owns a dance hall, upstate.
Vinnie's Dance Girls Deluxe.
She was one of the dancers, I was a bouncer.
MAE:
All right, let's go.
You were great!
Thanks for the ride, kid.
What's your rush, dollbody?
What do you say we slip in the back seat and you make a man out of me?
What do you say I smack you around for a while?
Can't we do both?
I'm not hot.
It's fine.
That's the one I like right there.
Brr.
It's really cold.
Ooh.
That's better.
Where's Kit?
Hi.
I think she's on the dance floor.
There she is.
MAN 1:
I got my truck parked outside.
Kit.
Hey.
Sorry, we gotta go.
Come on.
Alice, come on.
Guys, we gotta go.
We got trouble.
I knew it.
You killed Miss Cuthbert.
We'll bury her.
I know a guy-
- Ha, ha.
It's Lowenstein.
He's on his way.
He catches us, we're out of the league.
Let's make like a bread truck and haul buns, ladies.
MAN 2:
See you, Mae.
Let's duck out the back door.
Is this all of you?
Marla didn't come?
She came.
Yeah, well, where is she?

That's the second time he dropped that Bible since she's been in there.
Come on, girls.
- Mae, what'd you say?
MAE:
Everything.
"Here's a good job for you, Jimmy.
Managing girl ballplayers.
You just go out there and you wave your little hat around.
Don't drink!"
Why would I want to drink?
I'm a goddamn Peach!
Double play.
Now I'm hitting like a girl.
"But be nice to them.
They're good ballplayers."
Unh!

Triple.

Hooch.
DORIS:

I've got Stilwell's snack on my cleat!
DOTTIE:

WOMAN 1:
What's the signal?
WOMAN 2:
Keep your eye on it, Marla.
What are you, stupid?
DORIS:
Somebody's gotta run the team.
Someone who actually watches the games.
You're gonna squeeze bunt with our best hitter?
What's the sign to swing away?
Hey, blond girl!
What's the sign?
It's the letters.
A squeeze'll work.
Stop thinking with your tits, you want a big inning.
Batter!
Time!
Come on!
Hey, who is the goddamn manager here?
I am!
Then act like it, you big lush!
DORIS:
Ho-ho-ho!
You tell him, Dottie!
MAE:
About time someone told him.
- I'm ready now.
- Play ball!
Oh, goody.
Show her something.
Put it by her.
Way to go, whatever your name is!
Good bluff!
Eh?
But I still say you're not ballplayers.
Cemetery boneyard!
Cross your fingers or you'll never get another hit.
MAE:
Sound it out.
Kimono.
Kimono off and... gra-bed...
Grabbed.
her... milky-
- Milky... white-
- Milky white...
What are you giving her to read?
What's the difference?
She's reading.
That's the important thing.
Now go away!
Go!
Shoo!
- Go ahead, Shirley.
You're doing good.
SHIRLEY:
Thanks.
Okay.
Milky white... breasts.
It gets really good after that.
Look.
A delivery boy walks in.
What you doing?
[WHISPERING] Oh, I'm writing a song.
- Really?
What's it about?
- Yeah.
About us.
ELLEN SUE:
Could you teach it to me?
BETTY:
Doris, is this your boyfriend?
DORIS:
Yup.
- Is it out of focus?
- No, that's how he looks.
Looks aren't the most important thing.
Right.
The important thing is he's stupid, out of work and treats me bad.
Then why...?
- Why?
What do you think?
- Because none of the other boys ever...
Always made me feel like I was wrong, you know?
Like I was some sort of a weird girl or a strange girl or not even a girl, just because I could play.
I believed them too.
But not anymore, you know?
I mean, look.
There's a lot of us.
I think we're all all right.
We are.
Hey, give me that.
So long, Charlie!
ANNOUNCER:
So with two runs in the 6th, South Bend gets even.
STILWELL:

I've gotta go!
WOMAN:
We'll get it back.
You shake it off.
Shake it off.
Say, Evelyn, can I ask you a question?
You got a moment?
Mm-hm.
Which team do you play for?
- Well, I'm a Peach.
- Well, I was just wondering because I couldn't figure out why you'd throw home when we've got a 2-run lead!
You let the tying run get on second, and we lost the lead!
You start using your head!
That's that lump that's three feet above your ass!
Are you crying?
- No.
- Are you crying?
Are you crying?
!
There's no crying!
There's no crying in baseball!
- Why don't you leave her alone?
- Oh, you zip it, Doris!
Rogers Hornsby, my manager, called me a "talking pile of pig shit"!
That was when my parents came from Michigan
- to see me play the game!
Did I cry?
- No, no.
- No!
No!
Do you know why?
- No.
Because there's no crying in baseball.
There's no crying in baseball!
No crying!
UMPIRE:
What's the matter, Jimmy?
- She's crying, sir.
I didn't mean to do that.
Perhaps you chastised her too vehemently.
Good rule of thumb:
Treat each of these girls as you would your mother.
Anyone ever tell you you look like a penis with a hat on?
You're out of here!
- I heard that!
- You misunderstood.
- Ten seconds!
- You misunderstood!
You can't throw me out knowing you've got a strike zone...
Off this field!
- Get in that dugout!
Get off this field!
- You're out.
I can't believe no one ever called you that before!
That's where you belong.
I'm in charge now.
All right, who's up here?
Who's up?
ANNOUNCER:
The crowd's light today, what with the tractor show in town.
If you're nearby, and you must be, since this isn't a powerful radio station, come on down to the ballpark and bring the kiddies.
People better start showing up.
We don't have fans, we don't have a league.
Ladies, you all look wonderful.
Mr. Lowenstein.
- Hello.
- Hi.
There's a reporter and a photographer in the stands from LIFE magazine.
WOMAN 1:
We're famous!
WOMAN 2:
LIFE magazine?
Don't waste your time, Doris.
ALICE:
We get that in Saskatchewan.
Dottie,
I'm trying to get them to do a story about you.
Me?
Why me?
You're the "Queen of Diamonds." That's what I'm calling you.
Did you tell them about me?
I told them how at first, the scout didn't even want you, but how Dottie wouldn't come without her kid sister.
They loved it.
They really loved it.
A real human-interest story.
So will you just try to give them something spectacular out there?
Anything.
Why, what's the matter?
Well, Mae, we're not doing so well.
Harvey and the other owners think they've made a mistake.
They're talking about closing you down.
- What?
- What are you talking about?
They can't close us down here.
- What kind of a thing is that?
- What's it mean?
They're businessmen.
No profit, no product.
And what am I supposed to do, huh?
Go back to taxi dancing?
Ten cents so some slob can sweat gin all over me?
I'm never doing that again.
So you tell old rich Mr. Chocolate Man that he ain't closing me down!
They can't keep us from playing!
KIT:
We'll show them how we play.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
I am trying my best.
So will you just give them everything you've got?
DORIS:
We always do.
ANNOUNCER:
A slick play by Alice Gaspers and there's 2 gone here in the 3rd.
That'll bring up Dee Lynch.
Lynch is the most consistent Belles hitter this year.
DOTTIE:
Okay, burn it in.

Settles in.
Pops it up!
Foul.
Hinson should have no trouble with this.
She's under it.

ANNOUNCER:
Uncle Elmore's socks!
What did she do?
Whoo-hoo!
- I can't do that.
- Who can?
What is her name?
Dottie Hinson.
D-O-T-T-I-E...
- Good play.
- What the hell was that, hm?
I just thought it might help the league.
JIMMY:
I'm in a goddamn circus!
A triple.
A double would be nice--
All right!
God knows we have a game.
It's not like any of this helps, believe me.
Safe!
That was really nice!
All right, all right.
Let's go, girls.
Dozens of people are waiting for the game to start.
Yeah!
Batter!
What is her name?
Hey you, tall girl!
- Beverly.
JIMMY:
Beverly!
Look sharp, tall-- What is her name again?
DOTTIE:
Beverly.
- Beverly.
Good.
Good.
Yeah!
Five bucks!
Five bucks!
What if, at a key moment in the game, my uniform bursts open and, oops, my bosoms come flying out?
That might draw a crowd, right?
Think there's men who ain't seen your bosoms?
Thank you.
- Marla, what you got?
- What about me?
MARLA:
I got a letter from Nelson!
Whoo!
ANNOUNCER:
Fly ball as Dottie Hinson brings the crowd to its feet with a home run!
BOTH:
Twenty-two!
Yeah.
We love you, 22!
Hey.

Evelyn.
Kid!
Kid!
The kid ate the lineup!
Right here.
Aah!
I'm so happy!
Thank you.
Thanks so much.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'm so happy.
MARLA:
I'll be back next season.
DORIS:
Marla.
- See you next season!
MAN:
Bye, Marla.
MARLA:
Bye.
Bye!
Slide!
Slide!
UMPIRE:
Safe!
Thank you!
Let it up.
Let it up.
And...
Ooh, that was a good one.
ANNOUNCER:
A fly ball to left!
WOMAN:
Get under it!
ANNOUNCER:
Betty Spaghetti makes the catch!
Brock tags up.
Spaghetti makes the throw!
It's gonna be close!
And...
DOTTIE:
Oh!
- Aunt Edna's bridgework!
She is out!
- Out!
ANNOUNCER:
Dottie Hinson held onto the ball!
Oh, doctor!
A lot of ballplayers use it.
Out!
ANNOUNCER:
High foul pop.
It's coming back!
Coming back!
Uh-oh.
ANNOUNCER:
She caught it!
Unbelievable!
Full house on its feet cheering Dottie Hinson!
- That sounded good.
- Yeah.
- You haven't got a curve ball left.
- I don't?
!
- You haven't had a curve ball since--
- Have you been watching?
Safe!
Aha.
Okay.
He's good-looking.
- What's he do when not in the Army?
- Dairy assistant manager.
He's gonna be manager someday.
He's real smart.
So he's good-looking and smart.
There's so few of us.
Where did you say he was again?
Italy?
Yeah, I think.
I haven't got a letter from him in three weeks.
I used to get one every week.
Well, that doesn't mean anything.
If he's in combat, it's not like there's a mailbox on every corner.
Besides, if something happened, you would've got a telegram.
- Oh, God, don't--
- But he's fine.
No, he's fine.
How come you're not in the Army?
I have no cartilage in my knee.
Not that you need cartilage to shoot Nazis.
You need this, right?
Trigger finger.
I could do that.
Heh.
Right.
How did I get so useless so fast?
- Boys really like this on your fingers?
- It works for me.
Your sister's not gonna be mad?
[WHISPERS] I don't care.
Listen, when, uh...
- Bob.
- Bob comes back,
- are you gonna keep playing?
- Oh, no.
- You could just quit like that?
- Sure.
You play like you love it.
No.
No.
- Does he know how good you are?
- Bob?
No, Hitler.
Yes, Bob.
How good am I?
You stink.
You're lousy.
You're only the best player in the league.
You don't know that?
Well...
You ever been married?
Well, let me think.
Yeah, twice.
Any children?
One of them was, yeah, yeah.
- Is she out?
- Yeah.
Well, I think it's time for a drink.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
- These really don't mix.
- Here.
- Ah...
- Ha-ha-ha.
DOTTIE:
Good, huh?
JIMMY:
Oh, yeah.
It's great.
UMPIRE:
Fair ball!
Time!
ANNOUNCER:
Jimmy Dugan pops his head out of the dugout.
He's on his way to talk to his hurler.
Kit Keller looks mighty tired.
Game's getting pretty exciting.
I'll finish it right here.
I'll strike this turkey out.
Betty's ready to come in.
Come on.
I've never been taken out before.
Ask Dottie.
I really wanna finish this game, Jimmy.
Please?
What do you think?
Well, you know, she's battling.
What do you think?
She's done.
She's throwing grapefruits.
- Blue!
ANNOUNCER:
Oh!
It looks like Keller's coming out of the game, and she is not happy about it!
MAN:
Nice job, Kit!
ANNOUNCER:
Betty Horn sprints in from the left-field bullpen.
Look at this crowd.
This is great.
They're jumping, hopping, cheering and they paid to get in.
You did a fabulous job.
I won't forget this.
Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey.
I appreciate it, coming from you.
But to be perfectly honest, I think the girls deserve most of the credit.
Oh, they're great.
Fortunately, we won't need them anymore.
Do you want a peanut?
No.
What do you mean?
What do you mean, what do I mean?
We're winning the war.
Our situation changed.
Roosevelt himself said, "Men's baseball won't be shut down."
So we won't need the girls next year.
Bases loaded.
Bottom of the 9th.
Rockford up 6 to 2.
Two men out.
- No balls, 2 strikes.
DOTTIE:
Okay, Betty, right here.
UMPIRE:
Strike 3!
ANNOUNCER:
And that is the ball game!
Rockford is in the playoffs!
I love these girls.
I don't need them, but I love them.
Look at that.
Come on.
Let's go.
Oh, look at me.
I'm full of peanuts!
I've got peanuts all over myself.
This is what it's gonna be like in the factories too, I suppose.
"Men are back.
Turn in your rivets."
We told them it was their patriotic duty to get out and go to work.
When the men come back, they're sent back to the kitchen.
Should we send the boys returning from war back to the kitchen?
Come on.
Excuse me.
Do you know how dedicated they are?
What they go through?
They play with sprained ankles, broken fingers.
They ride a bus all night to play a double-header the next morning.
I'll make it up to them.
What?
With Harvey Bars?
I'm getting tired of listening to you, Ira.
I'd like your permission to take over the league.
What?
Do you understand?
All of the owners are getting out.
There's no point to it anymore.
Just let them finish the season, and that's it!
I sold your product when there was no product.
This is a product!
There is no room for girls' baseball in this country once the war is over.
They're through.
I think you're wrong.
And I'm gonna prove it to you, Mr. Harvey!
Hi, my name's Mae.
That's more than a name, that's an attitude.
Here's my friend Doris.
Best player on the team.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Smile for the camera.
- Thank you, Mae.
- You're the best.
The game put us in the playoffs.
I could have finished.
Stilwell could've hit off you.
What's the matter?
Too big to finish your own games now?
Hey!
Don't start with me, Kit.
Don't you start with me.
Don't start!
DOTTIE:
Kit, come on, cut it out!
DORIS:
What the hell are you doing?
!
WOMAN 1:
Hey, you guys.
DORIS:
Get off of me!
WOMAN 2:
Jimmy!
WOMAN 3:
Stop it!
Get off of her.
- Get your sister off of her!
- Stay out of it Mae!
You stay out of it!
Doris!
KIT:
You just wait, Doris!
Let me down!
Let me down!
Ow!
You stay down there and you cool off!
Why'd she do it?
She was vulnerable.
You provoked her.
Shut up, Helen!
You're making her more upset.
Really!
I don't need it from Helen too.
Take a shower.
Leave me.
I'm not taking a shower.
She reminds me of my husband.
DOTTIE:
Save some hot water for me, you guys.
You okay?
My rear end hurts where Jimmy dropped me.
You acted like a baby out there.
You treat me like a baby.
I treated you like a pitcher who'd lost her stuff.
When Betty's in trouble, you nurse her.
Every pitch, you're backing her up!
I seem to remember last week somebody throwing a rosin bag in my face.
Told me to get my fat ass behind the plate.
Was that you or the umpire?
KIT:
You could've backed me up today instead of holding me back.
I hold you back?
It's like at home.
It's like if you're here, then I'm not here.
What does that mean?
I don't know what I mean.
I know I'm wrong.
I know you're right and I'm wrong.
I know that.
I just-
- You--
I just get so mad!
Why do you gotta be so good, huh?
Hey, Kit.
Kit.
Ah, Dottie, there you are.
You weren't on the bus.
Could I speak to you a minute?
I have to leave.
Oh.
Don't worry.
The bus wouldn't leave without you.
No.
I'm going home.
I'm leaving the team.
What?
- Why?
What--
- I have to go home.
Home?
You can't go home now.
No, it--
This couldn't come at a worse time.
You see, we're in a bit of a crisis, and I have to try to pull something off.
It's not a good time to lose our most popular player.
What's the problem?
Maybe I can help.
I don't wanna talk about it.
It's personal?
It's one of the girls, isn't it?
It's Mae, right?
No.
Kit, that's it.
I've noticed there's some friction.
That's fine.
That's no problem.
Doesn't mean you have to quit.
I can arrange a trade.
Like Racine?
Kenosha?
South Bend?
Trade me or whatever.
But figure it out by tomorrow.
Otherwise, I'm going home.
Tomorrow?
Fine!
I'll work everything out by tomorrow.
You really gave me a scare there for a second.
Hey, does anybody have any extra hose?
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Mae, your date's here.
- How do I look?
- Where'd you get that dress?
- Borrowed it.
- It don't fit.
It's too tight.
I don't plan on wearing it that long.
I don't know why you get dressed at all.
[ON RADIO] ♪ Choo choo, ch-boogie Take me right back to the track ♪♪
- Where's Dottie?
- In there.
WOMAN 1:
Wanna go to the movies with me?
WOMAN 2:
You wanna go with me?
KIT:
You bitch!
- What?
I've been traded to Racine!
You?
I told them to trade me.
Oh, yeah, they'd really trade you.
Miss Star, Miss Perfect.
You knew what was gonna happen!
DOTTIE:
I didn't!
WOMAN 1:
This'll be better than the movies.
I'll quit. ls that what you want?
Then they'll blame me for you quitting!
What do you want me to do?
Stay away from me.
Leave me alone!
That's what I want you to do!
Kit, listen to me.
It was all a mistake, okay?
A big mistake.
I was getting too good.
You won't listen.
I knew if I did too good, you'd do something to push me down!
Blow it out your rear end!
I'm sick of being blamed for everything bothering you.
I got you into this league!
[WHISPERING] She got her in the league.
I didn't even wanna be here!
Then why are you still here?
Kit wants to know why she's still playing.
My train leaves at 8:00.
I got 10 minutes to pack.
If you have trouble, you know who to blame.
KIT:
I'll see you in the World Series.
DOTTIE:
Yeah, you bet you will.
DORIS:
Don't look at her.
Don't look.
Huh?
Oh.
Has anyone seen my new red hat?
Oh, piss on your hat!
Well, that seemed uncalled for.
STILWELL:
Mommy!
Just keep it down, okay?
Kit's off our team.
WOMAN 3:
She's not!
DORIS:
Yes, she is.
Are you deaf?
Kit?
Kit, you need any help in there?
Don't act like this.
You're still in the league.
You're just on another team, that's all.

Man on the floor!
Ah!
Already dressed.
Get Stilwell away.
I don't know what he's doing.
Get him away from the tape!
EVELYN:
Stilwell, angel, come here.
All right.
EVELYN:
Come over here.
All right, everybody, let's listen up.
I was in the toilet reading my contract, and it turns out I get a bonus when we get to the World Series.
So let's play hard!
Play smart!
Use your heads!
That's that lump three feet above our ass, right, Jimmy?
Well, some more prominent than others.
Come in.
MAN:
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
I got a telegram from the War Department.
Oh, my God!
Ernie!
MAN:
Let's see.
Boy, I hate these.
These are the worst.
The Army could at least send someone personally to tell you your husband's dead.
Darn!
I had the name right here.
Well, I gotta go back and get this straightened out.
Sorry.
Hey.
Just give me the telegram.
I can't.
I don't have a name.
Just give me the telegram.
Hey.
This is official.
This is from the War Department!
Come on!
That's official business!
I'm coming--
WOMAN:
Miss Cuthbert.
Miss Cuthbert.
JIMMY:
I'm sorry, Betty.
No, it's George!
No, no, no!
It's okay.
Jimmy, you wanna take her?
All right.
It's okay.
It's okay.
BETTY:
It's George!
It's okay.
BETTY:
It's George.
No.
No.
All right, come on.
Come on.
We still got a game to play.
Come in.
Hi, cutie.
Bob.
How...?
How did you...?
Bob!
Oh, my God!
Bob, what happened?
- Oh, I'm fine.
- What is it?
It was a sniper.
I was lucky though.
He got seven of us before we got him.
Oh, sweetie!
Oh, sweetie!
It's all right.
I made it.
I missed you so much.
I've been discharged.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
It's all over.
I'm here, baby.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, listen.
You have to sit down here.
I'll clear all this stuff off.
I almost forgot how beautiful you are.
Oh, no.
I look terrible.
You look beautiful.
You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I love you.
Can we just hold each other for the rest of our lives?
That's my plan.
Why am I the only person on this bus?
What are we waiting for?
Are you physically unable to show up on time?
Coming, Jimmy.
Bye.
If you think you can do without the batting practice, think again.
Not with the way you've been hitting.
Oh, let's not go to the World Series without Stilwell's toys!
Alice, what time is it where you live?
ALICE:
Don't yell before a game.
It's bad luck.
- Mr. Dugan?
- Yeah?
- Could you sign my baseball?
- Sure.
- There.
- Wow.
"Avoid the clap.
Jimmy Dugan." Wow.
That's good advice!
Dottie.
Write to us.
We'll miss you.
We will.
Thanks.
Good luck in the World Series.
Bye!
Bye, girls.
Bye, girls.
- Goodbye.
WOMAN 1:
Goodbye, Molly.
WOMAN 2:
So lovely.
We'll be back.
- Taking a little day trip?
- No.
Um,
Bob and I are driving home to Oregon.
I really thought you were a ballplayer.
- Well, you were wrong.
- Was I?
Yeah.
It is only a game, Jimmy.
It's only a game, and I don't need this.
I have Bob.
I don't need this.
I don't.
I gave away five years at the end of my career to drinking.
Five years.
There isn't anything I wouldn't give to get back any one day of it.
Well, we're different.
That's chickenshit!
You wanna go home and make 100 babies, great.
I can't tell anyone how to live.
But sneaking out like this, quitting...
You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
Baseball is what gets inside you.
It's what lights you up.
You can't deny that.
It just got too hard.
It's supposed to be hard.
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it.
The hard is what makes it great.
Everything all right?
Yeah, fine.
Fine.
Bye, Jimmy.
First game of the first women's baseball World Series.
This is history in the making.
History in the making!
This is for you.
We brought you these also.
- For me?
- Thank them!
Come on, come on!
Way to go, way to go, way to go!
Yes!
- Aw, cut it out!
- I'm sorry.
UMPIRE:
You're out!
You're out!
Safe!
Get it in, get it in!
Two box seats on the third base line.
Anybody want them?
I got two box seats.
Who wants them?
One of them.
Ten bucks.
That's my daughter, third baseman, Doris Murphy.
Best one they got.
- Where you from?
- Staten Island.
After the game, I'm gonna take her out for a steak dinner.
All right, all right, all right!
Time for the song and dance.
What is that smell?
Alice thinks it's bad luck to change her socks.
JIMMY:
So we all have to suffer?
Get away.
Outfielders, play deep a couple steps.
Don't give up anything long.
- Alice?
- Hm?
If the lead-off hitter gets on, they're gonna bunt.
Be ready.
All right.
Now, I'd like to...
I'd like to lead you all in a prayer.
- Come on.
WOMAN:
A prayer?
- A what?
JIMMY:
Come on.
Yes, a little prayer.
Come on!
Is he serious?
HELEN:
Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost.
Okay, good, good.
Uh, Lord, hallowed be thy name.
May our feet be swift.
May our bats be mighty.
May our balls be plentiful.
And, Lord,
I'd just like to thank you for that waitress in South Bend.
You know who she is.
She kept calling your name.
And, God, these are good girls, and they work hard.
Help them see it all the way through.
Okay, that's it.
Ahem.
Let's go.
ALL:
Amen.
MAE:
Okay.
ALL:
Go
Peaches!
Last game.
Now or never, ladies.
Alice, you're killing me.
You're killing me, Alice!
You're goddamn killing me!

You're gonna lose!
You're gonna lose!
Stilwell!
Come here!
Evelyn!
You keep that kid away from me for just one game!
EVELYN:
Stilwell, come here.
Ellen Sue, how's it looking?
- Good.
- Feeling good?
Looking good!
- Nice and warm?
- Warm.
Good.
Alice, if Ellen Sue doesn't have anything, don't keep it a secret.
You tell me.
You tell me right away.
You understand me?
Do you hear me?
!
Yeah, you're screaming.
I hear you.
Where'd you come from?
We got as far as Yellowstone Park and turned back.
Have trouble with the bears, did you?
I was fine until that scout walked into our barn.
I'm no quitter.
Wait.
Wait a minute!
Hold it!
Who said you could play?
Alice has been catching for us the last six games.
She looks pretty good.
Ow.
You don't want me to play?
Well, you're already dressed.
Hell, if you want to play,
I don't care.
You can play.
- Well, then, I'll play.
- Okay.
Good.

Good catch!
Thank goodness.
Go get them!

Wallace'll stop at third.
Whoa!

What are you do--?
Go, go, go!
All the way, all the way!
I'm sorry!
Shoot!
ANNOUNCER:
Wallace scampers home, and the Belles take the lead, 1 to nothing!
They're dancing in the aisles here in Racine!
Yeah!
MAN:
Go Peaches, go Peaches!
Evelyn!
I know.
I know.
I know.
You're still missing the cutoff man.
That's something I would like you to work on before next season.
Right.
Okay.
All right.
Thanks.
Thank you, Mr. Dugan.
Thanks.
All right, let's get this one!
All right, come on!
We need some runs out there.
Come on, we need runs.

Bring me home.
UMPIRE:

But with tying and go-ahead runs in scoring position.

Okay, let's get out of this inning!
Come on!
Let's go.

Throw smoke!

She'll have to go for this one to the stands!
For the final out to retire the side.
But the damage has been done.
Right here in Racine, Rockford leads our Belles, 2 to 1 as we go to the bottom of the 9th.
Come on, it's okay.
You gotta bat now.
Relax!
Kit, one run and we are back in this ball game.
Shake it off.
You gotta hit.
It's okay, Kit.
Okay, come on now.
Make her pitch to you.
Let's go.
Hey, come on.

You're the hitter now.
Let's go.

The last batter standing in Rockford's way is Kit Keller.
Kit is 1 for 3 today.

High fastballs.
She can't hit them, can't lay off them.
All right.
All right, if we just hold them now, we got it!
Come on!
Come on, Ellen Sue!
One, two, three!

Ellen Sue!
One more!
One more!

It falls in there!
No one'll get to this ball!
This should tie it up!
Hendricks is rounding third!
She will score!
Keller is heading for third!
Gardner hits the relay man with a frozen rope!
The coach is giving Keller the stop sign at third!
But she is not stopping!
She runs through the stop sign!
She is not stopping!

Hinson dropped the ball!
The ball game is over!

I have seen enough to know I have seen too much!
CROWD [CHANTING]:
Kit, Kit, Kit, Kit.
Come on.
You played a good game.
Well, what do you say?
All right, Ira.
We'll stick with it.
My mother always used to say, "If at first you don't succeed--"
You don't have to spend the next six months in Saskatchewan.
Alice, you told me it's lovely.
Yeah, if you like ice fishing.
I thought we were gonna win, I swear.
Well, we didn't.
Up to that last inning, we had it.
I'm so depressed, I could eat a cow.
Hey, Dottie.
It's all right.
You know?
You did good.
Get dressed.
See you on the bus.
Thanks, Mae.
Here.
Thanks.
Wanna be a ballplayer when you get big?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
What's your name?
Angelina.
ANGELINA:

KIT:
Here you go.
You gotta practice really hard.
What's your name?

How much are these?

Okay, well, you guys be good.

Bye!
Oh.
Dottie, look, um...
I'm sorry I knocked you over.
No, you're not.
You blocked the entire plate!
How do you expect--
You did what you had to.
You just beat me.
You wanted it more than me.
I jammed my shoulder, if it makes you feel any better.
A little.
Bob and I are driving back to Oregon.
You're welcome to come with us.
No.
You two should be alone.
I'd just be in the way.
When do you think you'll be coming home?
Well, some of the girls talked about staying around here and getting jobs.
I really like it here.
Christmas?
Um...
I...
Uh, I don't know.
But you're coming back next year, right?
No.
I wanna have kids.
We wanna have kids.
Dottie, you got plenty of time to have kids.
You couldn't give this up.
You'd miss it.
Miss it?
Heh.
Miss putting on all this gear?
Catching a double-header in 100-degree heat?
Pushing the bus in mud?
Getting slammed into every other day by a base runner?
Think I'm gonna miss that?
Yeah.
- I'll tell you what I'll miss.
- What?
Well, I'll miss the girls.
I'll miss you, Kit.
Me?
Yeah.
How many sisters do you think I have?
I love you, Kit.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Just when I want you to stay, you're leaving.
Well, thank you for getting me into the league, Dottie.
You got yourself in the league.
I got you on the train.
Play great.
Like you.
You stay in touch, you hear?
Come home every once in a while.
If you don't, I'll come back and hit line drives at your head, okay?
Go on.
I love you.
And you are gonna miss this.
- I don't care what you say.
- Yeah.
JIMMY:
There's the winner!
Good game, Jimmy.
Good game, good manager.
Jimmy Dugan.
- Hi, I'm a big fan of yours.
- Hi.
Yeah?
I'm Dottie's husband.
Oh, hey, hey.
Well, then I'm a big fan of yours.
Yeah.
Well...
Old man Harvey just offered me a job managing next year in Wichita.
Wow.
Triple A?
That's great.
Good luck.
I turned him down.
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?
I already got a job.
I'll see you.
- All right.

ANNOUNCER:
This week in the world of sports.
With the boys overseas and off to war, baseball pitches in for the war effort.
Trading bats for bullets, Yankee Joe DiMaggio promises to give those Nazis a jolt.
Ace fireballer Bob Feller has traded Cleveland gray for Navy blue.
Baseball's biggest stars say:
"Look out, Mr. Hitler.
The Yanks are coming."
Not to mention the Indians, Red Sox and Tigers.
And they won't come back till it's over, over there.
Meanwhile, Chicago club owner Walter Harvey, the candy-bar king, met with other team owners at the Harvey Mansion as rumors persist that baseball may be shut down for the duration of the war.
Harvey's promotional whiz kid, Ira Lowenstein, has been given the job of figuring out how to keep baseball going.
Good luck, Mr. Lowenstein.

Wait a second, Doris.
I can't wait much longer, so get up.
Yeah, so?
Yeah, so I ain't done yet.
Watch this.
That's it?
You can't do it, Mae.
I could do it.
How long you been working on that, Doris?
That?
Took me a year.
Yeah.
Not counting the two months I was in the hospital.
Bat hit me right in the head.
Bam.
Really?
Yup.
Your head and not your behind?
That looks really swollen.
What kind of thing is that to say?
I'm joking.
I'm nervous, all right?
I don't...
What are you looking at?
Yeah, what?
Nothing.
Yeah, nothing.
That's right, nothing.
All these girls gonna be in the league?
You wish.
You do wish.
Four teams.
Sixteen girls to a team.
That's right.
Sixty-four girls.
Yeah.
What are you, a genius?
Ha-ha-ha.
They got over 100 girls here, so some of youse will have to go home.
Yeah, sorry about that.
Come on, Doris.
What do you mean, "some of us"?
Do it.
Okay, some of them are going home.
Hey.
How did you do that?
Excuse me.
Hey.
Hey.
You caught that.
Hello?

ANNOUNCER:
And now, from Chicago, The Mutual presents another social commentary by Miss Maida Gilespie.
MAIDA [OVER RADIO]:
Careers and higher education are leading to the masculinization of women with enormously dangerous consequences to the home, the children and our country.
[I N VOICE-OVER] When our boys come home from war, what kind of girls will they be coming home to?
And now, the most disgusting example of this sexual confusion, Mr. Walter Harvey of Harvey Bars is presenting us with women 's baseball.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
Right here in Chicago, young girls plucked from their families are gathered at Harvey Field to see which one of them can be the most masculine.
Mr. Harvey, like your candy bars, you are completely nuts.

I never cared for the game myself, but I love grass.
It costs a fortune to keep like this, with the mowing and trimming.
But I grew up in an apartment.
I had one lousy plant in a cheese box.
Now look.
I got a park.
These are my in-laws.
Hello!
They can't hear nothing.
Enough socializing.
Jimmy, I'm thinking of giving you another managing job.
Oh, well, Mr. Harvey,
I guarantee I'll do a better job than last time.
You kind of let me down on that San Antonio job.
Yeah, yeah.
I had no right to sell off the team's equipment like that.
That won't happen again.
Let me be blunt.
Are you still a fall-down drunk?
Well, that is blunt.
Ahem.
No, sir.
I've quit drinking.
You've seen the error of your ways?
No, I just can't afford it.
[LAUGHS]
That's funny to you?
Your drinking is funny?
You're a young man, Jimmy.
You still could be playing if you just would've laid off the booze.
Well, it's not exactly like that.
I hurt my knee.
You fell out of a hotel.
That's how you hurt it!
JIMMY:
There was a fire.
Which you started, which I had to pay for.
JIMMY:
I was gonna send you a thank-you card, but I wasn't allowed anything sharp to write with.
Look, Jimmy, I want you to manage one of the new girls' baseball teams.
Don't look so stunned.
Face it.
You're still a name.
You step out of the dugout before every game.
You wave your little hat.
You give the people a thrill.
Why not get an organ grinder?
I can hop around and dance.
If your knees are up to it, go ahead.
Mr. Harvey,
I hit 487 home runs for your baseball club.
Three in the World Series, two in Game 4 alone.
I know that.
That's why I'm giving you this job.

Nice piece of coaching, Jimmy.
Especially in the 5th inning when you scratched your balls for an hour.
Yeah, well, anything worth doing is worth doing right.
Yes, indeed.
Until you did that, I couldn't tell if you were drunk or dead.
It was made very clear to me what I'm supposed to do here.

I smile, wave my little hat, and I did that.
So when do I get paid?
You have some good ballplayers.
If you'll only give them...
Ballplayers!
I haven't got ballplayers!
I've got girls!
Girls are what you sleep with after the game, not what you coach during it.
If we paid you more, could you be just a little more disgusting?
Well, I could certainly use the money.

Anyone ever tell you you look like a penis with a hat on?
You're out of here!
I heard that!
You misunderstood.
Ten seconds!
You misunderstood!
You can't throw me out knowing you've got a strike zone...
Off this field!
Get in that dugout!
Get off this field!
You're out.
I can't believe no one ever called you that before!
That's where you belong.
I'm in charge now.
All right, who's up here?
Who's up?
ANNOUNCER:
The crowd's light today, what with the tractor show in town.
If you're nearby, and you must be, since this isn't a powerful radio station, come on down to the ballpark and bring the kiddies.
People better start showing up.
We don't have fans, we don't have a league.
Ladies, you all look wonderful.
Mr. Lowenstein.
Hello.
Hi.
There's a reporter and a photographer in the stands from LIFE magazine.
WOMAN 1:
We're famous!
WOMAN 2:
LIFE magazine?
Don't waste your time, Doris.
ALICE:
We get that in Saskatchewan.
Dottie,
I'm trying to get them to do a story about you.
Me?
Why me?
You're the "Queen of Diamonds." That's what I'm calling you.
Did you tell them about me?
I told them how at first, the scout didn't even want you, but how Dottie wouldn't come without her kid sister.
They loved it.
They really loved it.
A real human-interest story.
So will you just try to give them something spectacular out there?
Anything.
Why, what's the matter?
Well, Mae, we're not doing so well.
Harvey and the other owners think they've made a mistake.
They're talking about closing you down.
What?
What are you talking about?
They can't close us down here.
What kind of a thing is that?
What's it mean?
They're businessmen.
No profit, no product.
And what am I supposed to do, huh?
Go back to taxi dancing?
Ten cents so some slob can sweat gin all over me?
I'm never doing that again.
So you tell old rich Mr. Chocolate Man that he ain't closing me down!
They can't keep us from playing!
KIT:
We'll show them how we play.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
I am trying my best.
So will you just give them everything you've got?
DORIS:
We always do.
ANNOUNCER:
A slick play by Alice Gaspers and there's 2 gone here in the 3rd.
That'll bring up Dee Lynch.
Lynch is the most consistent Belles hitter this year.
DOTTIE:
Okay, burn it in.
ANNOUNCER:
Settles in.
Pops it up!
Foul.
Hinson should have no trouble with this.
She's under it.
Out!
ANNOUNCER:
Uncle Elmore's socks!
What did she do?
Whoo-hoo!
I can't do that.
Who can?
What is her name?
Dottie Hinson.
D-O-T-T-l-E...
Good play.
What the hell was that, hm?
I just thought it might help the league.
JIMMY:
I'm in a goddamn circus!
A triple.
A double would be nice...
All right!
God knows we have a game.
It's not like any of this helps, believe me.
[♪♪♪]
Safe!
[CROWD APPLAUDING]
That was really nice!
All right, all right.
Let's go, girls.
Dozens of people are waiting for the game to start.
[CROWD WHOOPING]
[CHATTERING]
Yeah!
Batter!
What is her name?
Hey you, tall girl!
Beverly.
JIMMY:
Beverly!
Look sharp, tall...
What is her name again?
DOTTIE:
Beverly.
Beverly.
Good.
Good.
Yeah!
Five bucks!
Five bucks!
What if, at a key moment in the game, my uniform bursts open and, oops, my bosoms come flying out?
That might draw a crowd, right?
Think there's men who ain't seen your bosoms?
Thank you.
Marla, what you got?
What about me?
MARLA:
I got a letter from Nelson!
Whoo!
ANNOUNCER:
Fly ball as Dottie Hinson brings the crowd to its feet with a home run!
BOTH:
Twenty-two!
Yeah.
We love you, 22!
Hey.
Come on!
Open your mouth!
Evelyn.
Kid!
Kid!
The kid ate the lineup!
Right here.
Aah!
[CHATTERING]
I'm so happy!
Thank you.
Thanks so much.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I love you.
I'm so happy.
MARLA:
I'll be back next season.
DORIS:
Marla.
See you next season!
MAN:
Bye, Marla.
MARLA:
Bye.
Bye!
Slide!
Slide!
UMPIRE:
Safe!
Thank you!
Let it up.
Let it up.
And...
Ooh, that was a good one.
ANNOUNCER:
A fly ball to left!
WOMAN:
Get under it!
ANNOUNCER:
Betty Spaghetti makes the catch!
Brock tags up.
Spaghetti makes the throw!
It's gonna be close!
And...
DOTTIE:
Oh!
Aunt Edna's bridgework!
She is out!
Out!
ANNOUNCER:
Dottie Hinson held onto the ball!
Oh, doctor!
[♪♪♪]
A lot of ballplayers use it.
[♪♪♪]
Out!
[CROWD CHEERING]
ANNOUNCER:
High foul pop.
It's coming back!
Coming back!
Uh-oh.
ANNOUNCER:
She caught it!
Unbelievable!
Full house on its feet cheering Dottie Hinson!
[♪♪♪]
That sounded good.
Yeah.
You haven't got a curve ball left.
I don't?
!
You haven't had a curve ball since...
Have you been watching?
[♪♪♪]
[CROWD CHEERING]
[WOMEN CHEERING]
Safe!
Safe!
[MUSIC SOFTLY PLAYING ON RADIO]
Aha.
Okay.
He's good-looking.
What's he do when not in the Army?
Dairy assistant manager.
He's gonna be manager someday.
He's real smart.
So he's good-looking and smart.
There's so few of us.
Where did you say he was again?
Italy?
Yeah, I think.
I haven't got a letter from him in three weeks.
I used to get one every week.
Well, that doesn't mean anything.
If he's in combat, it's not like there's a mailbox on every corner.
Besides, if something happened, you would've got a telegram.
Oh, God, don't...
But he's fine.
No, he's fine.
How come you're not in the Army?
I have no cartilage in my knee.
Not that you need cartilage to shoot Nazis.
You need this, right?
Trigger finger.
I could do that.
Heh.
Right.
How did I get so useless so fast?
[ANNOUNCER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON RADIO]
[JIMMY SIGHS]
Boys really like this on your fingers?
It works for me.
Your sister's not gonna be mad?
[WHISPERS] I don't care.
Listen, when, uh...
Bob.
Bob comes back, are you gonna keep playing?
Oh, no.
You could just quit like that?
Sure.
You play like you love it.
No.
No.
Does he know how good you are?
Bob?
No, Hitler.
Yes, Bob.
How good am I?
You stink.
You're lousy.
You're only the best player in the league.
You don't know that?
Well...
You ever been married?
Well, let me think.
Yeah, twice.
Any children?
One of them was, yeah, yeah.
[CHUCKLES]
Is she out?
Yeah.
Well, I think it's time for a drink.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[BOTTLE OPENS]
These really don't mix.
Here.
Ah...
Ha-ha-ha.
[SIGHS]
DOTTIE:
Good, huh?
JIMMY:
Oh, yeah.
It's great.
UMPIRE:
Fair ball!
[GRUNTS]
Time!
ANNOUNCER:
Jimmy Dugan pops his head out of the dugout.
He's on his way to talk to his hurler.
Kit Keller looks mighty tired.
Game's getting pretty exciting.
I'll finish it right here.
I'll strike this turkey out.
Betty's ready to come in.
Come on.
I've never been taken out before.
Ask Dottie.
I really wanna finish this game, Jimmy.
Please?
What do you think?
Well, you know, she's battling.
What do you think?
She's done.
She's throwing grapefruits.
Blue!
ANNOUNCER:
Oh!
It looks like Keller's coming out of the game, and she is not happy about it!
MAN:
Nice job, Kit!
ANNOUNCER:
Betty Horn sprints in from the left-field bullpen.
Look at this crowd.
This is great.
They're jumping, hopping, cheering and they paid to get in.
You did a fabulous job.
I won't forget this.
Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey.
I appreciate it, coming from you.
But to be perfectly honest, I think the girls deserve most of the credit.
Oh, they're great.
Fortunately, we won't need them anymore.
Do you want a peanut?
No.
What do you mean?
What do you mean, what do I mean?
We're winning the war.
Our situation changed.
Roosevelt himself said, "Men's baseball won't be shut down."
So we won't need the girls next year.
Bases loaded.
Bottom of the 9th.
Rockford up 6 to 2.
Two men out.
No balls, 2 strikes.
DOTTIE:
Okay, Betty, right here.
UMPIRE:
Strike 3!
ANNOUNCER:
And that is the ball game!
Rockford is in the playoffs!
[CROWD APPLAUDING AND WHISTLING]
I love these girls.
I don't need them, but I love them.
Look at that.
Come on.
Let's go.
Oh, look at me.
I'm full of peanuts!
I've got peanuts all over myself.
This is what it's gonna be like in the factories too, I suppose.
"Men are back.
Turn in your rivets."
We told them it was their patriotic duty to get out and go to work.
When the men come back, they're sent back to the kitchen.
Should we send the boys returning from war back to the kitchen?
Come on.
Excuse me.
Do you know how dedicated they are?
What they go through?
They play with sprained ankles, broken fingers.
They ride a bus all night to play a double-header the next morning.
I'll make it up to them.
What?
With Harvey Bars?
I'm getting tired of listening to you, Ira.
I'd like your permission to take over the league.
What?
Do you understand?
All of the owners are getting out.
There's no point to it anymore.
Just let them finish the season, and that's it!
I sold your product when there was no product.
This is a product!
There is no room for girls' baseball in this country once the war is over.
They're through.
I think you're wrong.
And I'm gonna prove it to you, Mr. Harvey!
Hi, my name's Mae.
That's more than a name, that's an attitude.
Here's my friend Doris.
Best player on the team.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Smile for the camera.
Thank you, Mae.
You're the best.
The game put us in the playoffs.
I could have finished.
Stilwell could've hit off you.
What's the matter?
Too big to finish your own games now?
[LAUGHS]
Hey!
Don't start with me, Kit.
Don't you start with me.
Don't start!
DOTTIE:
Kit, come on, cut it out!
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
[GRUNTS]
DORIS:
What the hell are you doing?
!
WOMAN 1:
Hey, you guys.
DORIS:
Get off of me!
WOMAN 2:
Jimmy!
WOMAN 3:
Stop it!
[WOMEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
Get off of her.
Get your sister off of her!
Stay out of it!
You stay out of it!
Doris!
[MEN CHUCKLING]
KIT:
You just wait, Doris!
Let me down!
Let me down!
Ow!
[YELLING]
You stay down there and you cool off!
Why'd she do it?
She was vulnerable.
You provoked her.
Shut up, Helen!
You're making her more upset.
Really!
I don't need it from Helen too.
Take a shower.
Leave me.
I'm not taking a shower.
She reminds me of my husband.
[SHOWERS RUNNING]
DOTTIE:
Save some hot water for me, you guys.
You okay?
My rear end hurts where Jimmy dropped me.
You acted like a baby out there.
You treat me like a baby.
I treated you like a pitcher who'd lost her stuff.
When Betty's in trouble, you nurse her.
Every pitch, you're backing her up!
I seem to remember last week somebody throwing a rosin bag in my face.
Told me to get my fat ass behind the plate.
Was that you or the umpire?
KIT:
You could've backed me up today instead of holding me back.
I hold you back?
[♪♪♪]
It's like at home.
It's like if you're here, then I'm not here.
What does that mean?
I don't know what I mean.
I know I'm wrong.
I know you're right and I'm wrong.
I know that.
I just...
You...
I just get so mad!
Why do you gotta be so good, huh?
Hey, Kit.
Kit.
Ah, Dottie, there you are.
You weren't on the bus.
Could I speak to you a minute?
I have to leave.
Oh.
Don't worry.
The bus wouldn't leave without you.
No.
I'm going home.
I'm leaving the team.
What?
Why?
What...
I have to go home.
Home?
You can't go home now.
No, it...
This couldn't come at a worse time.
You see, we're in a bit of a crisis, and I have to try to pull something off.
It's not a good time to lose our most popular player.
What's the problem?
Maybe I can help.
I don't wanna talk about it.
It's personal?
It's one of the girls, isn't it?
It's Mae, right?
No.
Kit, that's it.
I've noticed there's some friction.
That's fine.
That's no problem.
Doesn't mean you have to quit.
I can arrange a trade.
Like Racine?
Kenosha?
South Bend?
Trade me or whatever.
But figure it out by tomorrow.
Otherwise, I'm going home.
Tomorrow?
Fine!
I'll work everything out by tomorrow.
You really gave me a scare there for a second.
Hey, does anybody have any extra hose?
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Mae, your date's here.
How do I look?
Where'd you get that dress?
Borrowed it.
It don't fit.
It's too tight.
I don't plan on wearing it that long.
[GASPS]
I don't know why you get dressed at all.
[ON RADIO] ♪ Choo choo, ch-boogie Take me right back to the track ♪♪
Where's Dottie?
In there.
WOMAN 1:
Wanna go to the movies with me?
WOMAN 2:
You wanna go with me?
KIT:
You bitch!
What?
I've been traded to Racine!
You?
I told them to trade me.
Oh, yeah, they'd really trade you.
Miss Star, Miss Perfect.
You knew what was gonna happen!
DOTTIE:
I didn't!
WOMAN 1:
This'll be better than the movies.
I'll quit.
Is that what you want?
Then they'll blame me for you quitting!
What do you want me to do?
Stay away from me.
Leave me alone!
That's what I want you to do!
Kit, listen to me.
It was all a mistake, okay?
A big mistake.
I was getting too good.
You won't listen.
I knew if I did too good, you'd do something to push me down!
Blow it out your rear end!
I'm sick of being blamed for everything bothering you.
I got you into this league!
[WHISPERING] She got her in the league.
I didn't even wanna be here!
Then why are you still here?
Kit wants to know why she's still playing.
[WOMEN WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY]
My train leaves at 8:00.
I got 10 minutes to pack.
If you have trouble, you know who to blame.
KIT:
I'll see you in the World Series.
DOTTIE:
Yeah, you bet you will.
DORIS:
Don't look at her.
Don't look.
Huh?
Oh.
Has anyone seen my new red hat?
Oh, piss on your hat!
Well, that seemed uncalled for.
STILWELL:
Mommy!
Just keep it down, okay?
Kit's off our team.
WOMAN 3:
She's not!
DORIS:
Yes, she is.
Are you deaf?
Kit?
Kit, you need any help in there?
Don't act like this.
You're still in the league.
You're just on another team, that's all.

It was a sniper.
I was lucky though.
He got seven of us before we got him.
Oh, sweetie!
Oh, sweetie!
It's all right.
I made it.
I missed you so much.
I've been discharged.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
It's all over.
I'm here, baby.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, listen.
You have to sit down here.
I'll clear all this stuff off.
I almost forgot how beautiful you are.
Oh, no.
I look terrible.
You look beautiful.
You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I love you.
Can we just hold each other for the rest of our lives?
That's my plan.
Why am I the only person on this bus?
What are we waiting for?
Are you physically unable to show up on time?

Was I?
Yeah.
It is only a game, Jimmy.
It's only a game, and I don't need this.
I have Bob.
I don't need this.
I don't.
I gave away five years at the end of my career to drinking.
Five years.
There isn't anything I wouldn't give to get back any one day of it.
Well, we're different.
That's chickenshit!
You wanna go home and make 100 babies, great.
I can't tell anyone how to live.
But sneaking out like this, quitting...
You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
Baseball is what gets inside you.
It's what lights you up.
You can't deny that.
It just got too hard.
It's supposed to be hard.
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it.
The hard is what makes it great.

You don't have to spend the next six months in Saskatchewan.

Yeah, if you like ice fishing.
I thought we were gonna win, I swear.
Well, we didn't.
Up to that last inning, we had it.

Dottie, look, um...
I'm sorry I knocked you over.
No, you're not.
You blocked the entire plate!
How do you expect...
You did what you had to.
You just beat me.
You wanted it more than me.
I jammed my shoulder, if it makes you feel any better.
[♪♪♪]
A little.
Bob and I are driving back to Oregon.
You're welcome to come with us.
No.
You two should be alone.
I'd just be in the way.
When do you think you'll be coming home?
Well, some of the girls talked about staying around here and getting jobs.
I really like it here.
Christmas?
Um...
I...
Uh, I don't know.
But you're coming back next year, right?
No.
I wanna have kids.
We wanna have kids.
Dottie, you got plenty of time to have kids.
You couldn't give this up.
You'd miss it.
Miss it?
Heh.
Miss putting on all this gear?
Catching a double-header in 100-degree heat?
Pushing the bus in mud?
Getting slammed into every other day by a base runner?
Think I'm gonna miss that?
Yeah.
I'll tell you what I'll miss.
What?
Well, I'll miss the girls.
I'll miss you, Kit.
Me?
Yeah.
How many sisters do you think I have?
I love you, Kit.
Really?
Yeah.
Just when I want you to stay, you're leaving.
Well, thank you for getting me into the league, Dottie.
You got yourself in the league.
I got you on the train.
Play great.
Like you.
You stay in touch, you hear?
Come home every once in a while.
If you don't, I'll come back and hit line drives at your head, okay?
Go on.
I love you.
And you are gonna miss this.
I don't care what you say.
Yeah.

You might need that.
Where'd you find this?
It was in one of those cartons.
Needs oil.
Who doesn't?
You ready?
- I'm not going.
- Mom!
I've got two children, I don't need a third.
Why is it so important that I go?
For one thing, it'd be nice if you just left the room.
Besides, these are your old friends.
They probably won't remember me.
The "Queen of Diamonds," Dottie Hinson?
Margaret, it just isn't a good idea.
Come on, Mom.
You'll get to see Aunt Kit.
- You never see each other.
- We still won't.
She'll be traveling around with that husband of hers.
Frank.
He has a name.
He's always been very nice to you.
He makes me nervous.
There's a lot of reasons why I can't go.
Honey I'm not comfortable about this.
I'm not really part of it.
It was never that important.
It was just something I did.
When will you realize how special it was, how much it all meant?
I know how you feel.
I really do.
But you're going.
Car.
- Car, train, bus.
I'm tired already.
- Sleep on the plane.
Grandma's out.
Is there a fire?
Wisenheimer.
Julie's watching you.
I don't want any bad reports.
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye.
Jeffrey, come here.
No matter what your brother does, he's littler than you.

This week in the world of sports.
With the boys overseas and off to war baseball pitches in for the war effort.
Trading bats for bullets, Yankee Joe DiMaggio promises to give those Nazis a jolt.
Ace fireballer Bob Feller has traded Cleveland gray for Navy blue.
Baseball's biggest stars say "Look out, Mr. Hitler.
The Yanks are coming. "
Not to mention the Indians, Red Sox and Tigers.
And they won't come back till it's over, over there.
Meanwhile, Chicago club owner Walter Harvey, the candy-bar king met with other team owners at the Harvey Mansion as rumours persist that baseball may be shut down for the duration of the war.
Harvey's promotional whiz kid, Ira Lowenstein has been given the job of figuring out how to keep baseball going.
Good luck, Mr. Lowenstein.
Strike 2!
Hey, fatso!
Get the hell out of the way!
What are you, crazy?
Strike 3!
Kit!
- Sis, don't swing at her high pitch.
- I can hit it.
- You can't.
- I can.
This bat's too heavy.
You'll never get it around.
I will!
Listen.
There's a big hole on the right side.
Don't look.
- Unless she pitches inside, pull it.
- I know.
Batter up!
No high ones.
I like the high ones!
- Mule!
- Nag!

Keep your eye on the ball.

Two away!
Better luck next time!

Okay, Dottie!
Batter up!
Right in here!
Bring them in there, Dottie!
Ball!
Keep your eye on it, Dottie!
One hit and we win!
That's it, Dottie!
You did it!
That's the ball game!
Hey, Kit!
What are you swinging those high ones for?
Good thing your sister bailed you out.
How about the two bucks you owe me for this game?
Kit!
Wait up, I'll give you a ride!
Stop kicking the rocks.
I'm sorry.
- That game just made me so mad.
- We won.
Get mad if we lose.
That last pitch was right down the middle.
If I'd have swung at that, I'd be the hero.
- You got me so crazy-
- I only said lay off the high ones.
"Good thing your sister bailed you out. "
"Kit, why don't you get your sister to teach you how to hit?"
"Why can't you be beautiful like your sister?"
What idiot said that?
No one.
- But that's what they were thinking.
- No, it's not!
You ever hear Dad introduce us to people?
"This is our daughter Dottie.
This is our other daughter, Dottie's sister.
Should've just had you and bought a dog.
- Mitch Swaley likes you.
- He's one step up from dating pigs.
But an important step.
- Why are you walking so fast?
- Why are you?
- Because you are.
- Can't even let me walk faster than you?
Girls, you got chores to do.
Don't run!
You'll scare the chickens!
I don't have time for these games.
- Why are you running?
- You can go faster than that.
Your legs are longer.
- I win!
- Barely.
Hey!
Hey, yourself.
Doesn't that hurt them?
Doesn't seem to.
It would bruise the hell out of me.
Who are you?
I'm Ernie Capadino, baseball scout.
I saw you playing today.
Not bad, not bad.
Ever hear of Walter Harvey?
Harvey Bars?
You know, the candy?
Yeah, we feed them to the cows when they're constipated.
He's starting a girls' baseball league so we can make a buck while the boys are overseas.
Wanna play?
Nice retort.
Tryouts are in Chicago.
It's a real league, professional.
Professional baseball?
They'll pay you $75 a week.
We only make $30 at the dairy.
Then this would be more, wouldn't it?
Interested?
Come on. $75 a week?
Pull her leg.
Mine are long enough.
Look, your country needs you.
You can not only play ball, but you're kind of a dolly.
Oh, now I get it.
Listen, mister.
I'm a married woman.
My husband's overseas.
Oh, relax!
I'm talking lookie, no touchie.
We want girls easy on the eye.
I'll go.
I'm ready now.
I gotta sign something?
I don't want you!
I want her!
The one who hit the ball!
You can climb back under the cow.
She's good.
She's very good.
She pitches.
She didn't today, because she did yesterday.
Thanks for that special glimpse into her life.
I want you.
You I saw, you I like.
The train leaves for Chicago tomorrow.
What do you say?
Are you in?
No, thanks.
"No, thanks"?
Hey, no skin off my Ashtabula.
If you wanna pluck cows, that's your business.
You know something?
You're not nice.
That one hurt.
So long, milkmaids.
No, wait!
Just watch me pitch.
Dottie, get your mitt!
I'll throw him a few.
Now look I know the goods when I see the goods, and she's the goods.
I'm sorry.
Will you shut up?
!
You're a pitcher, huh?
I'll tell you what.
If she comes, you can come too.
If you stink, it only costs us the train ticket.
Get these wild animals away from me!
Haven't you ever heard of a leash?
Come on, Dottie.
You got the whole rest of your life to hang around here.
Never go anywhere.
Never do anything.
I'm married.
I'm happy.
It's what I want.
Don't confuse things.
But can't you just have this first?
Just so you can say you once did something?
Something special?
Goodness sake, Kit!
Keep your voice down.
Your father's listening to the radio.
Please, Dottie?
I gotta get out of here.
I'm nothing here.
In the Pacific Northwest, my territory we have increased sales 106% in the last 12-month period.
And this with a war on!
You know, if I had your job, I'd kill myself.
Sit here.
I'll see if I can dig up a pistol.
Every trip I take, I gotta sit next to one of these guys.
I'm just too friendly.
Hey, isn't that-?
Well, I'll say one thing for them.
They can run.
Mr. Capadino!
I got her!
Look!
- Sir, your knee.
- Like it?
Stop the train!
Come on!
Come on!
Give me that bag!
Did you promise the cows you'd write?
When do we get to Chicago?
We gotta make a stop.
Fort Collins, Colorado.
Gotta look at another girl.
Hope you're not jealous.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, honey.
That was good form.
Thattagirl!
Good, honey.
Good.
Nice, nice.
That's a rope, honey.
Good girl.
Good, good.
Right, too high.
She's got an eye like DiMaggio.
Okay, Marla.
Now lefty.
She's really good.
She's your daughter?
Her mom's dead.
It's just the two of us.
Coach said if she was a boy, she'd go to the state tournament.
I said, "If she was a boy, I'd talk to the Yankees instead of living here."
That's enough.
You can bring her over.
Okay, Marla.
Come here.
Boys!
Hit the showers!
Take off your hat, honey.
We'll let you know.
Daddy, I'm sorry.
Let's go.
We'll miss the train.
Let's move, move, move!
What's the matter?
I can't use her.
She's great.
Why not?
What's the problem?
You know General Omar Bradley?
There's too strong a resemblance.
You ain't taking her because she ain't pretty?
Well, look who just caught up!
All right.
Come on, let's go.
Pick those suitcases up!
Come on!
I'm not kidding.
Move!
- One foot in front of the other.
- Mister?
I know my girl ain't so pretty as these girls.
But that's my fault.
I raised her like I would a boy.
I didn't know any better.
She loves to play.
Don't make my girl suffer because I messed up raising her.
Please?
I wish you had a decent mitt.
I think maybe I'd better not go.
No, you can relace it.
It'll be okay.
I mean, who's gonna take care of you?
Cook?
Help you take care of the equipment?
Don't you worry about me.
You'll play baseball.
I'm not gonna know anybody.
Nothing's ever gonna happen here.
You gotta go where things happen.
I love you, Daddy.
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, honey.
Are you coming?
See, how it works is, the train moves, not the station.
This is making me sick.
Write to me, honey.
I love you.
Hey, cowgirls, see the grass?
Don't eat it.
Okay, girls, this is it.
Harvey Field.
Tryouts.
Get out there.
Show them what you got.
Don't embarrass me.
It's been a thin slice of heaven.
Goodbye.
Wait.
You're going?
Dry your eyes.
I'm going home.
Grab a shower and a shave.
Give the wife a pickle-tickle, and I'm on my way.
I'll see you.
- But-
- But what?
Field!
Tryouts!
Play!
That's it!
Get lost!
I hate when they get attached to me like that.
- Hey, Mae.
- What?
- Come look at this.
- Wait a second, Doris.
I can't wait much longer, so get up.
Yeah, so?
Yeah, so I ain't done yet.
Watch this.
- That's it?
- You can't do it, Mae.
I could do it.
How long you been working on that, Doris?
Took me a year.
Not counting the two months I was in the hospital.
Bat hit me right in the head.
Your head and not your behind?
That looks really swollen.
- What kind of thing is that to say?
- I'm joking, okay?
I'm nervous.
- What are you looking at?
- Yeah, what?
Nothing.
That's right, nothing.
All these girls gonna be in the league?
- You wish.
- You do wish.
- Four teams.
Sixteen girls to a team.
- That's right.
Sixty-four girls.
What are you, a genius?
They got over 100 girls here, so some of youse will have to go home.
- Sorry about that.
- Come on, Doris.
What do you mean, "some of us"?
- Okay, some of them are going home.
- How'd you do that?
Excuse me.
You caught that.
Hello?
Let's go practice.
She caught it with her bare hand.
And now, from Chicago, The Mutual presents another social commentary by Miss Maida Gilespie.
Careers and higher education are leading to the masculinization of women with enormously dangerous consequences to the home, the children and our country.
When our boys come home from war what kind of girls will they be coming home to?
And now, the most disgusting example of this sexual confusion, Mr. Walter Harvey, of Harvey Bars is presenting us with women's baseball.
Right here in Chicago, young girls plucked from their families are gathered at Harvey Field to see which one of them can be the most masculine.
Mr. Harvey, like your candy bars, you are completely nuts.
Very good.
Try another.
Nice throw!
Your name will be on one of those five lists.
Okay, find your name.
If we could just form two or three parallel lines...
I'm a Peach!
A Rockford Peach!
I made it!
I can stay!
Are you a newspaper guy?
This is my friend Mae.
She made the team.
Come on, we got a lot to do.
Let's settle down.
Now, you're the first-
Honey, are you supposed to be here, or are you on the cut list?
Look, I'm sorry.
If you're on the cut list, you have to leave the field.
Well, are you cut?
Look on the list.
It's either Rockford, Racine, Kenosha or South Bend.
Can you read, honey?
No.
All right, what's your name?
Shirley Baker.
Let's just take a look.
This is you.
You're with us.
You're a Rockford Peach.
Go join your team.
Settle down.
We got a lot to go over.
First, congratulations.
You are the first members of the All-American Girls' Baseball League.
I'm Charlie Collins.
I'll be managing the Racine team when the season starts.
The other teams will have managers soon.
At the end of practice today you all have to get fitted for your uniforms.
And this is what they'll look like.
Pretty darn nifty, if you ask me.
You can't slide in that.
That's a dress.
It's half a dress.
That's not a baseball uniform.
What do you think we are, ballplayers or ballerinas?
It's awfully short.
Short?
I'm gonna have to squat in that thing.
I can't!
My husband will kill me.
Ladies!
Excuse me.
You can't play ball in this, you can't play ball with us.
There are 38 girls getting tickets home who'll play in a bathing suit if I ask.
There's no pockets for my cigarettes.
There is no smoking.
There is also no drinking and no men.
Your social engagements will be cleared through your team chaperones.
You'll have regular classes at charm and beauty school.
For what?
Every girl in this league will be a lady.
And gracefully and grandly.
Gracefully and grandly.
All right, now go back!
And sip.
Down.
Don't slurp.
Sip.
Down.
Don't slurp.
Stop that!
It's good.
Posture!
Heads up.
Backs straight.
And sit.
Right over left.
Legs always together.
A lady reveals nothing.
The hair.
Soften and shorten.
The eyebrows.
Thin and separate.
There should be two.
ery nice.
ery nice!
Lovely!
What do you suggest?
A lot of night games.
I wanna show you the grounds.
You know, I always-
Jimmy, come on.
I'm showing you around.
Beautiful, huh?
Place used to be a golf course.
I never cared for the game, but I love grass.
It costs a fortune, with the mowing and trimming.
But I grew up in an apartment.
I had one lousy plant in a cheese box.
Now look.
I got a park.
These are my in-laws.
Hello!
They can't hear nothing.
Enough socializing.
Jimmy, I'm thinking of giving you another managing job.
Mr. Harvey, I guarantee I'll do a better job than last time.
You kind of let me down on that San Antonio job.
I had no right to sell off the team's equipment like that.
It won't happen again.
Let me be blunt.
Are you still a fall-down drunk?
Well, that is blunt.
No, sir.
I've quit drinking.
You've seen the error of your ways?
No, I just can't afford it.
That's funny to you?
Your drinking is funny?
You're a young man.
You still could be playing if you just would've laid off the booze.
Well, it's not exactly like that.
I hurt my knee.
You fell out of a hotel.
That's how you hurt it!
There was a fire.
Which you started, which I paid for.
I was gonna send you a thank-you card, but I wasn't allowed anything sharp to write with.
I want you to manage one of the new girls' baseball teams.
Don't look so stunned.
Face it.
You're still a name.
You step out of the dugout before every game.
You wave your little hat.
You give the people a thrill.
Get an organ grinder.
I can hop around and dance.
If your knees are up to it, go ahead.
Mr. Harvey I hit 487 home runs for your baseball club.
Three in the World Series, two in game 4 alone.
I know that.
That's why I'm giving you this job.
Take it or leave it.
I gotta feed the fish.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the first game of the All-American Girls' Baseball League!
The South Bend Blue Sox against your own Rockford Peaches.
- Where is he?
- I can't believe he's our manager.
I was listening to the radio when he hit that home run to win the pennant.
I'm asking him to sign my husband's baseball card.
Do you mind?
Could I take a look at that?
Just be careful with it.
If anything happens, he'll come back from the Pacific and kill me.
- Mr. Dugan-
- Mr. Dugan, I'm simply...
Do something, Mae.
Time him.
Give me your watch.
Could be a record.
That counts.
How long?
I ain't gonna ask you again.
Shut up, Doris.
Keep timing.
Hey, Mae, how long?
Boy, that was some good peeing.
Hey, coach.
Mr. Dugan?
Could you sign my husband's baseball card for me?
Great to meet you!
What'll we do?
He didn't give us a lineup.
We can't play without one.
I'll pitch.
I can pitch.
- I thought I was playing centre field.
- No, I am.
Hey, you guys.
Come on.
How hard can it be to make a lineup?
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you do it, Oregon?
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
All right.
Mae, centre field, lead off.
She's good.
And now, the manager of the Peaches former six-time National League Home Run Champ Jimmy Dugan!
Jimmy, look up here!
We love you!
Bullshit.
You can all kiss my ass.
That's right.
Kiss my big hairy ass.
And the Rockford Peaches!
Doris Murphy takes the field!
Lift up your skirt!
This'll be something.
Ain't too many people here.
- You nervous, Doris?
- Yeah.
I ain't.
- Are they laughing at us?
- Yeah, they're laughing at us.
- They hate us.
- Just keep smiling.
Hey, glamour puss!
Can you throw the ball?
All right, ladies, let's play ball!
- Let's play ball.
- Dirt in the skirt!
And now, the lineup for Rockford:
Leading off and playing centre field, number 5, Mae Mordabito!
Batting second and playing 3rd base, number 22, Doris Murphy!
Batting third, the catcher, number 8, Dottie Hinson!
Batting fourth and playing 2nd base, number 32, Marla Hooch.
Girls can't play ball!
Batting fifth...
Look at me!
I'm a ballplayer!
Better look out, I might break a nail!
- number 1, Ellen Sue Gotlander.
- It slipped!
- Batting ninth, pitcher number 23, Kit Keller!
Count's 2 balls and no strikes to Rockford's big catcher, Dottie Hinson.
And it's in the dirt. 3 and 0.
Let's see if Jimmy Dugan gives her the green light on 3 and 0 or gives her the take sign.
Game's tied 2-2, the bottom of the 9th with two runners in scoring position and only 1 out.
From the belt, here's the delivery.
Oh, baby!
She hit the cream cheese out of that one!
Jimmy Dugan, master strategist, had her swinging away!
He sure knows his baseball.
Come on, Dottie!
Make me proud!
A 3-run clout for Dottie Hinson and Rockford wins it, 5 to 2.
Dottie, ladies and gentlemen!
Dottie!
I couldn't believe you hit it right out there!
Can we have your autograph?
Can we, Jimmy?
Not today, boys.
Come back next game.
Nice piece of coaching.
Especially in the 5th inning when you scratched your balls for an hour.
Anything worth doing is worth doing right.
Yes, indeed.
Until you did that, I couldn't tell if you were drunk or dead.
It was made very clear to me what I'm supposed to do here.
I smile wave my little hat, and I did that.
So when do I get paid?
You have some good ballplayers.
If you'll only-
Ballplayers!
I haven't got ballplayers!
I've got girls!
Girls are what you sleep with after the game, not what you coach during it.
If we paid you more, could you be just a little more disgusting?
I could certainly use the money.
On the home front they find them everywhere North, East, South and West, and even Canada.:
Players for the new All-American Girls' Baseball League.
After a month of play the shine still isn't off these Diamond Gals.
Alice "Skeeter" Gaspers says "Legging out a triple is no reason to let your nose get shiny. "
Betty Grable has nothing on these gals.
Helen Haley has not only been on several championship amateur teams she's also an accomplished coffeemaker.
With her husband in the Pacific Betty Horn enjoys cooking spaghetti and knitting.
Her teammates call her "Betty Spaghetti. "
Ellen Sue Gotlander is a former Miss Georgia.
Then there's pretty Dottie Hinson who plays like Gehrig and looks like Garbo.
Fellas, keep your mitts to yourselves.
She's married.
And there's her kid sister Kit, who's as single as they come.
Enough concentrated "oomph" for a whole carload of Hollywood starlets.
And how about Marla Hooch?
What a hitter!
What a lead!
But girls playing baseball?
- Enjoy that?
- Yeah!
Good.
Come back next game, will you?
I'm Evelyn Gardner.
I play right field.
For us.
I just spoke to my husband last night.
He says I can't leave our son with him at home anymore.
See, he says he's too busy reading the want ads and I should just take him with me and shut up about it.
So can I?
Take my son with me on road trips?
Ballplayers...!
He's the sweetest little boy.
Everyone's just gonna love him.
Get this brat off of me!
That's it!
I quit!
Stilwell, angel, come to Mommy.
- You're too young to drive.
- I will.
Watch.
Evelyn!
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to kill your son!
Wait!
The girls have a game!
You can't leave us like this!
Please, Mr. Goosatelli!
Get over here, Stilwell!
I'm gonna kill you!
You can't catch me!
Don't use my bat, use Marla's!
It's heavier!
- Evelyn, why is he so wild?
- I don't know.
Stilwell, angel, have another chocolate bar.
Gimme!
Gimme!
You can't leave us like this.
We're in the middle of nowhere!
- We can't be here!
- No!
Keep him away from me!
He's really a sweetie, Dottie.
- I hope I have five just like him.
- Don't eat the wrapper, honey.
- You gonna come?
- Where you going?
A roadhouse called the Suds Bucket.
No, I'm married.
I'm...
Come on, you ain't on the farm anymore.
Live a little bit.
Girls!
Please!
Mr. Goosatelli shan't be returning.
How you gonna get past Miss Cuthbert?
Mae's gonna poison her dinner.
What is it, baby?
What the hell is going on?
!
Why are we stopped?
Lou quit.
Who's Lou?
The driver.
A car could've came by now.
- Get on the bus!
- Was that English?
I loved you in The Wizard of Oz.
In the 43 years I've practised medicine, I never saw a woman throw up that much.
Maybe that's how she entertains herself, doc.
Hurry!
Come on!
Quiet!
Mae, what did you give her?
Who cares?
It's working.
I'm going, baby!
Come on, way to go, Mae!
I'm coming in!
Catch me!
Did you see me, Kit?
I pretzeled!
- How'd you learn to do that?
- She taught me.
My father owns a dance hall, upstate.
innie's Dance Girls Deluxe.
She was a dancer, I was a bouncer.
You were great!
- Thanks for the ride, kid.
- What's your rush, dollbody?
What do you say we slip in the back seat and you make a man out of me?
What do you say I smack you around?
Can't we do both?
No, I'm not hot.
It's fine.
It's really cold.
- That's better.
- Where's Kit?
I think she's on the dance floor.
There she is.
I got my truck parked outside.
Sorry, we gotta go.
Come on.
Alice, come on.
We gotta go.
We got trouble.
- I knew it.
You killed Miss Cuthbert.
- We'll bury her.
I know a guy-
Lowenstein's coming.
He catches us, we're out of the league.
Let's make like a bread truck and haul buns, ladies.
Let's duck out the back door.
Is this all?
Marla didn't come?
She came.
Well, where is she?
There.
Thinkin' of you
Some others I've seen
What did you do to her?
We just gave her a dress.
And a lot of liquor!
You guys go ahead.
I'll get Marla.
Hurry up, ladies!
Thanks.
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
It had to be you
It had to be you
Marla, honey?
We gotta go.
I'm singing to Nelson!
Ain't I, baby?
You sure are.
I could take her home.
It'd be an honour.
Ain't he something?
Could make me be blue
That's the second time he dropped that Bible since she's been in there.
Come on, girls.
Mae, what'd you say?
Everything.
Here's a good job for you, Jimmy.
Managing girl ballplayers.
You go out there and you wave your little hat around.
Don't drink!
Why would I want to drink?
I'm a goddamn Peach!
God, double play.
Now I'm hitting like a girl.
"But be nice to them.
They're good ballplayers."
There, catch that, blondie!
Now batting for the Rockford Peaches number 5, centre fielder Mae Mordabito!
Here's the pitch.
There's a shot into right centre!
It's up the alley!
She's turning around 1 st!
She's digging up the dirt!
She's heading past 2nd.
She's heading into 3rd!
Dirt in the skirt, Mae!
Dirt in the skirt!
- Safe!
- She's in there with a triple!
Boy, did she smack that one right on the kisser.
No wonder they call her "All-the-Way" Mae.
Triple.
Next batter number 32, 2nd baseman, Marla Hooch.
Evelyn, look at this!
I've got Stilwell's snack on my cleat!
What are you, stupid?
Somebody's gotta run the team.
Someone who actually watches the games.
You're gonna squeeze bunt with our best hitter?
What's the sign to swing away?
Hey, blond girl!
What's the sign?
It's the letters.
A squeeze'll work.
Stop thinking with your tits.
Batter!
Time!
Come on!
Who is the goddamn manager here?
I am!
Then act like it, you big lush!
- You tell him, Dottie!
- About time someone told him.
- I'm ready now.
- Play ball!
Way to go, whatever your name is!
Good bluff!
But I still say you're not ballplayers.
Cemetery boneyard!
Cross your fingers or you'll never get another hit.
Sound it out.
Kimono.
Kimono off and gra-bed...
Grabbed.
...her milky milky white...
What are you giving her to read?
What's the difference?
She's reading.
That's the important thing.
Go away!
Go!
Shoo!
Go ahead, Shirley.
Thanks.
Milky white breasts.
It gets really good after that.
- A delivery boy walks in...
- What are you doing?
I'm writing a song.
Really?
What's it about?
About us.
Could you teach it to me?
Doris, is this your boyfriend?
Is it out of focus?
No, that's how he looks.
Looks aren't the most important thing.
Right.
The important thing is he's stupid, out of work and treats me bad.
Then why...?
Why?
What do you think?
Because none of the other boys ever...
Always made me feel like I was wrong.
Like I was some sort of a weird girl or a strange girl or not even a girl, just because I could play.
I believed them too.
But not anymore.
I mean, look.
There's a lot of us.
I think we're all all right.
We are.
Give me that.
So long, Charlie!
So with 2 runs in the 6th, South Bend gets even.
I've gotta go!
I've gotta go!
You shake it off.
Shake it off.
Say, Evelyn, can I ask you a question?
Which team do you play for?
- I'm a Peach.
- Well, I was just wondering because I couldn't figure out why you'd throw home when we've got a 2-run lead!
You let the tying run get on 2nd, and we lost the lead!
You start using your head!
That's that lump that's three feet above your ass!
Are you crying?
Are you crying?
There's no crying!
There's no crying in baseball!
Leave her alone, Jimmy.
You zip it, Doris!
Rogers Hornsby, my manager, called me a 'talking pile of pig shit'!
That was when my parents came from Michigan to see me play the game!
And did I cry?
No!
Do you know why?
Because there's no crying in baseball.
No crying in baseball!
No crying!
What's the matter?
She's crying, sir.
I didn't mean to do that.
Perhaps you chastised her too vehemently.
Good rule of thumb:
Treat each of them as you would your mother.
Anyone ever tell you you look like a penis with a hat on?
You're out of here!
- I heard that!
- You misunderstood.
- Ten seconds!
- You misunderstood!
You can't throw me out knowing you've got a strike!
Off this field!
I can't believe no one ever called you that before!
That's where you belong.
I'm in charge now.
The crowd's light today, what with the tractor show in town.
If you're nearby, and you must be, since this isn't a powerful radio station...
People better start showing up.
We don't have fans, we don't have a league.
Ladies you all look wonderful.
There's a reporter and a photographer in the stands from Life magazine.
- We're famous!
- Life magazine?
Don't waste your time.
Dottie, I'm trying to get them to do a story about you.
Me?
Why me?
You're the "Queen of Diamonds." That's what I'm calling you.
Did you tell them about me?
I told them how at first, the scout didn't even want you but how Dottie wouldn't come without her kid sister.
They really loved it.
A real human-interest story.
Will you just try to give them something spectacular out there?
Anything.
What's the matter?
Well, we're not doing so well.
Harvey and the other owners think they've made a mistake.
They might close you down.
What are you talking about?
They can't close us down here.
- What kind of a thing is that?
- What's it mean?
They're businessmen.
No profit, no product.
And what am I supposed to do?
Go back to taxi dancing?
Ten cents so some slob can sweat gin all over me?
I'm never doing that again!
So you tell old rich Mr. Chocolate Man that he ain't closing me down!
They can't keep us from playing!
We'll show them how we play.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
I am trying my best.
So will you just give them everything you've got?
We always do.
A slick play by Alice Gaspers and there's 2 gone in the 3rd.
That'll bring up Dee Lynch.
Lynch is the most consistent Belles hitter this year.
Settles in.
Pops it up!
Foul.
Hinson should have no trouble with this.
She's under it.
Uncle Elmore's socks!
What did she do?
I can't do that.
Who can?
- What is her name?
- Dottie Hinson.
D-O-T-T-I-E...
What the hell was that?
I just thought it might help the league.
A goddamn circus!
A double would be nice-
All right!
God knows we have a game.
It's not like any of this helps, believe me.
That was really nice!
Let's go, girls.
Dozens of people are waiting for the game to start.
Batter!
What is her name?
Hey you, tall girl!
Beverly!
Look sharp, tall- What is her name?
Beverly.
Good.
Five bucks!
Five bucks!
What if, at a key moment in the game, my uniform bursts open and my bosoms fly out?
That might draw a crowd, right?
Think there's men who ain't seen your bosoms?
Thank you.
- Marla, what you got?
- What about me?
I got a letter from Nelson!
Fly ball as Dottie Hinson brings the crowd to its feet with a home run!
22!
We love you, 22!
- Come on!
- Open your mouth!
The kid ate the lineup!
Right here.
I'm so happy!
Thank you.
I love you.
I'll be back next season.
See you next season!
Slide!
Slide!
Safe!
Thank you!
Let it up.
Let it up.
That was a good one.
It's a fly ball to left!
Betty Spaghetti makes the catch!
Heads up!
Spaghetti makes the throw!
It's gonna be close!
Aunt Edna's bridgework!
She is out!
Dottie Hinson held onto the ball!
Oh, doctor!
A lot of ballplayers use it.
High foul pop.
It's coming back!
She caught it!
Unbelievable!
Full house on its feet cheering Dottie Hinson!
That sounded good.
- You haven't got a curve ball left.
- I don't?
!
You haven't had one since-
Safe!
Safe!
He's good-looking.
- What's he do when not in the Army?
- Dairy assistant manager.
He'll be manager.
He's smart.
So he's good-looking and smart.
There's so few of us.
Where did you say he was?
Italy?
I think.
I haven't got a letter from him in three weeks.
I used to get one every week.
That doesn't mean anything.
If he's in combat, it's not like there's a mailbox on every corner.
If something happened, you would've got a telegram.
Oh, God, don't-
But he's fine.
No, he's fine.
How come you're not in the Army?
I have no cartilage in my knee.
You don't need it to shoot Nazis.
You need this, right?
Trigger finger.
I could do that.
How did I get so useless so fast?
Boys like this on your fingers?
Works for me.
Your sister's not gonna be mad?
I don't care.
Listen, when...
- Bob.
- ...
Bob comes back will you keep playing?
You could just quit?
Sure.
You play like you love it.
- Does he know how good you are?
- Bob?
No, Hitler.
Yes, Bob.
How good am I?
You stink.
You're lousy.
You're only the best player in the league.
You don't know that?
You ever been married?
Let me think.
Yeah, twice.
Any children?
One of them was.
Is she out?
I think it's time for a drink.
Hang on.
Hang on.
These really don't mix.
- Good, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
It's great.
Fair ball!
Time!
Jimmy Dugan pops his head out of the dugout.
He's on his way to talk to his hurler.
Kit Keller looks mighty tired.
Game's getting exciting.
I'll finish it right here.
I'll strike this turkey out.
Betty's ready to come in.
Come on.
I've never been taken out before.
Ask Dottie.
I really wanna finish this game.
Please?
What do you think?
Well, you know, she's battling.
What do you think?
She's throwing grapefruits.
It looks like Keller's coming out of the game, and she is not happy about it!
Nice job, Kit!
Betty Horn sprints in from the left-field bullpen.
Look at this crowd.
This is great!
They're jumping, cheering and they paid to get in.
You did a fabulous job.
I won't forget this.
Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey.
I appreciate it, coming from you.
But to be perfectly honest, I think the girls deserve most of the credit.
They're great.
Fortunately, we won't need them anymore.
Do you want a peanut?
No.
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We're winning the war.
Our situation changed.
Roosevelt himself said, "Men's baseball won't be shut down."
So we won't need the girls next year.
Bases loaded.
Bottom of the 9th.
Rockford up, 6 to 2.
Two men out.
No balls, 2 strikes.
Strike 3!
And that is the ball game!
Rockford is in the playoffs!
I love these girls.
I don't need them, but I love them.
Come on.
Let's go.
Look at me.
I'm full of peanuts!
I've got peanuts all over myself.
This is what it's gonna be like in the factories too.
"Men are back.
Turn in your rivets."
First, it was their patriotic duty to get out and go to work.
When the men come back, they're sent back to the kitchen.
Should we send the boys returning from war back to the kitchen?
Come on.
Do you know how dedicated they are?
What they go through?
They play with sprained ankles, broken fingers.
They ride a bus all night to play a double-header the next day!
I'll make it up to them.
What?
With Harvey Bars?
I'm getting tired of listening to you, Ira.
I'd like your permission to take over the league.
Do you understand?
All of the owners are getting out.
There's no point to it anymore.
Just let them finish the season, and that's it!
I sold your product when there was no product.
This is a product!
There is no room for girls' baseball in this country once the war is over.
They're through.
I think you're wrong.
And I'm gonna prove it to you, Mr. Harvey!
Hi, my name's Mae.
That's more than a name, that's an attitude.
Here's my friend Doris.
Best player on the team.
- Thank you.
- You're the best.
- The game put us in the playoffs.
- I could've finished.
Stilwell could've hit off you.
What's the matter?
Too big to finish your own games now?
Don't start with me, Kit!
Don't you start with me!
Kit, come on, cut it out!
What the hell are you doing?
!
- Get your sister off of her!
- Stay out of it!
You just wait, Doris!
Let me down!
Let me down!
You stay down there and you cool off!
- Why'd she do it?
- She was vulnerable.
You provoked her.
- Shut up, Helen!
- You're making her more upset.
Really!
- I don't need it from Helen.
- Take a shower.
- I'm not taking a shower.
- She reminds me of my husband.
Save some hot water for me, you guys.
You okay?
My rear end hurts where he dropped me.
You acted like a baby.
You treat me like one.
I treated you like a pitcher who'd lost her stuff.
When Betty's in trouble, you back her up every pitch!
I seem to remember last week, somebody throwing a resin bag in my face.
Told me to get my fat ass behind the plate.
Was that you or the umpire?
You could've backed me up today instead of holding me back.
I hold you back?
It's like at home.
It's like if you're here, then I'm not here.
What's that mean?
I don't know what I mean.
I know I'm wrong.
I know you're right and I'm wrong.
I know that.
I just-
I just get so mad!
Why do you gotta be so good?
Dottie, here you are.
You weren't on the bus.
Can I speak to you a minute?
I have to leave.
Don't worry.
The bus wouldn't leave without you.
I'm leaving the team.
What?
- Why?
What-
- I have to go home.
Home?
You can't go home now.
This couldn't come at a worse time.
We're in a bit of a crisis, and I have to try to pull something off.
It's not a good time to lose our most popular player.
- What's the problem?
- I don't want to talk about it.
It's personal?
It's one of the girls, isn't it?
It's Mae, right?
Kit, that's it.
I've noticed there's some friction.
That's fine.
No problem.
Doesn't mean you have to quit.
I can arrange a trade.
Racine?
Kenosha?
South Bend?
Trade me or whatever.
But figure it out by tomorrow, or I'm going home.
Tomorrow?
Fine!
I'll work everything out by tomorrow.
You really gave me a scare for a second.
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Mae, your date's here.
- How do I look?
- Where'd you get that dress?
- Borrowed it.
- It don't fit.
Too tight.
I don't plan on wearing it that long.
I don't know why you get dressed at all.
Where's Dottie?
In there.
Wanna go to the movies with me?
You bitch!
I've been traded to Racine!
You?
I told them to trade me.
They'd really trade you.
Miss Star, Miss Perfect.
You knew what would happen!
- I didn't!
- This'll be better than the movies.
- I'll quit.
Is that what you want?
- They'll blame me for you quitting!
What do you want me to do?
Stay away from me.
Leave me alone!
That's what I want you to do!
Kit, listen.
It was all a mistake.
A big mistake.
- I was getting too good.
- You won't listen.
I knew if I did too good, you'd do something to push me down!
Kit, blow it out your rear end!
I'm sick of you blaming me.
I got you into this league!
She got her in the league!
- I didn't wanna be here!
- Then why are you still here?
Kit wants to know why she's playing.
My train leaves at 8.
I got 10 minutes to pack.
If you have trouble, you know who to blame.
See you in the World Series.
You bet you will.
Don't look at her.
Has anyone seen my new red hat?
Piss on your hat!
Well, that seemed uncalled for.
Just keep it down.
- Kit's off our team.
- She's not!
Yes, she is.
Are you deaf?
You need any help in there?
Don't act like this.
You're still in the league.
You're just on another team, that's all.
Batter up
Hear that call
The time has come
For one and all
To play
Ball
For we're the members of
The All-American League We come from cities
Near and far
We got Canadians
Irish ones and Swedes
We're all for one, we're one for all We're All-Americans
Each girl stands Her head so proudly high
Her motto.:
Do or Die
She's not the one to use Or need an alibi
Our chaperones are not too soft They're not too tough
Our managers are on the ball
Miss Cuthbert...
You gorgeous stack of pancakes!
Man on the floor!
Already dressed.
Get Stilwell away.
I don't know what he's doing.
Get him away from the tapes!
Angel, come here now.
All right.
Everybody, let's listen up.
I was in the toilet reading my contract, and it turns out I get a bonus when we get to the World Series.
Let's play hard!
Play smart!
Use your heads!
That's that lump three feet above our ass, right?
Some more prominent than others.
Come in.
Excuse me!
I got a telegram from the War Department.
Oh, my God!
Ernie!
Boy, I hate these.
These are the worst.
The Army could at least send someone to tell you your husband's dead.
Darn!
I had the name right here!
I gotta go back and straighten this out.
Sorry.
- Just give me the telegram.
- I can't.
I don't have a name.
Just give me the telegram.
This is official.
This is from the War Department!
Come on!
That's official business!
I'm coming-
- I'm sorry, Betty.
- No, it's George!
It's George!
All right, come on.
We still got a game to play.
Come in.
Hi, cutie.
How did you...?
Bob!
Oh, my God!
What happened?
- I'm fine.
- What is it?
It was a sniper.
I was lucky though.
He got seven of us before we got him.
Oh, sweetie!
It's all right.
I made it.
I missed you so much.
I've been discharged.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
It's all over.
I'm here, baby.
Well, listen.
You have to sit down here.
I'll clear all this stuff off.
I almost forgot how beautiful you are.
- Oh, no.
I look terrible!
- You look beautiful.
You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I love you.
Can we just hold each other for the rest of our lives?
That's my plan.
Why am I the only one on this bus?
What are we waiting for?
Are you physically unable to show up on time?
Coming, Jimmy.
If you think you can do without the batting practice, think again.
Not the way you hit.
Let's not go to the World Series without Stilwell's toys!
- Alice, what time is it where you live?
- It's bad luck to yell before a game.
- Could you sign my baseball?
- Sure.
"Avoid the clap.
Jimmy Dugan. "
That's good advice!
Write to us.
We'll miss you.
We will.
Thanks.
Good luck in the World Series.
Taking a little day trip?
Bob and I are driving home to Oregon.
I thought you were a ballplayer.
You were wrong.
Was I?
It is only a game.
It's only a game, and I don't need this.
I have Bob.
I don't need this.
I gave away five years at the end of my career to drinking.
Five years.
There isn't anything I wouldn't give to get back any one day of it.
Well, we're different.
Chickenshit!
You wanna go home and make 100 babies, great.
I can't tell anyone how to live.
But sneaking out like this, quitting...
You'll regret it all your life.
Baseball is what gets inside you.
It's what lights you up.
You can't deny that.
It just got too hard.
It's supposed to be hard.
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it.
The hard is what makes it great.
Everything all right?
Yeah, fine.
Fine.
Bye, Jimmy.
First game of the first women's baseball World Series.
This is history in the making.
History in the making!
This is for you.
We brought you these also.
For me?
Thank them!
- Cut it out!
- I'm sorry.
Two box seats on the 3rd base line.
I got two box seats.
Who wants them?
- How much?
-10 bucks.
That's my daughter, 3rd baseman, Doris Murphy.
Best one they got.
- Where you from?
- Staten Island.
After the game, I'm taking her out for a steak dinner.
All right, all right, all right!
Time for the song and dance.
What's that smell?
Alice thinks it's bad luck to change her socks.
So we all suffer?
Get away, get away.
Outfielders, play deep a few steps.
Don't give up anything long.
Alice?
If the lead-off hitter gets on, they're gonna bunt.
Be ready.
Now, I'd like to...
I'd like to lead you in prayer.
- Come on.
- A prayer?
Come on.
Yes, a little prayer.
Come on!
Come on!
In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost...
Lord hallowed be Thy name.
May our feet be swift.
May our bats be mighty.
May our balls be plentiful.
And, Lord I'd just like to thank you for that waitress in South Bend.
You know who she is.
She kept calling Your name.
And, God these are good girls, and they work hard.
Help them see it all the way through.
Okay, that's it.
- Let's go.
- Amen.
Go Peaches!
Last game.
Now or never, ladies.
Alice, you're killing me.
You're killing me, Alice!
You're goddamn killing me!
And the rocket's red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh, say does that star-spangled
Banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave
This is it, folks.
One game for the whole ball of string.
There is no tomorrow.
Someone will walk out league champions, and someone else will just walk out.
You're gonna lose!
You're gonna lose!
You keep that kid away from me for just one game!
Ellen Sue, how's it looking?
- Good.
- Feeling good?
Looking good!
Nice and warm?
Good.
Alice, if Ellen Sue doesn't have anything, don't keep it a secret.
Tell me right away.
You understand me?
Do you hear me?
!
You're screaming.
I hear you.
Where'd you come from?
We got to Yellowstone and turned back.
Have trouble with the bears, did you?
I was fine until that scout walked into our barn.
I'm no quitter.
Wait a minute!
Hold it!
Who said you could play?
Alice has been catching the last six games.
She looks pretty good.
You don't want me to play?
Well, you're already dressed.
Hell, if you want to play I don't care.
You can play.
Well, then, I'll play.
Good.
- Fine.
- Fine.
Go play.
You look like shit.
Don't you ever shave?
We're gonna win.
We're gonna win!
You're gonna lose!
You stink!
Got him!
Lineup change!
- It's okay.
- Evelyn, he deserved it.
Stilwell, you gonna stay out here or come in the dugout?
Strike!
Strike!
You're out!
3!
Strike!
You're out!
You're out!
You're out, Brenda!
You are out!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Good, Mae!
Good catch!
Thank goodness.
2 down!
2 down!
Base hit.
Gardner's up with it.
Wallace'll stop at 3rd.
Gardner's throw is way off line!
Go!
Go!
All the way!
I'm sorry!
Shoot!
Wallace scampers home, and the Belles take the lead, 1 to nothing!
They're dancing in the aisles here in Racine!
I know.
I know.
You're still missing the cutoff man.
That's something I would like you to work on before next season.
All right.
Thanks.
Thank you, Mr. Dugan.
All right, let's get this one!
All right, come on!
We need some runs out there.
Make something happen, Mae!
All-the-Way Mae!
- They love her.
- Let's go, let's go!
Very cute.
Thanks.
Safe!
She's safe!
Way to play!
Way to run!
Way to make something happen!
Safe!
You get a hit, I'll baby-sit that little porker!
Come on!
You're out!
Come on!
Bring me home, Helen!
Out!
Peaches are down to their final out.
Only tying and go-ahead runs in scoring position.
Big Dottie Hinson striding to the plate.
Let's get out of this inning!
Come on!
Throw smoke, Kit!
Throw smoke!
Here's the pitch.
Bite me on the butt and call me an apple!
She nearly took her head off!
Mordabito scores!
Murphy, she will score!
Rockford has taken the lead, 2 to 1!
That's my wife!
One more!
Keep it going!
Put it past the little queen here.
Right past her!
There's a fly ball to left field.
She'll have to go for this one!
That's the final out.
But the damage has been done.
Right here in Racine, Rockford leads our Belles, 2 to 1 as we go to the bottom of the 9th.
Come on, it's okay.
You gotta bat now.
Relax!
One run and we are back in this ball game.
Shake it off.
You gotta hit.
It's okay, Kit.
Strike her out!
Bad eye!
Bat at that, blond girl!
She drives it to deep centre!
Mordabito goes to the wall and makes the catch!
Beautiful catch!
Beautiful!
Gotlander's pitch and it is in the dirt!
Ball 1!
That looked good to me, Ellen Sue!
Shake that one off!
That ain't nothing!
Gotlander, she delivers.
It's a ground ball between 1 st and 2nd.
This ball is hot!
Hendricks will go up at 1 st with a base hit.
That's all right. 1 down!
We got 1 down!
Let's go!
Foul ball!
Hinson's taking after it.
That does it!
Did she get it?
She got it!
She got it!
There's no question who the star of this game is.
Dottie Hinson has her team 1 out from the title.
Come on, Kit, you're up.
You're the hitter now.
Let's go.
The last batter standing in Rockford's way is Kit Keller.
Kit is 1 for 3 today.
- Can I have time-out?
- Time!
High fastballs.
She can't hit them, can't lay off them.
All right.
All right, if we just hold them now, we got it!
Come on!
Come on, Ellen Sue!
One, two, three!
Play ball!
- Strike!
- Swing and a miss.
Strike 1!
Yes!
Thank you, God!
Lay off the high ones!
Here's the pitch.
Swing and a miss!
Strike 2!
One more!
One more!
Here's the pitch.
It is a long fly ball.
Back, back, back.
It falls in there!
No one'll get to this ball!
This should tie it up!
Hendricks is rounding 3rd!
She will score!
Keller to 3rd!
Gardner hits the relay man with a frozen rope!
The coach is giving Keller the stop sign at 3rd!
But she is not stopping!
She runs through the stop sign!
She is not stopping!
Here comes the throw!
It should be in time!
Safe!
She is safe!
I can't believe it!
Hinson dropped the ball!
Hinson dropped the ball!
The ball game is over!
Racine has won the game, 3 to 2 and the World Series!
Take me home, Mama, and put me to bed!
I have seen enough to know I have seen too much!
You played a good game.
Well, what do you say?
All right, Ira.
We'll stick with it.
My mother always used to say, "If at first you don't succeed-"
You don't have to spend six months in Saskatchewan.
- Alice, you told me it's lovely.
- If you like icicles.
I thought we were gonna win.
- We didn't.
- Up to that last inning, we had it.
I'm so depressed, I could eat a cow.
It's all right.
You did good.
Get dressed.
See you on the bus.
Thanks.
Wanna be a ballplayer when you get big?
- What's your name?
- Angelina.
Gotta practice really hard.
What's your name?
- How much?
- Help yourself.
Thank you.
- Hitting!
- You all like hitting better?
- What's your name?
- Mary.
- Who you rooting for?
- Racine!
That's what I thought you said.
You guys be good.
Get dirty.
- I'm sorry I knocked you over.
- No, you're not.
You blocked the entire plate!
How do you-
You did what you had to.
You beat me.
You wanted it more than me.
I jammed my shoulder, if it makes you feel any better.
A little.
Bob and I are driving back to Oregon.
You're welcome to come with us.
You two should be alone.
I'd just be in the way.
When will you be coming home?
Some of the girls talked about staying around here and getting jobs.
I really like it here.
Christmas?
I don't know.
You'll come back next year, right?
I wanna have kids.
We wanna have kids.
You got plenty of time to have kids.
You couldn't give this up.
You'd miss it.
Miss it?
Miss putting on all this gear?
Catching a double-header in 100-degree heat?
Pushing the bus in mud?
Getting slammed into every other day by a base runner?
Think I'm gonna miss that?
I'll tell you what I'll miss.
I'll miss the girls.
I'll miss you.
Me?
How many sisters do you think I have?
I love you, Kit.
Really?
Just when I want you to stay, you're leaving.
Thanks for getting me in the league.
You got yourself in the league.
I got you on the train.
Play great.
Like you.
You stay in touch.
Come home every once in a while.
If you don't, I'll come back and hit line drives at your head.
I love you.
And you are gonna miss this.
I don't care what you say.
There's the winner!
Good game, Jimmy.
Hi, I'm a big fan of yours.
I'm Dottie's husband.
Well, then I'm a big fan of yours.
Old man Harvey just offered me a job managing next year in Wichita.
Triple A?
Great.
Good luck.
Turned him down.
Why?
What do you mean, why?
I already got a job.
I'll see you.
Miss Cuthbert, save me my special seat, now, cutie!
Meet you at the hotel.
Did you see Mae's catch, Dad?
I'd rather see you play ball instead of what you used to do.
What are you saying that for?
You make her feel bad!
Steak dinner.
On you.
I'll see you later.
Kit, over here!
Come on, let's go!
That was Bob, huh?
Nice guy.
Lay off of those high ones.
I like the high ones.
- Mule!
- Nag!
Hey, Mae.
Come here.
- What do you want?
- Come here.
- What is it?
- Look at her.
It's Dottie.
Hey, Doris.
Mae?
All-the-Way Mae?
- No one's called me that since-
- Last night!
I'm a married woman now.
Yeah, about eight times.
Girls!
Look who's here!
Shirley?
Helen Haley!
- It's Dr. Haley now.
I'm a doctor.
- I always knew you would be.
- Who's that?
- Dottie Hinson.
Betty Spaghetti?
Best ballplayer in the league.
- I don't remember her.
- She only played one year.
Ellen Sue!
You haven't changed one bit.
I married a plastic surgeon.
Having you here is good luck.
Thanks, Alice!
Marla!
I'm so glad you're here.
- How's...?
- Nelson?
He's good.
He's retired.
Our son runs the business.
How's Bob?
He's...
When?
Just this winter.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Shirley, I'm so excited.
I've got butterflies in my stomach!
They've got a "Women In Baseball" thing up there.
Isn't it neat?
Baseball Hall of Fame.
I'm shaking.
Wait a minute here.
- Guess who that is?
- Who?
You remember?
You're gonna lose.
Stilwell, angel!
My goodness!
Where's your mom?
Mom died a couple of years ago.
I'm sorry.
She was a real nice lady.
And a damn fine ballplayer.
When I heard about this, I felt like I owed it to her to be here.
She always said it was the best time she had in her whole life.
Come here.
Recognize yourself?
- Can I get one of these?
- Sure.
Ladies!
It's a pleasure to welcome you here today.
It's taken years, but you are the first women ever to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame!
- And now-
- Wait.
Wait a minute.
This really isn't right.
Mr. Lowenstein since you kept the league going all those years you do it.
- There you go, Ira.
- Thank you, Bob.
Ladies it's my honour.
Mr. Capadino, look!
That's when you changed my life, honey!
Stilwell, angel, smile!

Is that you, Grandma?
I'm so glad you came.
Hi, Aunt Dottie.
Take a picture.
Let's take a picture of the whole team.
The original Peaches!
Where'd you find this?
It was in one of those cartons.
Needs oil.
Who doesn't?
You ready?
- I'm not going.
- Mom!
I've got two children, I don't need a third.
Why is it so important that I go?
For one thing, it'd be nice if you just left the room.
Besides, these are your old friends.
They probably won't remember me.
The "Queen of Diamonds," Dottie Hinson?
Margaret, it just isn't a good idea.
Come on, Mom.
You'll get to see Aunt Kit.
- You never see each other.
- We still won't.
She'll be traveling around with that husband of hers.
Frank.
He has a name.
He's always been very nice to you.
He makes me nervous.
There's a lot of reasons why I can't go.
Honey I'm not comfortable about this.
I'm not really part of it.
It was never that important.
It was just something I did.
When will you realize how special it was, how much it all meant?
I know how you feel.
I really do.
But you're going.
Car.
- Car, train, bus.
I'm tired already.
- Sleep on the plane.
Grandma's out.
Is there a fire?
Wisenheimer.
Julie's watching you.
I don't want any bad reports.
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye.
Jeffrey, come here.
No matter what your brother does, he's littler than you.
Give him a chance to shoot.
Promise?
Bobby, come here.
Kill him.
Come on, you'll miss your plane.
I still think I shouldn't go.
Get a hit, Beans!
I'm coming, Mae!
I'm coming!
This week in the world of sports.
With the boys overseas and off to war baseball pitches in for the war effort.
Trading bats for bullets, Yankee Joe DiMaggio promises to give those Nazis a jolt.
Ace fireballer Bob Feller has traded Cleveland gray for Navy blue.
Baseball's biggest stars say "Look out, Mr. Hitler.
The Yanks are coming."
Not to mention the Indians, Red Sox and Tigers.
And they won't come back till it's over, over there.
Meanwhile, Chicago club owner Walter Harvey, the candy-bar king met with other team owners at the Harvey Mansion as rumours persist that baseball may be shut down for the duration of the war.
Harvey's promotional whiz kid, Ira Lowenstein has been given the job of figuring out how to keep baseball going.
Good luck, Mr. Lowenstein.
Strike 2!
Hey, fatso!
Get the hell out of the way!
What are you, crazy?
Strike 3!
Kit!
- Sis, don't swing at her high pitch.
- I can hit it.
- You can't.
- I can.
This bat's too heavy.
You'll never get it around.
I will!
Listen.
There's a big hole on the right side.
Don't look.
- Unless she pitches inside, pull it.
- I know.
Batter up!
No high ones.
I like the high ones!
- Mule!
- Nag!
Come on, Kit.
Keep your eye on the ball.
Strike 1!
Strike 2!
Too high.
All right, Kit.
Look it over!
Look it over there!
Strike 3!
All right, 2 outs, everybody.
Two away!
Better luck next time!
Knock it out of here!
Okay, Dottie!
Batter up!
Right in here!
Bring them in there, Dottie!
Ball!
Keep your eye on it, Dottie!
One hit and we win!
That's it, Dottie!
You did it!
That's the ball game!
Hey, Kit!
What are you swinging those high ones for?
Good thing your sister bailed you out.
How about the two bucks you owe me for this game?
Kit!
Wait up, I'll give you a ride!
Stop kicking the rocks.
I'm sorry.
- That game just made me so mad.
- We won.
Get mad if we lose.
That last pitch was right down the middle.
If I'd have swung at that, I'd be the hero.
- You got me so crazy-
- I only said lay off the high ones.
"Good thing your sister bailed you out."
"Kit, why don't you get your sister to teach you how to hit?"
"Why can't you be beautiful like your sister?"
What idiot said that?
No one.
- But that's what they were thinking.
- No, it's not!
You ever hear Dad introduce us to people?
"This is our daughter Dottie.
This is our other daughter, Dottie's sister.
Should've just had you and bought a dog.
- Mitch Swaley likes you.
- He's one step up from dating pigs.
But an important step.
- Why are you walking so fast?
- Why are you?
- Because you are.
- Can't even let me walk faster than you?
Girls, you got chores to do.
Don't run!
You'll scare the chickens!
I don't have time for these games.
- Why are you running?
- You can go faster than that.
Your legs are longer.
- I win!
- Barely.
Hey!
Hey, yourself.
Doesn't that hurt them?
Doesn't seem to.
It would bruise the hell out of me.
Who are you?
I'm Ernie Capadino, baseball scout.
I saw you playing today.
Not bad, not bad.
Ever hear of Walter Harvey?
Harvey Bars?
You know, the candy?
Yeah, we feed them to the cows when they're constipated.
He's starting a girls' baseball league so we can make a buck while the boys are overseas.
Wanna play?
Nice retort.
Tryouts are in Chicago.
It's a real league, professional.
Professional baseball?
They'll pay you $75 a week.
We only make $30 at the dairy.
Then this would be more, wouldn't it?
Interested?
Come on. $75 a week?
Pull her leg.
Mine are long enough.
Look, your country needs you.
You can not only play ball, but you're kind of a dolly.
Oh, now I get it.
Listen, mister.
I'm a married woman.
My husband's overseas.
Oh, relax!
I'm talking lookie, no touchie.
We want girls easy on the eye.
I'll go.
I'm ready now.
I gotta sign something?
I don't want you!
I want her!
The one who hit the ball!
You can climb back under the cow.
She's good.
She's very good.
She pitches.
She didn't today, because she did yesterday.
Thanks for that special glimpse into her life.
I want you.
You I saw, you I like.
The train leaves for Chicago tomorrow.
What do you say?
Are you in?
No, thanks.
"No, thanks"?
Hey, no skin off my Ashtabula.
If you wanna pluck cows, that's your business.
You know something?
You're not nice.
That one hurt.
So long, milkmaids.
No, wait!
Just watch me pitch.
Dottie, get your mitt!
I'll throw him a few.
Now look I know the goods when I see the goods, and she's the goods.
I'm sorry.
Will you shut up?
!
You're a pitcher, huh?
I'll tell you what.
If she comes, you can come too.
If you stink, it only costs us the train ticket.
Get these wild animals away from me!
Haven't you ever heard of a leash?
Come on, Dottie.
You got the whole rest of your life to hang around here.
Never go anywhere.
Never do anything.
I'm married.
I'm happy.
It's what I want.
Don't confuse things.
But can't you just have this first?
Just so you can say you once did something?
Something special?
Goodness sake, Kit!
Keep your voice down.
Your father's listening to the radio.
Please, Dottie?
I gotta get out of here.
I'm nothing here.
In the Pacific Northwest, my territory we have increased sales 106% in the last 12-month period.
And this with a war on!
You know, if I had your job, I'd kill myself.
Sit here.
I'll see if I can dig up a pistol.
Every trip I take, I gotta sit next to one of these guys.
I'm just too friendly.
Hey, isn't that-?
Well, I'll say one thing for them.
They can run.
Mr. Capadino!
I got her!
Look!
- Sir, your knee.
- Like it?
Stop the train!
Come on!
Come on!
Give me that bag!
Did you promise the cows you'd write?
When do we get to Chicago?
We gotta make a stop.
Fort Collins, Colorado.
Gotta look at another girl.
Hope you're not jealous.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, honey.
That was good form.
Thattagirl!
Good, honey.
Good.
Nice, nice.
That's a rope, honey.
Good girl.
Good, good.
Right, too high.
She's got an eye like DiMaggio.
Okay, Marla.
Now lefty.
She's really good.
She's your daughter?
Her mom's dead.
It's just the two of us.
Coach said if she was a boy, she'd go to the state tournament.
I said, "If she was a boy, I'd talk to the Yankees instead of living here."
That's enough.
You can bring her over.
Okay, Marla.
Come here.
Boys!
Hit the showers!
Take off your hat, honey.
We'll let you know.
Daddy, I'm sorry.
Let's go.
We'll miss the train.
Let's move, move, move!
What's the matter?
I can't use her.
She's great.
Why not?
What's the problem?
You know General Omar Bradley?
There's too strong a resemblance.
You ain't taking her because she ain't pretty?
Well, look who just caught up!
All right.
Come on, let's go.
Pick those suitcases up!
Come on!
I'm not kidding.
Move!
- One foot in front of the other.
- Mister?
I know my girl ain't so pretty as these girls.
But that's my fault.
I raised her like I would a boy.
I didn't know any better.
She loves to play.
Don't make my girl suffer because I messed up raising her.
Please?
I wish you had a decent mitt.
I think maybe I'd better not go.
No, you can relace it.
It'll be okay.
I mean, who's gonna take care of you?
Cook?
Help you take care of the equipment?
Don't you worry about me.
You'll play baseball.
I'm not gonna know anybody.
Nothing's ever gonna happen here.
You gotta go where things happen.
I love you, Daddy.
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, honey.
Are you coming?
See, how it works is, the train moves, not the station.
This is making me sick.
Write to me, honey.
I love you.
Hey, cowgirls, see the grass?
Don't eat it.
Okay, girls, this is it.
Harvey Field.
Tryouts.
Get out there.
Show them what you got.
Don't embarrass me.
It's been a thin slice of heaven.
Goodbye.
Wait.
You're going?
Dry your eyes.
I'm going home.
Grab a shower and a shave.
Give the wife a pickle-tickle, and I'm on my way.
I'll see you.
- But-
- But what?
Field!
Tryouts!
Play!
That's it!
Get lost!
I hate when they get attached to me like that.
- Hey, Mae.
- What?
- Come look at this.
- Wait a second, Doris.
I can't wait much longer, so get up.
Yeah, so?
Yeah, so I ain't done yet.
Watch this.
- That's it?
- You can't do it, Mae.
I could do it.
How long you been working on that, Doris?
Took me a year.
Not counting the two months I was in the hospital.
Bat hit me right in the head.
Your head and not your behind?
That looks really swollen.
- What kind of thing is that to say?
- I'm joking, okay?
I'm nervous.
- What are you looking at?
- Yeah, what?
Nothing.
That's right, nothing.
All these girls gonna be in the league?
- You wish.
- You do wish.
- Four teams.
Sixteen girls to a team.
- That's right.
Sixty-four girls.
What are you, a genius?
They got over 100 girls here, so some of youse will have to go home.
- Sorry about that.
- Come on, Doris.
What do you mean, "some of us"?
- Okay, some of them are going home.
- How'd you do that?
Excuse me.
You caught that.
Hello?
Let's go practice.
She caught it with her bare hand.
And now, from Chicago, The Mutual presents another social commentary by Miss Maida Gilespie.
Careers and higher education are leading to the masculinization of women with enormously dangerous consequences to the home, the children and our country.
When our boys come home from war what kind of girls will they be coming home to?
And now, the most disgusting example of this sexual confusion, Mr. Walter Harvey, of Harvey Bars is presenting us with women's baseball.
Right here in Chicago, young girls plucked from their families are gathered at Harvey Field to see which one of them can be the most masculine.
Mr. Harvey, like your candy bars, you are completely nuts.
Very good.
Try another.
Nice throw!
Your name will be on one of those five lists.
Okay, find your name.
If we could just form two or three parallel lines...
I'm a Peach!
A Rockford Peach!
I made it!
I can stay!
Are you a newspaper guy?
This is my friend Mae.
She made the team.
Come on, we got a lot to do.
Let's settle down.
Now, you're the first-
Honey, are you supposed to be here, or are you on the cut list?
Look, I'm sorry.
If you're on the cut list, you have to leave the field.
Well, are you cut?
Look on the list.
It's either Rockford, Racine, Kenosha or South Bend.
Can you read, honey?
No.
All right, what's your name?
Shirley Baker.
Let's just take a look.
This is you.
You're with us.
You're a Rockford Peach.
Go join your team.
Settle down.
We got a lot to go over.
First, congratulations.
You are the first members of the All-American Girls' Baseball League.
I'm Charlie Collins.
I'll be managing the Racine team when the season starts.
The other teams will have managers soon.
At the end of practice today you all have to get fitted for your uniforms.
And this is what they'll look like.
Pretty darn nifty, if you ask me.
You can't slide in that.
That's a dress.
It's half a dress.
That's not a baseball uniform.
What do you think we are, ballplayers or ballerinas?
It's awfully short.
Short?
I'm gonna have to squat in that thing.
I can't!
My husband will kill me.
Ladies!
Excuse me.
You can't play ball in this, you can't play ball with us.
There are 38 girls getting tickets home who'll play in a bathing suit if I ask.
There's no pockets for my cigarettes.
There is no smoking.
There is also no drinking and no men.
Your social engagements will be cleared through your team chaperones.
You'll have regular classes at charm and beauty school.
For what?
Every girl in this league will be a lady.
And gracefully and grandly.
Gracefully and grandly.
All right, now go back!
And sip.
Down.
Don't slurp.
Sip.
Down.
Don't slurp.
Stop that!
It's good.
Posture!
Heads up.
Backs straight.
And sit.
Right over left.
Legs always together.
A lady reveals nothing.
The hair.
Soften and shorten.
The eyebrows.
Thin and separate.
There should be two.
ery nice.
ery nice!
Lovely!
What do you suggest?
A lot of night games.
I wanna show you the grounds.
You know, I always-
Jimmy, come on.
I'm showing you around.
Beautiful, huh?
Place used to be a golf course.
I never cared for the game, but I love grass.
It costs a fortune, with the mowing and trimming.
But I grew up in an apartment.
I had one lousy plant in a cheese box.
Now look.
I got a park.
These are my in-laws.
Hello!
They can't hear nothing.
Enough socializing.
Jimmy, I'm thinking of giving you another managing job.
Mr. Harvey, I guarantee I'll do a better job than last time.
You kind of let me down on that San Antonio job.
I had no right to sell off the team's equipment like that.
It won't happen again.
Let me be blunt.
Are you still a fall-down drunk?
Well, that is blunt.
No, sir.
I've quit drinking.
You've seen the error of your ways?
No, I just can't afford it.
That's funny to you?
Your drinking is funny?
You're a young man.
You still could be playing if you just would've laid off the booze.
Well, it's not exactly like that.
I hurt my knee.
You fell out of a hotel.
That's how you hurt it!
There was a fire.
Which you started, which I paid for.
I was gonna send you a thank-you card, but I wasn't allowed anything sharp to write with.
I want you to manage one of the new girls' baseball teams.
Don't look so stunned.
Face it.
You're still a name.
You step out of the dugout before every game.
You wave your little hat.
You give the people a thrill.
Get an organ grinder.
I can hop around and dance.
If your knees are up to it, go ahead.
Mr. Harvey I hit 487 home runs for your baseball club.
Three in the World Series, two in game 4 alone.
I know that.
That's why I'm giving you this job.
Take it or leave it.
I gotta feed the fish.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the first game of the All-American Girls' Baseball League!
The South Bend Blue Sox against your own Rockford Peaches.
- Where is he?
- I can't believe he's our manager.
I was listening to the radio when he hit that home run to win the pennant.
I'm asking him to sign my husband's baseball card.
Do you mind?
Could I take a look at that?
Just be careful with it.
If anything happens, he'll come back from the Pacific and kill me.
- Mr. Dugan-
- Mr. Dugan, I'm simply...
Do something, Mae.
Time him.
Give me your watch.
Could be a record.
That counts.
How long?
I ain't gonna ask you again.
Shut up, Doris.
Keep timing.
Hey, Mae, how long?
Boy, that was some good peeing.
Hey, coach.
Mr. Dugan?
Could you sign my husband's baseball card for me?
Great to meet you!
What'll we do?
He didn't give us a lineup.
We can't play without one.
I'll pitch.
I can pitch.
- I thought I was playing centre field.
- No, I am.
Hey, you guys.
Come on.
How hard can it be to make a lineup?
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you do it, Oregon?
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
All right.
Mae, centre field, lead off.
She's good.
And now, the manager of the Peaches former six-time National League Home Run Champ Jimmy Dugan!
Jimmy, look up here!
We love you!
Bullshit.
You can all kiss my ass.
That's right.
Kiss my big hairy ass.
And the Rockford Peaches!
Doris Murphy takes the field!
Lift up your skirt!
This'll be something.
Ain't too many people here.
- You nervous, Doris?
- Yeah.
I ain't.
- Are they laughing at us?
- Yeah, they're laughing at us.
- They hate us.
- Just keep smiling.
Hey, glamour puss!
Can you throw the ball?
All right, ladies, let's play ball!
- Let's play ball.
- Dirt in the skirt!
And now, the lineup for Rockford:
Leading off and playing centre field, number 5, Mae Mordabito!
Batting second and playing 3rd base, number 22, Doris Murphy!
Batting third, the catcher, number 8, Dottie Hinson!
Batting fourth and playing 2nd base, number 32, Marla Hooch.
Girls can't play ball!
Batting fifth...
Look at me!
I'm a ballplayer!
Better look out, I might break a nail!
- number 1, Ellen Sue Gotlander.
- It slipped!
- Batting ninth, pitcher number 23, Kit Keller!
Count's 2 balls and no strikes to Rockford's big catcher, Dottie Hinson.
And it's in the dirt. 3 and 0.
Let's see if Jimmy Dugan gives her the green light on 3 and 0 or gives her the take sign.
Game's tied 2-2, the bottom of the 9th with two runners in scoring position and only 1 out.
From the belt, here's the delivery.
Oh, baby!
She hit the cream cheese out of that one!
Jimmy Dugan, master strategist, had her swinging away!
He sure knows his baseball.
Come on, Dottie!
Make me proud!
A 3-run clout for Dottie Hinson and Rockford wins it, 5 to 2.
Dottie, ladies and gentlemen!
Dottie!
I couldn't believe you hit it right out there!
Can we have your autograph?
Can we, Jimmy?
Not today, boys.
Come back next game.
Nice piece of coaching.
Especially in the 5th inning when you scratched your balls for an hour.
Anything worth doing is worth doing right.
Yes, indeed.
Until you did that, I couldn't tell if you were drunk or dead.
It was made very clear to me what I'm supposed to do here.
I smile wave my little hat, and I did that.
So when do I get paid?
You have some good ballplayers.
If you'll only-
Ballplayers!
I haven't got ballplayers!
I've got girls!
Girls are what you sleep with after the game, not what you coach during it.
If we paid you more, could you be just a little more disgusting?
I could certainly use the money.
On the home front they find them everywhere North, East, South and West, and even Canada.:
Players for the new All-American Girls' Baseball League.
After a month of play the shine still isn't off these Diamond Gals.
Alice "Skeeter" Gaspers says "Legging out a triple is no reason to let your nose get shiny."
Betty Grable has nothing on these gals.
Helen Haley has not only been on several championship amateur teams she's also an accomplished coffeemaker.
With her husband in the Pacific Betty Horn enjoys cooking spaghetti and knitting.
Her teammates call her "Betty Spaghetti."
Ellen Sue Gotlander is a former Miss Georgia.
Then there's pretty Dottie Hinson who plays like Gehrig and looks like Garbo.
Fellas, keep your mitts to yourselves.
She's married.
And there's her kid sister Kit, who's as single as they come.
Enough concentrated "oomph" for a whole carload of Hollywood starlets.
And how about Marla Hooch?
What a hitter!
What a lead!
But girls playing baseball?
- Enjoy that?
- Yeah!
Good.
Come back next game, will you?
I'm Evelyn Gardner.
I play right field.
For us.
I just spoke to my husband last night.
He says I can't leave our son with him at home anymore.
See, he says he's too busy reading the want ads and I should just take him with me and shut up about it.
So can I?
Take my son with me on road trips?
Ballplayers...!
He's the sweetest little boy.
Everyone's just gonna love him.
Get this brat off of me!
That's it!
I quit!
Stilwell, angel, come to Mommy.
- You're too young to drive.
- I will.
Watch.
Evelyn!
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to kill your son!
Wait!
The girls have a game!
You can't leave us like this!
Please, Mr. Goosatelli!
Get over here, Stilwell!
I'm gonna kill you!
You can't catch me!
Don't use my bat, use Marla's!
It's heavier!
- Evelyn, why is he so wild?
- I don't know.
Stilwell, angel, have another chocolate bar.
Gimme!
Gimme!
You can't leave us like this.
We're in the middle of nowhere!
- We can't be here!
- No!
Keep him away from me!
He's really a sweetie, Dottie.
- I hope I have five just like him.
- Don't eat the wrapper, honey.
- You gonna come?
- Where you going?
A roadhouse called the Suds Bucket.
No, I'm married.
I'm...
Come on, you ain't on the farm anymore.
Live a little bit.
Girls!
Please!
Mr. Goosatelli shan't be returning.
How you gonna get past Miss Cuthbert?
Mae's gonna poison her dinner.
What is it, baby?
What the hell is going on?
!
Why are we stopped?
Lou quit.
Who's Lou?
The driver.
A car could've came by now.
- Get on the bus!
- Was that English?
I loved you in The Wizard of Oz.
In the 43 years I've practised medicine, I never saw a woman throw up that much.
Maybe that's how she entertains herself, doc.
Hurry!
Come on!
Quiet!
Mae, what did you give her?
Who cares?
It's working.
I'm going, baby!
Come on, way to go, Mae!
I'm coming in!
Catch me!
Did you see me, Kit?
I pretzeled!
- How'd you learn to do that?
- She taught me.
My father owns a dance hall, upstate.
innie's Dance Girls Deluxe.
She was a dancer, I was a bouncer.
You were great!
- Thanks for the ride, kid.
- What's your rush, dollbody?
What do you say we slip in the back seat and you make a man out of me?
What do you say I smack you around?
Can't we do both?
No, I'm not hot.
It's fine.
It's really cold.
- That's better.
- Where's Kit?
I think she's on the dance floor.
There she is.
I got my truck parked outside.
Sorry, we gotta go.
Come on.
Alice, come on.
We gotta go.
We got trouble.
- I knew it.
You killed Miss Cuthbert.
- We'll bury her.
I know a guy-
Lowenstein's coming.
He catches us, we're out of the league.
Let's make like a bread truck and haul buns, ladies.
Let's duck out the back door.
Is this all?
Marla didn't come?
She came.
Well, where is she?
There.
Thinkin' of you
Some others I've seen
What did you do to her?
We just gave her a dress.
And a lot of liquor!
You guys go ahead.
I'll get Marla.
Hurry up, ladies!
Thanks.
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
It had to be you
It had to be you
Marla, honey?
We gotta go.
I'm singing to Nelson!
Ain't I, baby?
You sure are.
I could take her home.
It'd be an honour.
Ain't he something?
Could make me be blue
That's the second time he dropped that Bible since she's been in there.
Come on, girls.
Mae, what'd you say?
Everything.
Here's a good job for you, Jimmy.
Managing girl ballplayers.
You go out there and you wave your little hat around.
Don't drink!
Why would I want to drink?
I'm a goddamn Peach!
God, double play.
Now I'm hitting like a girl.
"But be nice to them.
They're good ballplayers."
There, catch that, blondie!
Now batting for the Rockford Peaches number 5, centre fielder Mae Mordabito!
Here's the pitch.
There's a shot into right centre!
It's up the alley!
She's turning around 1 st!
She's digging up the dirt!
She's heading past 2nd.
She's heading into 3rd!
Dirt in the skirt, Mae!
Dirt in the skirt!
- Safe!
- She's in there with a triple!
Boy, did she smack that one right on the kisser.
No wonder they call her "All-the-Way" Mae.
Triple.
Next batter number 32,2nd baseman, Marla Hooch.
Evelyn, look at this!
I've got Stilwell's snack on my cleat!
What are you, stupid?
Somebody's gotta run the team.
Someone who actually watches the games.
You're gonna squeeze bunt with our best hitter?
What's the sign to swing away?
Hey, blond girl!
What's the sign?
It's the letters.
A squeeze'll work.
Stop thinking with your tits.
Batter!
Time!
Come on!
Who is the goddamn manager here?
I am!
Then act like it, you big lush!
- You tell him, Dottie!
- About time someone told him.
- I'm ready now.
- Play ball!
Way to go, whatever your name is!
Good bluff!
But I still say you're not ballplayers.
Cemetery boneyard!
Cross your fingers or you'll never get another hit.
Sound it out.
Kimono.
Kimono off and gra-bed...
Grabbed.
...her milky milky white...
What are you giving her to read?
What's the difference?
She's reading.
That's the important thing.
Go away!
Go!
Shoo!
Go ahead, Shirley.
Thanks.
Milky white breasts.
It gets really good after that.
- A delivery boy walks in...
- What are you doing?
I'm writing a song.
Really?
What's it about?
About us.
Could you teach it to me?
Doris, is this your boyfriend?
Is it out of focus?
No, that's how he looks.
Looks aren't the most important thing.
Right.
The important thing is he's stupid, out of work and treats me bad.
Then why...?
Why?
What do you think?
Because none of the other boys ever...
Always made me feel like I was wrong.
Like I was some sort of a weird girl or a strange girl or not even a girl, just because I could play.
I believed them too.
But not anymore.
I mean, look.
There's a lot of us.
I think we're all all right.
We are.
Give me that.
So long, Charlie!
So with 2 runs in the 6th, South Bend gets even.
I've gotta go!
I've gotta go!
You shake it off.
Shake it off.
Say, Evelyn, can I ask you a question?
Which team do you play for?
- I'm a Peach.
- Well, I was just wondering because I couldn't figure out why you'd throw home when we've got a 2-run lead!
You let the tying run get on 2nd, and we lost the lead!
You start using your head!
That's that lump that's three feet above your ass!
Are you crying?
Are you crying?
There's no crying!
There's no crying in baseball!
Leave her alone, Jimmy.
You zip it, Doris!
Rogers Hornsby, my manager, called me a 'talking pile of pig shit'!
That was when my parents came from Michigan to see me play the game!
And did I cry?
No!
Do you know why?
Because there's no crying in baseball.
No crying in baseball!
No crying!
What's the matter?
She's crying, sir.
I didn't mean to do that.
Perhaps you chastised her too vehemently.
Good rule of thumb:
Treat each of them as you would your mother.
Anyone ever tell you you look like a penis with a hat on?
You're out of here!
- I heard that!
- You misunderstood.
- Ten seconds!
- You misunderstood!
You can't throw me out knowing you've got a strike!
Off this field!
I can't believe no one ever called you that before!
That's where you belong.
I'm in charge now.
The crowd's light today, what with the tractor show in town.
If you're nearby, and you must be, since this isn't a powerful radio station...
People better start showing up.
We don't have fans, we don't have a league.
Ladies you all look wonderful.
There's a reporter and a photographer in the stands from Life magazine.
- We're famous!
- Life magazine?
Don't waste your time.
Dottie, I'm trying to get them to do a story about you.
Me?
Why me?
You're the "Queen of Diamonds." That's what I'm calling you.
Did you tell them about me?
I told them how at first, the scout didn't even want you but how Dottie wouldn't come without her kid sister.
They really loved it.
A real human-interest story.
Will you just try to give them something spectacular out there?
Anything.
What's the matter?
Well, we're not doing so well.
Harvey and the other owners think they've made a mistake.
They might close you down.
What are you talking about?
They can't close us down here.
- What kind of a thing is that?
- What's it mean?
They're businessmen.
No profit, no product.
And what am I supposed to do?
Go back to taxi dancing?
Ten cents so some slob can sweat gin all over me?
I'm never doing that again!
So you tell old rich Mr. Chocolate Man that he ain't closing me down!
They can't keep us from playing!
We'll show them how we play.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
I am trying my best.
So will you just give them everything you've got?
We always do.
A slick play by Alice Gaspers and there's 2 gone in the 3rd.
That'll bring up Dee Lynch.
Lynch is the most consistent Belles hitter this year.
Settles in.
Pops it up!
Foul.
Hinson should have no trouble with this.
She's under it.
Uncle Elmore's socks!
What did she do?
I can't do that.
Who can?
- What is her name?
- Dottie Hinson.
D-O-T-T-I-E...
What the hell was that?
I just thought it might help the league.
A goddamn circus!
A double would be nice-
All right!
God knows we have a game.
It's not like any of this helps, believe me.
That was really nice!
Let's go, girls.
Dozens of people are waiting for the game to start.
What is her name?
Hey you, tall girl!
Beverly!
Look sharp, tall- What is her name?
Beverly.
Good.
Five bucks!
Five bucks!
What if, at a key moment in the game, my uniform bursts open and my bosoms fly out?
That might draw a crowd, right?
Think there's men who ain't seen your bosoms?
Thank you.
- Marla, what you got?
- What about me?
I got a letter from Nelson!
Fly ball as Dottie Hinson brings the crowd to its feet with a home run!
22!
We love you, 22!
- Come on!
- Open your mouth!
The kid ate the lineup!
Right here.
I'm so happy!
Thank you.
I love you.
I'll be back next season.
See you next season!
Slide!
Slide!
Safe!
Thank you!
Let it up.
Let it up.
That was a good one.
It's a fly ball to left!
Betty Spaghetti makes the catch!
Heads up!
Spaghetti makes the throw!
It's gonna be close!
Aunt Edna's bridgework!
She is out!
Dottie Hinson held onto the ball!
Oh, doctor!
A lot of ballplayers use it.
High foul pop.
It's coming back!
She caught it!
Unbelievable!
Full house on its feet cheering Dottie Hinson!
That sounded good.
- You haven't got a curve ball left.
- I don't?
!
You haven't had one since-
Safe!
Safe!
He's good-looking.
- What's he do when not in the Army?
- Dairy assistant manager.
He'll be manager.
He's smart.
So he's good-looking and smart.
There's so few of us.
Where did you say he was?
Italy?
I think.
I haven't got a letter from him in three weeks.
I used to get one every week.
That doesn't mean anything.
If he's in combat, it's not like there's a mailbox on every corner.
If something happened, you would've got a telegram.
Oh, God, don't-
But he's fine.
No, he's fine.
How come you're not in the Army?
I have no cartilage in my knee.
You don't need it to shoot Nazis.
You need this, right?
Trigger finger.
I could do that.
How did I get so useless so fast?
Boys like this on your fingers?
Works for me.
Your sister's not gonna be mad?
I don't care.
Listen, when...
- Bob.
- ...
Bob comes back will you keep playing?
You could just quit?
Sure.
You play like you love it.
- Does he know how good you are?
- Bob?
No, Hitler.
Yes, Bob.
How good am I?
You stink.
You're lousy.
You're only the best player in the league.
You don't know that?
You ever been married?
Let me think.
Yeah, twice.
Any children?
One of them was.
Is she out?
I think it's time for a drink.
Hang on.
Hang on.
These really don't mix.
- Good, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
It's great.
Fair ball!
Time!
Jimmy Dugan pops his head out of the dugout.
He's on his way to talk to his hurler.
Kit Keller looks mighty tired.
Game's getting exciting.
I'll finish it right here.
I'll strike this turkey out.
Betty's ready to come in.
Come on.
I've never been taken out before.
Ask Dottie.
I really wanna finish this game.
Please?
What do you think?
Well, you know, she's battling.
What do you think?
She's throwing grapefruits.
It looks like Keller's coming out of the game, and she is not happy about it!
Nice job, Kit!
Betty Horn sprints in from the left-field bullpen.
Look at this crowd.
This is great!
They're jumping, cheering and they paid to get in.
You did a fabulous job.
I won't forget this.
Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey.
I appreciate it, coming from you.
But to be perfectly honest, I think the girls deserve most of the credit.
They're great.
Fortunately, we won't need them anymore.
Do you want a peanut?
No.
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We're winning the war.
Our situation changed.
Roosevelt himself said, "Men's baseball won't be shut down."
So we won't need the girls next year.
Bases loaded.
Bottom of the 9th.
Rockford up, 6 to 2.
Two men out.
No balls, 2 strikes.
Strike 3!
And that is the ball game!
Rockford is in the playoffs!
I love these girls.
I don't need them, but I love them.
Come on.
Let's go.
Look at me.
I'm full of peanuts!
I've got peanuts all over myself.
This is what it's gonna be like in the factories too.
"Men are back.
Turn in your rivets."
First, it was their patriotic duty to get out and go to work.
When the men come back, they're sent back to the kitchen.
Should we send the boys returning from war back to the kitchen?
Come on.
Do you know how dedicated they are?
What they go through?
They play with sprained ankles, broken fingers.
They ride a bus all night to play a double-header the next day!
I'll make it up to them.
What?
With Harvey Bars?
I'm getting tired of listening to you, Ira.
I'd like your permission to take over the league.
Do you understand?
All of the owners are getting out.
There's no point to it anymore.
Just let them finish the season, and that's it!
I sold your product when there was no product.
This is a product!
There is no room for girls' baseball in this country once the war is over.
They're through.
I think you're wrong.
And I'm gonna prove it to you, Mr. Harvey!
Hi, my name's Mae.
That's more than a name, that's an attitude.
Here's my friend Doris.
Best player on the team.
- Thank you.
- You're the best.
- The game put us in the playoffs.
- I could've finished.
Stilwell could've hit off you.
What's the matter?
Too big to finish your own games now?
Don't start with me, Kit!
Don't you start with me!
Kit, come on, cut it out!
What the hell are you doing?
!
- Get your sister off of her!
- Stay out of it!
You just wait, Doris!
Let me down!
Let me down!
You stay down there and you cool off!
- Why'd she do it?
- She was vulnerable.
You provoked her.
- Shut up, Helen!
- You're making her more upset.
Really!
- I don't need it from Helen.
- Take a shower.
- I'm not taking a shower.
- She reminds me of my husband.
Save some hot water for me, you guys.
You okay?
My rear end hurts where he dropped me.
You acted like a baby.
You treat me like one.
I treated you like a pitcher who'd lost her stuff.
When Betty's in trouble, you back her up every pitch!
I seem to remember last week, somebody throwing a resin bag in my face.
Told me to get my fat ass behind the plate.
Was that you or the umpire?
You could've backed me up today instead of holding me back.
I hold you back?
It's like at home.
It's like if you're here, then I'm not here.
What's that mean?
I don't know what I mean.
I know I'm wrong.
I know you're right and I'm wrong.
I know that.
I just-
I just get so mad!
Why do you gotta be so good?
Dottie, here you are.
You weren't on the bus.
Can I speak to you a minute?
I have to leave.
Don't worry.
The bus wouldn't leave without you.
I'm leaving the team.
What?
- Why?
What-
- I have to go home.
Home?
You can't go home now.
This couldn't come at a worse time.
We're in a bit of a crisis, and I have to try to pull something off.
It's not a good time to lose our most popular player.
- What's the problem?
- I don't want to talk about it.
It's personal?
It's one of the girls, isn't it?
It's Mae, right?
Kit, that's it.
I've noticed there's some friction.
That's fine.
No problem.
Doesn't mean you have to quit.
I can arrange a trade.
Racine?
Kenosha?
South Bend?
Trade me or whatever.
But figure it out by tomorrow, or I'm going home.
Tomorrow?
Fine!
I'll work everything out by tomorrow.
You really gave me a scare for a second.
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Does anybody have any extra hose?
Mae, your date's here.
- How do I look?
- Where'd you get that dress?
- Borrowed it.
- It don't fit.
Too tight.
I don't plan on wearing it that long.
I don't know why you get dressed at all.
Where's Dottie?
In there.
Wanna go to the movies with me?
You bitch!
I've been traded to Racine!
You?
I told them to trade me.
They'd really trade you.
Miss Star, Miss Perfect.
You knew what would happen!
- I didn't!
- This'll be better than the movies.
- I'll quit.
Is that what you want?
- They'll blame me for you quitting!
What do you want me to do?
Stay away from me.
Leave me alone!
That's what I want you to do!
Kit, listen.
It was all a mistake.
A big mistake.
- I was getting too good.
- You won't listen.
I knew if I did too good, you'd do something to push me down!
Kit, blow it out your rear end!
I'm sick of you blaming me.
I got you into this league!
She got her in the league!
- I didn't wanna be here!
- Then why are you still here?
Kit wants to know why she's playing.
My train leaves at 8.
I got 10 minutes to pack.
If you have trouble, you know who to blame.
See you in the World Series.
You bet you will.
Don't look at her.
Has anyone seen my new red hat?
Piss on your hat!
Well, that seemed uncalled for.
Just keep it down.
- Kit's off our team.
- She's not!
Yes, she is.
Are you deaf?
You need any help in there?
Don't act like this.
You're still in the league.
You're just on another team, that's all.
Batter up
Hear that call
The time has come
For one and all
To play
Ball
For we're the members of
The All-American League We come from cities
Near and far
We got Canadians
Irish ones and Swedes
We're all for one, we're one for all We're All-Americans
Each girl stands Her head so proudly high
Her motto.:
Do or Die
She's not the one to use Or need an alibi
Our chaperones are not too soft They're not too tough
Our managers are on the ball
Miss Cuthbert...
You gorgeous stack of pancakes!
Man on the floor!
Already dressed.
Get Stilwell away.
I don't know what he's doing.
Get him away from the tapes!
Angel, come here now.
All right.
Everybody, let's listen up.
I was in the toilet reading my contract, and it turns out I get a bonus when we get to the World Series.
Let's play hard!
Play smart!
Use your heads!
That's that lump three feet above our ass, right?
Some more prominent than others.
Come in.
Excuse me!
I got a telegram from the War Department.
Oh, my God!
Ernie!
Boy, I hate these.
These are the worst.
The Army could at least send someone to tell you your husband's dead.
Darn!
I had the name right here!
I gotta go back and straighten this out.
Sorry.
- Just give me the telegram.
- I can't.
I don't have a name.
Just give me the telegram.
This is official.
This is from the War Department!
Come on!
That's official business!
I'm coming-
- I'm sorry, Betty.
- No, it's George!
It's George!
All right, come on.
We still got a game to play.
Come in.
Hi, cutie.
How did you...?
Bob!
Oh, my God!
What happened?
- I'm fine.
- What is it?
It was a sniper.
I was lucky though.
He got seven of us before we got him.
Oh, sweetie!
It's all right.
I made it.
I missed you so much.
I've been discharged.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
It's all over.
I'm here, baby.
Well, listen.
You have to sit down here.
I'll clear all this stuff off.
I almost forgot how beautiful you are.
- Oh, no.
I look terrible!
- You look beautiful.
You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I love you.
Can we just hold each other for the rest of our lives?
That's my plan.
Why am I the only one on this bus?
What are we waiting for?
Are you physically unable to show up on time?
Coming, Jimmy.
If you think you can do without the batting practice, think again.
Not the way you hit.
Let's not go to the World Series without Stilwell's toys!
- Alice, what time is it where you live?
- It's bad luck to yell before a game.
- Could you sign my baseball?
- Sure.
"Avoid the clap.
Jimmy Dugan."
That's good advice!
Write to us.
We'll miss you.
We will.
Thanks.
Good luck in the World Series.
Taking a little day trip?
Bob and I are driving home to Oregon.
I thought you were a ballplayer.
You were wrong.
Was I?
It is only a game.
It's only a game, and I don't need this.
I have Bob.
I don't need this.
I gave away five years at the end of my career to drinking.
Five years.
There isn't anything I wouldn't give to get back any one day of it.
Well, we're different.
Chickenshit!
You wanna go home and make 100 babies, great.
I can't tell anyone how to live.
But sneaking out like this, quitting...
You'll regret it all your life.
Baseball is what gets inside you.
It's what lights you up.
You can't deny that.
It just got too hard.
It's supposed to be hard.
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it.
The hard is what makes it great.
Everything all right?
Yeah, fine.
Fine.
Bye, Jimmy.
First game of the first women's baseball World Series.
This is history in the making.
History in the making!
This is for you.
We brought you these also.
For me?
Thank them!
- Cut it out!
- I'm sorry.
Two box seats on the 3rd base line.
I got two box seats.
Who wants them?
- How much?
- 10 bucks.
That's my daughter, 3rd baseman, Doris Murphy.
Best one they got.
- Where you from?
- Staten Island.
After the game, I'm taking her out for a steak dinner.
All right, all right, all right!
Time for the song and dance.
What's that smell?
Alice thinks it's bad luck to change her socks.
So we all suffer?
Get away, get away.
Outfielders, play deep a few steps.
Don't give up anything long.
Alice?
If the lead-off hitter gets on, they're gonna bunt.
Be ready.
Now, I'd like to...
I'd like to lead you in prayer.
- Come on.
- A prayer?
Come on.
Yes, a little prayer.
Come on!
Come on!
In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost...
Lord hallowed be Thy name.
May our feet be swift.
May our bats be mighty.
May our balls be plentiful.
And, Lord I'd just like to thank you for that waitress in South Bend.
You know who she is.
She kept calling Your name.
And, God these are good girls, and they work hard.
Help them see it all the way through.
Okay, that's it.
- Let's go.
- Amen.
Go Peaches!
Last game.
Now or never, ladies.
Alice, you're killing me.
You're killing me, Alice!
You're goddamn killing me!
And the rocket's red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh, say does that star-spangled
Banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave
This is it, folks.
One game for the whole ball of string.
There is no tomorrow.
Someone will walk out league champions, and someone else will just walk out.
You're gonna lose!
You're gonna lose!
You keep that kid away from me for just one game!
Ellen Sue, how's it looking?
- Good.
- Feeling good?
Looking good!
Nice and warm?
Good.
Alice, if Ellen Sue doesn't have anything, don't keep it a secret.
Tell me right away.
You understand me?
Do you hear me?
!
You're screaming.
I hear you.
Where'd you come from?
We got to Yellowstone and turned back.
Have trouble with the bears, did you?
I was fine until that scout walked into our barn.
I'm no quitter.
Wait a minute!
Hold it!
Who said you could play?
Alice has been catching the last six games.
She looks pretty good.
You don't want me to play?
Well, you're already dressed.
Hell, if you want to play I don't care.
You can play.
Well, then, I'll play.
Good.
- Fine.
- Fine.
Go play.
You look like shit.
Don't you ever shave?
We're gonna win.
We're gonna win!
You're gonna lose!
You stink!
Got him!
Lineup change!
- It's okay.
- Evelyn, he deserved it.
Stilwell, you gonna stay out here or come in the dugout?
Strike!
Strike!
You're out!
3!
Strike!
You're out!
You're out, Brenda!
You are out!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Good, Mae!
Good catch!
Thank goodness.
2 down!
2 down!
Base hit.
Gardner's up with it.
Wallace'll stop at 3rd.
Gardner's throw is way off line!
Go!
Go!
All the way!
I'm sorry!
Shoot!
Wallace scampers home, and the Belles take the lead, 1 to nothing!
They're dancing in the aisles here in Racine!
I know.
I know.
You're still missing the cutoff man.
That's something I would like you to work on before next season.
All right.
Thanks.
Thank you, Mr. Dugan.
All right, let's get this one!
All right, come on!
We need some runs out there.
Make something happen, Mae!
All-the-Way Mae!
- They love her.
- Let's go, let's go!
Very cute.
Thanks.
Safe!
She's safe!
Way to play!
Way to run!
Way to make something happen!
Safe!
You get a hit, I'll baby-sit that little porker!
Come on!
You're out!
Come on!
Bring me home, Helen!
Out!
Peaches are down to their final out.
Only tying and go-ahead runs in scoring position.
Big Dottie Hinson striding to the plate.
Let's get out of this inning!
Come on!
Throw smoke, Kit!
Throw smoke!
Here's the pitch.
Bite me on the butt and call me an apple!
She nearly took her head off!
Mordabito scores!
Murphy, she will score!
Rockford has taken the lead, 2 to 1!
That's my wife!
One more!
Keep it going!
Put it past the little queen here.
Right past her!
There's a fly ball to left field.
She'll have to go for this one!
That's the final out.
But the damage has been done.
Right here in Racine, Rockford leads our Belles, 2 to 1 as we go to the bottom of the 9th.
Come on, it's okay.
You gotta bat now.
Relax!
One run and we are back in this ball game.
Shake it off.
You gotta hit.
It's okay, Kit.
Strike her out!
Bad eye!
Bat at that, blond girl!
She drives it to deep centre!
Mordabito goes to the wall and makes the catch!
Beautiful catch!
Beautiful!
Gotlander's pitch and it is in the dirt!
Ball 1!
That looked good to me, Ellen Sue!
Shake that one off!
That ain't nothing!
Gotlander, she delivers.
It's a ground ball between 1 st and 2nd.
This ball is hot!
Hendricks will go up at 1 st with a base hit.
That's all right. 1 down!
We got 1 down!
Let's go!
Foul ball!
Hinson's taking after it.
That does it!
Did she get it?
She got it!
She got it!
There's no question who the star of this game is.
Dottie Hinson has her team 1 out from the title.
Come on, Kit, you're up.
You're the hitter now.
Let's go.
The last batter standing in Rockford's way is Kit Keller.
Kit is 1 for 3 today.
- Can I have time-out?
- Time!
High fastballs.
She can't hit them, can't lay off them.
All right.
All right, if we just hold them now, we got it!
Come on!
Come on, Ellen Sue!
One, two, three!
Play ball!
- Strike!
- Swing and a miss.
Strike 1!
Yes!
Thank you, God!
Lay off the high ones!
Here's the pitch.
Swing and a miss!
Strike 2!
One more!
One more!
Here's the pitch.
It is a long fly ball.
Back, back, back.
It falls in there!
No one'll get to this ball!
This should tie it up!
Hendricks is rounding 3rd!
She will score!
Keller to 3rd!
Gardner hits the relay man with a frozen rope!
The coach is giving Keller the stop sign at 3rd!
But she is not stopping!
She runs through the stop sign!
She is not stopping!
Here comes the throw!
It should be in time!
Safe!
She is safe!
I can't believe it!
Hinson dropped the ball!
Hinson dropped the ball!
The ball game is over!
Racine has won the game, 3 to 2 and the World Series!
Take me home, Mama, and put me to bed!
I have seen enough to know I have seen too much!
You played a good game.
Well, what do you say?
All right, Ira.
We'll stick with it.
My mother always used to say, "If at first you don't succeed-"
You don't have to spend six months in Saskatchewan.
- Alice, you told me it's lovely.
- If you like icicles.
I thought we were gonna win.
- We didn't.
- Up to that last inning, we had it.
I'm so depressed, I could eat a cow.
It's all right.
You did good.
Get dressed.
See you on the bus.
Thanks.
Wanna be a ballplayer when you get big?
- What's your name?
- Angelina.
Gotta practice really hard.
What's your name?
- How much?
- Help yourself.
Thank you.
- Hitting!
- You all like hitting better?
- What's your name?
- Mary.
- Who you rooting for?
- Racine!
That's what I thought you said.
You guys be good.
Get dirty.
- I'm sorry I knocked you over.
- No, you're not.
You blocked the entire plate!
How do you-
You did what you had to.
You beat me.
You wanted it more than me.
I jammed my shoulder, if it makes you feel any better.
A little.
Bob and I are driving back to Oregon.
You're welcome to come with us.
You two should be alone.
I'd just be in the way.
When will you be coming home?
Some of the girls talked about staying around here and getting jobs.
I really like it here.
Christmas?
I don't know.
You'll come back next year, right?
I wanna have kids.
We wanna have kids.
You got plenty of time to have kids.
You couldn't give this up.
You'd miss it.
Miss it?
Miss putting on all this gear?
Catching a double-header in 100-degree heat?
Pushing the bus in mud?
Getting slammed into every other day by a base runner?
Think I'm gonna miss that?
I'll tell you what I'll miss.
I'll miss the girls.
I'll miss you.
Me?
How many sisters do you think I have?
I love you, Kit.
Really?
Just when I want you to stay, you're leaving.
Thanks for getting me in the league.
You got yourself in the league.
I got you on the train.
Play great.
Like you.
You stay in touch.
Come home every once in a while.
If you don't, I'll come back and hit line drives at your head.
I love you.
And you are gonna miss this.
I don't care what you say.
There's the winner!
Good game, Jimmy.
Hi, I'm a big fan of yours.
I'm Dottie's husband.
Well, then I'm a big fan of yours.
Old man Harvey just offered me a job managing next year in Wichita.
Triple A?
Great.
Good luck.
Turned him down.
Why?
What do you mean, why?
I already got a job.
I'll see you.
Miss Cuthbert, save me my special seat, now, cutie!
Meet you at the hotel.
Did you see Mae's catch, Dad?
I'd rather see you play ball instead of what you used to do.
What are you saying that for?
You make her feel bad!
Steak dinner.
On you.
I'll see you later.
Kit, over here!
Come on, let's go!
That was Bob, huh?
Nice guy.
Lay off of those high ones.
I like the high ones.
- Mule!
- Nag!
Hey, Mae.
Come here.
- What do you want?
- Come here.
- What is it?
- Look at her.
It's Dottie.
Hey, Doris.
Mae?
All-the-Way Mae?
- No one's called me that since-
- Last night!
I'm a married woman now.
Yeah, about eight times.
Girls!
Look who's here!
Shirley?
Helen Haley!
- It's Dr. Haley now.
I'm a doctor.
- I always knew you would be.
- Who's that?
- Dottie Hinson.
Betty Spaghetti?
Best ballplayer in the league.
- I don't remember her.
- She only played one year.
Ellen Sue!
You haven't changed one bit.
I married a plastic surgeon.
Having you here is good luck.
Thanks, Alice!
Marla!
I'm so glad you're here.
- How's...?
- Nelson?
He's good.
He's retired.
Our son runs the business.
How's Bob?
He's...
When?
Just this winter.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Shirley, I'm so excited.
I've got butterflies in my stomach!
They've got a "Women In Baseball" thing up there.
Isn't it neat?
Baseball Hall of Fame.
I'm shaking.
Wait a minute here.
- Guess who that is?
- Who?
You remember?
You're gonna lose.
Stilwell, angel!
My goodness!
Where's your mom?
Mom died a couple of years ago.
I'm sorry.
She was a real nice lady.
And a damn fine ballplayer.
When I heard about this, I felt like I owed it to her to be here.
She always said it was the best time she had in her whole life.
Come here.
Recognize yourself?
- Can I get one of these?
- Sure.
Ladies!
It's a pleasure to welcome you here today.
It's taken years, but you are the first women ever to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame!
- And now-
- Wait.
Wait a minute.
This really isn't right.
Mr. Lowenstein since you kept the league going all those years you do it.
- There you go, Ira.
- Thank you, Bob.
Ladies it's my honour.
Mr. Capadino, look!
That's when you changed my life, honey!
Stilwell, angel, smile!
Batter up
Hear that call
The time has come
For one and all
To play
Ball
We're the members of
The All-American League
We come from cities
Near and far
We've got Canadians
Irish ones and Swedes
We're all for one We're one for all
We're All-Americans
Is that you, Grandma?
I'm so glad you came.
Hi, Aunt Dottie.
Take a picture.
Let's take a picture of the whole team.
The original Peaches!
Strike!
That was clear inside.
It was clear inside, clear inside.
- I told you three times.
- That's my opinion.
Yesterday or tomorrow, that might've been a ball but today, it was a strike!
Subtitles by GELULA CO., INC.
...The Minnesota Pee Wee Championship is up for grabs.
Both teams playing like there's no tomorrow.
Duluth, in the Hawks'zone, looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.
There's a pass out to the blue line.
Intercepted by Gordon Bombay!
Bombay!
He's got a breakaway.
Across the blue line all alone for a chance to win the game!
He's pulled down from behind by Fox of Duluth.
Fox definitely pulled him down from behind and this could be -
Yes, the referee calls for a penalty shot.
Gordon, it's up to you.
I don't wanna see any goats around after the game.
You got it?
Now, you miss this shot... you're not just lettin' me down, you're lettin' your team down.
Apressure situation he's in now.
The 1973 Pee Wee State Championship now rests... on the little shoulders of number 9, Gordon Bombay.
Gordon!
Gordon!
Let's go, son!
All right!
He hit the goalpost!
What a heartbreaker!
Little Gordon Bombay had the chance -
All my client did was attempt to give you what you wanted!
Isn't that right?
This man put his neck on the line for your greed.
Objection.
Your Honour?
Will both counsellors approach the bench?
What's he doing?
I don't have anything to tell you.
I just wanna make a point.
So nod like I'm saying something important.
- Mr. Bombay?
- Gordon, what are you doing?
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.
This drives him nuts and I love it.
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya?
Oh, Mr. Bombay, I'm so glad you could make it.
Please restrict yourself to a relevant cross-examination!
Your Honour, the applicability of societal intent... vis-a-vis individual action is well established.
I'm citing Minneapolis V. Higgins.
The appellant court overruled a judge who disallowed similar testimony.
Now, if I'm not mistaken, that was... you.
Wasn't it,Judge Weathers?
I stand corrected, counsellor.
Objection overruled.
Oh,you really stooped to an all-time low on this, Bombay.
I'm insulted, Frank.
You have no idea how low I can stoop.
I don't mind losing.
I would just like to lose fair.
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.
And what about justice?
That man should be in jail.
It was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me!
Next time do your job, Frankie boy.
- 30 and 0!
I remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case?
We don't count that one because I scored with the court reporter.
- The one you said had the intelligent body?
- That's the one.
- No calls on the Duck phone?
- Not yet.
What's he waiting for?
I saw him in the back of the courtroom.
How about some kudos here, huh?
Mr. Tolbert dropped off ringside seats for tonight's North Stars game.
Hockey?
Forget it!
Gordon, here's the research for the Pearlstein Project.
- Can you get started?
- Jane!
Can't you see I'm reveling here?
Today I'm 30 and 0!
- 30 and one.
- Type,Jeannie, don't speak.
Mr. Bombay's office.
Yes.
It's Ducksworth.
You're right.
He wants to see you.
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
It was nothing, Mr. Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth.
Gordon, another fine job today.
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.
Score.
Don't spike.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean, sir.
This is a business.
It isn't a game.
Next time a little restraint might be in order.
~Hey, man, get off my back I'm doin'the best I can,yeah ~
~ You bust my neck Cut no slack ~
- ~Forget your fellow man Yeah yeah uh-huh ~
- Pull your vehicle over to the right, now!
- This is not good.
- ~ Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah ~
- Licence, please.
- Could you turn down the stereo?
- Sure.
I guess it was a "widdle" noisy.
A "widdle"?
Okay, I'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine?
No, thanks, I'm full.
Okay, out of the car.
Now.
The charges against Mr. Bombay are driving under the influence, driving with an open container and reckless endangerment.
And to think I almost stayed home this morning.
I assume you're representing yourself?
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a licence?
Okay, let's talk business.
What am I facing?
Suspension of licence?
Fines?
What?
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow you to plead guilty to lesser charges.
But that's solely up to the prosecutor.
The city of Minneapolis does not wish to pursue a plea bargain in this case.
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo?
The defendant is released on his own recognizance.
Mr. Ducksworth.
What are you doing here?
I own the place.
How about you?
Just goin' over a few cases.
RICOH Statute stuff.
Oh, I thought you might be researching your defence... against D.U.I. and reckless endangerment.
Did you think I wouldn't find out, Gordon?
There was no reason to concern you with it, sir.
They have no case.
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp.
I found a loophole.
I'm gonna plead not guilty -
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.
There's not going to be a trial.
I am not going to have you drag... this firm's good name through the mud.
I've talked toJudge Weathers and he has agreed to suspend your case.
- Under what conditions?
- Probation, suspension of your driver's licence... and 500 hours of community service.
And a leave of absence from the firm.
A leave of absence?
He can't do that.
- He can't stop me from working!
- He's not.
I am.
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.
It'll teach you compassion, a sense of fair play, how to fit in.
- Community service?
This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.
And hopefully you'll come back a better person and a better attorney, which is why I'm keeping you on salary and have arranged a driver for you.
You know, in the early '7 Os I drove the tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties, amps cranked up to about eight jillion decibels.
All that loud music damaged my hearing, but I got no regrets...
- except for the '80s.
- How could he do this to me?
Community service...
coaching hockey!
I found one!
I'm comin' out!
Karp,you finally found something for once in your life.
Dumpster Dave comes through!
- What do you think?
- Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.
- You gonna take that from him, Karp?
- Remind me to bust you, Averman.
- Thanks, Peter.
Thanks very much.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah!
Right there!
- Yeah!
Here, Petie.
Here, boy.
A little chili to keep you warm, buddy.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look!
I can't believe he ate the can too.
He sniffs.
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.
He sniffs some more.
He stops.
I think this is it!
He's turnin' in a circle.
- He squats!
He scores!
- Yes!
We did it!
Full load.
Stinks!
Come on, come on, give me the dollar!
- Hurry it up already.
- I'm hurrying', okay?
- Go, go, go, go!
- Yeah!
All right!
Let's do it!
Oh, come on.
Stop!
- Yes!
- Okay!
Here we go.
Yeah.
There's more inside.
He's takin'off with it.
This guy deserves what he gets.
Oh, guys, he saw us.
Oh, my!
Rink's gotta be around here someplace.
Just look for a sign that says " Personal Hell. "
How could he do this to me?
I hate kids.
They're barely human.
Come on!
Over here!
Keep it down, please!
Hey, come on.
There's no need for this.
Let's talk, come on.
I'm your friend, aren't I?
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to stop it.
I'm tired of chasing' the puck.
Be careful, man.
It almost hit me that time.
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
It's supposed to hit you.
Does that sound stupid to anyone else?
Good God.
That's the hockey team.
Drive out on the ice.
It'll be all right.
I ain't scared.
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.
We're gonna get in big trouble.
- I'll take care of it.
- They're drugs, I just know it.
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.
This is my dominion.
This is a drug-free zone, you understand?
We ain't buying' nothin'.
I'm feelin' generous today.
So I'm gonna let you get your sorry vanilla bootie outta here... before we be usin' your eyeballs as hockey pucks.
Thanks, bro, but I'm not goin' home 'til I take care of business.
He's got a gun.
Stand back.
Whew!
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.
I'm Gordon Bombay.
I'm the new coach.
What a joke!
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.
Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.
Here's the long and the short of it.
I hate hockey and I don't like kids.
What's this supposed to be, a pep talk?
I'm sure this'll be a real bonding experience.
Maybe one day one of you will even write a book about it in jail.
- Funny.
- Is there a goalie?
Only for a little while.
I'm movin' back to Philly.
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.
Uh,just so you know.
We really suck.
I'll decide who sucks around here.
- Get off me.
- They really suck.
The Pete-meister.
Mr. Rabble-rouser.
Passing the puck over toJesse-roonie, the enforcer.
Ouch!
That hurt!
Oh, it's the Connie-meister, the velvet hammer.
Hi, coach.
I'm Connie.
- Do you play?
- No.
So what's our record anyway?
0 and 9.
One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.
We almost scored a goal too.
So what do we do now... coach?
- What did your old coach have you do?
- He just yelled a lot.
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm?
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us, " Little bastards, where'd you learn to play?
Oh, you suck, you!
Skate, you little bast-"
Heart attack.
Great.
All right, look.
I gotta make a phone call.
Keep scrimmaging.
You, you, you, you and you against you four.
- We got names, you know?
- I'm sure you do.
And I'll bet they're very nice names.
I might even learn 'em.
For now, I'll be in my office.
Oh, and if you need anything, fax me.
Geez, what a jerk.
Where do they find these coaches anyways?
We're impressionable kids, right?
Shouldn't we check his qualifications or somethin'?
Jeannie, who told you not to give me my messages?
Ducksworth!
Then who's handling my cases?
- On three!
- Jane!
- One, two, three!
Charge!
- Are you kidding me?
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to -
Hold on a second!
Hey!
Get your mouth off the windows!
- Hey!
- Get off there!
Get off the car!
- We're being invaded!
- Get off!
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool!
- Is that a real phone?
- Yes, and I'm really on it.
- Not any more.
- Thank you.
- Let's see, who should I -
- Watch the upholstery.
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
- We wanna ride!
- I could kill one of'em just to set an example.
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything!
This looks good.
I'm gonna eat it.
- Wow, I feel like Madonna.
- You wish!
Seats ten comfortably.
Hey, pass me one of those glasses.
Yeah, I see your point.
Oh.
Goldberg!
- It wasn't me, all right!
- Young man, what did you eat?
- Nothing!
It wasn't me!
- Open a window!
Oh, man!
It's my mom!
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.
All right, out!
Everybody, out of the car right now.
Goldberg, why'd you have to ruin the fun?
Are you out of your mind?
What were you thinking putting that car on the ice?
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take.
One crack!
- The ice is not gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
- The new coach?
They send you over here to coach the team and you endanger their lives.
What danger?
I grew up on the ice;
I know when it's safe to drive on.
- How do you know?
- I just know!
All right?
Well, listen, Mr. Zen Master, you may be in tune with the ice universe, but when it comes to my kid, "I just know" doesn't cut it.
Charlie, let's go.
- Mom?
- Give me my candy!
All of it!
Well, I guess practise is over.
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- It's all right, Charlie.
Coach, gonna be at the game tomorrow?
By order of the state of Minnesota, yeah.
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
- Hi, girls.
- Karp!
No!
Goodbye.
The hawks.
My first game and it had to be the Hawks.
Gordon?
Gordon Bombay.
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.
Why don't you just call meJack?
Hey, come back to see your old coach, huh?
Well, actually I'm, uh, coaching...
Pee Wee.
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'.
You got a kid on the team or something?
No, I'm here because I need to be of service to the community.
How about this, huh?
Whoever thought we'd be coaching' against each other?
Yeah, who'd have thought?
So, who's your hotshot player this year?
- Anyone good?
- I got a kid named Banks.
Might go all the way.
Not quite as good as you were.
But he wants it more.
Kid won't give up.
Oh, boy,
I wish they would take that one down.
Don't you?
Well, good luck.
You're gonna need it.
It's up to you, Gordon.
You miss this shot, you're not just... letting me down, you're letting your whole team down too.
I wish your dad could be here to see this.
Make him proud of you!
Win!
Win!
Win!
All right, guys, gather round.
Come on, come on.
- Win!
Win!
Win!
- Win.
Win.
Win!
Win!
Win!
- Win?
- Win!
Win!
Win!
Yeah, we're fired up.
All right!
Watch this!
Oh, great.
Good concept, guys.
Nice - ouch!
Nice goin', fool!
- Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
- Oh, yeah, "I didn't mean to. "
Yeah, sure, you're on my own team.
Oh, sorry, Goldberg.
Didn't mean to.
Would you get off me before I clock you?
Let's go,Jesse!
Go, Terry!
Let's go!
Come on in.
What's this?
The Oreo line!
Hey, come on.
Let's play hockey.
Um, batter, batter, hum, batter, batter!
Hey, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Hum, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Averman!
It's hockey!
There's no batter.
Idiot.
Hum, goalie, goalie, hum, goalie, goalie!
Hey, goalie, goalie, save, goalie, goalie!
Hum, goalie, goalie, hey, goalie, goalie!
No, I got him!
I, I, I got him!
That's one!
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy!
Good show.
Sloppy pass.
Way to stuff it, Banks!
All right, all right!
Let's run it up!
Run it up!
Run it up!
Oh, man!
How could you let him get by you?
All right, line change.
Come on, go, go, go.
Hey!
Banks!
Banks!
Banks!
Hey, you!
Come back here!
Oh!
Why me?
How lazy can you be?
They're killing us out there!
How many times do I have to tell you:
Get those rebounds, get your heads up, get those loose pucks.
Get
- Just -
Just get the hell outta here.
All right!
It's Spaz-way.
He'll screw up.
Hey, hey!
Way to play it, Banks!
All right!
That's okay, Charlie!
Nice try!
Nice fan, Charlie.
Keep swingin'.
Maybe you'll give 'em a cold.
Hey, hey, hey, knock it off!
Against this team we should have twice this many!
Now let's run it up!
Remember it's not worth winning if you can't win big!
All right!
Guys!
No!
Come on, let's talk about this!
Be civilized!
Come on!
Please!
Oh no, guys!
Come on, not again!
Please!
Just take the goal.
Fine!
I don't care!
- I'm so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.
All right!
Hey, knock it off!
That was a lousy third period.
Anybody could beat these pansies.
I want you guys to stay hungry out there!
All right, nice goin', Banks.
New Hawks record.
- Okay, boys.
Let's go.
- All right!
Hey, Gordon!
Nice game.
I enjoyed it thoroughly.
At least I can handle the puck!
Hey, shut up!
You guys stink!
I thought we came here to play hockey.
You know, I knew we forgot something.
Oh, you think it's funny?
You think losing is funny?
Well, not at first, but once you get the hang of it.
We're the ones out there gettin' our butts kicked.
Yeah, it's not like you coach us or anything.
At least we try.
You didn't listen to a word I said.
I said, keep your heads up.
You put your heads down.
I said, hustle.
You went slower!
That was the sloppiest playing I've ever seen.
Why the hell don't you just listen to me?
Why the hell should we?
I don't care.
You want to lose, fine.
You're the ones who look like idiots out there.
Great game!
Hans?
I don't believe it!
Who would throw these away?
- First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
- Fork it over.
Forget it, Karp.
I can see this every day on MTV.
This one's from Minneapolis.
Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom.
- Let's give him a wedgie.
- Good idea,Jesse!
I was just kidding, okay?
Hey!
Give that back!
- Hi, girls.
- Does your mommy know you have that?
Nah, she's busy with the mailman.
That'll make great bathroom reading.
That's mine, you jerk!
I found it!
You don't even know what to do with it, wuss-breath.
- You gonna let him call you wuss-breath?
- No!
Hey!
Hey!
- Oh!
- Come on.
Want some more?
You guys want some more?
Come on!
Yeah!
You want some more?
Come on!
Let's get out!
Move it!
- Thanks a lot.
- All right, man.
One, two, three!
Boom!
What are you laughing at, cream cheese boy?
Go!
If we're gonna cheat, we gotta make those falls look real.
Keep it up!
Whoa!
Score one for the spirit.
Go at him!
Go at him!
Good!
Go at him!
Come on, get angry!
Oh!
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt!
I am hurt.
Good, good.
Now say it again!
Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
- One more time!
- Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
Good!
You guys are ready.
Give me a break, ref!
Open your eyes!
Did you see what he did to me?
Goldberg, you don't take the fall while they're shooting at you.
Oh!
Well, I guess you didn't explain that very well, did ya?
- District Five!
- I throw myself on the ice -
Cut the acting class.
One more dive, I forfeit to theJets!
What?
I'm insulted by that!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
- Quit it!
Face-off!
Let's go!
Charlie!
That guy is twice your size.
The next time he gets you in a corner like that,
I want you to grab your eye like it's cut and then hit the ice!
- Got it?
Let's go.
- Let's go!
Face-off!
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
Here we go.
Hey -
- Come on!
- That's it, Charlie.
- That's it, Charlie!
- Come on!
Damn it, Charlie!
We can't even win when we cheat.
- Stupid cake-eater tricks!
- That was embarrassing.
Charlie!
What the hell is the matter with you?
When I tell you to do something, you do it!
You got it?
Look at me.
- You got it?
- You can't make me cheat.
Jesse, Terry, let's go.
This is what I gave up my overtime pay for?
To see my kids takin' falls?
Gordon.
- How did you know?
- Through the back door at this time of night.
Just like you used to.
You'd spend hours watching me do this.
What do you think?
Is this sharp enough?
Ow!
- Did you cut yourself?
- No.
You always fell for that.
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, I'm Scandinavian.
- It's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.
You probably thought I was dead.
I saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything?
You were so busy screaming at the kids.
I didn't want to spoil the moment.
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.
Why should my store?
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that?
Well, I hardly ever lose a case.
That is not what I asked.
Hmm!
I see you still have this up.
- Thanks very much.
- It is important to remember the past.
I'd just as soon forget it.
That was the worse time in my life.
My dad died that year.
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.
I found this not long ago.
He was proud of you.
I miss him.
You scored 198 goals in that season, Gordon.
It's a shame you quit.
You -
- Could have gone all the way.
Yeah.
- No!
You really loved to play.
You remember?
You remember... you used to play on the ponds until after dark, until your father called you back.
You really flew on that ice, Gordon.
That's all I ever wanted to do.
Then why did you stop?
Reilly?
I saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.
- The guy wins.
- It's not about winning.
It never was.
Just show they how to play.
Show them how to have fun.
Teach them to fly.
That is what they'll remember long after you've gone back to being a doctor.
Lawyer.
And long after they've stopped buying skates from me.
Here... there you are.
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.
- What's this?
- Your new skates.
That is why you came here tonight, isn't it?
- I figured nine and a half was your size.
- Actually, I'm a nine.
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.
Here comes Bombay on an end-to-end rush.
Past the blue line, past centre.
He's not skating, he's flying!
He fakes once, he fakes twice.
Fakes three times!
Shoots!
Scores!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
What a play!
What a guy!
Gordon Bombay does it again!
Great move, Gordy!
You faked him out of his pads.
Come here, son.
You look great out there.
Come on, let's go inside, get something to eat.
A few more minutes?
Please?
- Go on.
Get outta here.
- Thanks.
- Hi, uh -
- Please,just go away.
Charlie doesn't want... to be on the team any more, and neither he nor I have anything to say to you.
- Well, I have something to say to you.
- Oh, really?
Door-to-door mistreatment now.
Now the team can feel miserable between games too, huh?
I came to apologize to Charlie...
to both of you.
- What?
- Apologize.
Well... you should.
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin'?
I was just, uh, walkin' around thinkin' and, uh -
Wanna give us a minute?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Listen, it was very wrong of me... to ask you and the other guys to cheat.
I never should have said to you what I said to you.
I was angry.
I was frustrated.
It took a lot of guts for you to do what you knew was right.
I admire that.
And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that, uh, that I'm -
Oh, boy, this is difficult.
- I'm -
- You're sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right?
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be a lot more fun this time around.
What do you say?
Do you want to stay for dinner?
- What?
- Charlie!
Uh, no, I - I can't.
Uh -
Well, what are you havin'?
Mr. Ducksworth, there are two reasons I came by.
First off, I want to let you know things are going well.
I'm learning a lot about teamwork, fair play and all that junk.
Good, good.
And the second thing?
Well, sir, fair play doesn't come cheap.
These kids, my team, have no money.
They can't afford rink time, safe equipment, proper uniforms, which makes it difficult for them to compete.
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old and stepping out onto that ice... with old copies of the " Enquirer" taped to your shins instead of pads.
The point I'm trying to make, sir, is that you wouldn't be taken seriously and neither are these kids.
So I thought maybe the firm could help 'em out.
How much are we talking about?
- $15,000.
- No way.
Wait a minute.
Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross, the firm that gives back to the community.
Come on.
I'll get you your own jersey.
~ Ooo,yeah ~
~ Can you feel it baby Ooo ~
~I can too, Ooo ~
~ Ooo ~
~ Ooo, come on swing ~
~ Come on swing ~
~ Come on swing ~
~ C-Come on swing Ooo ~
~ Ooo ~
~It's such a good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
~It's such a good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
Who is that kid?
Thanks, Fulton.
- Fulton Reed.
He's in one of my classes.
- How come he's not on the team?
He only plays football.
Some preppie school gave him a scholarship... as long as he doesn't play hockey.
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- I heard it was colleges.
He's been accepted to four of'em.
- Yeah, but I heard he's got to repeat the sixth grade.
- Ah, shut up.
Gordon Bombay?
Bombay was a Hawk.
~...
Good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
~Feel the vibration It's such a good vibration ~~
Dude, check 'em out, man.
Holy cow.
- They're pretty good skaters.
- Anybody know who they are?
That's Tommy Duncan.
He's in my science class.
That's his sister, Tammy.
- Think they'd want to play hockey with us?
- Yeah!
Go get dressed.
I'll do the negotiating.
Just think of it as figure skating... with a stick.
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy!
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive!
Mom isn't gonna like this at all.
So what?
You want me to figure skate, then you gotta play hockey.
What do I know about hockey?
More than you think.
Back to basics!
Skating!
Go!
Go!
Side to side.
Shift your weight.
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.
That's okay, Charlie.
Soft hands.
You don't shoot the puck to your teammate.
You sail it to him.
Karp, on your feet.
- You send it.
- Oh!
Gross!
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it.
Cradle it.
- Oh!
- Again!
Concentration, not strength.
Like the Karate Kid, right?
"Wax on!
Wax off!"
Just shut up and try it, Averman!
- You're such a jerk.
- Send it back, Averman.
Good, Averman.
Charlie.
That's good.
Good.
Now sail it back.
Oh!
Way to go!
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.
Oh!
Here it comes.
Nice and easy.
Good.
- I did it!
I did it!
- All right.
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.
- But when are you gonna work with me in goal?
- Goldberg, do you trust me?
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar mitzvah'd.
This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.
Coach, I think you got the ceremonies mixed up.
It's more like a circumcision.
Coach!
Will you come back here?
What'd I ever do to you, man?
District Five!
Ready!
Oh, man, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
- Aim!
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.
- Oh, please!
No!
- Fire!
I wanna go home!
This doesn't hurt!
You wimps!
Give me your best shot!
Oh!
Come on!
That's good!
Hex goal!
Goalie boot save!
Whoa!
Nice shot, man!
I'm a dog!
I'm a crazed dog!
Come on!
Goldberg!
Goldberg!
I am Goldberg!
The goalie!
Good!
Good!
All right, Charlie!
Good hustle!
Conway, way to go.
All right, Karp!
- You guys hungry?
Tired?
- Yeah!
- Do you ache?
Are you pumped up?
- Yeah!
Good!
That was a hell of a practise.
Be proud of yourself.
Hey, guys!
Excuse me, guys!
You gotta untie me now!
Ha-ha!
Good joke.
Very funny.
I like it.
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach!
Coach, come on, don't leave me hangin' like this!
Coach, don't make me come after you, coach.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Thanks for the ride.
You did real well in practise today, Charlie.
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad?
Mom and I left him.
I don't really remember, but that's what she says.
You know, when I was a boy, I had to take care of my mother too.
Really?
What happened to your dad?
He passed away.
You do a good job takin' care of your mom.
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right?
- Okay.
We'll see ya.
- Okay.
Hey, coach.
- What's that?
- Huh?
- Oh!
- Victory!
You've just entered the tickling zone!
So I'm right in the middle of my cross-examination and I say to the guy,
I usually defend heels like you, you scuzzy, mole-faced rat.
That's a good one, sir.
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Look, it was an accident, all right?
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
I didn't learn.
I just do it.
Do it again.
Yargh!
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal?
Yeah.
Well, one out of five.
Fulton, is it true what they say?
About the scholarships and how they won't let you play hockey?
People talk.
It don't mean nothin'.
- Why don't you play for us?
- I can't.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I can't.
- You afraid?
- No, I mean I can't, you moron.
I don't know how to skate.
Whoa!
Is that all that's stoppin' ya?
~I ride the top of the line I can't settle for less ~
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.
Side to side, good!
Follow me.
Aaah!
Watch it!
Get out of the way!
Sorry!
~ This is all we got baby It's got to be enough ~
~I'd like to try to quit But I don't know how ~
~I needed it then and baby I need it right now ~
Come on, Fulton.
Let's go!
- ~I gotta keep movin' 'til I'm satisfied ~
- Hey!
~ Come on, Come on It's gonna be all right ~~
The Ducks?
We're the Ducks?
Man, what brain-dead jerk came up with that name?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But I didn't have a choice.
We're being sponsored.
By who?
Donald and Daisy?
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks?
You'd rather be District Five?
Some stupid number?
Better than some stupid animal.
I'll have you know, Peter, that the Duck is one of the most noble, agile and intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom.
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.
Neither do hockey players.
Have you guys ever seen a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation?
It's beautiful.
Pretty awesome the way they all stick together.
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight?
No way.
Why?
Because the other animals are afraid.
They know that if they mess with one duck, they gotta deal with the whole flock.
Oh, man!
I'm proud to be a duck.
And I'd be proud to fly with any one of you.
So how about it?
Who's a Duck?
I'll be a Duck.
Yeah.
Me too.
Anybody see Goldberg?
All right!
Now we're the Ducks!
The Mighty Ducks!
- What are we?
- The Ducks!
What the hell are they doing?
Every time you get the puck, you're the quarterback.
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.
Come on, guys.
This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.
What a weird-ass team.
How you doin'?
- You ready?
- I think so.
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.
My God!
Wow!
One out of five.
All right, Let's forget the past.
We lost a few games, tough!
That was District Five.
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right!
Yeah!
Quack, quack.
- Quack.
Quack.
- Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Go...
Ducks!
What the hell was that?
Let's go, Ducks!
Defence!
Defence!
Dig it outta there!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Let's go, Ducks!
Throw it!
Throw it!
To the crease!
Yes!
The Oreo line!
That's my boy!
Defence, Karp!
Defence!
Come on.
I don't wanna go to school today, Mom.
- How many fingers am I holding' up?
- He wouldn't know.
Shut up, Peter.
Karp, are you okay?
- Look at this.
- The Karp-ster used his head to stop the puck.
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.
Get him on the bench, Charlie.
Okay, Ducks, we still got a chance here.
Connie, Terry,Jesse, Guy, time for the secret weapon.
Okay, Fulton.
Remember,just like we talked about.
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.
Oh, no.
- Go!
Get the face-off!
- Line up, boys, let's go.
That's it.
Aaah!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Yeah!
That tie of yours might be what you need to make the play-offs.
- The ducks have a shot at the play-offs?
- Sure.
Everyone but the last two teams are in, remember?
Panthers got the measles and they forfeited the season.
So,you beat the Huskies and you'll make the play-offs.
- Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
- So?
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since I played.
Actually, one little thing has changed.
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.
They redrew the district lines last year.
The lake is not the boundary any more.
You see?
You'd be a Duck.
I'd be a Duck.
Excuse me.
Coach Reilly?
- Yeah?
- I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.
- What's that?
- One of your players is ineligible.
Banks!
Over here!
- This is a joke, right?
- I'm afraid it's no joke.
- Problem?
- No,just a mistake.
Are you this boy's father?
450 North Hennipen, is that your address?
- Yes.
- I'm afraid there's no mistake.
- This boy is playing for the wrong team.
- What?
According to league rules, Adam Banks should be playing for District Five.
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- Is this your doing, Gordon?
I'll expect to see him at our next game.
- We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
- No way.
My son would rather not play than play for your team.
Fine, if that's the way you want it.
But remember, if Adam plays for the Hawks, you'll forfeit every game for the rest of the season.
Boy, I'd hate to see that.
Look, I'm sorry this had to happen, but you can see on the map.
Gordon?
Hey, Bombay!
You stop when I'm talking to you, son!
What's the idea here?
You trying to sabotage me or what?
The law's a bitch when it works against you, isn't it,Jack?
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.
Even with Banks, what do you think you're gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers?
That's right, coach.
They are losers.
We hate losers, don't we?
They don't even deserve to live.
Maybe Banks won't make a difference, but at least we're playing by the rules.
Why'd you turn against me, Gordon?
For six years...
I taught ya how to skate, I taught ya how to score.
I taught ya how to go for the "W."
You could have been one of the greats.
And now look at yourself.
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.
Going to the play-offs!
Whoo!
One win!
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.
All right, everyone, listen up.
I got some good news.
We're getting a new player, Adam Banks.
What?
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.
- We don't need him.
- I'm the coach.
I say we do need him.
- If we make it to the play-offs, he could be a big help.
- If?
All of a sudden you don't think we're good enough.
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.
- What?
- We heard what you said.
You said we were losers, we didn't deserve to live.
- That's not what I meant.
- I saw that picture of you missing that goal.
You were a Hawk, weren't you?
Guess you guys stick together to the end.
You know what?
I don't need your stinkin'equipment.
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.
- I'm talkin' to you, son!
- Forget it, cake-eater.
If you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.
Where do you guys think you're goin'?
I don't believe this.
All right, I'm goin' up to the bench because that's where I'm supposed to be.
Anyone who wants to join me can join me.
Anyone who doesn't -
Well -
Ten minutes to game time, coach.
Yeah, yeah, they'll be out in a minute.
They're, you know, working themselves into a frenzy.
Not much of a frenzy.
We forfeit.
Ducks forfeit.
Flames, you win.
Hey.
Can I sit?
Sure.
You talk to the guys?
I tried.
They think I'm a traitor for even showing up.
I guess they really hate me, huh?
Is it true you were really a Hawk?
Yeah.
Peter said you blew a really big game once.
Yeah, well, Peter's right.
It was the last game of the state finals.
We were tied 2-2 in the end of the third period.
I get a penalty shot.
I go in, I triple deke.
I fake the goalie right out of his pads.
The puck's headed in, and then...
Clang!
Hits the post.
We lost in overtime.
A quarter of an inch this way and it would have gone in.
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way and you'd have missed completely.
I never thought of it that way.
At least you got to play in a championship game.
- That must've been so cool.
- Hey.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
I'd love one.
You know, she has many fine qualities that men find attractive.
I know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.
So, what kind of guys does she usually date?
Jerks.
I mean, most of them like her, but as soon as they catch a glimpse of me -
Pow!
Warp speed!
They are gone!
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, I wouldn't even care... except it's not fair to my mom.
She deserves somebody nice.
Are you gonna come over for dinner again?
I don't know, Charlie.
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
See, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I, um, talked toJesse and Terry's dad, and he's gonna take over coaching for the rest of the year.
- You're quitting?
- I'm stepping aside to keep the team together.
The guys can't play for somebody they don't trust.
I trust you.
The other guys do too.
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.
- I've done all I can.
- No, you haven't.
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.
We are too!
We weren't even the Ducks until you came along.
You made us and now you're stuck with us.
Charlie.
That's right.
The red is oxygen.
Now what are the blue balls?
- Tommy?
- Hydrogen?
Is correct.
Now put them together... and you have a molecule that makes up 96% of your body.
- What is it?
- Pizza?
It's the principal.
I'll be right back.
Work on H2 CO3.
It's a goody.
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way?
- Yeah, did you score?
Leave me alone, guys.
I don't want to talk about the team.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.
Everybody knows he likes you best.
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp!
Take it back now!
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl!
- Lay off!
- Don't shove, Peter.
Atoms away!
My atoms!
You!
Sit!
Sit now!
In your seats now!
I have never in my life -
What have you got to say for yourselves?
Quack.
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!
Thanks for coming by on such short notice, Gordon.
By the way, your court release came through.
- Congratulations.
Your community service is over.
- You're kidding.
So you wanted to talk about my coming back to work then?
- Well, actually -
- Oh, you got your jersey.
Great!
A lot's been happening.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.
Gordon, you know Coach Reilly and Mr. Banks.
Sir, they're the bad guys.
No, actually, Phil is one of my oldest friends.
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together here to try to work out this little problem.
You see, my son Adam wants to play for the Hawks.
His older brother was a Hawk.
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.
It's a tradition.
You understand that, Gordon.
You played.
But the league's already ruled on it.
We've talked to the league, and we worked out a little deal.
- You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League?
- Yes, we did.
The long and short of it is that Adam stays on the Hawks for the rest of the season.
And then next year, they redraft the lines.
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.
What's that?
That you withdraw your protest.
- That's great.
- Good, good.
Well, that's settled then.
No, sir, you don't understand.
I can't withdraw my protest.
- What?
- Mr. Ducksworth, you wanted me to learn about fair play... and how to be part of a team... and I may not have learned everything yet, but I remember something my father said to me.
A team isn't a bunch of kids out to win.
A team is something you belong to, something you feel, something you have to earn.
And I'm not gonna let those kids down.
Gordon, I'm going to make this simple.
Are you prepared to lose your job over some kids?
Some game?
Let me ask you, sir.
Are you prepared to fire me over some kids?
Some game?
Collect your personal belongings, Gordon.
Yes, sir, Mr. Ducksworth!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth!
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.
You may have paid for this jersey, sir, but you didn't earn it.
I'll see you in the play-offs.
- Excuse me.
There are some students here that I'd like to see.
- Who are you?
I'm their hockey coach.
If you could tell me where I can find each of them, please.
They're in room 223.
- All of them?
- All of them.
"I will not quack at the principal. "
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you guys.
- People.
- People, right.
Sit down, please.
All of you.
Okay, don't sit down.
Look, what's done is done.
I want to be your coach again.
You're gonna coach a bunch of losers?
- No, I want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said?
You said we didn't deserve to live.
Karp, I was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means?
- No.
- Okay, then you do.
I didn't mean those things the way they sounded.
You guys know what it's like to be misunderstood, right?
- Yeah, of course.
We're kids.
- So...
Can you forgive me?
Can I be your coach again?
- What about Banks?
- He can be on the team if he wants.
He should have been with us all year.
It's you guys who were cheated.
Let's forget all that crap!
- We're a team, right?
- Yeah.
I made you guys, and I'm sticking with you.
So, what's it gonna be?
We can play tomorrow night and still have a shot at the play-offs... or we can forfeit again and the season's over.
Peter, what do you say?
Well...
I guess it would help if we practised first.
All right.
Let me see if I can get you out of detention.
- Yes.
- Take that.
You really quacked at the principal?
Yeah.
Are we Ducks, or what?
Yeah!
Look at your mother.
Let's see how it is in ten minutes.
I'm gonna kill you!
Hey.
Wasn't sure if you'd show up.
Yeah, whatever.
- I just want to play hockey.
- Good.
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.
On behalf of the Ducks, I'd like to say welcome.
Cake-eater.
Ooh, theJess-man, dissin'the new guy!
TheJess-ster!
Shut up, Averman!
It's just a joke.
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey doesn't mean you're a real Duck.
- They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
- I bet.
Well, suit up.
I'll see you on the ice.
On your left!
Over here!
I'm open!
Come on, right here!
Up front!
- Up front!
- Pass it to Banks!
Come on!
Do somethin' with it!
Yeah!
All right!
Way to go, Banks!
All right!
Score another one for the Ducks!
Goldberg, you're gonna sit this one out.
What?
You're pulling the goalie when we're tied?
Listen, listen, listen!
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.
Okay, Fulton, you're our extra man.
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.
- We pulling the Statue of Liberty play?
- Yeah?
No, take your shot.
You may only get one, so it's gotta be good.
- But, coach, one outta one?
- Soft hands, Fulton.
- Concentration, not strength.
- That's right!
Okay?
Let's get the Huskies!
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one.
Let's go!
- Get in there!
- Come on!
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!
Shoot, Fulton, shoot!
We won!
We made the play-offs!
Boy, this is great.
Guys, look, it's the North Stars.
- Oh, man.
- It's Mike Modano!
- ...
Believe this?
- Cool!
This is too cool.
I can't believe this.
This place is humongous.
What are we doing here?
It's a little play-offs present.
Hey, Gordo!
Gordon Bombay, right?
- You remember me?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- I heard you were a farmer.
Actually, I became a lawyer.
But I'm coaching Pee Wee now and this is my team, the Ducks.
- Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
- We can see that.
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks!
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.
If you ever want a shot, I'll get you a tryout in the minor league clubs.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, nice seein' ya.
Take it easy.
All right, let's have some fun!
~ You've got to accentuate the positive ~
~Eliminate the negative ~
~Latch on to the affirmative ~
~Don't mess with Mister In-between ~
~ You've got to spread joy up to the maximum ~

- Hey!
- Hey!
~Don't you mess with Mister In-between ~~
You know, I heard the North Stars wore the same underwear... all through the play-offs last year for luck.
So I'm doin' the same thing.
Hmm.
Maybe I should've cooked.
You know, I'm thinkin' maybe we can all go down to the winter festival tonight.
- All three of us?
- Sure.
I don't think I should, 'cause I got a lot of homework.
You should go.
With my mom.
By yourselves.
Mmm, smells great!
Hello.
Go for it.
Hi.
I don't know how they sculpt these.
Hmm, I wonder.
I used to sculpt, but now I do mostly paintings.
How do you think they do the details?
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.
Oh.
I'm nervous.
I'm rambling on and on here.
You probably think I'm weird.
No, I think you're great.
When I was a little girl, I used to pretend that that was an ice castle.
And that was my room, that window right up there.
And last winter I gave Charlie that one.
What about me?
Which window's mine?
I want to live there too.
What?
What did I say?
- It's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy?
Casey, I was just playin' around.
Look, I don't know how you feel about me.
I don't even know how I feel about you.
But I do know there's a little kid back home... who's absolutely falling in love with his coach... and if you can't deal with that, if you're just playing around, then you better let me know.
What are we talking?
'Til death do us part?
- I have to decide on the first date?
- Stop it, Gordon.
Charlie's gonna be there when we get back.
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.
Look, I can take it.
But if Charlie gets too attached -
Every time this happens, it gets... a little rougher on him.
Just on him?
I'm glad to be here with you.
Me too.
The surprising Ducks are still in this game... against the Hornets.
Banks moving right in front, stops.
He shoots, he scores!
It's getting rough out there between the Ducks and the Hornets.

Germaine put it off the goaltender's glove into the net!
And that does it!
The Ducks have won!
Can you believe it?
4-2, and the Ducks now get set to face the Hawks in the state finals.
All right, it's up to you, Gordon.
Now,you miss this shot, you're not just letting your team down, you're letting me down too.
Remember, it's not worth playing -
- If you can't win.
- That's right.
Okay, son, let's go.
Let's go, son!
~...
Oh, say does that star-spangled ~
~Banner yet wave ~
~ O'er the land of the free ~
~And the home of the brave ~~
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
All right!

All right, pressure, boys.
Pressure, pressure!
All right, hold it, hold it.

Oh, my God.
Come on, son, let's go.
Come on.
Number seven, McGill.
Cross-checking.
Two minutes.
Don't worry, guys.
Did it go in?
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favour.
Kick some Hawk butt.
All right, cake-eater.
He'll be okay, sir.
We need to take some X rays, though.
Hell of a job, son.
They score against us, they're gonna pay the price.
Now, don't worry.
We're gonna get that one back.
You got somethin' to say to me, Bombay?
To think I wasted all those years worrying about what you thought.
You're goin' down, Reilly.
- Let me go after 'em, coach.
Let me get 'em.
- No, we're better than that.
Look, look, it's time to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.
- All right?
Now we got the power play.
- Yeah.
All right.
We're gonna hit 'em where it hurts the most: up there.
Fulton, you're in.
- Coach, they'll be rushing' him.
- Right.
Jesse, make sure you give Fulton plenty of time.
- Right, coach.
- Jesse, do good.
Let's go!
- Yeah!
- Hold it!
Wait!
Whoa!
Let's have fun out there.
- All right!
- All right!
Let's go!
Let's go!
The Ducks trail 3-1, and now they call on number 44, Fulton Reed...

That's it!
More fun!
More fun!
Of all the sloppy ass
- Ladies, they don't need our help out there!
Now I want that Fulton Reed covered.
He better not make another shot.
You got it?
I'm tellin' you, you blow this game and nobody makes the team next year!
All right, get out there!
Quick feet, now!
Quick feet!
The puck comes around, now to Blake on the right side.
Blake through the slot with a backhand.
Scores!

We have got to stay fired up and focused, all right?
It ain't over 'til it's over.

We're still alive!

Yes, we're still in there!
He Grabs McGill from behind... and throws him over the boards into the bench.
Now he wants to pick a fight with the entire Hawks team.
Fulton Reed has to be restrained by the referee.
Game misconduct.
You're outta here, son.
I'm off, coach.
He barely touched him.
Oreo line!
I want you to remember what we learned.
- Ducks stick together, right?
- Yeah!
So let's see it!
Show me the flying "V."
- All right!
- All right!
Let's get a line change!
Let's go!
Here we go!
Come on, y'all, let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
Flying "V"!

- Conway to centre ice on a breakaway!
Conway moving across the Hawk blue line, down the middle!
He could win the game!
Hey!
Where's the call?
No time left on the clock, but the referee is calling a penalty shot!
What kind of call is that?
Okay, we've got a penalty shot for the Ducks.
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.
All right, Ducks, who's gonna take it?
- I think he should take it.
- Me?
What about Charlie?
- What about Charlie?
- All he does is fan.
Let's let him finish what he started.
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.
Come here.
You been practising that triple deke?
- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.
You may make it, you may not.
But that doesn't matter, Charlie.
What matters is that we're here.
Look around.
Whoever thought we'd make it this far?
One, two, three.
Triple deke.
Take your best shot.
I believe in you, Charlie, win or lose.
- Thanks, coach.
- Go get 'em.
- All right, Charlie.
- Let's go, Charlie.
Okay, now wait for my signal.
Good luck.
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...
Okay, now don't leave your crease before he touches the puck.
Good luck.
Come on, Charlie.
Come on, Charlie.

Yeah.

One step at a time.
Yeah, you're right.
Bye.
I'll call you when I get there.
Banks is first in line next!

The Minnesota Pee Wee Championship is up for grabs.
Both teams playing like there's no tomorrow.
Duluth, in the Hawks' zone, looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.
There's a pass out to the blue line.
Intercepted by Gordon Bombay!
Bombay!
He's got a breakaway.
Across the blue line all alone for a chance to win the game!
He's pulled down from behind by Fox of Duluth.
Fox definitely pulled him down from behind and this could be...
Yes, the referee calls for a penalty shot.
What a game!
Hi, Gordon, it's up to you.
I don't wanna see any goats around here after the game.
You got it?
Now, you miss this shot... you're not just lettin' me down, you're lettin' your team down too.
A pressure situation he's in now.
The 1973 Pee Wee State Championship now rests on the little shoulders of number nine, Gordon Bombay.
Gordon!
Gordon!
Gordon!
Gordon!
Gordon!
Let's go, son!
All right!
He hit the goalpost, with a chance to win the game!
What a heart-breaker!
Little Gordon Bombay had the chance...
All my client did was attempt to give you what you wanted!
Isn't that right?
This man put his neck on the line for your greed.
Objection.
Your Honor?
Will both Counselors approach the bench?
What's he doing?
I don't have anything to tell you.
I just wanna make them wait.
So nod like I'm saying something important.
- Mr. Bombay?
- Gordon, what are you doing?
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.
This drives him nuts and I love it.
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya?
Oh, Mr. Bombay, I'm so glad you could make it.
Please restrict yourself to a relevant cross-examination!
Your Honor, the applicability of societal intent,
Vis-a-Vis individual action is well established.
I'm citing Minneapolis V. Higgins, in which the appellant court overruled a judge who disallowed similar testimony.
Now, if I'm not mistaken, that was... you.
Wasn't it, Judge Weathers?
I stand corrected, counselor.
Objection overruled.
Oh, you really stooped to an all-time low on this, Bombay.
I'm insulted by that, Frank.
You have no idea how low I can stoop.
I mean, I don't mind losing.
I would just like to lose fair.
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.
And what about justice?
That man should be in jail.
It was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me!
Next time, do your job, Frankie boy.
- 30 and 0!
I remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case?
We don't count that one because I scored with the court reporter.
The one you said had the intelligent body?
That's the one.
- No calls on the Duck phone?
- Not yet.
What's he waiting for?
I saw him in the back of the courtroom.
How about some kudos here, huh?
Mr. Tolbert dropped off ringside seats for tonight's North Stars game.
Hockey?
Forget it!
Gordon, here's the research for the Pearlstein Project.
- Can you get started?
- Jane!
Can't you see I'm reveling here?
Today I'm 30 and 0!
- 30 and one.
- Type, Jeannie, don't speak.
Mr. Bombay's office.
Yes.
It's Ducksworth.
You're right.
He wants to see you.
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
It was nothing, Mr. Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth.
Gordon, another fine job today.
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.
Score.
Don't spike.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean, sir.
This is a business.
It isn't a game.
Next time, a little restraint might be in order.
Hey, man, get off my back
I'm doin' the best I can, yeah
You bust my neck Cut no slack
Forget your fellow man Yeah, yeah, uh-huh
Pull your vehicle over to the right, now!
This is not good.
- Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah
- COP:
License, please.
- Could you turn down the stereo?
- Sure.
I guess it was a widdle noisy.
A "widdle"?
Okay, I'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine?
No, thanks, I'm full.
Okay, out of the car.
Now.
The charges against Mr. Bombay are driving under the influence, driving with an open container and reckless endangerment.
And to think I almost stayed home this morning.
I assume you're representing yourself?
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a license?
Okay, let's talk business.
What am I facing?
Suspension of license?
Fines?
What?
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow you to plead guilty to lesser charges.
But that's solely up to the prosecutor.
The city of Minneapolis does not wish to pursue a plea bargain in this case, Your Honor.
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo?
The defendant is released on his own recognizance.
Mr. Ducksworth.
What are you doing here?
I own the place.
How about you?
Just goin' over a few cases.
RICOH Statute stuff.
Oh, I thought you might be researching your defense against D.U.I. and reckless endangerment.
Did you think I wouldn't find out, Gordon?
There was no reason to concern you with it, sir.
They have no case.
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp.
I found a loophole.
I'm gonna plead not guilty...
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.
There's not going to be a trial.
I am not going to have you drag this firm's good name through the mud.
I've talked to Judge Weathers and he has agreed to suspend the disposition of your case.
Under what conditions?
Probation, suspension of your driver's license, and 500 hours of community service.
And a leave of absence from the firm.
A leave of absence?
He can't do that.
- He can't stop me from working!
- He's not.
I am.
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.
It'll teach you compassion, a sense of fair play, how to fit in.
- Community service?
This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.
And hopefully, you'll come back a better person and a better attorney, which is why I'm keeping you on salary and have arranged a driver for you.
You know, in the early '70s,
I drove the tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties, amps cranked up to about eight gillion decibels.
Doctor said all that loud music damaged my hearing, but I got no regrets.
Except for the '80s.
How could he do this to me?
Community service...
coaching hockey!
I found one!
I'm comin' out!
Karp, you finally found something for once in your life.
Dumpster Dave comes through!
What do you think?
Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.
You gonna take that from him, Karp?
No.
Remind me to bust your head, Averman.
- Thanks, Peter.
Thanks very much.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah!
Right there!
- Yeah!
Here, Petie.
Here, boy.
A little chili to keep you warm, buddy.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look!
I can't believe he ate the can too.
He sniffs.
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.
He sniffs some more.
He stops.
I think this is it!
He's turnin' in a circle.
- He squats!
He scores!
- Yes!
We did it!
Full load.
Stinks!
Come on, come on, give me the dollar!
- Hurry it up already.
- I'm hurrying', okay?
- Go, go, go, go!
- Yeah!
All right!
Let's do it!
Oh, come on.
Stop!
- Yes!
- Okay!
Here we go.
Yeah.
There's more inside.
He's takin' off with it.
This guy deserves what he gets.
Oh, guys, he saw us.
Oh, my!
Rink's gotta be around here someplace.
Just look for a sign that says "Personal Hell."
How could he do this to me?
I hate kids.
They're barely human.
Come on!
Over here!
Keep it down, please!
Hey, please, come on.
There's no need for this.
Let's talk, come on.
I'm your friend, aren't I?
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to stop it.
I'm getting tired of chasing' the puck.
Be careful, man.
It almost hit me that time.
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
It's supposed to hit you.
Does that sound stupid to anyone else?
Good God.
That's the hockey team.
Drive out on the ice.
It'll be all right.
I ain't scared.
Come on.
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.
- We'll get in big trouble.
- Chill, all right?
- I'll take care of it.
- They're drugs, I just know it.
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.
This is my dominion.
This is a drug-free zone, you understand?
We ain't buying' nothin'.
I'm feelin' generous today.
So I'm gonna let you get your sorry vanilla bootie outta here before we be usin' your eyeballs as hockey pucks.
Thanks, bro, but I'm not goin' home 'til I take care of business.
- He's got a gun.
- Stand back.
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.
I'm Gordon Bombay.
I'm the new coach.
What a joke!
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.
- Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.
- Geez, he is the coach!
Here's the long and the short of it.
I hate hockey and I don't like kids.
What's this supposed to be, a pep talk?
Look, I'm sure this'll be a real bonding experience.
Maybe one day, one of you will even write a book about it in jail.
- Funny.
- Is there a goalie?
Only for a little while.
I'm movin' back to Philly.
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.
Uh, just so you know.
We really suck.
I'll decide who sucks around here.
- Get off me.
- They really suck.
The Pete Meister.
Mr. Rabble Rouser.
Passing the puck over to Jesse Roonie, the enforcer.
Ouch!
That hurt!
Oh, it's the Connie-meister, the velvet hammer.
Hi, coach.
I'm Connie.
- Do you play?
- No.
So what's our record anyway?
0 and 9.
One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.
We almost scored a goal too.
So what do we do now... coach?
- What did your old coach have you do?
- He just yelled a lot.
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm?
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us,
"Little bastards, where'd you learn to play?
Oh, you suck, you!
Skate, you little bast..."
Heart attack.
Great.
All right, look.
I gotta make a phone call.
Keep scrimmaging.
You, you, you, you and you against you four.
- We got names, you know?
- I'm sure you do.
And I bet they're very nice names.
I might even learn 'em.
For now, I'll be in my office.
Oh, and if you need anything, fax me.
Geez, what a jerk.
Where do they find these coaches anyways?
We're impressionable kids, right?
Shouldn't we check his qualifications or somethin'?
Jeannie, who told you not to give me my messages?
Ducksworth!
Then who's handling my cases?
- On three!
- Jane!
- One, two, three!
Charge!
- Are you kidding me?
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to...
Hold on a second!
Hey!
Get your mouth off the windows!
- Hey!
- Get off there!
Get off the car!
- We're being invaded!
- Get off!
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool!
- Is that a real phone?
- Yes, and I'm really on it.
- Not any more.
- Thank you.
- Let's see, who should I...
- Watch the upholstery.
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
I could kill one of 'em just to set an example, sir.
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything!
This looks good.
I'm gonna eat it.
- Wow, I feel like Madonna.
- You wish!
- Seats ten comfortably.
- Shut up, Karp.
Hey, pass me one of those glasses.
Yeah, I see your point.
Oh.
Goldberg!
- It wasn't me, all right!
- Young man, what did you eat?
- Nothing!
It wasn't me!
- Open a window!
Oh, man!
It's my mom!
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.
All right, out!
Everybody, out of the car right now.
Goldberg, why'd you have to ruin the fun?
It was not me who farted!
Are you out of your mind?
What were you thinking putting that car on the ice?
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take.
One crack!
- The ice isn't gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are?
I'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
The new coach?
They send you to coach the team and you endanger their lives.
What danger?
I grew up on the ice, I know when it's safe to drive on.
- How do you know?
- I just know!
All right?
Well, listen, Mr. Zen Master, you may be in tune with the ice universe, but when it comes to my kid, "I just know" doesn't cut it.
Charlie, let's go.
Mom?
Give me my candy!
All of it!
All of it, now!
Well, I guess practice is over.
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- It's all right, Charlie.
Coach, gonna be at the game tomorrow?
By order of the state of Minnesota, yeah.
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
Hi, girls.
- Karp!
No!
- Goodbye.
The hawks.
My first game and it had to be the Hawks.
Gordon?
Gordon Bombay.
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.
Why don't you just call me Jack?
Hey, come back to see your old coach, huh?
Well, actually I'm, uh, coaching...
Pee Wee.
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'.
You got a kid on the team or something?
No, I'm here because I need to be of service to the community.
How about this, huh?
Whoever thought we'd be coaching' against each other?
Yeah, who'd have thought?
So, who's your hotshot player this year?
- Anyone good?
- I got a kid named Banks.
Might go all the way.
Not quite as good as you were.
But he wants it more.
Kid won't give up.
Oh, boy,
I wish they would take that one down.
Don't you?
Well, good luck.
You're gonna need it.
It's up to you, Gordon.
You miss this shot, you're not just letting me down, you're letting your whole team down too.
I wish your dad could be here to see this.
Make him proud of you!
Win!
Win!
Win!
All right, guys, gather round.
Come on, come on.
- Win!
Win!
Win!
- Win.
Win.
Win!
Win!
Win!
- Win?
- Win!
Win!
Win!
Yeah, we're fired up.
All right!
Watch this!
Oh, great.
Good concept, guys.
Nice...
Ouch!
Nice goin', fool!
- Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
- Oh, yeah, "I didn't mean to."
Yeah, sure, you're on my own team.
- Yeah, no problem!
- Oh, sorry, Goldberg.
Didn't mean to.
Would you get off me before I clock you?
Let's go, Jesse!
Go, Terry!
Let's go!
Come on in.
What's this?
The Oreo line!
Hey, come on.
Let's play hockey.
Um, batter, batter, hum, batter, batter!
Hey, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
Hum, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
Averman!
It's hockey!
There's no batter.
Idiot.
Hum, goalie, goalie, hum, goalie, goalie!
Hey, goalie, goalie, save, goalie, goalie!
Hum, goalie, goalie, hey, goalie, goalie!
No, I got him!
I got him!
That's one!
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy!
Good show.
Sloppy pass.
Way to stuff it, Banks!
We will, we will rock you!
All right, all right!
Let's run it up!
Run it up!
Run it up!
Oh, man!
How could you let him get by you?
All right, line change.
Come on, go, go, go.
Hey!
Banks!
Banks!
Banks!
Hey, you!
Come back here!
Oh!
Why me?
How lazy can you be?
They're killing us out there!
How many times do I have to tell you:
Get those rebounds, get your heads up, get those loose pucks.
Get...
Just...
Just get the hell outta here.
All right!
It's Spaz-way.
He'll screw up.
Hey, hey!
Way to play it, Banks!
All right!
That's okay, Charlie!
Nice try!
Nice fan, Charlie.
Keep swingin'.
Maybe you'll give 'em a cold.
Hey, hey, hey, knock it off!
Against this team, we should have twice this many!
Now let's run it up!
Remember, it's not worth winning if you can't win big!
All right!
Guys!
No!
Come on, let's talk about this!
Be civilized!
Come on!
Please!
Oh no, guys!
Come on, not again!
Please!
Just take the goal.
Fine!
I don't care!
- I'm so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.
All right!
Hey, knock it off!
That was a lousy third period.
Anybody could beat these pansies.
I want you guys to stay hungry out there!
All right, nice goin', Banks.
New Hawks record.
- Okay, boys.
Let's go.
- All right!
Hey, Gordon!
Nice game.
I enjoyed it thoroughly.
At least I can handle the puck!
Hey, shut up!
You guys stink!
I thought we came here to play hockey.
You know, I knew we forgot something.
Oh, you think it's funny?
You think losing is funny?
Well, not at first, but once you get the hang of it.
We're the ones out there gettin' our butts kicked.
Yeah, it's not like you coach us or anything.
At least we tried.
You didn't listen to a word I said.
I said, keep your heads up.
You put your heads down.
I said, hustle.
You went slower!
That was the sloppiest playing I've ever seen.
Why the hell don't you just listen to me?
Why the hell should we?
I don't care.
You want to lose, fine.
You're the ones who look like idiots out there.
Great game!
Hans?
I don't believe it!
Who would throw these away?
First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
Yeah, guys.
Fork it over.
Forget it, Karp.
I can see this every day on MTV.
Hey, guys, this one's from Minneapolis.
Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom.
- Let's give him a wedgie.
- Good idea, Jesse!
Come on!
I was just kidding, okay?
Hey!
Give that back!
Hi, girls.
Does your mommy know you have that?
Nah, she's busy with the mailman.
That'll make great bathroom reading.
That's mine, you jerk!
I found it!
You don't even know what to do with it, wuss-breath.
You gonna let him call you wuss-breath?
No!
Hey!
Hey!
- Oh!
- Come on.
Want some more?
You guys want some more?
Come on!
Yeah!
You want some more?
Come on!
Let's get out!
Move it!
- Thanks a lot.
- All right, man.
One, two, three!
Boom!
What are you laughing at, cream cheese boy?
Let's go!
If we're gonna cheat, we gotta make those falls look real.
Keep it up!
Whoa!
Score one for the spirit.
Go at him!
Go at him!
Good!
Go at him!
Come on, get angry!
Oh!
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt!
I am hurt.
Good, good.
Now say it again!
Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
One more time!
Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
Good!
You guys are ready.
Give me a break, ref!
Open your eyes!
Did you see what he did to me?
- Goldberg!
- What?
You don't take the fall while they're shooting at you.
Oh!
Well, I guess you didn't explain that very well, did ya?
- I throw myself on the ice...
- District Five!
Cut the acting class.
One more dive, I forfeit to the Jets!
What?
I'm insulted by that!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
- Quit it!
Face-off!
Let's go!
Charlie!
That guy is twice your size.
So the next time he gets you in a corner like that,
I want you to grab your eye like it's cut and then hit the ice!
- Got it?
Let's go.
- Let's go!
Face-off!
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
Here we go.
Hey!
- Come on!
- That's it, Charlie.
- That's it, Charlie!
- Come on!
Damn it, Charlie!
We can't even win when we cheat.
- Stupid cake-eater tricks!
- That was embarrassing.
Charlie!
What the hell is the matter with you?
When I tell you to do something, you do it!
You got it?
Look at me.
- You got it?
- You can't make me cheat.
Jesse, Terry, let's go.
This is what I gave up my overtime pay for?
To see my kids takin' falls?
Gordon.
How did you know?
Through the back door at this time of night.
Just like you used to.
You'd spend hours watching me do this.
What do you think?
Is this sharp enough?
Ow!
- Did you cut yourself?
- No.
You always fell for that.
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, I'm Scandinavian.
- It's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.
You probably thought I was dead.
I saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything?
You were so busy screaming at the kids.
I didn't want to spoil the moment.
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.
Why should my store?
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that?
Well, I hardly ever lose a case.
That is not what I asked.
Hmm.
I see you still have this up.
- Thanks very much.
- It is important to remember the past.
I'd just as soon forget it.
That was the worse time of my life.
My dad died that year.
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.
I found this not long ago.
He was proud of you.
I miss him.
You scored 198 goals in that season, Gordon.
It's a shame you quit.
You...
- Could have gone all the way.
Yeah.
- No!
You really loved to play.
You remember?
You remember... you used to play on the ponds until after dark, until your father called you back.
You really flew on that ice, Gordon.
That's all I ever wanted to do.
Then why did you stop?
Reilly?
I saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.
- The guy wins.
- It's not about winning.
It never was.
Just show them how to play.
Show them how to have fun.
Teach them to fly.
That is what they'll remember long after you've gone back to being a doctor.
Lawyer.
And long after they've stopped buying skates from me.
Here... there you are.
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.
- What's this?
- Your new skates.
That is why you came here tonight, isn't it?
I figured nine and a half was your size.
Actually, I'm a nine.
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.
Here comes Bombay on an end-to-end rush.
Past the blue line, past center.
He's not skating, he's flying!
He fakes once, he fakes twice.
Fakes three times!
Shoots!
Scores!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
What a play!
What a guy!
Gordon Bombay does it again!
Great move, Gordy!
You faked him out of his pads.
Come here, son.
You look great out there, Gordy.
Come on, let's go inside, it's getting late.
A few more minutes?
Please?
- Go on.
Get outta here.
- Thanks.
- Hi, um...
- Please, just go away.
Charlie doesn't want to be on the team any more, and neither he nor I have anything to say to you.
Well, I have something to say to you.
Oh, really?
Door-to-door mistreatment now.
Now the team can feel miserable between games too, huh?
I came to apologize to Charlie... to both of you.
- What?
- Apologize.
Well... you should.
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin'?
I was just walkin' around thinkin' and, uh...
Wanna give us a minute?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Listen, it was very wrong of me to ask you and the other guys to cheat.
I never should've said what I said to you.
I was angry.
I was frustrated.
It took a lot of guts for you to do what you knew was right.
I admire that.
And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that, uh, that I'm...
Oh, boy, this is difficult.
- I'm...
- You're sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, all right?
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be a lot more fun this time around.
What do you say?
Do you want to stay for dinner?
- What?
- Charlie!
Uh, no, I...
I can't.
Uh...
Well, what are you havin'?
Mr. Ducksworth, there are two reasons I came by.
First off, I want to let you know things are going well.
I'm learning a lot about teamwork, fair play and all that junk.
Good, good.
And the second thing?
Well, sir, fair play doesn't come cheap.
These kids, my team, have no money.
They can't afford rink time, safe equipment, proper uniforms, which makes it difficult for them to compete.
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old and stepping out onto that ice with old copies of the Enquirer taped to your shins instead of pads.
The point I'm trying to make, sir, is that you wouldn't be taken seriously, and neither are these kids.
So I thought maybe the firm could help 'em out.
How much are we talking about?
- Fifteen thousand dollars.
- No way.
Wait a minute.
Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross, the firm that gives back to the community.
Come on.
I'll get you your own jersey.
Ooo, yeah
- Can you feel it baby?
- Ooo
- I can too
- Ooo
Ooo
- Ooo
- Come on, swing
Come on, swing
Come on, swing
- Come on swing
- Ooo
Ooo
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
- Who is that kid?
- Thanks, Fulton.
Fulton Reed.
He's in one of my classes.
How come he's not on the team?
He only plays football.
Some preppie school gave him a scholarship as long as he doesn't play hockey.
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- I heard it was colleges.
He's already been accepted to four of 'em.
Yeah, but I heard he's gotta repeat the sixth grade.
Ah, shut up.
Gordon Bombay?
Bombay was a Hawk.
Good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
- Feel the vibration
- It's such a good vibration
Dude, check 'em out, man.
Holy cow.
- They're pretty good skaters.
- Anybody know who they are?
That's Tommy Duncan.
He's in my science class.
And that's his sister, Tammy.
Think they'd want to play hockey with us?
Yeah!
Go get dressed.
I'll do the negotiating.
Just think of it as figure skating...
with a stick.
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy!
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive!
Mom isn't gonna like this at all.
So what?
You want me to figure skate, then you gotta play hockey.
What do I know about hockey?
More than you think.
Back to basics!
Skating!
Go!
Go!
Side to side.
Shift your weight.
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.
That's okay, Charlie.
Soft hands.
You don't shoot the puck to your teammate.
You sail it to him.
Karp, on your feet.
- You send it.
- Oh!
Gross!
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it.
Cradle it.
- Oh!
- Again!
Concentration, not strength.
Like the Karate Kid, right?
"Wax on!
Wax off!"
Just shut up and try it, Averman!
- You're such a jerk.
- Send it back, Averman.
Good, Averman.
Charlie.
Good!
Good.
Now, sail it back.
Oh!
Way to go!
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.
Oh!
Here it comes.
Nice and easy.
Good.
- I did it!
I did it!
- All right.
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.
But when are you gonna work with me in goal?
Goldberg, do you trust me?
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar Mitzvah'd.
This is your bar Mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.
Coach, I think you got the ceremonies mixed up.
It's more like a circumcision.
Coach!
Will you come back here?
What'd I ever do to you, man?
District Five!
Ready!
Oh, man, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
- Aim!
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.
- Oh, please!
No!
- Fire!
I wanna go home!
This doesn't hurt!
You wimps!
Give me your best shot!
Oh!
Come on!
Hex goal!
Goalie boot save!
Come and get me!
Whoa!
Nice shot, man!
I'm a dog!
I'm a crazed dog!
Come on!
Goldberg!
Goldberg!
I am Goldberg!
The goalie!
Good!
Good!
All right, Charlie!
Good hustle, Conway!
Way to go.
All right, Karp!
- You guys hungry?
Tired?
- Yeah!
- Do you ache?
Are you pumped up?
- Yeah!
Good!
That was a hell of a practice.
Be proud of yourself.
Hey, guys!
Excuse me, guys!
You gotta untie me now!
Ha-ha!
Good joke.
Very funny.
I like it.
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach!
Coach, come on, don't leave me hangin' like this!
Coach, don't make me come after you, coach.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Thanks for the ride.
You did real well in practice today, Charlie
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad?
Mom and I left him.
I don't really remember, but that's what she says.
You know, when I was a boy, I had to take care of my mother too.
Really?
What happened to your dad?
He passed away.
You do a good job takin' care of your mom.
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right?
- Okay.
Well, see ya.
- Okay.
Hey, coach.
- What's that?
- Huh?
Whoa!
- Oh!
- Victory!
You've just entered the tickling zone!
So I'm right in the middle of my cross-examination, and I say to the guy,
"I usually defend heels like you, you scuzzy, mole-faced rat."
That's a good one, sir.
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Look, it was an accident, all right?
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
I didn't learn.
I just do it.
Do it again.
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal?
Yeah.
Well, one out of five.
Fulton, is it true what they say?
About the scholarships and how they won't let you play hockey?
People talk.
It don't mean nothin'.
- Why don't you play for us?
- I can't.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I can't.
- You afraid?
- No, I mean I can't, you moron.
I don't know how to skate.
Whoa!
Is that all that's stoppin' ya?
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.
Side to side, good!
Follow me.
Watch it!
Get out of the way!
Sorry!
Come on, Fulton.
Let's go!
Hey!
Whoa!
The Ducks?
We're the Ducks?
Man, what brain-dead jerk came up with that name?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But I didn't have a choice.
We're being sponsored.
By who?
Donald and Daisy?
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks?
You'd rather be District Five?
Some stupid number?
Better than some stupid animal.
I'll have you know, Peter, that the duck is one of the most noble, agile and intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom.
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.
Neither do hockey players.
Have you guys ever seen a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation?
It's beautiful.
Pretty awesome the way they all stick together.
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight?
No way.
Why?
Because the other animals are afraid.
They know that if they mess with one duck, they gotta deal with the whole flock.
Oh, man!
I'm proud to be a duck.
And I'd be proud to fly with any one of you.
So how about it?
Who's a Duck?
I'll be a Duck.
Yeah.
Me too.
- Anybody see Goldberg?
- All right!
Now we're the Ducks!
The Mighty Ducks!
- What are we?
- The Ducks!
What the hell are they doing?
Every time you get the puck, you're the quarterback.
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.
Come on, guys.
This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.
What a weird-ass team.
How you doin'?
- You ready?
- I think so.
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.
My God!
Wow!
One out of five.
All right, Let's forget the past.
We lost a few games, tough!
That was District Five.
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right!
Yeah!
Quack, quack.
- Quack.
Quack.
- Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Go...
Ducks!
What the hell was that?
Let's go, Ducks!
Defense!
Defense!
Dig it outta there!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Let's go, Ducks!
Throw it!
Throw it!
To the crease!
Yes!
The Oreo line!
That's my boy!
Defense, Karp!
Defense!
Come on.
I don't wanna go to school today, Mom.
Karp, how many fingers am I holding' up?
- He wouldn't know that anyway.
- Shut up, Peter.
- Karp, are you okay?
- Look at this.
The Karp-ster used his head to stop the puck.
Mr. Karp-a-lanee.
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.
Get him on the bench, Charlie.
Okay, Ducks, we still got a chance here.
Connie, Terry, Jesse, Guy, time for the secret weapon.
Okay, Fulton.
Remember, just like we talked about.
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.
Oh, no.
- Go!
Get the face-off!
- Line up, boys, let's go.
That's it.
Whoa!
Whoo!
Yeah!
That tie of yours might be what you need to make the play-offs.
- The Ducks have a shot?
- Sure.
Everyone but the last two teams are in, remember?
Panthers got the measles and they forfeited the season.
So, you beat the Huskies and you'll make the play-offs.
Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
So?
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since I played.
Actually, one little thing has changed.
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.
They redrew the district lines last year.
The lake is not the boundary any more.
You see?
You'd be a Duck.
I'd be a Duck.
- Excuse me.
Coach Reilly?
- Yeah?
I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.
- What's that?
- One of your players is ineligible.
Banks!
Over here!
- This is a joke, right?
- I'm afraid it's no joke.
- Is there a problem?
- No, just a mistake, Mr. Banks.
Are you this boy's father?
450 North Hennipen Avenue, is that your address?
- Yes.
- I'm afraid there's no mistake.
This boy is playing for the wrong team.
- What?
- According to league rules,
Adam Banks should be playing for District Five.
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- Is this your doing, Gordon?
I'll expect to see him at our next game.
We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
No way!
My son would rather not play than play for your team.
Fine, if that's the way you want it.
But remember, if Adam plays for the Hawks, you'll forfeit every game for the rest of the season.
Boy, I'd hate to see that.
Look, I'm sorry this had to happen, but you can see on the map, it's very clearly delineated.
Gordon?
Hey, Bombay!
You stop when I'm talking to you, son!
What's the idea here?
You trying to sabotage me or what?
The law's a bitch when it works against you, isn't it, Jack?
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.
Even with Banks, what do you think you're gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers?
That's right, coach.
They are losers.
We hate losers, don't we?
They don't even deserve to live.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe Banks won't make a difference, but at least we're playing by the rules.
Why'd you turn against me, Gordon?
For six years...
I taught ya how to skate, I taught ya how to score.
I taught ya how to go for the "W."
You could have been one of the greats!
And now look at yourself.
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.
Going to the play-offs!
Whoo!
One win!
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.
All right, everyone, listen up.
I got some good news.
We're getting a new player, Adam Banks.
What?
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.
- We don't need him.
- I'm the coach.
I say we do need him.
If we make it to the play-offs, he could be a big help.
"If"?
All of a sudden, you don't think we're good enough?
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.
- What?
- We heard what you said.
You said we were losers, we didn't deserve to live.
That's not what I meant.
I saw that picture of you missing that goal.
You were a Hawk, weren't you?
Guess you guys stick together to the end.
You know what?
I don't need your stinkin' equipment.
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.
- I'm talkin' to you, son!
- Forget it, cake-eater.
If you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.
Where do you guys think you're goin'?
I don't believe this.
All right,
I'm goin' up to the bench because that's where I'm supposed to be.
Anyone who wants to join me can join me.
Anyone who doesn't...
Well...
Ten minutes to game time, coach.
Yeah, yeah, they'll be out in a minute.
They're... you know, working themselves into a frenzy.
Not much of a frenzy.
We forfeit.
Ducks forfeit.
Flames, you win.
Hey.
Can I sit?
Sure.
You talk to the guys?
I tried.
They think I'm a traitor for even showing up.
I guess they really hate me, huh?
Is it true you were really a Hawk?
Yeah.
Peter said you blew a really big game once.
Yeah, well, Peter's right.
It was the last game of the state finals.
We were tied 2-2 in the end of the third period.
I get a penalty shot.
I go in, I triple deke.
I fake the goalie right out of his pads.
The puck's headed in, and then...
Clang!
Hits the post.
We lost in overtime.
A quarter of an inch this way and it would've gone in.
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way and you'd have missed completely.
I never thought of it that way.
At least you got to play in a championship game.
God, that must've been so cool.
Hey.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
I'd love one.
You know, she has many fine qualities that men find attractive.
I know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.
So, what kind of guys does she usually date?
Jerks.
I mean, most of them like her, but as soon as they catch a glimpse of me...
Pow!
Warp speed!
They are gone!
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, I wouldn't even care, except it's not fair to my mom.
She deserves somebody nice.
Are you gonna come over for dinner again?
I don't know, Charlie.
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
See, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I, um...
talked to Jesse and Terry's dad, and he's gonna take over coaching for the rest of the year.
You're quitting?
I'm stepping aside to keep the team together.
The guys can't play for somebody they don't trust.
I trust you.
The other guys do too.
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.
- Charlie, I've done all I can.
- No, you haven't.
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.
We are too!
We weren't even the Ducks until you came along.
You made us and now you're stuck with us.
Charlie.
That's right.
The red is oxygen.
Now, what are the blue balls?
- Tommy?
- Hydrogen?
Is correct.
Now put them together, and you have a molecule that makes up 96% of your body.
- What is it?
- Pizza?
It's the principal.
I'll be right back.
Work on H2 CO3.
It's a goody.
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way?
- Yeah, did you score?
Leave me alone, guys.
I don't want to talk about the team.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.
Everybody knows he likes you best.
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp!
Take it back now!
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl!
- Lay off!
- Don't shove, Peter.
Atoms away!
My atoms!
You!
Sit!
Sit, now!
In your seats, now!
I have never in my life...
What have you got to say for yourselves?
Quack.
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!
Thanks for coming by on such short notice, Gordon.
By the way, your court release came through.
Congratulations.
Your community service is over.
You're kidding.
So you wanted to talk about my coming back to work then?
- Well, actually...
- Oh, you got your jersey.
Great!
A lot's been happening, sir.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.
Gordon, you know Coach Reilly and Mr. Banks.
Sir, they're the bad guys.
No, actually, Phil is one of my oldest friends.
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together here to try to work out this little problem.
You see, my son Adam wants to play for the Hawks.
His older brother was a Hawk.
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.
It's a tradition.
Now, you understand that, Gordon.
You played.
Sure, I can.
But the league's already ruled on it.
We've talked to the league, and we worked out a little deal.
You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League?
Yes, we did.
The long and short of it is that Adam stays on the Hawks for the rest of the season.
And then next year, they redraft the lines.
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.
What's that?
That you withdraw your protest.
- That's great.
- Good, good.
- Well, that's settled then.
- No, sir, you don't understand.
I can't withdraw my protest.
- What?
- Mr. Ducksworth, you wanted me to learn about fair play, and how to be part of a team,
and I may not have learned everything yet, but...
I remember something my father said to me.
A team isn't a bunch of kids out to win.
A team is something you belong to, something you feel,
something you have to earn.
And I'm not gonna let those kids down.
Gordon, I'm going to make this simple.
Are you prepared to lose your job over some kids?
Some game?
Let me ask you, sir.
Are you prepared to fire me over some kids?
Some game?
Collect your personal belongings, Gordon.
Yes, sir, Mr. Ducksworth!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth!
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.
You may have paid for this jersey, sir, but you didn't earn it.
I'll see you in the play-offs.
Excuse me.
There are some students here that I'd like to see.
- Who are you?
- I'm their hockey coach.
If you could tell me where I can find each of them, please.
They're in room 223.
- All of them?
- All of them.
"I will not quack at the principal."
"I will not quack at the principal."
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you guys.
- People.
- People, right.
Sit down, please.
All of you.
Okay, don't sit down.
Look, what's done is done.
I want to be your coach again.
You wanna coach a bunch of losers?
- No, I want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said?
You said we didn't deserve to live.
Karp, I was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means?
- No.
- Okay, then you do.
I didn't mean those things the way they sounded.
You guys know what it's like to be misunderstood, right?
- Yeah, of course.
We're kids.
- So...
Can you forgive me?
Can I be your coach again?
- What about Banks?
- He can be on the team if he wants.
He should have been with us all year.
It's you guys who were cheated.
But let's forget all that crap!
- We're a team, right?
- Yeah.
I made you guys, and I'm sticking with you.
So, what's it gonna be?
We can play tomorrow night and still have a shot at the play-offs... or we can forfeit again and the season's over.
Peter, what do you say?
Well...
I guess it would help if we practiced first.
All right.
Let me see if I can get you out of detention.
- Yes.
- Take that.
You really quacked at the principal?
Yeah.
Are we Ducks, or what?
Yeah!
Look at your mother.
- Let's see how it is in ten minutes.
- I'm gonna kill you!
Hey.
Wasn't sure if you'd show up.
Yeah, whatever.
- I just want to play hockey.
- Good.
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.
On behalf of the Ducks, I'd like to say welcome.
Cake-eater.
Ooh, the Jess-man, dissin' the new guy!
The Jess-ster!
Shut up, Averman!
It's just a joke.
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey doesn't mean you're a real Duck.
They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
I bet.
Well, suit up.
I'll see you on the ice.
On your left!
Over here!
I'm open!
Come on, right here!
Up front!
- Up front!
- Pass it to Banks!
Come on!
Do somethin' with it!
Yeah!
All right!
Way to go, Banks!
Goldberg, you're gonna sit this one out.
What?
You're pulling the goalie when we're tied?
Listen, listen, listen!
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.
Okay, Fulton, you're our extra man.
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.
We pulling the Statue of Liberty play?
- Yeah?
- No, take your shot.
You may only get one, so it's gotta be good.
- But, coach, one outta one?
- Soft hands, Fulton.
- Concentration, not strength.
- That's right!
Okay?
Let's get the Huskies!
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one.
Let's go!
- Get in there!
- Come on!
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!
Shoot, Fulton, shoot!
We won!
We made the play-offs!
Boy, this is great.
Guys, look, it's the North Stars.
- Oh, man.
- It's Mike Modano!
- Believe this?
- Cool!
- This is too cool.
- I can't believe this.
This place is humongous.
What are we doing here?
It's a little play-offs present.
Hey, Gordo!
Gordon Bombay, right?
- You remember me?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- I heard you were a farmer.
Actually, I became a lawyer.
But I'm coaching Pee Wee now and this is my team, the Ducks.
Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
We can see that.
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks!
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.
If you ever want a shot, I'll get you a tryout in the minor-league clubs.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, nice seein' ya.
Take it easy.
All right, let's have some fun!
You've got to accentuate the positive
Eliminate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister In-between
You've got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to that minimum
Have faith or pandemonium
You're liable to walk upon the sea
To illustrate my last remark
Talking about Jonah in a whale and Noah in an ark
What did they do when everything looked so dark
Then they say
You better accentuate the positive
Eliminate that negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister In-between
We better accentuate the positive
Eliminate all the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister In-between
No, don't mess with Mister In-between
- Hey!
- Hey!
Don't you mess with Mister In-between
You know, I heard the North Stars wore the same underwear... all through the play-offs last year for luck.
So I'm doin' the same thing.
Hmm.
Maybe I should've cooked.
You know, I'm thinkin' maybe we can all go down to the winter festival tonight.
- All three of us?
- Sure.
I don't think I should, 'cause I got a lot of homework.
You should go.
With my mom.
By yourselves.
Mmm, smells great!
Hello.
Go for it.
Hi.
I don't know how they sculpt these.
Hmm, I wonder.
I used to sculpt, but now I do mostly paintings.
How do you think they do the details?
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.
Oh.
I'm nervous.
I'm rambling on and on here.
You probably think I'm weird.
No, I think you're great.
When I was a little girl, I used to pretend that that was an ice castle.
And that was my room, that window right up there.
And last winter I gave Charlie that one.
What about me?
Which window's mine?
I want to live there too.
What?
What did I say?
- It's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy?
Casey, I was just playin' around.
Look, I don't know how you feel about me.
I don't even know how I feel about you.
But I do know there's a little kid back home... who's absolutely falling in love with his coach... and if you can't deal with that, if you're just playing around, then you better let me know.
What are we talking?
'Til death do us part?
- I have to decide on the first date?
- Stop it, Gordon.
Charlie's gonna be there when we get back.
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.
Look, I can take it.
But if Charlie gets too attached...
Every time this happens, it gets... a little rougher on him.
Just on him?
I'm glad to be here with you.
Me too.
The surprising Ducks are still in this game against the Hornets.
Banks moving right in front, stops.
He shoots, he scores!
It's getting rough out there between the Ducks and the Hornets.
Here's Adam Banks in the slot.
He stops, shoots.
He scores!
Back it goes to Averman.
He shoots!
Score!
The ducks win it, 5-3 over the Hornets.
And now it's on to the semifinals... where the Ducks will face the Cardinals.
What a game so far, ladies and gentlemen!
The Ducks and the Cardinals!
Cardinals with it in their own zone, tryin' to clear it out.
Pass to the blue line, intercepted by the Ducks.
Here's their star, Adam Banks.
Banks has great speed.
Right down the middle!
Goes around one man with a great move!
Steps around another defender!
He scores!
Come on!
Come on, Jesse!
Ducks with it again.
Here's Averman, now getting it over to Banks.
Germaine is right in the slot.
Germaine with it!
He shoots, he scores!
Germaine put it off the goaltender's glove into the net!
And that does it!
The Ducks have won!
Can you believe it?
4-2, and the Ducks now get set to face the Hawks in the state finals.
All right, it's up to you, Gordon.
Now, you miss this shot, you're not just letting your team down, you're letting me down too.
Remember, it's not worth playing...
- If you can't win.
- That's right.
Okay, son, let's go.
Let's go, son!
Oh, say does that star-spangled
Banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
All right!
Welcome to the Minnesota State Pee Wee Championship.
Have we got a game for you today.
The Hawks, coached by Jack Reilly.
Win, win, win, win, win!
Win, win, win, win, win!
Win, win, win, win, win!
Win, win, win, win!
Win, win, win, win!
Win, win, win, win, win!
Ducks, let's fire it up!
Come on, let's get fired up!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
- Go Ducks!
- Let's go!
Hey, Banks.
Don't forget what side you're on.
He's a Duck, Jesse.
He'll play like a Duck.
And the game is underway, and right off Larson and McGill with a heavy hit.
That gives you an indication of what you're going to see tonight.
Good hit!
That's the way I want you guys to play it!
The Ducks in green chasing it down against...
A hard hit out at center ice!
Keep it away from 'em!
Come on, Banks!
Heavy hitting continues in this championship game.

Here's McGill, inside, the lead at center ice.
He's up on the blue line and around the net.
And he scores!
And now the Hawks lead 2-0.
Good save, Goldberg!
All right, all right!
That's the kind of hockey
I want to see played all day, boys.
Larson stopped at the blue line, but the Ducks can't clear it out.
McGill to Brown, left side.
He shoots!
He scores!
The Hawks lead late in the first period, 3-0.
Don't be scared of them, Ducks.
That's what they want.
Keep your heads up.
Play proud.
Let's fly!
Come on, let's go!
All right, pressure, boys.
Pressure, pressure!
All right, hold it, hold it.
I want you to drop Banks like a bad habit.
I want him outta the game.
- Finish him off.
You got it?
- Yeah.
Okay, boys, let's go.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right!
Face-off for the second period, and the Hawks win the draw.

Adam, are you okay?
- What'd you do?
- My job.
Okay, we need the paramedics in.
He's injured.
Oh, my God.
Come on, son, let's go.
Come on.
Number seven, McGill.
Cross-checking.
Two minutes.
Don't worry, guys.
Did it go in?
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favor.
Kick some Hawk butt.
All right, cake-eater.
He'll be okay, Sir.
We need to take some X-rays, though.
Hell of a job, son.
They score against us, they're gonna pay the price.
Now, don't worry.
We're gonna get that one back.
You got somethin' to say to me, Bombay?
To think I wasted all those years worrying about what you thought.
You're goin' down, Reilly.
Let me go after 'em, coach.
Let me get 'em.
No, we're better than that.
Look, look, it's time to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.
- All right?
Now we got the power play.
- Yeah.
All right.
We're gonna hit 'em where it hurts the most:
Up there.
Yeah.
Fulton, you're in.
- Coach, they'll be rushing' him.
- Right.
Jesse, make sure you give Fulton plenty of time.
- Right, coach.
- Jesse, do good.
Let's go!
- Yeah!
- Hold it!
Wait!
Whoa!
Let's have fun out there.
- All right!
- All right!
Let's go!
Let's go!
The Ducks trail 3-1, and now they call on number 44, Fulton Reed...
Get the face-off!
Who has a big, booming shot.
And the Ducks get it back to Fulton Reed.
Hall clears the front of the net.
Here's Reed winding.
He scores!
Fulton Reed has scored, and the Ducks are back in the game!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
Yes!
That's it!
More fun!
More fun!
Of all the sloppy ass...
Ladies, they don't need our help out there!
Now I want that Fulton Reed covered.
He better not make another shot.
You got it?
I'm tellin' you, you blow this game and nobody makes the team next year!
All right, get out there!
Quick feet, now!
Quick feet!
The puck comes around, now to Blake on the right side.
Blake through the slot with a backhand.
Scores!
Blake with a backhanded goal, and the Hawks regain the two goal lead at 4-2.
Guys, guys, guys, listen up, listen.
We have got to stay fired up and focused, all right?
It ain't over 'til it's over.
Tammy, Tommy, let's show these Hawks something really different.
Come here.
All right.
I want you guys to start up here...
Third period and the Ducks trail 4-2, trying desperately to get back in the game.
The Ducks with Tammy and Tommy Duncan on the ice.
Tammy Duncan goes in front of the net, Tommy with the puck.
Tammy's spinning, and the Hawks are just looking at her.

- Come on!
Now!

Yes!
Yes!
We're still alive!
I'm on, coach.
Yes, we're still in there!
He Grabs McGill from behind... and throws him over the boards into the bench.
Now he wants to pick a fight with the entire Hawks team.
Fulton Reed has to be restrained by the referee.
Game misconduct.
You're outta here, son.
I'm off, coach.
He barely touched him.
Oreo line!
I want you to remember what we learned.
- Ducks stick together, right?
- Yeah!
So let's see it!
Show me the flying "V."
- All right!
- All right!
Let's get a line change!
Let's go!
Here we go!
Come on, y'all, let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
Flying "V"!
Jesse Hall goes behind his own net, joined by the rest of his team.
Here they come from behind the net!
It's the flying "V"!
Come on!
Come on!
Terry Hall, with the puck, moves the puck ahead to brother Jesse.
They stay onside the blue line.
Jesse Hall with it, trying to come down the slot.
Moves down the right side, now in front of the net.
Jesse scores!
With the score tied 4-4, the next goal will decide the championship.
Tremendous pressure.
Neither team can afford any mistakes now.
23 seconds left to go in regulation.
Looking for the game-winning goal, here's Morgan moving into the slot.
He shoots and a big save.
Big save, Goldberg!
We'll get 'em in overtime!
Score tied at four.
Now Averman ahead to Charlie Conway.
- Come on, Charlie.
- Conway to center ice on a breakaway!
Conway moving across the Hawk blue line, down the middle!
He could win the game!
Hey!
Where's the call?
No time left on the clock, but the referee is calling a penalty shot!
What kind of call is that?
Okay, we've got a penalty shot for the Ducks.
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.
All right, Ducks, who's gonna take it?
- I think he should take it.
- Me?
What about Charlie?
- What about Charlie?
- All he does is fan.
Let's let him finish what he started.
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.
Come here.
You been practicing that triple deke?
- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.
You may make it, you may not.
But that doesn't matter, Charlie.
What matters is that we're here.
Look around.
Whoever thought we'd make it this far?
One, two, three.
Triple deke.
Take your best shot.
I believe in you, Charlie, win or lose.
- Thanks, coach.
- Go get 'em.
- All right, Charlie.
- Let's go, Charlie.
Go, Charlie!
Okay, now wait for my signal.
Good luck.
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...
Okay, now don't leave your crease before he touches the puck.
Good luck.
Come on, Charlie.
Come on, Charlie.
Thank you, Hans.
I'm proud of you, Gordon.
Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks,
Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks,
Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks...
Look, don't take any bad dives, okay?
Just remember, keep your head up, man.
Cake-eater.
Remember, strength, not concentration.
Right.
And for God's sakes, soft hands.
Right.
Anything else?
Yeah.
Have fun out there, coach.
I must be crazy.
A tryout with the minors.
I'm gonna be goin' up against kids half my age.
Just have a good tryout, Gordon.
One step at a time.
Yeah, you're right.
Bye.
I'll call you when I get there.
Banks is first in line next!
Hey, Ducks!
No matter what happens, we'll see you next season.
We got a title to defend.
I'm closing up
I'm closing in
Couldn't wait for this moment to come
Couldn't wait for this day to begin
Won't be afraid
Got so much pride
And I've never been a loser
And I just can't lose tonight
Winning it all, ain't gonna walk away
Giving it all, no matter what you say
Ain't gonna fall, don't wanna lose today
Winning it all
This time it's right
My time has come
Gonna give everything that I've got
Till it's over and victory's won
No second chance
No giving up
Because no one remembers a loser
And I don't intend to be one
Winning it all, ain't gonna walk away
Giving it all, no matter what you say
Ain't gonna fall, don't wanna lose today
Oh, winning it all
Winning it all, ain't gonna walk away
Giving it all, no matter what you say
Ain't gonna fall, don't wanna lose today
Winning it all
Winning it all, ain't gonna walk away
Giving it all

Buddy you're a young man, hard man
Shoutin' in the street, gonna take on the world some day
You got blood on yo' face, you big disgrace
Wavin' your banner all over the place
We will we will rock you
We will we will rock you

[ Announcer ] ...
The Minnesota Pee Wee Championship is up for grabs.
Both teams playing like there's no tomorrow.
Duluth, in the Hawks' zone, looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.
There's a pass out to the blue line.
intercepted by Gordon Bombay !
Bombay !
He's got a breakaway.
Across the blue line all alone for a chance to win the game !
He's pulled down from behind by Fox of Duluth.
Fox definitely pulled him down from behind and this could be --
Yes, the referee calls for a penalty shot.
Gordon, it's up to you. I don't wanna see any goats around after the game.
You got it ?
Now, you miss this shot... you're not just lettin' me down, you're lettin' your team down.
[ Announcer ] A pressure situation he's in now.
The 1973 Pee Wee State Championship now rests... on the little shoulders of number 9, Gordon Bombay.
[ Cheering ]
[ Crowd chanting ] Gordon !
Gordon !
[ Chanting ] Gordon !
Gordon !
Let's go, son !
All right !
[ Crowd cheering ]
[ Whistle blowing ]
[ Announcer ] He hit the goalpost !
What a heartbreaker !
Little Gordon Bombay had the chance --
All my client did was attempt to give you what you wanted !
Isn't that right ?
This man put his neck on the line for your greed.
Objection.
Your Honour ?
Will both counsellors approach the bench ?
[ Man ] What's he doing ?
I don't have anything to tell you.
I just wanna make a point.
So nod like I'm saying something important.
- Mr Bombay ?
- Gordon, what are you doing ?
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.
This drives him nuts and I love it.
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya ?
Oh, Mr Bombay, I'm so glad you could make it.
Please restrict yourself to a relevant cross-examination !
Your Honour, the applicability of societal intent... vis-a-vis individual action is well established.
I'm citing Minneapolis V. Higgins.
The appellant court overruled a judge who disallowed similar testimony.
Now, if I'm not mistaken, that was... you.
Wasn't it, Judge Weathers ?
I stand corrected, counsellor.
Objection overruled.
[ Frank ] Oh, you really stooped to an all-time low on this, Bombay.
I'm insulted, Frank.
You have no idea how low I can stoop.
I don't mind losing.
I would just like to lose fair.
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.
And what about justice ?
That man should be in jail.
It was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me !
Next time do your job, Frankie boy.
- 30 and 0 !
I remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case ?
We don't count that one because I scored with the court reporter.
- The one you said had the intelligent body ?
- That's the one.
- No calls on the Duck phone ?
- Not yet.
What's he waiting for ?
I saw him in the back of the courtroom.
How about some kudos here, huh ?
Mr Tolbert dropped off a couple ringside seats for tonight's North Stars game.
Hockey ?
[ Raspberry ] Forget it !
Gordon, here's the research for the Pearlstein Project.
- Can you get started ?
- Jane !
Can't you see I'm reveling here ?
Today I'm 30 and 0 !
- 30 and one.
- Type, Jeannie, don't speak.
- [ Ringing ]
- Mr Bombay's office.
Yes. lt's Ducksworth.
You're right.
He wants to see you.
Ha-ha-ha !
Thank you very much, Mr Ducksworth !
It was nothing, Mr Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr Ducksworth.
[ Door closing ]
Gordon, another fine job today.
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.
Score.
Don't spike.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean, sir.
This is a business.
It isn't a game.
Next time a little restraint might be in order.
[ Tyres squealing ]
* Hey, man, get off my back I'm doin' the best I can, yeah *
* You bust my neck Cut no slack *
- * Forget your fellow man Yeah yeah uh-huh * - [ Siren ]
- Pull your vehicle over to the right, now !
- This is not good.
** [ Muffled rock ]
- * Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah *
- Licence, please.
- Could you turn down the stereo ?
- Sure.
I guess it was a "widdle" noisy.
A "widdle" ?
Okay, I'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine ?
No, thanks, I'm full.
[ Laughs ]
Okay, out of the car.
Now.
The charges against Mr Bombay are driving under the influence, driving with an open container and reckless endangerment.
And to think I almost stayed home this morning.
I assume you're representing yourself ?
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a licence?
Okay, let's talk business.
What am I facing ?
Suspension of licence ?
Fines ?
What ?
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow you to plead guilty to lesser charges.
But that's solely up to the prosecutor.
The city of Minneapolis does not wish to pursue a plea bargain in this case.
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo ?
The defendant is released on his own recognizance.
Mr Ducksworth.
What are you doing here ?
I own the place.
How about you ?
Just goin' over a few cases.
ricoh Statute stuff.
Oh, I thought you might be researching your defence... against D.U.l. and reckless endangerment.
Did you think I wouldn't find out, Gordon ?
There was no reason to concern you with it, sir.
They have no case.
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp.
I found a loophole.
I'm gonna plead not guilty --
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.
There's not going to be a trial.
I am not going to have you drag... this firm's good name through the mud.
I've talked to Judge Weathers and he has agreed to suspend your case.
- Under what conditions ?
- Probation, suspension of your driver's licence... and 500 hours of community service.
And a leave of absence from the firm.
A leave of absence ?
He can't do that.
- He can't stop me from working !
- He's not. I am.
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.
It'll teach you compassion, a sense of fair play, how to fit in.
- Community service ?
This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.
And hopefully you'll come back a better person and a better attorney, which is why I'm keeping you on salary and have arranged a driver for you.
You know, in the early '70s I drove the tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties, amps cranked up to about eight jillion decibels.
All that loud music damaged my hearing, but I got no regrets...
- except for the '80s.
- How could he do this to me ?
Community service...
coaching hockey !
I found one !
I'm comin' out !
[ Boy ] Karp, you finally found something for once in your life.
Dumpster Dave comes through !
- What do you think ?
- Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.
- You gonna take that from him, Karp ?
- Remind me to bust you, Averman.
- Thanks, Peter.
Thanks very much.
- Did you get it ?
- Yeah !
Right there !
- Yeah !
Here, Petie.
Here, boy.
A little chili to keep you warm, buddy.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look !
[ Peter ] I can't believe he ate the can too.
[ Averman ] He sniffs.
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.
[ Averman ] He sniffs some more.
He stops.
I think this is it !
He's turnin' in a circle.
- He squats !
He scores !
- Yes !
We did it !
[ Groaning ] Full load.
Stinks !
[ Averman ] Come on, come on, give me the dollar !
- [ Peter ] Hurry it up already.
- l'm hurrying', okay ?
- Go, go, go, go !
- Yeah !
All right !
Let's do it !
Oh, come on.
Stop !
- Yes !
- Okay !
Here we go.
Yeah.
There's more inside.
[ Karp ] He's takin' off with it.
This guy deserves what he gets.
- [ Tyres squealing ] - [ Screaming ]
[ Laughing ]
Oh, guys, he saw us.
Oh, my !
[ Groaning ]
[ Cheering ]
Rink's gotta be around here someplace.
Just look for a sign that says "Personal Hell."
How could he do this to me ?
I hate kids.
They're barely human.
[ indistinct chatter ]
Come on !
Over here !
Keep it down, please !
Hey, come on.
There's no need for this.
Let's talk, come on.
I'm your friend, aren't I ?
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to stop it. I'm tired of chasing' the puck.
Be careful, man.
It almost hit me that time.
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
It's supposed to hit you.
Does that sound stupid to anyone else ?
Good God.
That's the hockey team.
Drive out on the ice.
It'll be all right.
[ indistinct chatter ] I ain't scared.
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.
[ Peter ] We're gonna get in big trouble.
- l'll take care of it.
- They're drugs, I just know it.
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.
This is my dominion.
This is a drug-free zone, you understand ?
We ain't buying' nothin'.
I'm feelin' generous today.
So I'm gonna let you get your sorry vanilla bootie outta here... before we be usin' your eyeballs as hockey pucks.
Thanks, bro, but I'm not goin' home 'til I take care of business.
He's got a gun.
Stand back.
Whew !
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.
I'm Gordon Bombay.
I'm the new coach.
[ Laughing ] What a joke !
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.
Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.
Here's the long and the short of it.
I hate hockey and I don't like kids.
What's this supposed to be, a pep talk ?
I'm sure this'll be a real bonding experience.
Maybe one day one of you will even write a book about it in jail.
- Funny.
- ls there a goalie ?
Only for a little while.
I'm movin' back to Philly.
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.
Uh, just so you know.
We really suck.
I'll decide who sucks around here.
- Get off me.
- They really suck.
The Pete-meister.
Mr Rabble-rouser.
Passing the puck over to Jesse-roonie, the enforcer.
- [ Grunt ]
- Ouch !
That hurt !
Oh, it's the Connie-meister, the velvet hammer.
Hi, coach. I'm Connie.
- Do you play ?
- No.
So what's our record anyway ?
0 and 9.
One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.
We almost scored a goal too.
So what do we do now... coach ?
- What did your old coach have you do ?
- He just yelled a lot.
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm ?
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us, "Little bastards, where'd you learn to play ?
Oh, you suck, you !
Skate, you little bast--" [ Gasping ]
Heart attack.
Great.
All right, look.
I gotta make a phone call.
Keep scrimmaging.
You, you, you, you and you against you four.
- We got names, you know ?
- l'm sure you do.
And I'll bet they're very nice names.
I might even learn 'em.
For now, I'll be in my office.
Oh, and if you need anything, fax me.
Geez, what a jerk.
Where do they find these coaches anyways ?
We're impressionable kids, right ?
Shouldn't we check his qualifications or somethin' ?
Jeannie, who told you not to give me my messages ?
Ducksworth !
Then who's handling my cases ?
- On three !
- Jane !
- One, two, three !
Charge !
- Are you kidding me ?
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to --
Hold on a second !
- [ Kids shouting ]
- Hey!
Get your mouth off the windows!
- Hey !
- Get off there !
- [ Shouting ]
- Get off the car !
- We're being invaded !
- Get off !
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool !
- ls that a real phone ?
- Yes, and I'm really on it.
- Not any more.
- Thank you.
- Let's see, who should I --
- Watch the upholstery.
[ indistinct chatter ]
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride !
[ Chanting ] We wanna ride !
We wanna ride !
- We wanna ride !
- l could kill one of 'em just to set an example.
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything !
[ Cheering ]
This looks good.
I'm gonna eat it.
- Wow, I feel like Madonna.
- You wish !
Seats ten comfortably.
- Hey, pass me one of those glasses.
- [ Growling ]
- Yeah, I see your point.
- [ Sniffing ]
Oh.
- [ Sniffing ] - [ Together ] Goldberg !
- lt wasn't me, all right !
- Young man, what did you eat ?
- Nothing !
It wasn't me !
- Open a window !
Oh, man !
It's my mom !
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.
All right, out !
Everybody, out of the car right now.
Goldberg, why'd you have to ruin the fun ?
Are you out of your mind ?
What were you thinking putting that car on the ice ?
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take.
One crack !
- The ice is not gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are ?
- l'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
- The new coach ?
They send you over here to coach the team and you endanger their lives.
What danger ?
I grew up on the ice;
I know when it's safe to drive on.
- How do you know ?
- l just know !
All right ?
Well, listen, Mr Zen Master, you may be in tune with the ice universe, but when it comes to my kid, "l just know" doesn't cut it.
Charlie, let's go.
- Mom ?
- Give me my candy !
All of it !
Well, I guess practise is over.
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- lt's all right, Charlie.
Coach, gonna be at the game tomorrow ?
By order of the state of Minnesota, yeah.
[ Chanting ] Hawks !
Hawks !
Hawks !
Hawks !

One, two, three, four, five !

No !
Goodbye.
The hawks.
My first game and it had to be the Hawks.
Gordon ?
Gordon Bombay.
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.
Why don't you just call me Jack ?
Hey, come back to see your old coach, huh ?
Well, actually I'm, uh, coaching...
Pee Wee.
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'.
You got a kid on the team or something ?
No, I'm here because I need to be of service to the community.
How about this, huh ?
Whoever thought we'd be coaching' against each other ?
Yeah, who'd have thought ?
So, who's your hotshot player this year ?
- Anyone good ?
- l got a kid named Banks.
Might go all the way.
Not quite as good as you were.
But he wants it more.
Kid won't give up.
Oh, boy, I wish they would take that one down.
Don't you ?
Well, good luck.
You're gonna need it.
It's up to you, Gordon.
You miss this shot, you're not just... letting me down, you're letting your whole team down too.
I wish your dad could be here to see this.
Make him proud of you !
[ Chanting ] Win !
Win !
Win !
All right, guys, gather round.
Come on, come on.
- Win !
Win !

Oh, great.
Good concept, guys.
Nice -- ouch !
Nice goin', fool !
- Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
- Oh, yeah, "l didn't mean to."
Yeah, sure, you're on my own team.
Oh, sorry, Goldberg.
Didn't mean to.
Would you get off me before I clock you ?
Let's go, Jesse !
Go, Terry !
[ Whistle blowing ] Let's go !
Come on in.
What's this ?
The Oreo line !
Hey, come on.
Let's play hockey.
Um, batter, batter, hum, batter, batter !
Hey, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter !
- Hum, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter !
- Averman !
It's hockey !
There's no batter. idiot.
Hum, goalie, goalie, hum, goalie, goalie !
Hey, goalie, goalie, save, goalie, goalie !
Hum, goalie, goalie, hey, goalie, goalie !
No, I got him !
I, I, I got him !
[ Cheering ]
That's one !
Hey, hey, hey !
Easy !
Good show.
Sloppy pass.
Way to stuff it, Banks !
All right, all right !
Let's run it up !
Run it up !
Run it up !
[ Whistle blowing ]
Oh, man !
How could you let him get by you ?
All right, line change.
Come on, go, go, go.
- Hey !
- [ Grunting ]
- [ Crowd cheering ] - [ Groaning ]
[ Chanting ] Banks !
Banks !
Banks !
Hey, you !
Come back here !
Oh !
- [ Whistle blowing ]
- Why me ?
How lazy can you be ?
They're killing us out there !
How many times do I have to tell you:
Get those rebounds, get your heads up, get those loose pucks.
- Get -
- Just -- - [ Whistle blowing ]
Just get the hell outta here.
All right !
It's Spaz-way.
He'll screw up.
[ Crowd cheering ]
[ Crowd gasping ]
Hey, hey !
Way to play it, Banks !
All right !
That's okay, Charlie !
Nice try !
Nice fan, Charlie.
Keep swingin'.
Maybe you'll give 'em a cold.
Hey, hey, hey, knock it off !
Against this team we should have twice this many !
Now let's run it up !
Remember it's not worth winning if you can't win big !
[ Reilly ] All right !
Guys !
No !
Come on, let's talk about this !
Be civilized !
Come on !
Please !
[ Crowd cheering ]
Oh no, guys !
Come on, not again !
Please !
Just take the goal.
Fine !
I don't care !
- l'm so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.
[ Buzzer ]
All right !
Hey, knock it off !
That was a lousy third period.
Anybody could beat these pansies.
I want you guys to stay hungry out there !
All right, nice goin', Banks.
New Hawks record.
- Okay, boys.
Let's go.
- All right !
Hey, Gordon !
Nice game.
I enjoyed it thoroughly.
At least I can handle the puck !
[ indistinct arguing ]
Hey, shut up !
You guys stink !
I thought we came here to play hockey.
- You know, I knew we forgot something.
- [ Laughing ]
Oh, you think it's funny ?
You think losing is funny ?
Well, not at first, but once you get the hang of it.
We're the ones out there gettin' our butts kicked.
Yeah, it's not like you coach us or anything.
At least we try.
You didn't listen to a word I said.
I said, keep your heads up.
You put your heads down.
I said, hustle.
You went slower !
That was the sloppiest playing I've ever seen.
Why the hell don't you just listen to me ?
Why the hell should we ?
I don't care.
You want to lose, fine.
You're the ones who look like idiots out there.
[ Reilly ] Great game !
Hans ?
[ Cheering ] I don't believe it !
Who would throw these away ?
- First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
- Fork it over.
Forget it, Karp.
I can see this every day on MTV.
This one's from Minneapolis.
Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom.
- Let's give him a wedgie.
- Good idea, Jesse !
I was just kidding, okay ?
Hey !
Give that back !
- Hi, girls.
- Does your mommy know you have that ?
Nah, she's busy with the mailman.
That'll make great bathroom reading.
That's mine, you jerk !
I found it !
You don't even know what to do with it, wuss-breath.
- You gonna let him call you wuss-breath ?
- No !
Hey !
Hey !
[ Grunting ]
- Oh !
- Come on.
Want some more ?
You guys want some more ?
Come on !
Yeah !
You want some more ?
Come on !
[ Gasping ] [ indistinct jeering ]
[ Jeering continues ]
[ Growling ]
Let's get out !
Move it !
- Thanks a lot.
- All right, man.
One, two, three !
Boom !
What are you laughing at, cream cheese boy ?
Go !
[ Bombay ] lf we're gonna cheat, we gotta make those falls look real.
Keep it up !
Whoa !
Score one for the spirit.
Go at him !
Go at him !
Good !
Go at him !
Come on, get angry !
Oh !
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt !
I am hurt.
Good, good.
Now say it again !
[ Together ] Take the fall !
Act hurt !
Get indignant !
- One more time !
- Take the fall !
Act hurt !
Get indignant !
Good !
You guys are ready.
- [ Grunting ] - [ Cheering ]
[ Buzzer ]
Give me a break, ref !
Open your eyes !
Did you see what he did to me ?
Goldberg, you don't take the fall while they're shooting at you.
Oh !
Well, I guess you didn't explain that very well, did ya ?
- District Five !
- l throw myself on the ice --
Cut the acting class.
One more dive, I forfeit to the Jets !
What ?
I'm insulted by that !
- Let's go !
Let's go !
- Quit it !
[ Whistle blowing ] Face-off !
Let's go !
Charlie !
That guy is twice your size.
The next time he gets you in a corner like that, I want you to grab your eye like it's cut and then hit the ice !
- Got it ?
Let's go.
- [ Referee ] Let's go !
Face-off !
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
Here we go.
Hey --
- Come on !
- That's it, Charlie.
- That's it, Charlie !
- Come on !
Damn it, Charlie !
We can't even win when we cheat.
- Stupid cake-eater tricks !
- [ Connie ] That was embarrassing.
Charlie !
What the hell is the matter with you ?
When I tell you to do something, you do it !
You got it ?
Look at me.
- You got it ?
- You can't make me cheat.
Jesse, Terry, let's go.
This is what I gave up my overtime pay for ?
To see my kids takin' falls ?
Gordon.
- How did you know ?
- Through the back door at this time of night.
Just like you used to.
You'd spend hours watching me do this.
What do you think ?
is this sharp enough ?
Ow !
- Did you cut yourself ?
- No. [ Chuckling ]
You always fell for that.
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, I'm Scandinavian.
- lt's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.
You probably thought I was dead.
I saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything ?
You were so busy screaming at the kids.
I didn't want to spoil the moment.
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.
Why should my store ?
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that ?
Well, I hardly ever lose a case.
That is not what I asked.
Hmm !
I see you still have this up.
- Thanks very much.
- lt is important to remember the past.
I'd just as soon forget it.
That was the worse time in my life.
My dad died that year.
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.
I found this not long ago.
He was proud of you.
I miss him.
You scored 198 goals in that season, Gordon.
It's a shame you quit.
You --
- Could have gone all the way.
Yeah.
- No !
You really loved to play.
You remember ?
You remember... you used to play on the ponds until after dark, until your father called you back.
You really flew on that ice, Gordon.
That's all I ever wanted to do.
Then why did you stop ?
Reilly ?
I saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.
- The guy wins.
- lt's not about winning. lt never was.
Just show they how to play.
Show them how to have fun.
Teach them to fly.
That is what they'll remember long after you've gone back to being a doctor.
Lawyer.
And long after they've stopped buying skates from me.
Here... there you are.
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.
- What's this ?
- Your new skates.
That is why you came here tonight, isn't it ?
- l figured nine and a half was your size.
- Actually, I'm a nine.
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.
Here comes Bombay on an end-to-end rush.
Past the blue line, past centre.
He's not skating, he's flying !
He fakes once, he fakes twice.
Fakes three times !
Shoots !
Scores !
Yes !
Yes !
Yes !
Yes !
What a play !
What a guy !
Gordon Bombay does it again !
Great move, Gordy !
You faked him out of his pads.
Come here, son.
You look great out there.
Come on, let's go inside, get something to eat.
A few more minutes ?
Please ?
- Go on.
Get outta here.
- Thanks.
[ Sighing ]
[ Knocking ]
- Hi, uh --
- Please, just go away.
Charlie doesn't want... to be on the team any more, and neither he nor I have anything to say to you.
- Well, I have something to say to you.
- Oh, really ?
Door-to-door mistreatment now.
Now the team can feel miserable between games too, huh ?
I came to apologize to Charlie...
to both of you.
- What ?
- Apologize.
Well... you should.
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin' ?
I was just, uh, walkin' around thinkin' and, uh --
Wanna give us a minute ?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Listen, it was very wrong of me... to ask you and the other guys to cheat.
I never should have said to you what I said to you.
I was angry. I was frustrated.
It took a lot of guts for you to do what you knew was right. I admire that.
And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that, uh, that I'm --
Oh, boy, this is difficult.
- l'm --
- You're sorry.
I'm sorry. [ Louder ] I'm sorry.
All right ?
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be a lot more fun this time around.
What do you say ?
Do you want to stay for dinner ?
- What ?
- Charlie !
Uh, no, I -- l can't.
Uh --
Well, what are you havin' ?
Mr Ducksworth, there are two reasons I came by.
First off, I want to let you know things are going well.
I'm learning a lot about teamwork, fair play and all that junk.
Good, good.
And the second thing ?
Well, sir, fair play doesn't come cheap.
These kids, my team, have no money.
They can't afford rink time, safe equipment, proper uniforms, which makes it difficult for them to compete.
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old and stepping out onto that ice... with old copies of the "Enquirer" taped to your shins instead of pads.
The point I'm trying to make, sir, is that you wouldn't be taken seriously and neither are these kids.
So I thought maybe the firm could help 'em out.
How much are we talking about ?
- $15,000.
- No way.
Wait a minute.
Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross, the firm that gives back to the community.
Come on.
I'll get you your own jersey.
* Ooo, yeah *
* Can you feel it baby Ooo * * l can too, Ooo *
* Ooo *
* Ooo, come on swing *
* Come on swing *
* Come on swing *
* C-Come on swing Ooo *
* Ooo * * lt's such a good vibration * * lt's such a sweet sensation * * lt's such a good vibration * * lt's such a sweet sensation *
Who is that kid ?
Thanks, Fulton.
-Fulton Reed.
He's in one of my classes.
-How come he's not on the team ?
He only plays football.
Some preppie school gave him a scholarship... as long as he doesn't play hockey.
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- l heard it was colleges.
He's been accepted to four of 'em.
- Yeah, but I heard he's got to repeat the sixth grade.
- Ah, shut up.
Gordon Bombay ?
Bombay was a Hawk.
* ...
Good vibration * * lt's such a sweet sensation *
* Feel the vibration lt's such a good vibration **
Dude, check 'em out, man.
Holy cow.
- They're pretty good skaters.
- Anybody know who they are ?
That's Tommy Duncan.
He's in my science class.
That's his sister, Tammy.
- Think they'd want to play hockey with us ?
- [ Together ] Yeah !
Go get dressed.
I'll do the negotiating.
Just think of it as figure skating... with a stick.
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy !
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive !
Mom isn't gonna like this at all.
So what ?
You want me to figure skate, then you gotta play hockey.
What do I know about hockey ?
More than you think.
Back to basics !
Skating !
Go !
Go !
Side to side.
Shift your weight.
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.
That's okay, Charlie.
Soft hands.
You don't shoot the puck to your teammate.
You sail it to him.
Karp, on your feet.
- You send it.
- Oh !
Gross !
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it.
Cradle it.
- Oh !
- Again !
Concentration, not strength.
Like the Karate Kid, right ?
"Wax on !
Wax off !"
Just shut up and try it, Averman !
- You're such a jerk.
- Send it back, Averman.
Good, Averman.
Charlie.
That's good.
Good.
Now sail it back.
Oh !
Way to go !
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.
- [ Splattering ]
- Oh !
Here it comes.
Nice and easy.
Good.
- l did it !
I did it !
- All right.
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.
- But when are you gonna work with me in goal ?
- Goldberg, do you trust me ?
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar mitzvah'd.
This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.
Coach, I think you got the ceremonies mixed up. lt's more like a circumcision.
Coach !
Will you come back here ?
What'd I ever do to you, man ?
District Five !
Ready !
Oh, man, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
- Aim !
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.
- Oh, please !
No !
- Fire !
[ Screaming ] I wanna go home !
[ Screaming ]
[ Laughing ]
This doesn't hurt !
You wimps !
Give me your best shot !
Oh !
Come on !
That's good !
Hex goal !
Goalie boot save !
Whoa !
Nice shot, man !
I'm a dog !
I'm a crazed dog !
Come on !
[ Chanting ] Goldberg !
Goldberg !
I am Goldberg !
The goalie !
[ Growling ]
Good !
Good !
All right, Charlie !
Good hustle !
Conway, way to go.
All right, Karp !
- You guys hungry ?
Tired ?
- [ Together ] Yeah !
- Do you ache ?
Are you pumped up ?
- Yeah !
Good !
That was a hell of a practise.
Be proud of yourself.
[ indistinct chatter ]
Hey, guys !
Excuse me, guys !
You gotta untie me now !
Ha-ha !
Good joke.
Very funny. I like it.
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach !
Coach, come on, don't leave me hangin' like this !
Coach, don't make me come after you, coach.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Thanks for the ride.
You did real well in practise today, Charlie.
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad ?
Mom and I left him. I don't really remember, but that's what she says.
You know, when I was a boy, I had to take care of my mother too.
Really ?
What happened to your dad ?
He passed away.
You do a good job takin' care of your mom.
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right ?
- Okay.
We'll see ya.
- Okay.
Hey, coach.
- What's that ?
- Huh ?
- Oh !
- Victory !
[ Laughing ]
[ Bombay laughing ] You've just entered the tickling zone !
[ Laughing ]
So I'm right in the middle of my cross-examination and I say to the guy, I usually defend heels like you, you scuzzy, mole-faced rat.
[ Chuckling ] That's a good one, sir.
Whoa !
[ Screeching ]
Hey !
Hey !
Hold it !
Hold it !
Whoa !
Whoa !
Whoa !
Look, it was an accident, all right ?
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that ?
I didn't learn.
I just do it.
Do it again.
Yargh !
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal ?
Yeah.
Well, one out of five.
Fulton, is it true what they say ?
About the scholarships and how they won't let you play hockey ?
People talk.
It don't mean nothin'.
- Why don't you play for us ?
- l can't.
- What do you mean ?
- l mean, I can't.
- You afraid ?
- No, I mean I can't, you moron.
I don't know how to skate.
Whoa !
is that all that's stoppin' ya ?
[ indistinct shouting ]
* l ride the top of the line I can't settle for less *
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.
Side to side, good !
Follow me.
[ Screaming ]
Aaah !
Watch it !
Get out of the way !
[ Screaming ]
Sorry !
* This is all we got baby lt's got to be enough * * l'd like to try to quit But I don't know how * * l needed it then and baby I need it right now *
Come on, Fulton.
Let's go !
- * l gotta keep movin' 'til I'm satisfied *
- Hey !
* Come on, Come on lt's gonna be all right **
The Ducks ?
We're the Ducks ?
Man, what brain-dead jerk came up with that name ?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But I didn't have a choice.
We're being sponsored.
By who ?
Donald and Daisy ?
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks ?
You'd rather be District Five ?
Some stupid number ?
Better than some stupid animal.
I'll have you know, Peter, that the Duck is one of the most noble, agile and intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom.
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.
Neither do hockey players.
Have you guys ever seen a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation ?
It's beautiful.
Pretty awesome the way they all stick together.
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight ?
No way.
Why ?
Because the other animals are afraid.
They know that if they mess with one duck, they gotta deal with the whole flock.
Oh, man !
I'm proud to be a duck.
And I'd be proud to fly with any one of you.
So how about it ?
Who's a Duck ?
I'll be a Duck.
Yeah.
Me too.
[ indistinct chatter ]
Anybody see Goldberg ?
All right !
- Now we're the Ducks !
- [ Cheering ]
- The Mighty Ducks !
- [ Cheering ]
- What are we ?
- [ Together ] The Ducks !
What the hell are they doing ?
Every time you get the puck, you're the quarterback.
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.
Come on, guys.
This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.
What a weird-ass team.
How you doin' ?
- You ready ?
- l think so.
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.
My God !
Wow !
- [ Crowd gasping ]
- One out of five.
All right, Let's forget the past.
We lost a few games, tough !
That was District Five.
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right !
Yeah !
Quack, quack.
- Quack.
Quack.
- [ Together ] Quack !
Quack !
Quack !
Quack !
Quack !
Quack !
[ Chanting ] Quack !
Quack !
Go...
Ducks !
- [ Cheering ]
- What the hell was that ?
[ Bombay ] Let's go, Ducks !
Defence !
Defence !
Dig it outta there !
Let's go !
Let's go !
Yeah !
Let's go, Ducks !
Throw it !
Throw it !
To the crease !
[ Cheering ]
Yes !
The Oreo line !
That's my boy !
[ Laughing ]
Defence, Karp !
Defence !
Come on.
[ Crowd gasping ]
I don't wanna go to school today, Mom.
- How many fingers am I holding' up ?
- He wouldn't know.
Shut up, Peter.
Karp, are you okay ?
- Look at this.
- The Karp-ster used his head to stop the puck.
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.
Get him on the bench, Charlie.
Okay, Ducks, we still got a chance here.
Connie, Terry, Jesse, Guy, time for the secret weapon.
Okay, Fulton.
Remember, just like we talked about.
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.
[ Cheering ]
Oh, no.
- Go !
Get the face-off !
- Line up, boys, let's go.
That's it.
Aaah !
Whoa !
[ Cheering ]
Whoo !
Yeah !
That tie of yours might be what you need to make the play-offs.
- The ducks have a shot at the play-offs ?
- Sure.
Everyone but the last two teams are in, remember ?
Panthers got the measles and they forfeited the season.
So, you beat the Huskies and you'll make the play-offs.
- Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
- So ?
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since I played.
Actually, one little thing has changed.
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.
They redrew the district lines last year.
The lake is not the boundary any more.
You see ?
You'd be a Duck.
I'd be a Duck.
Excuse me.
Coach Reilly ?
- Yeah ?
- l'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.
- What's that ?
- One of your players is ineligible.
Banks !
Over here !
- This is a joke, right ?
- l'm afraid it's no joke.
- Problem ?
- No, just a mistake.
Are you this boy's father ?
450 North Hennipen, is that your address ?
- Yes.
- l'm afraid there's no mistake.
-This boy is playing for the wrong team.
-What ?
According to league rules, Adam Banks should be playing for District Five.
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- ls this your doing, Gordon ?
I'll expect to see him at our next game.
- We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
- No way.
My son would rather not play than play for your team.
Fine, if that's the way you want it.
But remember, if Adam plays for the Hawks, you'll forfeit every game for the rest of the season.
Boy, I'd hate to see that.
Look, I'm sorry this had to happen, but you can see on the map.
Gordon ?
Hey, Bombay !
You stop when I'm talking to you, son !
What's the idea here ?
You trying to sabotage me or what ?
The law's a bitch when it works against you, isn't it, Jack ?
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.
Even with Banks, what do you think you're gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers ?
That's right, coach.
They are losers.
We hate losers, don't we ?
They don't even deserve to live.
Maybe Banks won't make a difference, but at least we're playing by the rules.
Why'd you turn against me, Gordon ?
For six years... I taught ya how to skate, I taught ya how to score.
I taught ya how to go for the "W."
You could have been one of the greats.
And now look at yourself.
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.
Going to the play-offs !
Whoo !
One win !
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform ?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.
All right, everyone, listen up.
I got some good news.
We're getting a new player, Adam Banks.
- What ?
- [ indistinct chatter ]
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.
- We don't need him.
- l'm the coach. I say we do need him.
- lf we make it to the play-offs, he could be a big help.
- [ Karp ] lf ?
All of a sudden you don't think we're good enough.
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.
- What ?
- We heard what you said.
You said we were losers, we didn't deserve to live.
- That's not what I meant.
- l saw that picture of you missing that goal.
You were a Hawk, weren't you ?
Guess you guys stick together to the end.
You know what ?
I don't need your stinkin' equipment.
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.
- l'm talkin' to you, son !
- Forget it, cake-eater.
If you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.
Where do you guys think you're goin' ?
I don't believe this.
[ Sighing ]
All right, I'm goin' up to the bench because that's where l'm supposed to be.
Anyone who wants to join me can join me.
Anyone who doesn't --
Well --
Ten minutes to game time, coach.
Yeah, yeah, they'll be out in a minute.
They're, you know, working themselves into a frenzy.
Not much of a frenzy.
We forfeit.
Ducks forfeit.
Flames, you win.
Hey.
Can I sit ?
Sure.
You talk to the guys ?
I tried.
They think I'm a traitor for even showing up.
I guess they really hate me, huh ?
is it true you were really a Hawk ?
Yeah.
Peter said you blew a really big game once.
Yeah, well, Peter's right.
It was the last game of the state finals.
We were tied 2-2 in the end of the third period.
I get a penalty shot.
I go in, I triple deke.
I fake the goalie right out of his pads.
The puck's headed in, and then...
- Clang !
Hits the post.
- [ Groans ]
We lost in overtime.
A quarter of an inch this way and it would have gone in.
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way and you'd have missed completely.
I never thought of it that way.
At least you got to play in a championship game.
- That must've been so cool.
- Hey.
Can I get you a cup of coffee ?
I'd love one.
You know, she has many fine qualities that men find attractive.
I know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.
So, what kind of guys does she usually date ?
Jerks. I mean, most of them like her, but as soon as they catch a glimpse of me --
Pow !
Warp speed !
They are gone !
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, I wouldn't even care... except it's not fair to my mom.
She deserves somebody nice.
Are you gonna come over for dinner again ?
I don't know, Charlie.
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
See, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I, um, talked to Jesse and Terry's dad, and he's gonna take over coaching for the rest of the year.
- You're quitting ?
- l'm stepping aside to keep the team together.
The guys can't play for somebody they don't trust.
I trust you.
The other guys do too.
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.
- l've done all I can.
- No, you haven't.
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.
We are too !
We weren't even the Ducks until you came along.
You made us and now you're stuck with us.
Charlie.
That's right.
The red is oxygen.
Now what are the blue balls ?
[ Students giggling ]
- Tommy ?
- Hydrogen ?
is correct.
Now put them together... and you have a molecule that makes up 96%%% of your body.
- What is it ?
- Pizza ?
[ Students giggling ]
-[ Knocking ] -lt's the principal. I'll be right back.
Work on H2 CO3.
It's a goody.
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way ?
- Yeah, did you score ?
Leave me alone, guys.
I don't want to talk about the team.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.
Everybody knows he likes you best.
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp !
Take it back now !
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.
- [ Connie ] Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl !
- Lay off !
- Don't shove, Peter.
[ All arguing ]
Atoms away !
My atoms !
You !
Sit !
Sit now !
In your seats now !
I have never in my life --
What have you got to say for yourselves ?
Quack.
[ Chanting ] Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack !
Thanks for coming by on such short notice, Gordon.
By the way, your court release came through.
- Congratulations.
Your community service is over.
- You're kidding.
So you wanted to talk about my coming back to work then ?
- Well, actually --
- Oh, you got your jersey.
Great !
A lot's been happening.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.
Gordon, you know Coach Reilly and Mr Banks.
[ Mumbling ] Sir, they're the bad guys.
No, actually, Phil is one of my oldest friends.
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together here to try to work out this little problem.
You see, my son Adam wants to play for the Hawks.
His older brother was a Hawk.
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.
It's a tradition.
You understand that, Gordon.
You played.
But the league's already ruled on it.
We've talked to the league, and we worked out a little deal.
- You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League ?
- Yes, we did.
The long and short of it is that Adam stays on the Hawks for the rest of the season.
And then next year, they redraft the lines.
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.
What's that ?
That you withdraw your protest.
- That's great.
- Good, good.
Well, that's settled then.
No, sir, you don't understand.
I can't withdraw my protest.
- What ?
- Mr Ducksworth, you wanted me to learn about fair play... and how to be part of a team... and I may not have learned everything yet, but I remember something my father said to me.
A team isn't a bunch of kids out to win.
A team is something you belong to, something you feel, something you have to earn.
And I'm not gonna let those kids down.
Gordon, I'm going to make this simple.
Are you prepared to lose your job over some kids ?
Some game ?
Let me ask you, sir.
Are you prepared to fire me over some kids ?
Some game ?
Collect your personal belongings, Gordon.
Yes, sir, Mr Ducksworth !
Thank you very much, Mr Ducksworth !
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, Mr Ducksworth !
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.
[ Quacking ]
You may have paid for this jersey, sir, but you didn't earn it.
I'll see you in the play-offs.
[ Bell rings ]
- Excuse me.
There are some students here that I'd like to see.
- Who are you ?
I'm their hockey coach.
If you could tell me where l can find each of them, please.
They're in room 223.
- All of them ?
- All of them.
"l will not quack at the principal."
"l will not quack at the principal."
- What do you want ?
- l want to talk to you guys.
- People.
- People, right.
Sit down, please.
All of you.
Okay, don't sit down.
Look, what's done is done.
I want to be your coach again.
You're gonna coach a bunch of losers ?
- No, I want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said ?
You said we didn't deserve to live.
Karp, I was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means ?
- No.
- Okay, then you do.
I didn't mean those things the way they sounded.
You guys know what it's like to be misunderstood, right ?
- Yeah, of course.
We're kids.
- So...
Can you forgive me ?
Can I be your coach again ?
- What about Banks ?
- He can be on the team if he wants.
He should have been with us all year.
It's you guys who were cheated.
Let's forget all that crap !
- We're a team, right ?
- [ Ducks ] Yeah.
I made you guys, and I'm sticking with you.
So, what's it gonna be ?
We can play tomorrow night and still have a shot at the play-offs... or we can forfeit again and the season's over.
Peter, what do you say ?
Well... I guess it would help if we practised first.
All right.
Let me see if I can get you out of detention.
- Yes.
- Take that.
You really quacked at the principal ?
Yeah.
Are we Ducks, or what ?
Yeah !
Look at your mother.
Let's see how it is in ten minutes.
I'm gonna kill you !
Hey.
Wasn't sure if you'd show up.
Yeah, whatever.
- l just want to play hockey.
- Good.
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.
On behalf of the Ducks, I'd like to say welcome.
Cake-eater.
Ooh, the Jess-man, dissin' the new guy !
The Jess-ster !
Shut up, Averman !
[ Averman ] lt's just a joke.
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey doesn't mean you're a real Duck.
- They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
- l bet.
Well, suit up.
I'll see you on the ice.
On your left !
Over here !
I'm open !
Come on, right here !
Up front !
- Up front !
- Pass it to Banks !
Come on !
Do somethin' with it !
Yeah !
All right !
Way to go, Banks !
All right !
Score another one for the Ducks !
[ Ducks talking excitedly ]
Goldberg, you're gonna sit this one out.
What ?
You're pulling the goalie when we're tied ?
Listen, listen, listen !
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.
Okay, Fulton, you're our extra man.
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.
-We pulling the Statue of Liberty play ?
-Yeah ?
No, take your shot.
You may only get one, so it's gotta be good.
- But, coach, one outta one ?
- [ Germaine ] Soft hands, Fulton.
- Concentration, not strength.
- [ Bombay ] That's right !
Okay ?
Let's get the Huskies !
Let's go !
Come on !
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one.
Let's go !
- Get in there !
- Come on !
[ Jesse ] Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot !
Shoot, Fulton, shoot !
We won !
We made the play-offs !
[ Charlie ] Boy, this is great.
[ Connie ] Guys, look, it's the North Stars.
- Oh, man.
- lt's Mike Modano !
- ...
Believe this ?
- Cool !
This is too cool.
I can't believe this.
[ Connie ] This place is humongous.
What are we doing here ?
It's a little play-offs present.
Hey, Gordo !
Gordon Bombay, right ?
- You remember me ?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- l heard you were a farmer.
Actually, I became a lawyer.
But I'm coaching Pee Wee now and this is my team, the Ducks.
- Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
- [ Ducks ] We can see that.
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks !
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.
If you ever want a shot, I'll get you a tryout in the minor league clubs.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, nice seein' ya.
Take it easy.
[ Bombay ] All right, let's have some fun !
* You've got to accentuate the positive *
* Eliminate the negative *
* Latch on to the affirmative *
* Don't mess with Mister ln-between *
* You've got to spread joy up to the maximum *
* Bring gloom down to that minimum *
* Have faith or pandemonium *
* You're liable to walk upon the sea *
* To illustrate my last remark *
* Talking about Jonah in a whale and Noah in an ark *
* What did they do when everything looked so dark *
* Then they say *
* You better accentuate the positive *
* Eliminate that negative *
* Latch on to the affirmative *
* Don't mess with Mister ln-between *
* We better accentuate the positive *
* Eliminate all the negative *
* Latch on to the affirmative *
* Don't mess with Mister ln-between *
* No, don't mess with Mister ln-between *
- Hey !
- Hey !
* Don't you mess with Mister ln-between **
You know, I heard the North Stars wore the same underwear... all through the play-offs last year for luck.
So I'm doin' the same thing.
Hmm.
Maybe I should've cooked.
You know, I'm thinkin' maybe we can all go down to the winter festival tonight.
- All three of us ?
- Sure.
I don't think I should, 'cause I got a lot of homework.
You should go.
With my mom.
By yourselves.
[ Door slams ]
Mmm, smells great !
Hello.
[ Whispering ] Go for it.
Hi.
[ Casey ] I don't know how they sculpt these.
Hmm, I wonder.
I used to sculpt, but now I do mostly paintings.
How do you think they do the details ?
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.
Oh.
I'm nervous.
I'm rambling on and on here.
You probably think I'm weird.
No, I think you're great.
When I was a little girl, I used to pretend that that was an ice castle.
And that was my room, that window right up there.
And last winter I gave Charlie that one.
What about me ?
Which window's mine ?
I want to live there too.
What ?
What did I say ?
- lt's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy ?
Casey, I was just playin' around.
Look, I don't know how you feel about me.
I don't even know how I feel about you.
But I do know there's a little kid back home... who's absolutely falling in love with his coach... and if you can't deal with that, if you're just playing around, then you better let me know.
What are we talking ?
'Til death do us part ?
- l have to decide on the first date ?
- Stop it, Gordon.
Charlie's gonna be there when we get back.
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.
Look, I can take it.
But if Charlie gets too attached --
Every time this happens, it gets... a little rougher on him.
Just on him ?
I'm glad to be here with you.
Me too.

Remember, it's not worth playing - lf you can't win.
- That's right.
Okay, son, let's go.
Let's go, son !

[ Hawk ] Don't worry, guys.
Did it go in ?
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favour.
Kick some Hawk butt.
All right, cake-eater.
He'll be okay, sir.
We need to take some X rays, though.
Hell of a job, son.
They score against us, they're gonna pay the price.
Now, don't worry.
We're gonna get that one back.
You got somethin' to say to me, Bombay ?
To think I wasted all those years worrying about what you thought.
You're goin' down, Reilly.
- Let me go after 'em, coach.
Let me get 'em.
- No, we're better than that.
Look, look, it's time to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.
-All right ?
Now we got the power play.
-[ Ducks ] Yeah.
All right.
We're gonna hit 'em where it hurts the most: up there.

So let's see it !
Show me the flying "V."
- All right !
- All right !
Let's get a line change !
Let's go !
[ Jesse ] Here we go !
Come on, y'all, let's go !
Come on !

[ Reilly ] What kind of call is that ?
Okay, we've got a penalty shot for the Ducks.
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.
All right, Ducks, who's gonna take it ?
- l think he should take it.
- Me ?
What about Charlie ?
- What about Charlie ?
- All he does is fan.
Let's let him finish what he started.
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.
Come here.
You been practising that triple deke ?
- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.
You may make it, you may not.
But that doesn't matter, Charlie.
What matters is that we're here.
Look around.
Whoever thought we'd make it this far ?
One, two, three.
Triple deke.
Take your best shot.
I believe in you, Charlie, win or lose.
- Thanks, coach.
- Go get 'em.
- All right, Charlie.
- Let's go, Charlie.
Okay, now wait for my signal.
Good luck.
[ Chanting ] Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,

Okay, now don't leave your crease before he touches the puck.
Good luck.

[ Announcer ] ...
The Minnesota Pee Wee Championship is up for grabs.
Both teams playing like there's no tomorrow.
Duluth, in the Hawks' zone, looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.
There's a pass out to the blue line.
intercepted by Gordon Bombay !
Bombay !
He's got a breakaway.
Across the blue line all alone for a chance to win the game !
He's pulled down from behind by Fox of Duluth.
Fox definitely pulled him down from behind and this could be --
Yes, the referee calls for a penalty shot.
Gordon, it's up to you. I don't wanna see any goats around after the game.
You got it ?
Now, you miss this shot... you're not just lettin' me down, you're lettin' your team down.
[ Announcer ] A pressure situation he's in now.
The 1973 Pee Wee State Championship now rests... on the little shoulders of number 9, Gordon Bombay.
[ Cheering ]
[ Crowd chanting ] Gordon !
Gordon !
[ Chanting ] Gordon !
Gordon !
Let's go, son !
All right !
[ Crowd cheering ]
[ Whistle blowing ]
[ Announcer ] He hit the goalpost !
What a heartbreaker !
Little Gordon Bombay had the chance --
All my client did was attempt to give you what you wanted !
Isn't that right ?
This man put his neck on the line for your greed.
Objection.
Your Honour ?
Will both counsellors approach the bench ?
[ Man ] What's he doing ?
I don't have anything to tell you.
I just wanna make a point.
So nod like I'm saying something important.
- Mr Bombay ?
- Gordon, what are you doing ?
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.
This drives him nuts and I love it.
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya ?
Oh, Mr Bombay, I'm so glad you could make it.
Please restrict yourself to a relevant cross-examination !
Your Honour, the applicability of societal intent... vis-a-vis individual action is well established.
I'm citing Minneapolis V. Higgins.
The appellant court overruled a judge who disallowed similar testimony.
Now, if I'm not mistaken, that was... you.
Wasn't it, Judge Weathers ?
I stand corrected, counsellor.
Objection overruled.
[ Frank ] Oh, you really stooped to an all-time low on this, Bombay.
I'm insulted, Frank.
You have no idea how low I can stoop.
I don't mind losing.
I would just like to lose fair.
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.
And what about justice ?
That man should be in jail.
It was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me !
Next time do your job, Frankie boy.
- 30 and 0 !
I remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case ?
We don't count that one because I scored with the court reporter.
- The one you said had the intelligent body ?
- That's the one.
- No calls on the Duck phone ?
- Not yet.
What's he waiting for ?
I saw him in the back of the courtroom.
How about some kudos here, huh ?
Mr Tolbert dropped off a couple ringside seats for tonight's North Stars game.
Hockey ?
[ Raspberry ] Forget it !
Gordon, here's the research for the Pearlstein Project.
- Can you get started ?
- Jane !
Can't you see I'm reveling here ?
Today I'm 30 and 0 !
- 30 and one.
- Type, Jeannie, don't speak.
- [ Ringing ]
- Mr Bombay's office.
Yes. lt's Ducksworth.
You're right.
He wants to see you.
Ha-ha-ha !
Thank you very much, Mr Ducksworth !
It was nothing, Mr Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr Ducksworth.
[ Door closing ]
Gordon, another fine job today.
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.
Score.
Don't spike.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean, sir.
This is a business.
It isn't a game.
Next time a little restraint might be in order.
[ Tyres squealing ]
* Hey, man, get off my back I'm doin' the best I can, yeah *
* You bust my neck Cut no slack *
- * Forget your fellow man Yeah yeah uh-huh * - [ Siren ]
- Pull your vehicle over to the right, now !
- This is not good.
** [ Muffled rock ]
- * Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah *
- Licence, please.
- Could you turn down the stereo ?
- Sure.
I guess it was a "widdle" noisy.
A "widdle" ?
Okay, I'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine ?
No, thanks, I'm full.
[ Laughs ]
Okay, out of the car.
Now.
The charges against Mr Bombay are driving under the influence, driving with an open container and reckless endangerment.
And to think I almost stayed home this morning.
I assume you're representing yourself ?
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a licence?
Okay, let's talk business.
What am I facing ?
Suspension of licence ?
Fines ?
What ?
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow you to plead guilty to lesser charges.
But that's solely up to the prosecutor.
The city of Minneapolis does not wish to pursue a plea bargain in this case.
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo ?
The defendant is released on his own recognizance.
Mr Ducksworth.
What are you doing here ?
I own the place.
How about you ?
Just goin' over a few cases.
ricoh Statute stuff.
Oh, I thought you might be researching your defence... against D.U.l. and reckless endangerment.
Did you think I wouldn't find out, Gordon ?
There was no reason to concern you with it, sir.
They have no case.
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp.
I found a loophole.
I'm gonna plead not guilty --
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.
There's not going to be a trial.
I am not going to have you drag... this firm's good name through the mud.
I've talked to Judge Weathers and he has agreed to suspend your case.
- Under what conditions ?
- Probation, suspension of your driver's licence... and 500 hours of community service.
And a leave of absence from the firm.
A leave of absence ?
He can't do that.
- He can't stop me from working !
- He's not. I am.
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.
It'll teach you compassion, a sense of fair play, how to fit in.
- Community service ?
This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.
And hopefully you'll come back a better person and a better attorney, which is why I'm keeping you on salary and have arranged a driver for you.
You know, in the early '70s I drove the tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties, amps cranked up to about eight jillion decibels.
All that loud music damaged my hearing, but I got no regrets...
- except for the '80s.
- How could he do this to me ?
Community service...
coaching hockey !
I found one !
I'm comin' out !
[ Boy ] Karp, you finally found something for once in your life.
Dumpster Dave comes through !
- What do you think ?
- Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.
- You gonna take that from him, Karp ?
- Remind me to bust you, Averman.
- Thanks, Peter.
Thanks very much.
- Did you get it ?
- Yeah !
Right there !
- Yeah !
Here, Petie.
Here, boy.
A little chili to keep you warm, buddy.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look !
[ Peter ] I can't believe he ate the can too.
[ Averman ] He sniffs.
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.
[ Averman ] He sniffs some more.
He stops.
I think this is it !
He's turnin' in a circle.
- He squats !
He scores !
- Yes !
We did it !
[ Groaning ] Full load.
Stinks !
[ Averman ] Come on, come on, give me the dollar !
- [ Peter ] Hurry it up already.
- l'm hurrying', okay ?
- Go, go, go, go !
- Yeah !
All right !
Let's do it !
Oh, come on.
Stop !
- Yes !
- Okay !
Here we go.
Yeah.
There's more inside.
[ Karp ] He's takin' off with it.
This guy deserves what he gets.
- [ Tyres squealing ] - [ Screaming ]
[ Laughing ]
Oh, guys, he saw us.
Oh, my !
[ Groaning ]
[ Cheering ]
Rink's gotta be around here someplace.
Just look for a sign that says "Personal Hell."
How could he do this to me ?
I hate kids.
They're barely human.
[ indistinct chatter ]
Come on !
Over here !
Keep it down, please !
Hey, come on.
There's no need for this.
Let's talk, come on.
I'm your friend, aren't I ?
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to stop it. I'm tired of chasing' the puck.
Be careful, man.
It almost hit me that time.
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
It's supposed to hit you.
Does that sound stupid to anyone else ?
Good God.
That's the hockey team.
Drive out on the ice.
It'll be all right.
[ indistinct chatter ] I ain't scared.
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.
[ Peter ] We're gonna get in big trouble.
- l'll take care of it.
- They're drugs, I just know it.
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.
This is my dominion.
This is a drug-free zone, you understand ?
We ain't buying' nothin'.
I'm feelin' generous today.
So I'm gonna let you get your sorry vanilla bootie outta here... before we be usin' your eyeballs as hockey pucks.
Thanks, bro, but I'm not goin' home 'til I take care of business.
He's got a gun.
Stand back.
Whew !
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.
I'm Gordon Bombay.
I'm the new coach.
[ Laughing ] What a joke !
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.
Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.
Here's the long and the short of it.
I hate hockey and I don't like kids.
What's this supposed to be, a pep talk ?
I'm sure this'll be a real bonding experience.
Maybe one day one of you will even write a book about it in jail.
- Funny.
- ls there a goalie ?
Only for a little while.
I'm movin' back to Philly.
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.
Uh, just so you know.
We really suck.
I'll decide who sucks around here.
- Get off me.
- They really suck.
The Pete-meister.
Mr Rabble-rouser.
Passing the puck over to Jesse-roonie, the enforcer.
- [ Grunt ]
- Ouch !
That hurt !
Oh, it's the Connie-meister, the velvet hammer.
Hi, coach. I'm Connie.
- Do you play ?
- No.
So what's our record anyway ?
0 and 9.
One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.
We almost scored a goal too.
So what do we do now... coach ?
- What did your old coach have you do ?
- He just yelled a lot.
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm ?
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us, "Little bastards, where'd you learn to play ?
Oh, you suck, you !
Skate, you little bast--" [ Gasping ]
Heart attack.
Great.
All right, look.
I gotta make a phone call.
Keep scrimmaging.
You, you, you, you and you against you four.
- We got names, you know ?
- l'm sure you do.
And I'll bet they're very nice names.
I might even learn 'em.
For now, I'll be in my office.
Oh, and if you need anything, fax me.
Geez, what a jerk.
Where do they find these coaches anyways ?
We're impressionable kids, right ?
Shouldn't we check his qualifications or somethin' ?
Jeannie, who told you not to give me my messages ?
Ducksworth !
Then who's handling my cases ?
- On three !
- Jane !
- One, two, three !
Charge !
- Are you kidding me ?
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to --
Hold on a second !
- [ Kids shouting ]
- Hey!
Get your mouth off the windows!
- Hey !
- Get off there !
- [ Shouting ]
- Get off the car !
- We're being invaded !
- Get off !
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool !
- ls that a real phone ?
- Yes, and I'm really on it.
- Not any more.
- Thank you.
- Let's see, who should I --
- Watch the upholstery.
[ indistinct chatter ]
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride !
[ Chanting ] We wanna ride !
We wanna ride !
- We wanna ride !
- l could kill one of 'em just to set an example.
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything !
[ Cheering ]
This looks good.
I'm gonna eat it.
- Wow, I feel like Madonna.
- You wish !
Seats ten comfortably.
- Hey, pass me one of those glasses.
- [ Growling ]
- Yeah, I see your point.
- [ Sniffing ]
Oh.
- [ Sniffing ] - [ Together ] Goldberg !
- lt wasn't me, all right !
- Young man, what did you eat ?
- Nothing !
It wasn't me !
- Open a window !
Oh, man !
It's my mom !
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.
All right, out !
Everybody, out of the car right now.
Goldberg, why'd you have to ruin the fun ?
Are you out of your mind ?
What were you thinking putting that car on the ice ?
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take.
One crack !
- The ice is not gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are ?
- l'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
- The new coach ?
They send you over here to coach the team and you endanger their lives.
What danger ?
I grew up on the ice;
I know when it's safe to drive on.
- How do you know ?
- l just know !
All right ?
Well, listen, Mr Zen Master, you may be in tune with the ice universe, but when it comes to my kid, "l just know" doesn't cut it.
Charlie, let's go.
- Mom ?
- Give me my candy !
All of it !
Well, I guess practise is over.
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- lt's all right, Charlie.
Coach, gonna be at the game tomorrow ?
By order of the state of Minnesota, yeah.
[ Chanting ] Hawks !
Hawks !
Hawks !
Hawks !

One, two, three, four, five !

- Hi, girls.

No !
Goodbye.
The hawks.
My first game and it had to be the Hawks.
Gordon ?
Gordon Bombay.
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.
Why don't you just call me Jack ?
Hey, come back to see your old coach, huh ?
Well, actually I'm, uh, coaching...
Pee Wee.
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'.
You got a kid on the team or something ?
No, I'm here because I need to be of service to the community.
How about this, huh ?
Whoever thought we'd be coaching' against each other ?
Yeah, who'd have thought ?
So, who's your hotshot player this year ?
- Anyone good ?
- l got a kid named Banks.
Might go all the way.
Not quite as good as you were.
But he wants it more.
Kid won't give up.
Oh, boy, I wish they would take that one down.
Don't you ?
Well, good luck.
You're gonna need it.
It's up to you, Gordon.
You miss this shot, you're not just... letting me down, you're letting your whole team down too.
I wish your dad could be here to see this.
Make him proud of you !
[ Chanting ] Win !
Win !
Win !
All right, guys, gather round.
Come on, come on.
- Win !
Win !
Win !

Win.
Win !

Win !
Win !
Yeah, we're fired up.
All right !
Watch this !
Oh, great.
Good concept, guys.
Nice -- ouch !
Nice goin', fool !
- Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
- Oh, yeah, "l didn't mean to."
Yeah, sure, you're on my own team.
Oh, sorry, Goldberg.
Didn't mean to.
Would you get off me before I clock you ?
Let's go, Jesse !
Go, Terry !
[ Whistle blowing ] Let's go !
Come on in.
What's this ?
The Oreo line !
Hey, come on.
Let's play hockey.
Um, batter, batter, hum, batter, batter !
Hey, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter !
- Hum, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter !
- Averman !
It's hockey !
There's no batter. idiot.
Hum, goalie, goalie, hum, goalie, goalie !
Hey, goalie, goalie, save, goalie, goalie !
Hum, goalie, goalie, hey, goalie, goalie !
No, I got him !
I, I, I got him !
[ Cheering ]
That's one !
Hey, hey, hey !
Easy !
Good show.
Sloppy pass.
Way to stuff it, Banks !
All right, all right !
Let's run it up !
Run it up !
Run it up !
[ Whistle blowing ]
Oh, man !
How could you let him get by you ?
All right, line change.
Come on, go, go, go.
- Hey !
- [ Grunting ]
- [ Crowd cheering ] - [ Groaning ]
[ Chanting ] Banks !
Banks !
Banks !
Hey, you !
Come back here !
Oh !
- [ Whistle blowing ]
- Why me ?
How lazy can you be ?
They're killing us out there !
How many times do I have to tell you:
Get those rebounds, get your heads up, get those loose pucks.
- Get -
- Just -- - [ Whistle blowing ]
Just get the hell outta here.
All right !
It's Spaz-way.
He'll screw up.
[ Crowd cheering ]
[ Crowd gasping ]
Hey, hey !
Way to play it, Banks !
All right !
That's okay, Charlie !
Nice try !
Nice fan, Charlie.
Keep swingin'.
Maybe you'll give 'em a cold.
Hey, hey, hey, knock it off !
Against this team we should have twice this many !
Now let's run it up !
Remember it's not worth winning if you can't win big !
[ Reilly ] All right !
Guys !
No !
Come on, let's talk about this !
Be civilized !
Come on !
Please !
[ Crowd cheering ]
Oh no, guys !
Come on, not again !
Please !
Just take the goal.
Fine !
I don't care !
- l'm so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.
[ Buzzer ]
All right !
Hey, knock it off !
That was a lousy third period.
Anybody could beat these pansies.
I want you guys to stay hungry out there !
All right, nice goin', Banks.
New Hawks record.
- Okay, boys.
Let's go.
- All right !
Hey, Gordon !
Nice game.
I enjoyed it thoroughly.
At least I can handle the puck !
[ indistinct arguing ]
Hey, shut up !
You guys stink !
I thought we came here to play hockey.
- You know, I knew we forgot something.
- [ Laughing ]
Oh, you think it's funny ?
You think losing is funny ?
Well, not at first, but once you get the hang of it.
We're the ones out there gettin' our butts kicked.
Yeah, it's not like you coach us or anything.
At least we try.
You didn't listen to a word I said.
I said, keep your heads up.
You put your heads down.
I said, hustle.
You went slower !
That was the sloppiest playing I've ever seen.
Why the hell don't you just listen to me ?
Why the hell should we ?
I don't care.
You want to lose, fine.
You're the ones who look like idiots out there.
[ Reilly ] Great game !
Hans ?
[ Cheering ] I don't believe it !
Who would throw these away ?
- First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
- Fork it over.
Forget it, Karp.
I can see this every day on MTV.
This one's from Minneapolis.
Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom.
- Let's give him a wedgie.
- Good idea, Jesse !
I was just kidding, okay ?
Hey !
Give that back !
- Hi, girls.
- Does your mommy know you have that ?
Nah, she's busy with the mailman.
That'll make great bathroom reading.
That's mine, you jerk !
I found it !
You don't even know what to do with it, wuss-breath.
- You gonna let him call you wuss-breath ?
- No !
Hey !
Hey !
[ Grunting ]
- Oh !
- Come on.
Want some more ?
You guys want some more ?
Come on !
Yeah !
You want some more ?
Come on !
[ Gasping ] [ indistinct jeering ]
[ Jeering continues ]
[ Growling ]
Let's get out !
Move it !
- Thanks a lot.
- All right, man.
One, two, three !
Boom !
What are you laughing at, cream cheese boy ?
Go !
[ Bombay ] lf we're gonna cheat, we gotta make those falls look real.
Keep it up !
Whoa !
Score one for the spirit.
Go at him !
Go at him !
Good !
Go at him !
Come on, get angry !
Oh !
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt !
I am hurt.
Good, good.
Now say it again !
[ Together ] Take the fall !
Act hurt !
Get indignant !
- One more time !
- Take the fall !
Act hurt !
Get indignant !
Good !
You guys are ready.
- [ Grunting ] - [ Cheering ]
[ Buzzer ]
Give me a break, ref !
Open your eyes !
Did you see what he did to me ?
Goldberg, you don't take the fall while they're shooting at you.
Oh !
Well, I guess you didn't explain that very well, did ya ?
- District Five !
- l throw myself on the ice --
Cut the acting class.
One more dive, I forfeit to the Jets !
What ?
I'm insulted by that !
- Let's go !
Let's go !
- Quit it !
[ Whistle blowing ] Face-off !
Let's go !
Charlie !
That guy is twice your size.
The next time he gets you in a corner like that, I want you to grab your eye like it's cut and then hit the ice !
- Got it ?
Let's go.
- [ Referee ] Let's go !
Face-off !
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
Here we go.
Hey --
- Come on !
- That's it, Charlie.
- That's it, Charlie !
- Come on !
Damn it, Charlie !
We can't even win when we cheat.
- Stupid cake-eater tricks !
- [ Connie ] That was embarrassing.
Charlie !
What the hell is the matter with you ?
When I tell you to do something, you do it !
You got it ?
Look at me.
- You got it ?
- You can't make me cheat.
Jesse, Terry, let's go.
This is what I gave up my overtime pay for ?
To see my kids takin' falls ?
Gordon.
- How did you know ?
- Through the back door at this time of night.
Just like you used to.
You'd spend hours watching me do this.
What do you think ?
is this sharp enough ?
Ow !
- Did you cut yourself ?
- No. [ Chuckling ]
You always fell for that.
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, I'm Scandinavian.
- lt's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.
You probably thought I was dead.
I saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything ?
You were so busy screaming at the kids.
I didn't want to spoil the moment.
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.
Why should my store ?
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that ?
Well, I hardly ever lose a case.
That is not what I asked.
Hmm !
I see you still have this up.
- Thanks very much.
- lt is important to remember the past.
I'd just as soon forget it.
That was the worse time in my life.
My dad died that year.
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.
I found this not long ago.
He was proud of you.
I miss him.
You scored 198 goals in that season, Gordon.
It's a shame you quit.
You --
- Could have gone all the way.
Yeah.
- No !
You really loved to play.
You remember ?
You remember... you used to play on the ponds until after dark, until your father called you back.
You really flew on that ice, Gordon.
That's all I ever wanted to do.
Then why did you stop ?
Reilly ?
I saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.
- The guy wins.
- lt's not about winning. lt never was.
Just show they how to play.
Show them how to have fun.
Teach them to fly.
That is what they'll remember long after you've gone back to being a doctor.
Lawyer.
And long after they've stopped buying skates from me.
Here... there you are.
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.
- What's this ?
- Your new skates.
That is why you came here tonight, isn't it ?
- l figured nine and a half was your size.
- Actually, I'm a nine.
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.
Here comes Bombay on an end-to-end rush.
Past the blue line, past centre.
He's not skating, he's flying !
He fakes once, he fakes twice.
Fakes three times !
Shoots !
Scores !
Yes !
Yes !
Yes !
Yes !
What a play !
What a guy !
Gordon Bombay does it again !
Great move, Gordy !
You faked him out of his pads.
Come here, son.
You look great out there.
Come on, let's go inside, get something to eat.
A few more minutes ?
Please ?
- Go on.
Get outta here.
- Thanks.
[ Sighing ]
[ Knocking ]
- Hi, uh --
- Please, just go away.
Charlie doesn't want... to be on the team any more, and neither he nor I have anything to say to you.
- Well, I have something to say to you.
- Oh, really ?
Door-to-door mistreatment now.
Now the team can feel miserable between games too, huh ?
I came to apologize to Charlie...
to both of you.
- What ?
- Apologize.
Well... you should.
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin' ?
I was just, uh, walkin' around thinkin' and, uh --
Wanna give us a minute ?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Listen, it was very wrong of me... to ask you and the other guys to cheat.
I never should have said to you what I said to you.
I was angry. I was frustrated.
It took a lot of guts for you to do what you knew was right. I admire that.
And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that, uh, that I'm --
Oh, boy, this is difficult.
- l'm --
- You're sorry.
I'm sorry. [ Louder ] I'm sorry.
All right ?
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be a lot more fun this time around.
What do you say ?
Do you want to stay for dinner ?
- What ?
- Charlie !
Uh, no, I -- l can't.
Uh --
Well, what are you havin' ?
Mr Ducksworth, there are two reasons I came by.
First off, I want to let you know things are going well.
I'm learning a lot about teamwork, fair play and all that junk.
Good, good.
And the second thing ?
Well, sir, fair play doesn't come cheap.
These kids, my team, have no money.
They can't afford rink time, safe equipment, proper uniforms, which makes it difficult for them to compete.
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old and stepping out onto that ice... with old copies of the "Enquirer" taped to your shins instead of pads.
The point I'm trying to make, sir, is that you wouldn't be taken seriously and neither are these kids.
So I thought maybe the firm could help 'em out.
How much are we talking about ?
- $15,000.
- No way.
Wait a minute.
Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross, the firm that gives back to the community.
Come on.
I'll get you your own jersey.
* Ooo, yeah *
* Can you feel it baby Ooo * * l can too, Ooo *
* Ooo *
* Ooo, come on swing *
* Come on swing *
* Come on swing *
* C-Come on swing Ooo *
* Ooo * * lt's such a good vibration * * lt's such a sweet sensation * * lt's such a good vibration * * lt's such a sweet sensation *
Who is that kid ?
Thanks, Fulton.
-Fulton Reed.
He's in one of my classes.
-How come he's not on the team ?
He only plays football.
Some preppie school gave him a scholarship... as long as he doesn't play hockey.
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- l heard it was colleges.
He's been accepted to four of 'em.
- Yeah, but I heard he's got to repeat the sixth grade.
- Ah, shut up.
Gordon Bombay ?
Bombay was a Hawk.
* ...
Good vibration * * lt's such a sweet sensation *
* Feel the vibration lt's such a good vibration **
Dude, check 'em out, man.
Holy cow.
- They're pretty good skaters.
- Anybody know who they are ?
That's Tommy Duncan.
He's in my science class.
That's his sister, Tammy.
- Think they'd want to play hockey with us ?
- [ Together ] Yeah !
Go get dressed.
I'll do the negotiating.
Just think of it as figure skating... with a stick.
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy !
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive !
Mom isn't gonna like this at all.
So what ?
You want me to figure skate, then you gotta play hockey.
What do I know about hockey ?
More than you think.
Back to basics !
Skating !
Go !
Go !
Side to side.
Shift your weight.
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.
That's okay, Charlie.
Soft hands.
You don't shoot the puck to your teammate.
You sail it to him.
Karp, on your feet.
- You send it.
- Oh !
Gross !
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it.
Cradle it.
- Oh !
- Again !
Concentration, not strength.
Like the Karate Kid, right ?
"Wax on !
Wax off !"
Just shut up and try it, Averman !
- You're such a jerk.
- Send it back, Averman.
Good, Averman.
Charlie.
That's good.
Good.
Now sail it back.
Oh !
Way to go !
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.
- [ Splattering ]
- Oh !
Here it comes.
Nice and easy.
Good.
- l did it !
I did it !
- All right.
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.
- But when are you gonna work with me in goal ?
- Goldberg, do you trust me ?
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar mitzvah'd.
This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.
Coach, I think you got the ceremonies mixed up. lt's more like a circumcision.
Coach !
Will you come back here ?
What'd I ever do to you, man ?
District Five !
Ready !
Oh, man, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
- Aim !
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.
- Oh, please !
No !
- Fire !
[ Screaming ] I wanna go home !
[ Screaming ]
[ Laughing ]
This doesn't hurt !
You wimps !
Give me your best shot !
Oh !
Come on !
That's good !
Hex goal !
Goalie boot save !
Whoa !
Nice shot, man !
I'm a dog !
I'm a crazed dog !
Come on !
[ Chanting ] Goldberg !
Goldberg !
I am Goldberg !
The goalie !
[ Growling ]
Good !
Good !
All right, Charlie !
Good hustle !
Conway, way to go.
All right, Karp !
- You guys hungry ?
Tired ?
- [ Together ] Yeah !
- Do you ache ?
Are you pumped up ?
- Yeah !
Good !
That was a hell of a practise.
Be proud of yourself.
[ indistinct chatter ]
Hey, guys !
Excuse me, guys !
You gotta untie me now !
Ha-ha !
Good joke.
Very funny. I like it.
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach !
Coach, come on, don't leave me hangin' like this !
Coach, don't make me come after you, coach.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Thanks for the ride.
You did real well in practise today, Charlie.
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad ?
Mom and I left him. I don't really remember, but that's what she says.
You know, when I was a boy, I had to take care of my mother too.
Really ?
What happened to your dad ?
He passed away.
You do a good job takin' care of your mom.
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right ?
- Okay.
We'll see ya.
- Okay.
Hey, coach.
- What's that ?
- Huh ?
- Oh !
- Victory !
[ Laughing ]
[ Bombay laughing ] You've just entered the tickling zone !
[ Laughing ]
So I'm right in the middle of my cross-examination and I say to the guy, I usually defend heels like you, you scuzzy, mole-faced rat.
[ Chuckling ] That's a good one, sir.
Whoa !
[ Screeching ]
Hey !
Hey !
Hold it !
Hold it !
Whoa !
Whoa !
Whoa !
Look, it was an accident, all right ?
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that ?
I didn't learn.
I just do it.
Do it again.
Yargh !
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal ?
Yeah.
Well, one out of five.
Fulton, is it true what they say ?
About the scholarships and how they won't let you play hockey ?
People talk.
It don't mean nothin'.
- Why don't you play for us ?
- l can't.
- What do you mean ?
- l mean, I can't.
- You afraid ?
- No, I mean I can't, you moron.
I don't know how to skate.
Whoa !
is that all that's stoppin' ya ?
[ indistinct shouting ]
* l ride the top of the line I can't settle for less *
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.
Side to side, good !
Follow me.
[ Screaming ]
Aaah !
Watch it !
Get out of the way !
[ Screaming ]
Sorry !
* This is all we got baby lt's got to be enough * * l'd like to try to quit But I don't know how * * l needed it then and baby I need it right now *
Come on, Fulton.
Let's go !
- * l gotta keep movin' 'til I'm satisfied *
- Hey !
* Come on, Come on lt's gonna be all right **
The Ducks ?
We're the Ducks ?
Man, what brain-dead jerk came up with that name ?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But I didn't have a choice.
We're being sponsored.
By who ?
Donald and Daisy ?
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks ?
You'd rather be District Five ?
Some stupid number ?
Better than some stupid animal.
I'll have you know, Peter, that the Duck is one of the most noble, agile and intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom.
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.
Neither do hockey players.
Have you guys ever seen a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation ?
It's beautiful.
Pretty awesome the way they all stick together.
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight ?
No way.
Why ?
Because the other animals are afraid.
They know that if they mess with one duck, they gotta deal with the whole flock.
Oh, man !
I'm proud to be a duck.
And I'd be proud to fly with any one of you.
So how about it ?
Who's a Duck ?
I'll be a Duck.
Yeah.
Me too.
[ indistinct chatter ]
Anybody see Goldberg ?
All right !
- Now we're the Ducks !
- [ Cheering ]
- The Mighty Ducks !
- [ Cheering ]
- What are we ?
- [ Together ] The Ducks !
What the hell are they doing ?
Every time you get the puck, you're the quarterback.
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.
Come on, guys.
This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.
What a weird-ass team.
How you doin' ?
- You ready ?
- l think so.
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.
My God !
Wow !
- [ Crowd gasping ]
- One out of five.
All right, Let's forget the past.
We lost a few games, tough !
That was District Five.
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right !
Yeah !
Quack, quack.
- Quack.
Quack.
- [ Together ] Quack !
Quack !
Quack !
Quack !
Quack !
Quack !
[ Chanting ] Quack !
Quack !
Go...
Ducks !
- [ Cheering ]
- What the hell was that ?
[ Bombay ] Let's go, Ducks !
Defence !
Defence !
Dig it outta there !
Let's go !
Let's go !
Yeah !
Let's go, Ducks !
Throw it !
Throw it !
To the crease !
[ Cheering ]
Yes !
The Oreo line !
That's my boy !
[ Laughing ]
Defence, Karp !
Defence !
Come on.
[ Crowd gasping ]
I don't wanna go to school today, Mom.
- How many fingers am I holding' up ?
- He wouldn't know.
Shut up, Peter.
Karp, are you okay ?
- Look at this.
- The Karp-ster used his head to stop the puck.
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.
Get him on the bench, Charlie.
Okay, Ducks, we still got a chance here.
Connie, Terry, Jesse, Guy, time for the secret weapon.
Okay, Fulton.
Remember, just like we talked about.
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.
[ Cheering ]
Oh, no.
- Go !
Get the face-off !
- Line up, boys, let's go.
That's it.
Aaah !
Whoa !
[ Cheering ]
Whoo !
Yeah !
That tie of yours might be what you need to make the play-offs.
- The ducks have a shot at the play-offs ?
- Sure.
Everyone but the last two teams are in, remember ?
Panthers got the measles and they forfeited the season.
So, you beat the Huskies and you'll make the play-offs.
- Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
- So ?
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since I played.
Actually, one little thing has changed.
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.
They redrew the district lines last year.
The lake is not the boundary any more.
You see ?
You'd be a Duck.
I'd be a Duck.
Excuse me.
Coach Reilly ?
- Yeah ?
- l'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.
- What's that ?
- One of your players is ineligible.
Banks !
Over here !
- This is a joke, right ?
- l'm afraid it's no joke.
- Problem ?
- No, just a mistake.
Are you this boy's father ?
450 North Hennipen, is that your address ?
- Yes.
- l'm afraid there's no mistake.
-This boy is playing for the wrong team.
-What ?
According to league rules, Adam Banks should be playing for District Five.
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- ls this your doing, Gordon ?
I'll expect to see him at our next game.
- We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
- No way.
My son would rather not play than play for your team.
Fine, if that's the way you want it.
But remember, if Adam plays for the Hawks, you'll forfeit every game for the rest of the season.
Boy, I'd hate to see that.
Look, I'm sorry this had to happen, but you can see on the map.
Gordon ?
Hey, Bombay !
You stop when I'm talking to you, son !
What's the idea here ?
You trying to sabotage me or what ?
The law's a bitch when it works against you, isn't it, Jack ?
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.
Even with Banks, what do you think you're gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers ?
That's right, coach.
They are losers.
We hate losers, don't we ?
They don't even deserve to live.
Maybe Banks won't make a difference, but at least we're playing by the rules.
Why'd you turn against me, Gordon ?
For six years... I taught ya how to skate, I taught ya how to score.
I taught ya how to go for the "W."
You could have been one of the greats.
And now look at yourself.
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.
Going to the play-offs !
Whoo !
One win !
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform ?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.
All right, everyone, listen up.
I got some good news.
We're getting a new player, Adam Banks.
- What ?
- [ indistinct chatter ]
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.
- We don't need him.
- l'm the coach. I say we do need him.
- lf we make it to the play-offs, he could be a big help.
- [ Karp ] lf ?
All of a sudden you don't think we're good enough.
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.
- What ?
- We heard what you said.
You said we were losers, we didn't deserve to live.
- That's not what I meant.
- l saw that picture of you missing that goal.
You were a Hawk, weren't you ?
Guess you guys stick together to the end.
You know what ?
I don't need your stinkin' equipment.
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.
- l'm talkin' to you, son !
- Forget it, cake-eater.
If you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.
Where do you guys think you're goin' ?
I don't believe this.
[ Sighing ]
All right, I'm goin' up to the bench because that's where l'm supposed to be.
Anyone who wants to join me can join me.
Anyone who doesn't --
Well --
Ten minutes to game time, coach.
Yeah, yeah, they'll be out in a minute.
They're, you know, working themselves into a frenzy.
Not much of a frenzy.
We forfeit.
Ducks forfeit.
Flames, you win.
Hey.
Can I sit ?
Sure.
You talk to the guys ?
I tried.
They think I'm a traitor for even showing up.
I guess they really hate me, huh ?
is it true you were really a Hawk ?
Yeah.
Peter said you blew a really big game once.
Yeah, well, Peter's right.
It was the last game of the state finals.
We were tied 2-2 in the end of the third period.
I get a penalty shot.
I go in, I triple deke.
I fake the goalie right out of his pads.
The puck's headed in, and then...
- Clang !
Hits the post.
- [ Groans ]
We lost in overtime.
A quarter of an inch this way and it would have gone in.
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way and you'd have missed completely.
I never thought of it that way.
At least you got to play in a championship game.
- That must've been so cool.
- Hey.
Can I get you a cup of coffee ?
I'd love one.
You know, she has many fine qualities that men find attractive.
I know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.
So, what kind of guys does she usually date ?
Jerks. I mean, most of them like her, but as soon as they catch a glimpse of me --
Pow !
Warp speed !
They are gone !
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, I wouldn't even care... except it's not fair to my mom.
She deserves somebody nice.
Are you gonna come over for dinner again ?
I don't know, Charlie.
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
See, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I, um, talked to Jesse and Terry's dad, and he's gonna take over coaching for the rest of the year.
- You're quitting ?
- l'm stepping aside to keep the team together.
The guys can't play for somebody they don't trust.
I trust you.
The other guys do too.
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.
- l've done all I can.
- No, you haven't.
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.
We are too !
We weren't even the Ducks until you came along.
You made us and now you're stuck with us.
Charlie.
That's right.
The red is oxygen.
Now what are the blue balls ?
[ Students giggling ]
- Tommy ?
- Hydrogen ?
is correct.
Now put them together... and you have a molecule that makes up 96%%% of your body.
- What is it ?
- Pizza ?
[ Students giggling ]
-[ Knocking ] -lt's the principal. I'll be right back.
Work on H2 CO3.
It's a goody.
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way ?
- Yeah, did you score ?
Leave me alone, guys.
I don't want to talk about the team.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.
Everybody knows he likes you best.
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp !
Take it back now !
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.
- [ Connie ] Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl !
- Lay off !
- Don't shove, Peter.
[ All arguing ]
Atoms away !
My atoms !
You !
Sit !
Sit now !
In your seats now !
I have never in my life --
What have you got to say for yourselves ?
Quack.
[ Chanting ] Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack !
Thanks for coming by on such short notice, Gordon.
By the way, your court release came through.
- Congratulations.
Your community service is over.
- You're kidding.
So you wanted to talk about my coming back to work then ?
- Well, actually --
- Oh, you got your jersey.
Great !
A lot's been happening.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.
Gordon, you know Coach Reilly and Mr Banks.
[ Mumbling ] Sir, they're the bad guys.
No, actually, Phil is one of my oldest friends.
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together here to try to work out this little problem.
You see, my son Adam wants to play for the Hawks.
His older brother was a Hawk.
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.
It's a tradition.
You understand that, Gordon.
You played.
But the league's already ruled on it.
We've talked to the league, and we worked out a little deal.
- You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League ?
- Yes, we did.
The long and short of it is that Adam stays on the Hawks for the rest of the season.
And then next year, they redraft the lines.
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.
What's that ?
That you withdraw your protest.
- That's great.
- Good, good.
Well, that's settled then.
No, sir, you don't understand.
I can't withdraw my protest.
- What ?
- Mr Ducksworth, you wanted me to learn about fair play... and how to be part of a team... and I may not have learned everything yet, but I remember something my father said to me.
A team isn't a bunch of kids out to win.
A team is something you belong to, something you feel, something you have to earn.
And I'm not gonna let those kids down.
Gordon, I'm going to make this simple.
Are you prepared to lose your job over some kids ?
Some game ?
Let me ask you, sir.
Are you prepared to fire me over some kids ?
Some game ?
Collect your personal belongings, Gordon.
Yes, sir, Mr Ducksworth !
Thank you very much, Mr Ducksworth !
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, Mr Ducksworth !
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.
[ Quacking ]
You may have paid for this jersey, sir, but you didn't earn it.
I'll see you in the play-offs.
[ Bell rings ]
- Excuse me.
There are some students here that I'd like to see.
- Who are you ?
I'm their hockey coach.
If you could tell me where l can find each of them, please.
They're in room 223.
- All of them ?
- All of them.
"l will not quack at the principal."
"l will not quack at the principal."
- What do you want ?
- l want to talk to you guys.
- People.
- People, right.
Sit down, please.
All of you.
Okay, don't sit down.
Look, what's done is done.
I want to be your coach again.
You're gonna coach a bunch of losers ?
- No, I want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said ?
You said we didn't deserve to live.
Karp, I was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means ?
- No.
- Okay, then you do.
I didn't mean those things the way they sounded.
You guys know what it's like to be misunderstood, right ?
- Yeah, of course.
We're kids.
- So...
Can you forgive me ?
Can I be your coach again ?
- What about Banks ?
- He can be on the team if he wants.
He should have been with us all year.
It's you guys who were cheated.
Let's forget all that crap !
- We're a team, right ?
- [ Ducks ] Yeah.
I made you guys, and I'm sticking with you.
So, what's it gonna be ?
We can play tomorrow night and still have a shot at the play-offs... or we can forfeit again and the season's over.
Peter, what do you say ?
Well... I guess it would help if we practised first.
All right.
Let me see if I can get you out of detention.
- Yes.
- Take that.
You really quacked at the principal ?
Yeah.
Are we Ducks, or what ?
Yeah !
Look at your mother.
Let's see how it is in ten minutes.
I'm gonna kill you !
Hey.
Wasn't sure if you'd show up.
Yeah, whatever.
- l just want to play hockey.
- Good.
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.
On behalf of the Ducks, I'd like to say welcome.
Cake-eater.
Ooh, the Jess-man, dissin' the new guy !
The Jess-ster !
Shut up, Averman !
[ Averman ] lt's just a joke.
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey doesn't mean you're a real Duck.
- They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
- l bet.
Well, suit up.
I'll see you on the ice.
On your left !
Over here !
I'm open !
Come on, right here !
Up front !
- Up front !
- Pass it to Banks !
Come on !
Do somethin' with it !
Yeah !
All right !
Way to go, Banks !
All right !
Score another one for the Ducks !
[ Ducks talking excitedly ]
Goldberg, you're gonna sit this one out.
What ?
You're pulling the goalie when we're tied ?
Listen, listen, listen !
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.
Okay, Fulton, you're our extra man.
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.
-We pulling the Statue of Liberty play ?
-Yeah ?
No, take your shot.
You may only get one, so it's gotta be good.
- But, coach, one outta one ?
- [ Germaine ] Soft hands, Fulton.
- Concentration, not strength.
- [ Bombay ] That's right !
Okay ?
Let's get the Huskies !
Let's go !
Come on !
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one.
Let's go !
- Get in there !
- Come on !
[ Jesse ] Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot !
Shoot, Fulton, shoot !
We won !
We made the play-offs !
[ Charlie ] Boy, this is great.
[ Connie ] Guys, look, it's the North Stars.
- Oh, man.
- lt's Mike Modano !
- ...
Believe this ?
- Cool !
This is too cool.
I can't believe this.
[ Connie ] This place is humongous.
What are we doing here ?
It's a little play-offs present.
Hey, Gordo !
Gordon Bombay, right ?
- You remember me ?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- l heard you were a farmer.
Actually, I became a lawyer.
But I'm coaching Pee Wee now and this is my team, the Ducks.
- Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
- [ Ducks ] We can see that.
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks !
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.
If you ever want a shot, I'll get you a tryout in the minor league clubs.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, nice seein' ya.
Take it easy.
[ Bombay ] All right, let's have some fun !
* You've got to accentuate the positive *
* Eliminate the negative *
* Latch on to the affirmative *
* Don't mess with Mister ln-between *
* You've got to spread joy up to the maximum *

- Hey !
- Hey !
* Don't you mess with Mister ln-between **
You know, I heard the North Stars wore the same underwear... all through the play-offs last year for luck.
So I'm doin' the same thing.
Hmm.
Maybe I should've cooked.
You know, I'm thinkin' maybe we can all go down to the winter festival tonight.
- All three of us ?
- Sure.
I don't think I should, 'cause I got a lot of homework.
You should go.
With my mom.
By yourselves.
[ Door slams ]
Mmm, smells great !
Hello.
[ Whispering ] Go for it.
Hi.
[ Casey ] I don't know how they sculpt these.
Hmm, I wonder.
I used to sculpt, but now I do mostly paintings.
How do you think they do the details ?
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.
Oh.
I'm nervous.
I'm rambling on and on here.
You probably think I'm weird.
No, I think you're great.
When I was a little girl, I used to pretend that that was an ice castle.
And that was my room, that window right up there.
And last winter I gave Charlie that one.
What about me ?
Which window's mine ?
I want to live there too.
What ?
What did I say ?
- lt's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy ?
Casey, I was just playin' around.
Look, I don't know how you feel about me.
I don't even know how I feel about you.
But I do know there's a little kid back home... who's absolutely falling in love with his coach... and if you can't deal with that, if you're just playing around, then you better let me know.
What are we talking ?
'Til death do us part ?
- l have to decide on the first date ?
- Stop it, Gordon.
Charlie's gonna be there when we get back.
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.
Look, I can take it.
But if Charlie gets too attached --
Every time this happens, it gets... a little rougher on him.
Just on him ?
I'm glad to be here with you.
Me too.
[ Announcer ] The surprising Ducks are still in this game... against the Hornets.
Banks moving right in front, stops.
He shoots, he scores !
It's getting rough out there between the Ducks and the Hornets.
Here's Adam Banks in the slot.
He stops, shoots.
He scores !
Back it goes to Averman.
He shoots !
Score !
The ducks win it, 5-3 over the Hornets.
And now it's on to the semifinals... where the Ducks will face the Cardinals.
What a game so far, ladies and gentlemen !
The Ducks and the Cardinals !
Cardinals with it in their own zone, tryin' to clear it out.
Pass to the blue line, intercepted by the Ducks.
Here's their star, Adam Banks.
Banks has great speed.
Right down the middle!
Goes around one man with a great move !
Steps around another defender !
He scores !
Come on !
Come on, Jesse !
[ Announcer ] Ducks with it again.
Here's Averman, now getting it over to Banks.
Germaine is right in the slot.
Germaine with it !
He shoots, he scores !
Germaine put it off the goaltender's glove into the net !
And that does it !
The Ducks have won !
Can you believe it ?
4-2, and the Ducks now get set to face the Hawks in the state finals.
[ Reilly ] All right, it's up to you, Gordon.
Now, you miss this shot, you're not just letting your team down, you're letting me down too.
Remember, it's not worth playing - lf you can't win.
- That's right.
Okay, son, let's go.
Let's go, son !
[ Yelling ]
* ...
Oh, say does that star-spangled *
* Banner yet wave *
* O'er the land of the free *
* And the home of the brave **
- Let's go !
- Let's go !
All right !
[ Announcer ] Welcome to the Minnesota State Pee Wee Championship.

Quack, quack, quack, quack !
Go...
Ducks !
Let's go !
[ Cheering ]
[ Booing ]
Hey, Banks.
Don't forget what side you're on.
He's a Duck, Jesse.
He'll play like a Duck.
[ Announcer ] And the game is underway, and right off Larson and McGill with a heavy hit.
That gives you an indication of what you're going to see tonight.
[ Reilly ] Good hit !
That's the way I want you guys to play it !
The Ducks in green chasing it down against --
A hard hit out at centre ice !
Keep it away from 'em !
Come on, Banks !
Heavy hitting continues in this championship game.
Banks up the centre ice.
He drives it down into the Hawks' zone.
Back in again to Larson, the man behind the net.
Go, go, go !
Get it out of there !

Hawks with a 1-0 lead, come back to centre ice.
Larson gives it up to McGill.
Here's McGill, inside, the lead at centre ice.
He's up on the blue line and around the net.
And he scores !
And now the Hawks lead 2-0.
Good save, Goldberg !
All right, all right !
That's the kind of hockey... I want to see played all day, boys.
Larson stopped at the blue line, but the Ducks can't clear it out.
McGill to Brown, left side.
He shoots !
He scores !
The Hawks lead late in the first period, 3-0.
Don't be scared of them, Ducks.
That's what they want.
Keep your heads up.
Play proud.
- Let's fly !
Come on, let's go !
- [ Ducks cheering ]
[ Reilly ] All right, pressure, boys.
Pressure, pressure !
All right, hold it, hold it.
I want you to drop Banks like a bad habit. I want him outta the game.
- Finish him off.
You got it ?
- Yeah.
Okay, boys, let's go.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right !
Face-off for the second period, and the Hawks win the draw.
They get it back to Stickler.

Adam, are you okay ?
- What'd you do ?
- My job.
Okay, we need the paramedics in.
He's injured.
Oh, my God.
Come on, son, let's go.
Come on.
Number seven, McGill.
Cross-checking.
Two minutes.
[ Hawk ] Don't worry, guys.
Did it go in ?
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favour.
Kick some Hawk butt.
All right, cake-eater.
He'll be okay, sir.
We need to take some X rays, though.
Hell of a job, son.
They score against us, they're gonna pay the price.
Now, don't worry.
We're gonna get that one back.
You got somethin' to say to me, Bombay ?
To think I wasted all those years worrying about what you thought.
You're goin' down, Reilly.
- Let me go after 'em, coach.
Let me get 'em.
- No, we're better than that.
Look, look, it's time to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.
-All right ?
Now we got the power play.
-[ Ducks ] Yeah.
All right.
We're gonna hit 'em where it hurts the most: up there.
Fulton, you're in.
- Coach, they'll be rushing' him.
- Right.
Jesse, make sure you give Fulton plenty of time.
- Right, coach.
- [ Charlie ] Jesse, do good.
Let's go !
- [ Ducks ] Yeah !
- Hold it !
Wait !
Whoa !
Let's have fun out there.
- [ Ducks ] All right !
- All right !
Let's go !
Let's go !
The Ducks trail 3-1, and now they call on number 44, Fulton Reed...
[ Bombay ] Get the face-off !
[ Announcer ] ...who has a big, booming shot.
And the Ducks get it back to Fulton Reed.
Hall clears the front of the net.
Here's Reed winding.
He scores !
Fulton Reed has scored, and the Ducks are back in the game !
Yeah !
Yeah !
Yes !
Yes !
That's it !
More fun !
More fun !
Of all the sloppy ass -
- Ladies, they don't need our help out there !
Now I want that Fulton Reed covered.
He better not make another shot.
You got it ?
I'm tellin' you, you blow this game and nobody makes the team next year !
All right, get out there !
Quick feet, now !
Quick feet !
The puck comes around, now to Blake on the right side.
Blake through the slot with a backhand.
Scores !
Blake with a backhanded goal, and the Hawks regain the two goal lead at 4-2.
Guys, guys, guys, listen up, listen.
We have got to stay fired up and focused, all right ?
It ain't over 'til it's over.
Tammy, Tommy, let's show these Hawks something really different.
Come here.
All right.
I want you guys to start up here --
Third period and the Ducks trail 4-2, trying desperately to get back in the game.
The Ducks with Tammy and Tommy Duncan on the ice.
Tammy Duncan goes in front of the net, Tommy with the puck.
Tammy's spinning, and the Hawks are just looking at her.
- Come on.
- Come on !
Now !
Tammy Duncan shoots, she scores !
Yes !
Yes !
We're still alive !
[ Crowd booing ] I'm on, coach.
Yes, we're still in there !
He Grabs McGill from behind... and throws him over the boards into the bench.
Now he wants to pick a fight with the entire Hawks team.
Fulton Reed has to be restrained by the referee.
Game misconduct.
You're outta here, son.
I'm off, coach.
He barely touched him.
Oreo line !
I want you to remember what we learned.
- Ducks stick together, right ?
- Yeah !
So let's see it !
Show me the flying "V."
- All right !
- All right !
Let's get a line change !
Let's go !
[ Jesse ] Here we go !
Come on, y'all, let's go !
Come on !
Come on !
Flying "V" !
Jesse Hall goes behind his own net, joined by the rest of his team.
Here they come from behind the net !
It's the flying "V" !
Come on !
Come on !
Terry Hall, with the puck, moves the puck ahead to brother Jesse.
They stay onside the blue line.
Jesse Hall with it, trying to come down the slot.
Moves down the right side, now in front of the net.
Jesse scores !
[ Crowd quacking ]
With the score tied 4-4, the next goal will decide the championship.
Tremendous pressure.
Neither team can afford any mistakes now.
23 seconds left to go in regulation.
Looking for the game-winning goal, here's Morgan moving into the slot.
He shoots and a big save.
Big save, Goldberg !
We'll get 'em in overtime !
Score tied at four.
Now Averman ahead to Charlie Conway.
- Come on, Charlie.
- Conway to centre ice on a breakaway !
Conway moving across the Hawk blue line, down the middle !
He could win the game !
Hey !
Where's the call ?
No time left on the clock, but the referee is calling a penalty shot !
[ Reilly ] What kind of call is that ?
Okay, we've got a penalty shot for the Ducks.
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.
All right, Ducks, who's gonna take it ?
- l think he should take it.
- Me ?
What about Charlie ?
- What about Charlie ?
- All he does is fan.
Let's let him finish what he started.
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.
Come here.
You been practising that triple deke ?
- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.
You may make it, you may not.
But that doesn't matter, Charlie.
What matters is that we're here.
Look around.
Whoever thought we'd make it this far ?
One, two, three.
Triple deke.
Take your best shot.
I believe in you, Charlie, win or lose.
- Thanks, coach.
- Go get 'em.
- All right, Charlie.
- Let's go, Charlie.
Okay, now wait for my signal.
Good luck.
[ Chanting ] Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
[ Chanting ] Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...
Okay, now don't leave your crease before he touches the puck.
Good luck.
[ Blows whistle ]
Come on, Charlie.
Come on, Charlie.

Cake-eater.

Right.
Anything else ?
Yeah.
Have fun out there, coach.
I must be crazy.
A tryout with the minors.
I'm gonna be goin' up against kids half my age.
Just have a good tryout, Gordon.
One step at a time.
Yeah, you're right.
[ Kids hooting ]
Bye. I'll call you when I get there.
Banks is first in line next !
Hey, Ducks !

...The Minnesota Pee Wee Championship is up for grabs.
Both teams playing like there's no tomorrow.
Duluth, in the Hawks'zone, looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.
There's a pass out to the blue line.
Intercepted by Gordon Bombay!
Bombay!
He's got a breakaway.
Across the blue line all alone for a chance to win the game!
He's pulled down from behind by Fox of Duluth.
Fox definitely pulled him down from behind and this could be -
Yes, the referee calls for a penalty shot.
Gordon, it's up to you.
I don't wanna see any goats around after the game.
You got it?
Now, you miss this shot... you're not just lettin' me down, you're lettin' your team down.
Apressure situation he's in now.
The 1973 Pee Wee State Championship now rests... on the little shoulders of number 9, Gordon Bombay.
Gordon!
Gordon!
Let's go, son!
All right!
He hit the goalpost!
What a heartbreaker!
Little Gordon Bombay had the chance -
All my client did was attempt to give you what you wanted!
Isn't that right?
This man put his neck on the line for your greed.
Objection.
Your Honour?
Will both counsellors approach the bench?
What's he doing?
I don't have anything to tell you.
I just wanna make a point.
So nod like I'm saying something important.
- Mr. Bombay?
- Gordon, what are you doing?
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.
This drives him nuts and I love it.
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya?
Oh, Mr. Bombay, I'm so glad you could make it.
Please restrict yourself to a relevant cross-examination!
Your Honour, the applicability of societal intent... vis-a-vis individual action is well established.
I'm citing Minneapolis V. Higgins.
The appellant court overruled a judge who disallowed similar testimony.
Now, if I'm not mistaken, that was... you.
Wasn't it,Judge Weathers?
I stand corrected, counsellor.
Objection overruled.
Oh,you really stooped to an all-time low on this, Bombay.
I'm insulted, Frank.
You have no idea how low I can stoop.
I don't mind losing.
I would just like to lose fair.
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.
And what about justice?
That man should be in jail.
It was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me!
Next time do your job, Frankie boy.
- 30 and 0!
I remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case?
We don't count that one because I scored with the court reporter.
- The one you said had the intelligent body?
- That's the one.
- No calls on the Duck phone?
- Not yet.
What's he waiting for?
I saw him in the back of the courtroom.
How about some kudos here, huh?
Mr. Tolbert dropped off ringside seats for tonight's North Stars game.
Hockey?
Forget it!
Gordon, here's the research for the Pearlstein Project.
- Can you get started?
- Jane!
Can't you see I'm reveling here?
Today I'm 30 and 0!
- 30 and one.
- Type,Jeannie, don't speak.
Mr. Bombay's office.
Yes.
It's Ducksworth.
You're right.
He wants to see you.
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
It was nothing, Mr. Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth.
Gordon, another fine job today.
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.
Score.
Don't spike.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean, sir.
This is a business.
It isn't a game.
Next time a little restraint might be in order.
~Hey, man, get off my back I'm doin'the best I can,yeah ~
~ You bust my neck Cut no slack ~
- ~Forget your fellow man Yeah yeah uh-huh ~
- Pull your vehicle over to the right, now!
- This is not good.
- ~ Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah ~
- Licence, please.
- Could you turn down the stereo?
- Sure.
I guess it was a "widdle" noisy.
A "widdle"?
Okay, I'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine?
No, thanks, I'm full.
Okay, out of the car.
Now.
The charges against Mr. Bombay are driving under the influence, driving with an open container and reckless endangerment.
And to think I almost stayed home this morning.
I assume you're representing yourself?
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a licence?
Okay, let's talk business.
What am I facing?
Suspension of licence?
Fines?
What?
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow you to plead guilty to lesser charges.
But that's solely up to the prosecutor.
The city of Minneapolis does not wish to pursue a plea bargain in this case.
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo?
The defendant is released on his own recognizance.
Mr. Ducksworth.
What are you doing here?
I own the place.
How about you?
Just goin' over a few cases.
RICOH Statute stuff.
Oh, I thought you might be researching your defence... against D.U.I. and reckless endangerment.
Did you think I wouldn't find out, Gordon?
There was no reason to concern you with it, sir.
They have no case.
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp.
I found a loophole.
I'm gonna plead not guilty -
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.
There's not going to be a trial.
I am not going to have you drag... this firm's good name through the mud.
I've talked toJudge Weathers and he has agreed to suspend your case.
- Under what conditions?
- Probation, suspension of your driver's licence... and 500 hours of community service.
And a leave of absence from the firm.
A leave of absence?
He can't do that.
- He can't stop me from working!
- He's not.
I am.
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.
It'll teach you compassion, a sense of fair play, how to fit in.
- Community service?
This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.
And hopefully you'll come back a better person and a better attorney, which is why I'm keeping you on salary and have arranged a driver for you.
You know, in the early '7 Os I drove the tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties, amps cranked up to about eight jillion decibels.
All that loud music damaged my hearing, but I got no regrets...
- except for the '80s.
- How could he do this to me?
Community service...
coaching hockey!
I found one!
I'm comin' out!
Karp,you finally found something for once in your life.
Dumpster Dave comes through!
- What do you think?
- Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.
- You gonna take that from him, Karp?
- Remind me to bust you, Averman.
- Thanks, Peter.
Thanks very much.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah!
Right there!
- Yeah!
Here, Petie.
Here, boy.
A little chili to keep you warm, buddy.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look!
I can't believe he ate the can too.
He sniffs.
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.
He sniffs some more.
He stops.
I think this is it!
He's turnin' in a circle.
- He squats!
He scores!
- Yes!
We did it!
Full load.
Stinks!
Come on, come on, give me the dollar!
- Hurry it up already.
- I'm hurrying', okay?
- Go, go, go, go!
- Yeah!
All right!
Let's do it!
Oh, come on.
Stop!
- Yes!
- Okay!
Here we go.
Yeah.
There's more inside.
He's takin'off with it.
This guy deserves what he gets.
Oh, guys, he saw us.
Oh, my!
Rink's gotta be around here someplace.
Just look for a sign that says " Personal Hell. "
How could he do this to me?
I hate kids.
They're barely human.
Come on!
Over here!
Keep it down, please!
Hey, come on.
There's no need for this.
Let's talk, come on.
I'm your friend, aren't I?
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to stop it.
I'm tired of chasing' the puck.
Be careful, man.
It almost hit me that time.
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
It's supposed to hit you.
Does that sound stupid to anyone else?
Good God.
That's the hockey team.
Drive out on the ice.
It'll be all right.
I ain't scared.
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.
We're gonna get in big trouble.
- I'll take care of it.
- They're drugs, I just know it.
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.
This is my dominion.
This is a drug-free zone, you understand?
We ain't buying' nothin'.
I'm feelin' generous today.
So I'm gonna let you get your sorry vanilla bootie outta here... before we be usin' your eyeballs as hockey pucks.
Thanks, bro, but I'm not goin' home 'til I take care of business.
He's got a gun.
Stand back.
Whew!
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.
I'm Gordon Bombay.
I'm the new coach.
What a joke!
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.
Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.
Here's the long and the short of it.
I hate hockey and I don't like kids.
What's this supposed to be, a pep talk?
I'm sure this'll be a real bonding experience.
Maybe one day one of you will even write a book about it in jail.
- Funny.
- Is there a goalie?
Only for a little while.
I'm movin' back to Philly.
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.
Uh,just so you know.
We really suck.
I'll decide who sucks around here.
- Get off me.
- They really suck.
The Pete-meister.
Mr. Rabble-rouser.
Passing the puck over toJesse-roonie, the enforcer.
Ouch!
That hurt!
Oh, it's the Connie-meister, the velvet hammer.
Hi, coach.
I'm Connie.
- Do you play?
- No.
So what's our record anyway?
0 and 9.
One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.
We almost scored a goal too.
So what do we do now... coach?
- What did your old coach have you do?
- He just yelled a lot.
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm?
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us, " Little bastards, where'd you learn to play?
Oh, you suck, you!
Skate, you little bast-"
Heart attack.
Great.
All right, look.
I gotta make a phone call.
Keep scrimmaging.
You, you, you, you and you against you four.
- We got names, you know?
- I'm sure you do.
And I'll bet they're very nice names.
I might even learn 'em.
For now, I'll be in my office.
Oh, and if you need anything, fax me.
Geez, what a jerk.
Where do they find these coaches anyways?
We're impressionable kids, right?
Shouldn't we check his qualifications or somethin'?
Jeannie, who told you not to give me my messages?
Ducksworth!
Then who's handling my cases?
- On three!
- Jane!
- One, two, three!
Charge!
- Are you kidding me?
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to -
Hold on a second!
Hey!
Get your mouth off the windows!
- Hey!
- Get off there!
Get off the car!
- We're being invaded!
- Get off!
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool!
- Is that a real phone?
- Yes, and I'm really on it.
- Not any more.
- Thank you.
- Let's see, who should I -
- Watch the upholstery.
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
- We wanna ride!
- I could kill one of'em just to set an example.
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything!
This looks good.
I'm gonna eat it.
- Wow, I feel like Madonna.
- You wish!
Seats ten comfortably.
Hey, pass me one of those glasses.
Yeah, I see your point.
Oh.
Goldberg!
- It wasn't me, all right!
- Young man, what did you eat?
- Nothing!
It wasn't me!
- Open a window!
Oh, man!
It's my mom!
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.
All right, out!
Everybody, out of the car right now.
Goldberg, why'd you have to ruin the fun?
Are you out of your mind?
What were you thinking putting that car on the ice?
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take.
One crack!
- The ice is not gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
- The new coach?
They send you over here to coach the team and you endanger their lives.
What danger?
I grew up on the ice;
I know when it's safe to drive on.
- How do you know?
- I just know!
All right?
Well, listen, Mr. Zen Master, you may be in tune with the ice universe, but when it comes to my kid, "I just know" doesn't cut it.
Charlie, let's go.
- Mom?
- Give me my candy!
All of it!
Well, I guess practise is over.
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- It's all right, Charlie.
Coach, gonna be at the game tomorrow?
By order of the state of Minnesota, yeah.
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
- Hi, girls.
- Karp!
No!
Goodbye.
The hawks.
My first game and it had to be the Hawks.
Gordon?
Gordon Bombay.
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.
Why don't you just call meJack?
Hey, come back to see your old coach, huh?
Well, actually I'm, uh, coaching...
Pee Wee.
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'.
You got a kid on the team or something?
No, I'm here because I need to be of service to the community.
How about this, huh?
Whoever thought we'd be coaching' against each other?
Yeah, who'd have thought?
So, who's your hotshot player this year?
- Anyone good?
- I got a kid named Banks.
Might go all the way.
Not quite as good as you were.
But he wants it more.
Kid won't give up.
Oh, boy,
I wish they would take that one down.
Don't you?
Well, good luck.
You're gonna need it.
It's up to you, Gordon.
You miss this shot, you're not just... letting me down, you're letting your whole team down too.
I wish your dad could be here to see this.
Make him proud of you!
Win!
Win!
Win!
All right, guys, gather round.
Come on, come on.
- Win!
Win!
Win!
- Win.
Win.
Win!
Win!
Win!
- Win?
- Win!
Win!
Win!
Yeah, we're fired up.
All right!
Watch this!
Oh, great.
Good concept, guys.
Nice - ouch!
Nice goin', fool!
- Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
- Oh, yeah, "I didn't mean to. "
Yeah, sure, you're on my own team.
Oh, sorry, Goldberg.
Didn't mean to.
Would you get off me before I clock you?
Let's go,Jesse!
Go, Terry!
Let's go!
Come on in.
What's this?
The Oreo line!
Hey, come on.
Let's play hockey.
Um, batter, batter, hum, batter, batter!
Hey, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Hum, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Averman!
It's hockey!
There's no batter.
Idiot.
Hum, goalie, goalie, hum, goalie, goalie!
Hey, goalie, goalie, save, goalie, goalie!
Hum, goalie, goalie, hey, goalie, goalie!
No, I got him!
I, I, I got him!
That's one!
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy!
Good show.
Sloppy pass.
Way to stuff it, Banks!
All right, all right!
Let's run it up!
Run it up!
Run it up!
Oh, man!
How could you let him get by you?
All right, line change.
Come on, go, go, go.
Hey!
Banks!
Banks!
Banks!
Hey, you!
Come back here!
Oh!
Why me?
How lazy can you be?
They're killing us out there!
How many times do I have to tell you:
Get those rebounds, get your heads up, get those loose pucks.
Get
- Just -
Just get the hell outta here.
All right!
It's Spaz-way.
He'll screw up.
Hey, hey!
Way to play it, Banks!
All right!
That's okay, Charlie!
Nice try!
Nice fan, Charlie.
Keep swingin'.
Maybe you'll give 'em a cold.
Hey, hey, hey, knock it off!
Against this team we should have twice this many!
Now let's run it up!
Remember it's not worth winning if you can't win big!
All right!
Guys!
No!
Come on, let's talk about this!
Be civilized!
Come on!
Please!
Oh no, guys!
Come on, not again!
Please!
Just take the goal.
Fine!
I don't care!
- I'm so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.
All right!
Hey, knock it off!
That was a lousy third period.
Anybody could beat these pansies.
I want you guys to stay hungry out there!
All right, nice goin', Banks.
New Hawks record.
- Okay, boys.
Let's go.
- All right!
Hey, Gordon!
Nice game.
I enjoyed it thoroughly.
At least I can handle the puck!
Hey, shut up!
You guys stink!
I thought we came here to play hockey.
You know, I knew we forgot something.
Oh, you think it's funny?
You think losing is funny?
Well, not at first, but once you get the hang of it.
We're the ones out there gettin' our butts kicked.
Yeah, it's not like you coach us or anything.
At least we try.
You didn't listen to a word I said.
I said, keep your heads up.
You put your heads down.
I said, hustle.
You went slower!
That was the sloppiest playing I've ever seen.
Why the hell don't you just listen to me?
Why the hell should we?
I don't care.
You want to lose, fine.
You're the ones who look like idiots out there.
Great game!
Hans?
I don't believe it!
Who would throw these away?
- First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
- Fork it over.
Forget it, Karp.
I can see this every day on MTV.
This one's from Minneapolis.
Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom.
- Let's give him a wedgie.
- Good idea,Jesse!
I was just kidding, okay?
Hey!
Give that back!
- Hi, girls.
- Does your mommy know you have that?
Nah, she's busy with the mailman.
That'll make great bathroom reading.
That's mine, you jerk!
I found it!
You don't even know what to do with it, wuss-breath.
- You gonna let him call you wuss-breath?
- No!
Hey!
Hey!
- Oh!
- Come on.
Want some more?
You guys want some more?
Come on!
Yeah!
You want some more?
Come on!
Let's get out!
Move it!
- Thanks a lot.
- All right, man.
One, two, three!
Boom!
What are you laughing at, cream cheese boy?
Go!
If we're gonna cheat, we gotta make those falls look real.
Keep it up!
Whoa!
Score one for the spirit.
Go at him!
Go at him!
Good!
Go at him!
Come on, get angry!
Oh!
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt!
I am hurt.
Good, good.
Now say it again!
Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
- One more time!
- Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
Good!
You guys are ready.
Give me a break, ref!
Open your eyes!
Did you see what he did to me?
Goldberg, you don't take the fall while they're shooting at you.
Oh!
Well, I guess you didn't explain that very well, did ya?
- District Five!
- I throw myself on the ice -
Cut the acting class.
One more dive, I forfeit to theJets!
What?
I'm insulted by that!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
- Quit it!
Face-off!
Let's go!
Charlie!
That guy is twice your size.
The next time he gets you in a corner like that,
I want you to grab your eye like it's cut and then hit the ice!
- Got it?
Let's go.
- Let's go!
Face-off!
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
Here we go.
Hey -
- Come on!
- That's it, Charlie.
- That's it, Charlie!
- Come on!
Damn it, Charlie!
We can't even win when we cheat.
- Stupid cake-eater tricks!
- That was embarrassing.
Charlie!
What the hell is the matter with you?
When I tell you to do something, you do it!
You got it?
Look at me.
- You got it?
- You can't make me cheat.
Jesse, Terry, let's go.
This is what I gave up my overtime pay for?
To see my kids takin' falls?
Gordon.
- How did you know?
- Through the back door at this time of night.
Just like you used to.
You'd spend hours watching me do this.
What do you think?
Is this sharp enough?
Ow!
- Did you cut yourself?
- No.
You always fell for that.
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, I'm Scandinavian.
- It's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.
You probably thought I was dead.
I saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything?
You were so busy screaming at the kids.
I didn't want to spoil the moment.
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.
Why should my store?
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that?
Well, I hardly ever lose a case.
That is not what I asked.
Hmm!
I see you still have this up.
- Thanks very much.
- It is important to remember the past.
I'd just as soon forget it.
That was the worse time in my life.
My dad died that year.
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.
I found this not long ago.
He was proud of you.
I miss him.
You scored 198 goals in that season, Gordon.
It's a shame you quit.
You -
- Could have gone all the way.
Yeah.
- No!
You really loved to play.
You remember?
You remember... you used to play on the ponds until after dark, until your father called you back.
You really flew on that ice, Gordon.
That's all I ever wanted to do.
Then why did you stop?
Reilly?
I saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.
- The guy wins.
- It's not about winning.
It never was.
Just show they how to play.
Show them how to have fun.
Teach them to fly.
That is what they'll remember long after you've gone back to being a doctor.
Lawyer.
And long after they've stopped buying skates from me.
Here... there you are.
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.
- What's this?
- Your new skates.
That is why you came here tonight, isn't it?
- I figured nine and a half was your size.
- Actually, I'm a nine.
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.
Here comes Bombay on an end-to-end rush.
Past the blue line, past centre.
He's not skating, he's flying!
He fakes once, he fakes twice.
Fakes three times!
Shoots!
Scores!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
What a play!
What a guy!
Gordon Bombay does it again!
Great move, Gordy!
You faked him out of his pads.
Come here, son.
You look great out there.
Come on, let's go inside, get something to eat.
A few more minutes?
Please?
- Go on.
Get outta here.
- Thanks.
- Hi, uh -
- Please,just go away.
Charlie doesn't want... to be on the team any more, and neither he nor I have anything to say to you.
- Well, I have something to say to you.
- Oh, really?
Door-to-door mistreatment now.
Now the team can feel miserable between games too, huh?
I came to apologize to Charlie...
to both of you.
- What?
- Apologize.
Well... you should.
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin'?
I was just, uh, walkin' around thinkin' and, uh -
Wanna give us a minute?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Listen, it was very wrong of me... to ask you and the other guys to cheat.
I never should have said to you what I said to you.
I was angry.
I was frustrated.
It took a lot of guts for you to do what you knew was right.
I admire that.
And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that, uh, that I'm -
Oh, boy, this is difficult.
- I'm -
- You're sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right?
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be a lot more fun this time around.
What do you say?
Do you want to stay for dinner?
- What?
- Charlie!
Uh, no, I - I can't.
Uh -
Well, what are you havin'?
Mr. Ducksworth, there are two reasons I came by.
First off, I want to let you know things are going well.
I'm learning a lot about teamwork, fair play and all that junk.
Good, good.
And the second thing?
Well, sir, fair play doesn't come cheap.
These kids, my team, have no money.
They can't afford rink time, safe equipment, proper uniforms, which makes it difficult for them to compete.
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old and stepping out onto that ice... with old copies of the " Enquirer" taped to your shins instead of pads.
The point I'm trying to make, sir, is that you wouldn't be taken seriously and neither are these kids.
So I thought maybe the firm could help 'em out.
How much are we talking about?
- $15,000.
- No way.
Wait a minute.
Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross, the firm that gives back to the community.
Come on.
I'll get you your own jersey.
~ Ooo,yeah ~
~ Can you feel it baby Ooo ~
~I can too, Ooo ~
~ Ooo ~
~ Ooo, come on swing ~
~ Come on swing ~
~ Come on swing ~
~ C-Come on swing Ooo ~
~ Ooo ~
~It's such a good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
~It's such a good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
Who is that kid?
Thanks, Fulton.
- Fulton Reed.
He's in one of my classes.
- How come he's not on the team?
He only plays football.
Some preppie school gave him a scholarship... as long as he doesn't play hockey.
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- I heard it was colleges.
He's been accepted to four of'em.
- Yeah, but I heard he's got to repeat the sixth grade.
- Ah, shut up.
Gordon Bombay?
Bombay was a Hawk.
~...
Good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
~Feel the vibration It's such a good vibration ~~
Dude, check 'em out, man.
Holy cow.
- They're pretty good skaters.
- Anybody know who they are?
That's Tommy Duncan.
He's in my science class.
That's his sister, Tammy.
- Think they'd want to play hockey with us?
- Yeah!
Go get dressed.
I'll do the negotiating.
Just think of it as figure skating... with a stick.
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy!
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive!
Mom isn't gonna like this at all.
So what?
You want me to figure skate, then you gotta play hockey.
What do I know about hockey?
More than you think.
Back to basics!
Skating!
Go!
Go!
Side to side.
Shift your weight.
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.
That's okay, Charlie.
Soft hands.
You don't shoot the puck to your teammate.
You sail it to him.
Karp, on your feet.
- You send it.
- Oh!
Gross!
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it.
Cradle it.
- Oh!
- Again!
Concentration, not strength.
Like the Karate Kid, right?
"Wax on!
Wax off!"
Just shut up and try it, Averman!
- You're such a jerk.
- Send it back, Averman.
Good, Averman.
Charlie.
That's good.
Good.
Now sail it back.
Oh!
Way to go!
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.
Oh!
Here it comes.
Nice and easy.
Good.
- I did it!
I did it!
- All right.
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.
- But when are you gonna work with me in goal?
- Goldberg, do you trust me?
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar mitzvah'd.
This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.
Coach, I think you got the ceremonies mixed up.
It's more like a circumcision.
Coach!
Will you come back here?
What'd I ever do to you, man?
District Five!
Ready!
Oh, man, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
- Aim!
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.
- Oh, please!
No!
- Fire!
I wanna go home!
This doesn't hurt!
You wimps!
Give me your best shot!
Oh!
Come on!
That's good!
Hex goal!
Goalie boot save!
Whoa!
Nice shot, man!
I'm a dog!
I'm a crazed dog!
Come on!
Goldberg!
Goldberg!
I am Goldberg!
The goalie!
Good!
Good!
All right, Charlie!
Good hustle!
Conway, way to go.
All right, Karp!
- You guys hungry?
Tired?
- Yeah!
- Do you ache?
Are you pumped up?
- Yeah!
Good!
That was a hell of a practise.
Be proud of yourself.
Hey, guys!
Excuse me, guys!
You gotta untie me now!
Ha-ha!
Good joke.
Very funny.
I like it.
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach!
Coach, come on, don't leave me hangin' like this!
Coach, don't make me come after you, coach.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Thanks for the ride.
You did real well in practise today, Charlie.
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad?
Mom and I left him.
I don't really remember, but that's what she says.
You know, when I was a boy, I had to take care of my mother too.
Really?
What happened to your dad?
He passed away.
You do a good job takin' care of your mom.
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right?
- Okay.
We'll see ya.
- Okay.
Hey, coach.
- What's that?
- Huh?
- Oh!
- Victory!
You've just entered the tickling zone!
So I'm right in the middle of my cross-examination and I say to the guy,
I usually defend heels like you, you scuzzy, mole-faced rat.
That's a good one, sir.
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Look, it was an accident, all right?
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
I didn't learn.
I just do it.
Do it again.
Yargh!
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal?
Yeah.
Well, one out of five.
Fulton, is it true what they say?
About the scholarships and how they won't let you play hockey?
People talk.
It don't mean nothin'.
- Why don't you play for us?
- I can't.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I can't.
- You afraid?
- No, I mean I can't, you moron.
I don't know how to skate.
Whoa!
Is that all that's stoppin' ya?
~I ride the top of the line I can't settle for less ~
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.
Side to side, good!
Follow me.
Aaah!
Watch it!
Get out of the way!
Sorry!
~ This is all we got baby It's got to be enough ~
~I'd like to try to quit But I don't know how ~
~I needed it then and baby I need it right now ~
Come on, Fulton.
Let's go!
- ~I gotta keep movin' 'til I'm satisfied ~
- Hey!
~ Come on, Come on It's gonna be all right ~~
The Ducks?
We're the Ducks?
Man, what brain-dead jerk came up with that name?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But I didn't have a choice.
We're being sponsored.
By who?
Donald and Daisy?
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks?
You'd rather be District Five?
Some stupid number?
Better than some stupid animal.
I'll have you know, Peter, that the Duck is one of the most noble, agile and intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom.
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.
Neither do hockey players.
Have you guys ever seen a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation?
It's beautiful.
Pretty awesome the way they all stick together.
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight?
No way.
Why?
Because the other animals are afraid.
They know that if they mess with one duck, they gotta deal with the whole flock.
Oh, man!
I'm proud to be a duck.
And I'd be proud to fly with any one of you.
So how about it?
Who's a Duck?
I'll be a Duck.
Yeah.
Me too.
Anybody see Goldberg?
All right!
Now we're the Ducks!
The Mighty Ducks!
- What are we?
- The Ducks!
What the hell are they doing?
Every time you get the puck, you're the quarterback.
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.
Come on, guys.
This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.
What a weird-ass team.
How you doin'?
- You ready?
- I think so.
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.
My God!
Wow!
One out of five.
All right, Let's forget the past.
We lost a few games, tough!
That was District Five.
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right!
Yeah!
Quack, quack.
- Quack.
Quack.
- Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Go...
Ducks!
What the hell was that?
Let's go, Ducks!
Defence!
Defence!
Dig it outta there!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Let's go, Ducks!
Throw it!
Throw it!
To the crease!
Yes!
The Oreo line!
That's my boy!
Defence, Karp!
Defence!
Come on.
I don't wanna go to school today, Mom.
- How many fingers am I holding' up?
- He wouldn't know.
Shut up, Peter.
Karp, are you okay?
- Look at this.
- The Karp-ster used his head to stop the puck.
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.
Get him on the bench, Charlie.
Okay, Ducks, we still got a chance here.
Connie, Terry,Jesse, Guy, time for the secret weapon.
Okay, Fulton.
Remember,just like we talked about.
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.
Oh, no.
- Go!
Get the face-off!
- Line up, boys, let's go.
That's it.
Aaah!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Yeah!
That tie of yours might be what you need to make the play-offs.
- The ducks have a shot at the play-offs?
- Sure.
Everyone but the last two teams are in, remember?
Panthers got the measles and they forfeited the season.
So,you beat the Huskies and you'll make the play-offs.
- Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
- So?
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since I played.
Actually, one little thing has changed.
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.
They redrew the district lines last year.
The lake is not the boundary any more.
You see?
You'd be a Duck.
I'd be a Duck.
Excuse me.
Coach Reilly?
- Yeah?
- I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.
- What's that?
- One of your players is ineligible.
Banks!
Over here!
- This is a joke, right?
- I'm afraid it's no joke.
- Problem?
- No,just a mistake.
Are you this boy's father?
450 North Hennipen, is that your address?
- Yes.
- I'm afraid there's no mistake.
- This boy is playing for the wrong team.
- What?
According to league rules, Adam Banks should be playing for District Five.
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- Is this your doing, Gordon?
I'll expect to see him at our next game.
- We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
- No way.
My son would rather not play than play for your team.
Fine, if that's the way you want it.
But remember, if Adam plays for the Hawks, you'll forfeit every game for the rest of the season.
Boy, I'd hate to see that.
Look, I'm sorry this had to happen, but you can see on the map.
Gordon?
Hey, Bombay!
You stop when I'm talking to you, son!
What's the idea here?
You trying to sabotage me or what?
The law's a bitch when it works against you, isn't it,Jack?
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.
Even with Banks, what do you think you're gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers?
That's right, coach.
They are losers.
We hate losers, don't we?
They don't even deserve to live.
Maybe Banks won't make a difference, but at least we're playing by the rules.
Why'd you turn against me, Gordon?
For six years...
I taught ya how to skate, I taught ya how to score.
I taught ya how to go for the "W."
You could have been one of the greats.
And now look at yourself.
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.
Going to the play-offs!
Whoo!
One win!
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.
All right, everyone, listen up.
I got some good news.
We're getting a new player, Adam Banks.
What?
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.
- We don't need him.
- I'm the coach.
I say we do need him.
- If we make it to the play-offs, he could be a big help.
- If?
All of a sudden you don't think we're good enough.
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.
- What?
- We heard what you said.
You said we were losers, we didn't deserve to live.
- That's not what I meant.
- I saw that picture of you missing that goal.
You were a Hawk, weren't you?
Guess you guys stick together to the end.
You know what?
I don't need your stinkin'equipment.
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.
- I'm talkin' to you, son!
- Forget it, cake-eater.
If you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.
Where do you guys think you're goin'?
I don't believe this.
All right, I'm goin' up to the bench because that's where I'm supposed to be.
Anyone who wants to join me can join me.
Anyone who doesn't -
Well -
Ten minutes to game time, coach.
Yeah, yeah, they'll be out in a minute.
They're, you know, working themselves into a frenzy.
Not much of a frenzy.
We forfeit.
Ducks forfeit.
Flames, you win.
Hey.
Can I sit?
Sure.
You talk to the guys?
I tried.
They think I'm a traitor for even showing up.
I guess they really hate me, huh?
Is it true you were really a Hawk?
Yeah.
Peter said you blew a really big game once.
Yeah, well, Peter's right.
It was the last game of the state finals.
We were tied 2-2 in the end of the third period.
I get a penalty shot.
I go in, I triple deke.
I fake the goalie right out of his pads.
The puck's headed in, and then...
Clang!
Hits the post.
We lost in overtime.
A quarter of an inch this way and it would have gone in.
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way and you'd have missed completely.
I never thought of it that way.
At least you got to play in a championship game.
- That must've been so cool.
- Hey.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
I'd love one.
You know, she has many fine qualities that men find attractive.
I know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.
So, what kind of guys does she usually date?
Jerks.
I mean, most of them like her, but as soon as they catch a glimpse of me -
Pow!
Warp speed!
They are gone!
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, I wouldn't even care... except it's not fair to my mom.
She deserves somebody nice.
Are you gonna come over for dinner again?
I don't know, Charlie.
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
See, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I, um, talked toJesse and Terry's dad, and he's gonna take over coaching for the rest of the year.
- You're quitting?
- I'm stepping aside to keep the team together.
The guys can't play for somebody they don't trust.
I trust you.
The other guys do too.
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.
- I've done all I can.
- No, you haven't.
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.
We are too!
We weren't even the Ducks until you came along.
You made us and now you're stuck with us.
Charlie.
That's right.
The red is oxygen.
Now what are the blue balls?
- Tommy?
- Hydrogen?
Is correct.
Now put them together... and you have a molecule that makes up 96% of your body.
- What is it?
- Pizza?
It's the principal.
I'll be right back.
Work on H2 CO3.
It's a goody.
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way?
- Yeah, did you score?
Leave me alone, guys.
I don't want to talk about the team.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.
Everybody knows he likes you best.
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp!
Take it back now!
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl!
- Lay off!
- Don't shove, Peter.
Atoms away!
My atoms!
You!
Sit!
Sit now!
In your seats now!
I have never in my life -
What have you got to say for yourselves?
Quack.
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!
Thanks for coming by on such short notice, Gordon.
By the way, your court release came through.
- Congratulations.
Your community service is over.
- You're kidding.
So you wanted to talk about my coming back to work then?
- Well, actually -
- Oh, you got your jersey.
Great!
A lot's been happening.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.
Gordon, you know Coach Reilly and Mr. Banks.
Sir, they're the bad guys.
No, actually, Phil is one of my oldest friends.
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together here to try to work out this little problem.
You see, my son Adam wants to play for the Hawks.
His older brother was a Hawk.
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.
It's a tradition.
You understand that, Gordon.
You played.
But the league's already ruled on it.
We've talked to the league, and we worked out a little deal.
- You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League?
- Yes, we did.
The long and short of it is that Adam stays on the Hawks for the rest of the season.
And then next year, they redraft the lines.
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.
What's that?
That you withdraw your protest.
- That's great.
- Good, good.
Well, that's settled then.
No, sir, you don't understand.
I can't withdraw my protest.
- What?
- Mr. Ducksworth, you wanted me to learn about fair play... and how to be part of a team... and I may not have learned everything yet, but I remember something my father said to me.
A team isn't a bunch of kids out to win.
A team is something you belong to, something you feel, something you have to earn.
And I'm not gonna let those kids down.
Gordon, I'm going to make this simple.
Are you prepared to lose your job over some kids?
Some game?
Let me ask you, sir.
Are you prepared to fire me over some kids?
Some game?
Collect your personal belongings, Gordon.
Yes, sir, Mr. Ducksworth!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth!
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.
You may have paid for this jersey, sir, but you didn't earn it.
I'll see you in the play-offs.
- Excuse me.
There are some students here that I'd like to see.
- Who are you?
I'm their hockey coach.
If you could tell me where I can find each of them, please.
They're in room 223.
- All of them?
- All of them.
"I will not quack at the principal. "
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you guys.
- People.
- People, right.
Sit down, please.
All of you.
Okay, don't sit down.
Look, what's done is done.
I want to be your coach again.
You're gonna coach a bunch of losers?
- No, I want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said?
You said we didn't deserve to live.
Karp, I was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means?
- No.
- Okay, then you do.
I didn't mean those things the way they sounded.
You guys know what it's like to be misunderstood, right?
- Yeah, of course.
We're kids.
- So...
Can you forgive me?
Can I be your coach again?
- What about Banks?
- He can be on the team if he wants.
He should have been with us all year.
It's you guys who were cheated.
Let's forget all that crap!
- We're a team, right?
- Yeah.
I made you guys, and I'm sticking with you.
So, what's it gonna be?
We can play tomorrow night and still have a shot at the play-offs... or we can forfeit again and the season's over.
Peter, what do you say?
Well...
I guess it would help if we practised first.
All right.
Let me see if I can get you out of detention.
- Yes.
- Take that.
You really quacked at the principal?
Yeah.
Are we Ducks, or what?
Yeah!
Look at your mother.
Let's see how it is in ten minutes.
I'm gonna kill you!
Hey.
Wasn't sure if you'd show up.
Yeah, whatever.
- I just want to play hockey.
- Good.
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.
On behalf of the Ducks, I'd like to say welcome.
Cake-eater.
Ooh, theJess-man, dissin'the new guy!
TheJess-ster!
Shut up, Averman!
It's just a joke.
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey doesn't mean you're a real Duck.
- They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
- I bet.
Well, suit up.
I'll see you on the ice.
On your left!
Over here!
I'm open!
Come on, right here!
Up front!
- Up front!
- Pass it to Banks!
Come on!
Do somethin' with it!
Yeah!
All right!
Way to go, Banks!
All right!
Score another one for the Ducks!
Goldberg, you're gonna sit this one out.
What?
You're pulling the goalie when we're tied?
Listen, listen, listen!
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.
Okay, Fulton, you're our extra man.
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.
- We pulling the Statue of Liberty play?
- Yeah?
No, take your shot.
You may only get one, so it's gotta be good.
- But, coach, one outta one?
- Soft hands, Fulton.
- Concentration, not strength.
- That's right!
Okay?
Let's get the Huskies!
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one.
Let's go!
- Get in there!
- Come on!
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!
Shoot, Fulton, shoot!
We won!
We made the play-offs!
Boy, this is great.
Guys, look, it's the North Stars.
- Oh, man.
- It's Mike Modano!
- ...
Believe this?
- Cool!
This is too cool.
I can't believe this.
This place is humongous.
What are we doing here?
It's a little play-offs present.
Hey, Gordo!
Gordon Bombay, right?
- You remember me?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- I heard you were a farmer.
Actually, I became a lawyer.
But I'm coaching Pee Wee now and this is my team, the Ducks.
- Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
- We can see that.
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks!
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.
If you ever want a shot, I'll get you a tryout in the minor league clubs.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, nice seein' ya.
Take it easy.
All right, let's have some fun!

- Hey!
~Don't you mess with Mister In-between ~~
You know, I heard the North Stars wore the same underwear... all through the play-offs last year for luck.
So I'm doin' the same thing.
Hmm.
Maybe I should've cooked.
You know, I'm thinkin' maybe we can all go down to the winter festival tonight.
- All three of us?
- Sure.
I don't think I should, 'cause I got a lot of homework.
You should go.
With my mom.
By yourselves.
Mmm, smells great!
Hello.
Go for it.
Hi.
I don't know how they sculpt these.
Hmm, I wonder.
I used to sculpt, but now I do mostly paintings.
How do you think they do the details?
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.
Oh.
I'm nervous.
I'm rambling on and on here.
You probably think I'm weird.
No, I think you're great.
When I was a little girl, I used to pretend that that was an ice castle.
And that was my room, that window right up there.
And last winter I gave Charlie that one.
What about me?
Which window's mine?
I want to live there too.
What?
What did I say?
- It's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy?
Casey, I was just playin' around.
Look, I don't know how you feel about me.
I don't even know how I feel about you.
But I do know there's a little kid back home... who's absolutely falling in love with his coach... and if you can't deal with that, if you're just playing around, then you better let me know.
What are we talking?
'Til death do us part?
- I have to decide on the first date?
- Stop it, Gordon.
Charlie's gonna be there when we get back.
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.
Look, I can take it.
But if Charlie gets too attached -
Every time this happens, it gets... a little rougher on him.
Just on him?
I'm glad to be here with you.
Me too.
The surprising Ducks are still in this game... against the Hornets.
Banks moving right in front, stops.
He shoots, he scores!
It's getting rough out there between the Ducks and the Hornets.

Germaine put it off the goaltender's glove into the net!
And that does it!
The Ducks have won!
Can you believe it?
4-2, and the Ducks now get set to face the Hawks in the state finals.
All right, it's up to you, Gordon.
Now,you miss this shot, you're not just letting your team down, you're letting me down too.
Remember, it's not worth playing -
- If you can't win.
- That's right.
Okay, son, let's go.
Let's go, son!
~...
Oh, say does that star-spangled ~
~Banner yet wave ~
~ O'er the land of the free ~
~And the home of the brave ~~
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
All right!

Come on.
Number seven, McGill.
Cross-checking.
Two minutes.
Don't worry, guys.
Did it go in?
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favour.
Kick some Hawk butt.
All right, cake-eater.
He'll be okay, sir.
We need to take some X rays, though.
Hell of a job, son.
They score against us, they're gonna pay the price.
Now, don't worry.
We're gonna get that one back.
You got somethin' to say to me, Bombay?
To think I wasted all those years worrying about what you thought.
You're goin' down, Reilly.
- Let me go after 'em, coach.
Let me get 'em.
- No, we're better than that.
Look, look, it's time to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.
- All right?
Now we got the power play.
- Yeah.
All right.
We're gonna hit 'em where it hurts the most: up there.
Fulton, you're in.

- Ladies, they don't need our help out there!
Now I want that Fulton Reed covered.

Game misconduct.
You're outta here, son.
I'm off, coach.
He barely touched him.
Oreo line!
I want you to remember what we learned.
- Ducks stick together, right?
- Yeah!
So let's see it!
Show me the flying "V."
- All right!
- All right!
Let's get a line change!
Let's go!
Here we go!
Come on, y'all, let's go!

What kind of call is that?
Okay, we've got a penalty shot for the Ducks.
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.
All right, Ducks, who's gonna take it?
- I think he should take it.
- Me?
What about Charlie?
- What about Charlie?
- All he does is fan.
Let's let him finish what he started.
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.
Come here.
You been practising that triple deke?
- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.
You may make it, you may not.
But that doesn't matter, Charlie.
What matters is that we're here.
Look around.
Whoever thought we'd make it this far?
One, two, three.
Triple deke.
Take your best shot.
I believe in you, Charlie, win or lose.
- Thanks, coach.
- Go get 'em.
- All right, Charlie.
- Let's go, Charlie.
Okay, now wait for my signal.
Good luck.
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...
Okay, now don't leave your crease before he touches the puck.
Good luck.
Come on, Charlie.

[Announcer] ...
The Minnesota Pee Wee Championship is up for grabs.
Both teams playing like there's no tomorrow.
Duluth, in the Hawks' zone, looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.
There's a pass out to the blue line.
intercepted by Gordon Bombay!
Bombay!
He's got a breakaway.
Across the blue line all alone for a chance to win the game!
He's pulled down from behind by Fox of Duluth.
Fox definitely pulled him down from behind and this could be --
Yes, the referee calls for a penalty shot.
Gordon, it's up to you. I don't wanna see any goats around after the game.
You got it?
Now, you miss this shot... you're not just lettin' me down, you're lettin' your team down.
[Announcer] A pressure situation he's in now.
The 1973 Pee Wee State Championship now rests... on the little shoulders of number 9, Gordon Bombay.
[Cheering]
[Crowd chanting] Gordon!
Gordon!
[Chanting] Gordon!
Gordon!
Let's go, son!
All right!
[Crowd cheering]
[Whistle blowing]
[Announcer] He hit the goalpost!
What a heartbreaker!
Little Gordon Bombay had the chance --
All my client did was attempt to give you what you wanted!
Isn't that right?
This man put his neck on the line for your greed.
Objection.
Your Honour?
Will both counsellors approach the bench?
[Man] What's he doing?
I don't have anything to tell you.
I just wanna make a point.
So nod like I'm saying something important.
- Mr Bombay?
- Gordon, what are you doing?
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.
This drives him nuts and I love it.
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya?
Oh, Mr Bombay, I'm so glad you could make it.
Please restrict yourself to a relevant cross-examination!
Your Honour, the applicability of societal intent... vis-a-vis individual action is well established.
I'm citing Minneapolis V. Higgins.
The appellant court overruled a judge who disallowed similar testimony.
Now, if I'm not mistaken, that was... you.
Wasn't it, Judge Weathers?
I stand corrected, counsellor.
Objection overruled.
[Frank] Oh, you really stooped to an all-time low on this, Bombay.
I'm insulted, Frank.
You have no idea how low I can stoop.
I don't mind losing.
I would just like to lose fair.
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.
And what about justice?
That man should be in jail.
It was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me!
Next time do your job, Frankie boy.
- 30 and 0!
I remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case?
We don't count that one because I scored with the court reporter.
- The one you said had the intelligent body?
- That's the one.
- No calls on the Duck phone?
- Not yet.
What's he waiting for?
I saw him in the back of the courtroom.
How about some kudos here, huh?
Mr Tolbert dropped off a couple ringside seats for tonight's North Stars game.
Hockey?
[Raspberry] Forget it!
Gordon, here's the research for the Pearlstein Project.
- Can you get started?
- Jane!
Can't you see I'm reveling here?
Today I'm 30 and 0!
- 30 and one.
- Type, Jeannie, don't speak.
- [Ringing]
- Mr Bombay's office.
Yes. lt's Ducksworth.
You're right.
He wants to see you.
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you very much, Mr Ducksworth!
It was nothing, Mr Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr Ducksworth.
[Door closing]
Gordon, another fine job today.
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.
Score.
Don't spike.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean, sir.
This is a business.
It isn't a game.
Next time a little restraint might be in order.
[Tyres squealing]
* Hey, man, get off my back I'm doin' the best I can, yeah *
* You bust my neck Cut no slack *
- * Forget your fellow man Yeah yeah uh-huh * - [Siren]
- Pull your vehicle over to the right, now!
- This is not good.
** [Muffled rock]
- * Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah *
- Licence, please.
- Could you turn down the stereo?
- Sure.
I guess it was a "widdle" noisy.
A "widdle"?
Okay, I'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine?
No, thanks, I'm full.
[Laughs]
Okay, out of the car.
Now.
The charges against Mr Bombay are driving under the influence, driving with an open container and reckless endangerment.
And to think I almost stayed home this morning.
I assume you're representing yourself?
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a licence?
Okay, let's talk business.
What am I facing?
Suspension of licence?
Fines?
What?
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow you to plead guilty to lesser charges.
But that's solely up to the prosecutor.
The city of Minneapolis does not wish to pursue a plea bargain in this case.
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo?
The defendant is released on his own recognizance.
Mr Ducksworth.
What are you doing here?
I own the place.
How about you?
Just goin' over a few cases.
ricoh Statute stuff.
Oh, I thought you might be researching your defence... against D.U.l. and reckless endangerment.
Did you think I wouldn't find out, Gordon?
There was no reason to concern you with it, sir.
They have no case.
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp.
I found a loophole. I'm gonna plead not guilty --
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.
There's not going to be a trial.
I am not going to have you drag... this firm's good name through the mud.
I've talked to Judge Weathers and he has agreed to suspend your case.
- Under what conditions?
- Probation, suspension of your driver's licence... and 500 hours of community service.
And a leave of absence from the firm.
A leave of absence?
He can't do that.
- He can't stop me from working!
- He's not. I am.
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.
It'll teach you compassion, a sense of fair play, how to fit in.
- Community service?
This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.
And hopefully you'll come back a better person and a better attorney, which is why I'm keeping you on salary and have arranged a driver for you.
You know, in the early '70s I drove the tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties, amps cranked up to about eight jillion decibels.
All that loud music damaged my hearing, but I got no regrets...
- except for the '80s.
- How could he do this to me?
Community service...
coaching hockey!
I found one!
I'm comin' out!
[Boy] Karp, you finally found something for once in your life.
Dumpster Dave comes through!
- What do you think?
- Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.
- You gonna take that from him, Karp?
- Remind me to bust you, Averman.
- Thanks, Peter.
Thanks very much.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah!
Right there!
- Yeah!
Here, Petie.
Here, boy.
A little chili to keep you warm, buddy.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look!
[Peter] I can't believe he ate the can too.
[Averman] He sniffs.
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.
[Averman] He sniffs some more.
He stops.
I think this is it!
He's turnin' in a circle.
- He squats!
He scores!
- Yes!
We did it!
[Groaning] Full load.
Stinks!
[Averman] Come on, come on, give me the dollar!
- [Peter] Hurry it up already.
- l'm hurrying', okay?
- Go, go, go, go!
- Yeah!
All right!
Let's do it!
Oh, come on.
Stop!
- Yes!
- Okay!
Here we go.
Yeah.
There's more inside.
[Karp] He's takin' off with it.
This guy deserves what he gets.
- [Tyres squealing] - [Screaming]
[Laughing]
Oh, guys, he saw us.
Oh, my!
[Groaning]
[Cheering]
Rink's gotta be around here someplace.
Just look for a sign that says "Personal Hell."
How could he do this to me?
I hate kids.
They're barely human.
[indistinct chatter]
Come on!
Over here!
Keep it down, please!
Hey, come on.
There's no need for this.
Let's talk, come on.
I'm your friend, aren't I?
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to stop it. I'm tired of chasing' the puck.
Be careful, man.
It almost hit me that time.
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
It's supposed to hit you.
Does that sound stupid to anyone else?
Good God.
That's the hockey team.
Drive out on the ice.
It'll be all right.
[indistinct chatter] I ain't scared.
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.
[Peter] We're gonna get in big trouble.
- l'll take care of it.
- They're drugs, I just know it.
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.
This is my dominion.
This is a drug-free zone, you understand?
We ain't buying' nothin'.
I'm feelin' generous today.
So I'm gonna let you get your sorry vanilla bootie outta here... before we be usin' your eyeballs as hockey pucks.
Thanks, bro, but I'm not goin' home 'til I take care of business.
He's got a gun.
Stand back.
Whew!
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.
I'm Gordon Bombay.
I'm the new coach.
[Laughing] What a joke!
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.
Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.
Here's the long and the short of it.
I hate hockey and I don't like kids.
What's this supposed to be, a pep talk?
I'm sure this'll be a real bonding experience.
Maybe one day one of you will even write a book about it in jail.
- Funny.
- ls there a goalie?
Only for a little while.
I'm movin' back to Philly.
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.
Uh, just so you know.
We really suck.
I'll decide who sucks around here.
- Get off me.
- They really suck.
The Pete-meister.
Mr Rabble-rouser.
Passing the puck over to Jesse-roonie, the enforcer.
- [Grunt]
- Ouch!
That hurt!
Oh, it's the Connie-meister, the velvet hammer.
Hi, coach. I'm Connie.
- Do you play?
- No.
So what's our record anyway?
0 and 9.
One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.
We almost scored a goal too.
So what do we do now... coach?
- What did your old coach have you do?
- He just yelled a lot.
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm?
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us, "Little bastards, where'd you learn to play?
Oh, you suck, you!
Skate, you little bast--" [Gasping]
Heart attack.
Great.
All right, look.
I gotta make a phone call.
Keep scrimmaging.
You, you, you, you and you against you four.
- We got names, you know?
- l'm sure you do.
And I'll bet they're very nice names.
I might even learn 'em.
For now, I'll be in my office.
Oh, and if you need anything, fax me.
Geez, what a jerk.
Where do they find these coaches anyways?
We're impressionable kids, right?
Shouldn't we check his qualifications or somethin'?
Jeannie, who told you not to give me my messages?
Ducksworth!
Then who's handling my cases?
- On three!
- Jane!
- One, two, three!
Charge!
- Are you kidding me?
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to --
Hold on a second!
- [Kids shouting]
- Hey!
Get your mouth off the windows!
- Hey!
- Get off there!
- [Shouting]
- Get off the car!
- We're being invaded!
- Get off!
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool!
- ls that a real phone?
- Yes, and I'm really on it.
- Not any more.
- Thank you.
- Let's see, who should I --
- Watch the upholstery.
[indistinct chatter]
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride!
[Chanting] We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
- We wanna ride!
- l could kill one of 'em just to set an example.
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything!
[Cheering]
This looks good.
I'm gonna eat it.
- Wow, I feel like Madonna.
- You wish!
Seats ten comfortably.
- Hey, pass me one of those glasses.
- [Growling]
- Yeah, I see your point.
- [Sniffing]
Oh.
- [Sniffing] - [Together] Goldberg!
- lt wasn't me, all right!
- Young man, what did you eat?
- Nothing!
It wasn't me!
- Open a window!
Oh, man!
It's my mom!
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.
All right, out!
Everybody, out of the car right now.
Goldberg, why'd you have to ruin the fun?
Are you out of your mind?
What were you thinking putting that car on the ice?
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take.
One crack!
- The ice is not gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are?
- l'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
- The new coach?
They send you over here to coach the team and you endanger their lives.
What danger?
I grew up on the ice;
I know when it's safe to drive on.
- How do you know?
- l just know!
All right?
Well, listen, Mr Zen Master, you may be in tune with the ice universe, but when it comes to my kid, "l just know" doesn't cut it.
Charlie, let's go.
- Mom?
- Give me my candy!
All of it!
Well, I guess practise is over.
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- lt's all right, Charlie.
Coach, gonna be at the game tomorrow?
By order of the state of Minnesota, yeah.
[Chanting] Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
- One, two, three, four, five!
- [Whistle blowing]
- Hi, girls.
- Karp!
No!
Goodbye.
The hawks.
My first game and it had to be the Hawks.
Gordon?
Gordon Bombay.
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.
Why don't you just call me Jack?
Hey, come back to see your old coach, huh?
Well, actually I'm, uh, coaching...
Pee Wee.
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'.
You got a kid on the team or something?
No, I'm here because I need to be of service to the community.
How about this, huh?
Whoever thought we'd be coaching' against each other?
Yeah, who'd have thought?
So, who's your hotshot player this year?
- Anyone good?
- l got a kid named Banks.
Might go all the way.
Not quite as good as you were.
But he wants it more.
Kid won't give up.
Oh, boy, I wish they would take that one down.
Don't you?
Well, good luck.
You're gonna need it.
It's up to you, Gordon.
You miss this shot, you're not just... letting me down, you're letting your whole team down too.
I wish your dad could be here to see this.
Make him proud of you!
[Chanting] Win!
Win!
Win!
All right, guys, gather round.
Come on, come on.
- Win!
Win!
Win!
- Win.
Win.
Win!
Win!
Win!
- Win?
- Win!
Win!
Win!
Yeah, we're fired up.
All right!
Watch this!
Oh, great.
Good concept, guys.
Nice -- ouch!
Nice goin', fool!
- Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
- Oh, yeah, "l didn't mean to."
Yeah, sure, you're on my own team.
Oh, sorry, Goldberg.
Didn't mean to.
Would you get off me before I clock you?
Let's go, Jesse!
Go, Terry!
[Whistle blowing] Let's go!
Come on in.
What's this?
The Oreo line!
Hey, come on.
Let's play hockey.
Um, batter, batter, hum, batter, batter!
Hey, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Hum, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Averman!
It's hockey!
There's no batter. idiot.
Hum, goalie, goalie, hum, goalie, goalie!
Hey, goalie, goalie, save, goalie, goalie!
Hum, goalie, goalie, hey, goalie, goalie!
No, I got him!
I, I, I got him!
[Cheering]
That's one!
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy!
Good show.
Sloppy pass.
Way to stuff it, Banks!
All right, all right!
Let's run it up!
Run it up!
Run it up!
[Whistle blowing]
Oh, man!
How could you let him get by you?
All right, line change.
Come on, go, go, go.
- Hey!
- [Grunting]
- [Crowd cheering] - [Groaning]
[Chanting] Banks!
Banks!
Banks!
Hey, you!
Come back here!
Oh!
- [Whistle blowing]
- Why me?
How lazy can you be?
They're killing us out there!
How many times do I have to tell you:
Get those rebounds, get your heads up, get those loose pucks.
- Get -
- Just -- - [Whistle blowing]
Just get the hell outta here.
All right!
It's Spaz-way.
He'll screw up.
[Crowd cheering]
[Crowd gasping]
Hey, hey!
Way to play it, Banks!
All right!
That's okay, Charlie!
Nice try!
Nice fan, Charlie.
Keep swingin'.
Maybe you'll give 'em a cold.
Hey, hey, hey, knock it off!
Against this team we should have twice this many!
Now let's run it up!
Remember it's not worth winning if you can't win big!
[Reilly] All right!
Guys!
No!
Come on, let's talk about this!
Be civilized!
Come on!
Please!
[Crowd cheering]
Oh no, guys!
Come on, not again!
Please!
Just take the goal.
Fine!
I don't care!
- l'm so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.
[Buzzer]
All right!
Hey, knock it off!
That was a lousy third period.
Anybody could beat these pansies.
I want you guys to stay hungry out there!
All right, nice goin', Banks.
New Hawks record.
- Okay, boys.
Let's go.
- All right!
Hey, Gordon!
Nice game.
I enjoyed it thoroughly.
At least I can handle the puck!
[indistinct arguing]
Hey, shut up!
You guys stink!
I thought we came here to play hockey.
- You know, I knew we forgot something.
- [Laughing]
Oh, you think it's funny?
You think losing is funny?
Well, not at first, but once you get the hang of it.
We're the ones out there gettin' our butts kicked.
Yeah, it's not like you coach us or anything.
At least we try.
You didn't listen to a word I said.
I said, keep your heads up.
You put your heads down.
I said, hustle.
You went slower!
That was the sloppiest playing I've ever seen.
Why the hell don't you just listen to me?
Why the hell should we?
I don't care.
You want to lose, fine.
You're the ones who look like idiots out there.
[Reilly] Great game!
Hans?
[Cheering] I don't believe it!
Who would throw these away?
- First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
- Fork it over.
Forget it, Karp.
I can see this every day on MTV.
This one's from Minneapolis.
Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom.
- Let's give him a wedgie.
- Good idea, Jesse!
I was just kidding, okay?
Hey!
Give that back!
- Hi, girls.
- Does your mommy know you have that?
Nah, she's busy with the mailman.
That'll make great bathroom reading.
That's mine, you jerk!
I found it!
You don't even know what to do with it, wuss-breath.
- You gonna let him call you wuss-breath?
- No!
Hey!
Hey!
[Grunting]
- Oh!
- Come on.
Want some more?
You guys want some more?
Come on!
Yeah!
You want some more?
Come on!
[Gasping] [indistinct jeering]
[Jeering continues]
[Growling]
Let's get out!
Move it!
- Thanks a lot.
- All right, man.
One, two, three!
Boom!
What are you laughing at, cream cheese boy?
Go!
[Bombay] lf we're gonna cheat, we gotta make those falls look real.
Keep it up!
Whoa!
Score one for the spirit.
Go at him!
Go at him!
Good!
Go at him!
Come on, get angry!
Oh!
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt!
I am hurt.
Good, good.
Now say it again!
[Together] Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
- One more time!
- Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
Good!
You guys are ready.
- [Grunting] - [Cheering]
[Buzzer]
Give me a break, ref!
Open your eyes!
Did you see what he did to me?
Goldberg, you don't take the fall while they're shooting at you.
Oh!
Well, I guess you didn't explain that very well, did ya?
- District Five!
- l throw myself on the ice --
Cut the acting class.
One more dive, I forfeit to the Jets!
What?
I'm insulted by that!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
- Quit it!
[Whistle blowing] Face-off!
Let's go!
Charlie!
That guy is twice your size.
The next time he gets you in a corner like that, I want you to grab your eye like it's cut and then hit the ice!
- Got it?
Let's go.
- [Referee] Let's go!
Face-off!
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
Here we go.
Hey --
- Come on!
- That's it, Charlie.
- That's it, Charlie!
- Come on!
Damn it, Charlie!
We can't even win when we cheat.
- Stupid cake-eater tricks!
- [Connie] That was embarrassing.
Charlie!
What the hell is the matter with you?
When I tell you to do something, you do it!
You got it?
Look at me.
- You got it?
- You can't make me cheat.
Jesse, Terry, let's go.
This is what I gave up my overtime pay for?
To see my kids takin' falls?
Gordon.
- How did you know?
- Through the back door at this time of night.
Just like you used to.
You'd spend hours watching me do this.
What do you think?
is this sharp enough?
Ow!
- Did you cut yourself?
- No. [Chuckling]
You always fell for that.
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, I'm Scandinavian.
- lt's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.
You probably thought I was dead.
I saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything?
You were so busy screaming at the kids.
I didn't want to spoil the moment.
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.
Why should my store?
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that?
Well, I hardly ever lose a case.
That is not what I asked.
Hmm!
I see you still have this up.
- Thanks very much.
- lt is important to remember the past.
I'd just as soon forget it.
That was the worse time in my life.
My dad died that year.
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.
I found this not long ago.
He was proud of you.
I miss him.
You scored 198 goals in that season, Gordon.
It's a shame you quit.
You --
- Could have gone all the way.
Yeah.
- No!
You really loved to play.
You remember?
You remember... you used to play on the ponds until after dark, until your father called you back.
You really flew on that ice, Gordon.
That's all I ever wanted to do.
Then why did you stop?
Reilly?
I saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.
- The guy wins.
- lt's not about winning. lt never was.
Just show they how to play.
Show them how to have fun.
Teach them to fly.
That is what they'll remember long after you've gone back to being a doctor.
Lawyer.
And long after they've stopped buying skates from me.
Here... there you are.
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.
- What's this?
- Your new skates.
That is why you came here tonight, isn't it?
- l figured nine and a half was your size.
- Actually, I'm a nine.
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.
Here comes Bombay on an end-to-end rush.
Past the blue line, past centre.
He's not skating, he's flying!
He fakes once, he fakes twice.
Fakes three times!
Shoots!
Scores!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
What a play!
What a guy!
Gordon Bombay does it again!
Great move, Gordy!
You faked him out of his pads.
Come here, son.
You look great out there.
Come on, let's go inside, get something to eat.
A few more minutes?
Please?
- Go on.
Get outta here.
- Thanks.
[Sighing]
[Knocking]
- Hi, uh --
- Please, just go away.
Charlie doesn't want... to be on the team any more, and neither he nor I have anything to say to you.
- Well, I have something to say to you.
- Oh, really?
Door-to-door mistreatment now.
Now the team can feel miserable between games too, huh?
I came to apologize to Charlie...
to both of you.
- What?
- Apologize.
Well... you should.
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin'?
I was just, uh, walkin' around thinkin' and, uh --
Wanna give us a minute?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Listen, it was very wrong of me... to ask you and the other guys to cheat.
I never should have said to you what I said to you.
I was angry. I was frustrated.
It took a lot of guts for you to do what you knew was right. I admire that.
And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that, uh, that I'm --
Oh, boy, this is difficult.
- l'm --
- You're sorry.
I'm sorry. [Louder] I'm sorry.
All right?
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be a lot more fun this time around.
What do you say?
Do you want to stay for dinner?
- What?
- Charlie!
Uh, no, I -- l can't.
Uh --
Well, what are you havin'?
Mr Ducksworth, there are two reasons I came by.
First off, I want to let you know things are going well.
I'm learning a lot about teamwork, fair play and all that junk.
Good, good.
And the second thing?
Well, sir, fair play doesn't come cheap.
These kids, my team, have no money.
They can't afford rink time, safe equipment, proper uniforms, which makes it difficult for them to compete.
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old and stepping out onto that ice... with old copies of the "Enquirer" taped to your shins instead of pads.
The point I'm trying to make, sir, is that you wouldn't be taken seriously and neither are these kids.
So I thought maybe the firm could help 'em out.
How much are we talking about?
- $15,000.
- No way.
Wait a minute.
Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross, the firm that gives back to the community.
Come on.
I'll get you your own jersey.
* Ooo, yeah *
* Can you feel it baby Ooo * * l can too, Ooo *
* Ooo *
* Ooo, come on swing *
* Come on swing *
* Come on swing *
* C-Come on swing Ooo *
* Ooo * * lt's such a good vibration * * lt's such a sweet sensation * * lt's such a good vibration * * lt's such a sweet sensation *
Who is that kid?
Thanks, Fulton.
- Fulton Reed.
He's in one of my classes.
- How come he's not on the team?
He only plays football.
Some preppie school gave him a scholarship... as long as he doesn't play hockey.
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- l heard it was colleges.
He's been accepted to four of 'em.
- Yeah, but I heard he's got to repeat the sixth grade.
- Ah, shut up.
Gordon Bombay?
Bombay was a Hawk.
* ...
Good vibration * * lt's such a sweet sensation *
* Feel the vibration lt's such a good vibration **
Dude, check 'em out, man.
Holy cow.
- They're pretty good skaters.
- Anybody know who they are?
That's Tommy Duncan.
He's in my science class.
That's his sister, Tammy.
- Think they'd want to play hockey with us?
- [Together] Yeah!
Go get dressed.
I'll do the negotiating.
Just think of it as figure skating... with a stick.
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy!
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive!
Mom isn't gonna like this at all.
So what?
You want me to figure skate, then you gotta play hockey.
What do I know about hockey?
More than you think.
Back to basics!
Skating!
Go!
Go!
Side to side.
Shift your weight.
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.
That's okay, Charlie.
Soft hands.
You don't shoot the puck to your teammate.
You sail it to him.
Karp, on your feet.
- You send it.
- Oh!
Gross!
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it.
Cradle it.
- Oh!
- Again!
Concentration, not strength.
Like the Karate Kid, right?
"Wax on!
Wax off!"
Just shut up and try it, Averman!
- You're such a jerk.
- Send it back, Averman.
Good, Averman.
Charlie.
That's good.
Good.
Now sail it back.
Oh!
Way to go!
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.
- [Splattering]
- Oh!
Here it comes.
Nice and easy.
Good.
- l did it!
I did it!
- All right.
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.
- But when are you gonna work with me in goal?
- Goldberg, do you trust me?
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar mitzvah'd.
This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.
Coach, I think you got the ceremonies mixed up. lt's more like a circumcision.
Coach!
Will you come back here?
What'd I ever do to you, man?
District Five!
Ready!
Oh, man, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
- Aim!
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.
- Oh, please!
No!
- Fire!
[Screaming] I wanna go home!
[Screaming]
[Laughing]
This doesn't hurt!
You wimps!
Give me your best shot!
Oh!
Come on!
That's good!
Hex goal!
Goalie boot save!
Whoa!
Nice shot, man!
I'm a dog!
I'm a crazed dog!
Come on!
[Chanting] Goldberg!
Goldberg!
I am Goldberg!
The goalie!
[Growling]
Good!
Good!
All right, Charlie!
Good hustle!
Conway, way to go.
All right, Karp!
- You guys hungry?
Tired?
- [Together] Yeah!
- Do you ache?
Are you pumped up?
- Yeah!
Good!
That was a hell of a practise.
Be proud of yourself.
[indistinct chatter]
Hey, guys!
Excuse me, guys!
You gotta untie me now!
Ha-ha!
Good joke.
Very funny. I like it.
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach!
Coach, come on, don't leave me hangin' like this!
Coach, don't make me come after you, coach.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Thanks for the ride.
You did real well in practise today, Charlie.
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad?
Mom and I left him. I don't really remember, but that's what she says.
You know, when I was a boy, I had to take care of my mother too.
Really?
What happened to your dad?
He passed away.
You do a good job takin' care of your mom.
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right?
- Okay.
We'll see ya.
- Okay.
Hey, coach.
- What's that?
- Huh?
- Oh!
- Victory!
[Laughing]
[Bombay laughing] You've just entered the tickling zone!
[Laughing]
So I'm right in the middle of my cross-examination and I say to the guy, I usually defend heels like you, you scuzzy, mole-faced rat.
[Chuckling] That's a good one, sir.
Whoa!
[Screeching]
Hey!
Hey!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Look, it was an accident, all right?
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
I didn't learn.
I just do it.
Do it again.
Yargh!
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal?
Yeah.
Well, one out of five.
Fulton, is it true what they say?
About the scholarships and how they won't let you play hockey?
People talk.
It don't mean nothin'.
- Why don't you play for us?
- l can't.
- What do you mean?
- l mean, I can't.
- You afraid?
- No, I mean I can't, you moron. I don't know how to skate.
Whoa!
is that all that's stoppin' ya?
[indistinct shouting]
* l ride the top of the line I can't settle for less *
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.
Side to side, good!
Follow me.
[Screaming]
Aaah!
Watch it!
Get out of the way!
[Screaming]
Sorry!
* This is all we got baby lt's got to be enough * * l'd like to try to quit But I don't know how * * l needed it then and baby I need it right now *
Come on, Fulton.
Let's go!
- * l gotta keep movin' 'til l'm satisfied *
- Hey!
* Come on, Come on lt's gonna be all right **
The Ducks?
We're the Ducks?
Man, what brain-dead jerk came up with that name?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But I didn't have a choice.
We're being sponsored.
By who?
Donald and Daisy?
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks?
You'd rather be District Five?
Some stupid number?
Better than some stupid animal.
I'll have you know, Peter, that the Duck is one of the most noble, agile and intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom.
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.
Neither do hockey players.
Have you guys ever seen a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation?
It's beautiful.
Pretty awesome the way they all stick together.
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight?
No way.
Why?
Because the other animals are afraid.
They know that if they mess with one duck, they gotta deal with the whole flock.
Oh, man!
I'm proud to be a duck.
And I'd be proud to fly with any one of you.
So how about it?
Who's a Duck?
I'll be a Duck.
Yeah.
Me too.
[indistinct chatter]
Anybody see Goldberg?
All right!
- Now we're the Ducks!
- [Cheering]
- The Mighty Ducks!
- [Cheering]
- What are we?
- [Together] The Ducks!
What the hell are they doing?
Every time you get the puck, you're the quarterback.
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.
Come on, guys.
This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.
What a weird-ass team.
How you doin'?
- You ready?
- l think so.
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.
My God!
Wow!
- [Crowd gasping]
- One out of five.
All right, Let's forget the past.
We lost a few games, tough!
That was District Five.
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right!
Yeah!
Quack, quack.
- Quack.
Quack.
- [Together] Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
[Chanting] Quack!
Quack!
Go...
Ducks!
- [Cheering]
- What the hell was that?
[Bombay] Let's go, Ducks!
Defence!
Defence!
Dig it outta there!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Let's go, Ducks!
Throw it!
Throw it!
To the crease!
[Cheering]
Yes!
The Oreo line!
That's my boy!
[Laughing]
Defence, Karp!
Defence!
Come on.
[Crowd gasping]
I don't wanna go to school today, Mom.
- How many fingers am I holding' up?
- He wouldn't know.
Shut up, Peter.
Karp, are you okay?
- Look at this.
- The Karp-ster used his head to stop the puck.
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.
Get him on the bench, Charlie.
Okay, Ducks, we still got a chance here.
Connie, Terry, Jesse, Guy, time for the secret weapon.
Okay, Fulton.
Remember, just like we talked about.
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.
[Cheering]
Oh, no.
- Go!
Get the face-off!
- Line up, boys, let's go.
That's it.
Aaah!
Whoa!
[Cheering]
Whoo!
Yeah!
That tie of yours might be what you need to make the play-offs.
- The ducks have a shot at the play-offs?
- Sure.
Everyone but the last two teams are in, remember?
Panthers got the measles and they forfeited the season.
So, you beat the Huskies and you'll make the play-offs.
- Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
- So?
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since I played.
Actually, one little thing has changed.
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.
They redrew the district lines last year.
The lake is not the boundary any more.
You see?
You'd be a Duck.
I'd be a Duck.
Excuse me.
Coach Reilly?
- Yeah?
- l'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.
- What's that?
- One of your players is ineligible.
Banks!
Over here!
- This is a joke, right?
- l'm afraid it's no joke.
- Problem?
- No, just a mistake.
Are you this boy's father?
450 North Hennipen, is that your address?
- Yes.
- l'm afraid there's no mistake.
- This boy is playing for the wrong team.
- What?
According to league rules, Adam Banks should be playing for District Five.
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- ls this your doing, Gordon?
I'll expect to see him at our next game.
- We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
- No way.
My son would rather not play than play for your team.
Fine, if that's the way you want it.
But remember, if Adam plays for the Hawks, you'll forfeit every game for the rest of the season.
Boy, I'd hate to see that.
Look, I'm sorry this had to happen, but you can see on the map.
Gordon?
Hey, Bombay!
You stop when I'm talking to you, son!
What's the idea here?
You trying to sabotage me or what?
The law's a bitch when it works against you, isn't it, Jack?
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.
Even with Banks, what do you think you're gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers?
That's right, coach.
They are losers.
We hate losers, don't we?
They don't even deserve to live.
Maybe Banks won't make a difference, but at least we're playing by the rules.
Why'd you turn against me, Gordon?
For six years... I taught ya how to skate, I taught ya how to score.
I taught ya how to go for the "W."
You could have been one of the greats.
And now look at yourself.
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.
Going to the play-offs!
Whoo!
One win!
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.
All right, everyone, listen up.
I got some good news.
We're getting a new player, Adam Banks.
- What?
- [indistinct chatter]
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.
- We don't need him.
- l'm the coach. I say we do need him.
- lf we make it to the play-offs, he could be a big help.
- [Karp] lf?
All of a sudden you don't think we're good enough.
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.
- What?
- We heard what you said.
You said we were losers, we didn't deserve to live.
- That's not what I meant.
- l saw that picture of you missing that goal.
You were a Hawk, weren't you?
Guess you guys stick together to the end.
You know what?
I don't need your stinkin' equipment.
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.
- l'm talkin' to you, son!
- Forget it, cake-eater.
If you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.
Where do you guys think you're goin'?
I don't believe this.
[Sighing]
All right, I'm goin' up to the bench because that's where l'm supposed to be.
Anyone who wants to join me can join me.
Anyone who doesn't --
Well --
Ten minutes to game time, coach.
Yeah, yeah, they'll be out in a minute.
They're, you know, working themselves into a frenzy.
Not much of a frenzy.
We forfeit.
Ducks forfeit.
Flames, you win.
Hey.
Can I sit?
Sure.
You talk to the guys?
I tried.
They think I'm a traitor for even showing up.
I guess they really hate me, huh?
is it true you were really a Hawk?
Yeah.
Peter said you blew a really big game once.
Yeah, well, Peter's right.
It was the last game of the state finals.
We were tied 2-2 in the end of the third period.
I get a penalty shot.
I go in, I triple deke.
I fake the goalie right out of his pads.
The puck's headed in, and then...
- Clang!
Hits the post.
- [Groans]
We lost in overtime.
A quarter of an inch this way and it would have gone in.
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way and you'd have missed completely.
I never thought of it that way.
At least you got to play in a championship game.
- That must've been so cool.
- Hey.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
I'd love one.
You know, she has many fine qualities that men find attractive.
I know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.
So, what kind of guys does she usually date?
Jerks. I mean, most of them like her, but as soon as they catch a glimpse of me --
Pow!
Warp speed!
They are gone!
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, I wouldn't even care... except it's not fair to my mom.
She deserves somebody nice.
Are you gonna come over for dinner again?
I don't know, Charlie.
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
See, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I, um, talked to Jesse and Terry's dad, and he's gonna take over coaching for the rest of the year.
- You're quitting?
- l'm stepping aside to keep the team together.
The guys can't play for somebody they don't trust.
I trust you.
The other guys do too.
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.
- l've done all I can.
- No, you haven't.
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.
We are too!
We weren't even the Ducks until you came along.
You made us and now you're stuck with us.
Charlie.
That's right.
The red is oxygen.
Now what are the blue balls?
[Students giggling]
- Tommy?
- Hydrogen?
is correct.
Now put them together... and you have a molecule that makes up 96 %%% of your body.
- What is it?
- Pizza?
[Students giggling]
- [Knocking] - lt's the principal. I'll be right back.
Work on H2 C03.
It's a goody.
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way?
- Yeah, did you score?
Leave me alone, guys.
I don't want to talk about the team.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.
Everybody knows he likes you best.
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp!
Take it back now!
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.
- [Connie] Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl!
- Lay off!
- Don't shove, Peter.
[All arguing]
Atoms away!
My atoms!
You!
Sit!
Sit now!
In your seats now!
I have never in my life --
What have you got to say for yourselves?
Quack.
[Chanting] Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!
Thanks for coming by on such short notice, Gordon.
By the way, your court release came through.
- Congratulations.
Your community service is over.
- You're kidding.
So you wanted to talk about my coming back to work then?
- Well, actually --
- Oh, you got your jersey.
Great!
A lot's been happening.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.
Gordon, you know Coach Reilly and Mr Banks.
[Mumbling] Sir, they're the bad guys.
No, actually, Phil is one of my oldest friends.
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together here to try to work out this little problem.
You see, my son Adam wants to play for the Hawks.
His older brother was a Hawk.
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.
It's a tradition.
You understand that, Gordon.
You played.
But the league's already ruled on it.
We've talked to the league, and we worked out a little deal.
- You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League?
- Yes, we did.
The long and short of it is that Adam stays on the Hawks for the rest of the season.
And then next year, they redraft the lines.
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.
What's that?
That you withdraw your protest.
- That's great.
- Good, good.
Well, that's settled then.
No, sir, you don't understand.
I can't withdraw my protest.
- What?
- Mr Ducksworth, you wanted me to learn about fair play... and how to be part of a team... and I may not have learned everything yet, but I remember something my father said to me.
A team isn't a bunch of kids out to win.
A team is something you belong to, something you feel, something you have to earn.
And I'm not gonna let those kids down.
Gordon, I'm going to make this simple.
Are you prepared to lose your job over some kids?
Some game?
Let me ask you, sir.
Are you prepared to fire me over some kids?
Some game?
Collect your personal belongings, Gordon.
Yes, sir, Mr Ducksworth!
Thank you very much, Mr Ducksworth!
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, Mr Ducksworth!
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.
[Quacking]
You may have paid for this jersey, sir, but you didn't earn it.
I'll see you in the play-offs.
[Bell rings]
- Excuse me.
There are some students here that I'd like to see.
- Who are you?
I'm their hockey coach.
If you could tell me where l can find each of them, please.
They're in room 223.
- All of them?
- All of them.
"l will not quack at the principal."
"l will not quack at the principal."
- What do you want?
- l want to talk to you guys.
- People.
- People, right.
Sit down, please.
All of you.
Okay, don't sit down.
Look, what's done is done.
I want to be your coach again.
You're gonna coach a bunch of losers?
- No, I want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said?
You said we didn't deserve to live.
Karp, I was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means?
- No.
- Okay, then you do.
I didn't mean those things the way they sounded.
You guys know what it's like to be misunderstood, right?
- Yeah, of course.
We're kids.
- So...
Can you forgive me?
Can I be your coach again?
- What about Banks?
- He can be on the team if he wants.
He should have been with us all year.
It's you guys who were cheated.
Let's forget all that crap!
- We're a team, right?
- [Ducks] Yeah.
I made you guys, and I'm sticking with you.
So, what's it gonna be?
We can play tomorrow night and still have a shot at the play-offs... or we can forfeit again and the season's over.
Peter, what do you say?
Well... I guess it would help if we practised first.
All right.
Let me see if I can get you out of detention.
- Yes.
- Take that.
You really quacked at the principal?
Yeah.
Are we Ducks, or what?
Yeah!
Look at your mother.
Let's see how it is in ten minutes.
I'm gonna kill you!
Hey.
Wasn't sure if you'd show up.
Yeah, whatever.
- l just want to play hockey.
- Good.
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.
On behalf of the Ducks, I'd like to say welcome.
Cake-eater.
Ooh, the Jess-man, dissin' the new guy!
The Jess-ster!
Shut up, Averman!
[Averman] lt's just a joke.
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey doesn't mean you're a real Duck.
- They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
- l bet.
Well, suit up.
I'll see you on the ice.
On your left!
Over here!
I'm open!
Come on, right here!
Up front!
- Up front!
- Pass it to Banks!
Come on!
Do somethin' with it!
Yeah!
All right!
Way to go, Banks!
All right!
Score another one for the Ducks!
[Ducks talking excitedly]
Goldberg, you're gonna sit this one out.
What?
You're pulling the goalie when we're tied?
Listen, listen, listen!
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.
Okay, Fulton, you're our extra man.
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.
- We pulling the Statue of Liberty play?
- Yeah?
No, take your shot.
You may only get one, so it's gotta be good.
- But, coach, one outta one?
- [Germaine] Soft hands, Fulton.
- Concentration, not strength.
- [Bombay] That's right!
Okay?
Let's get the Huskies!
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one.
Let's go!
- Get in there!
- Come on!
[Jesse] Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!
Shoot, Fulton, shoot!
We won!
We made the play-offs!
[Charlie] Boy, this is great.
[Connie] Guys, look, it's the North Stars.
- Oh, man.
- lt's Mike Modano!
- ...
Believe this?
- Cool!
This is too cool.
I can't believe this.
[Connie] This place is humongous.
What are we doing here?
It's a little play-offs present.
Hey, Gordo!
Gordon Bombay, right?
- You remember me?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- l heard you were a farmer.
Actually, I became a lawyer.
But I'm coaching Pee Wee now and this is my team, the Ducks.
- Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
- [Ducks] We can see that.
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks!
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.
If you ever want a shot, I'll get you a tryout in the minor league clubs.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, nice seein' ya.
Take it easy.
[Bombay] All right, let's have some fun!
* You've got to accentuate the positive *
* Eliminate the negative *
* Latch on to the affirmative *

* Don't you mess with Mister ln-between **
You know, I heard the North Stars wore the same underwear... all through the play-offs last year for luck.
So I'm doin' the same thing.
Hmm.
Maybe I should've cooked.
You know, I'm thinkin' maybe we can all go down to the winter festival tonight.
- All three of us?
- Sure.
I don't think I should, 'cause I got a lot of homework.
You should go.
With my mom.
By yourselves.
[Door slams]
Mmm, smells great!
Hello.
[Whispering] Go for it.
Hi.
[Casey] I don't know how they sculpt these.
Hmm, I wonder.
I used to sculpt, but now I do mostly paintings.
How do you think they do the details?
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.
Oh.
I'm nervous.
I'm rambling on and on here.
You probably think I'm weird.
No, I think you're great.
When I was a little girl, I used to pretend that that was an ice castle.
And that was my room, that window right up there.
And last winter I gave Charlie that one.
What about me?
Which window's mine?
I want to live there too.
What?
What did I say?
- lt's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy?
Casey, I was just playin' around.
Look, I don't know how you feel about me.
I don't even know how I feel about you.
But I do know there's a little kid back home... who's absolutely falling in love with his coach... and if you can't deal with that, if you're just playing around, then you better let me know.
What are we talking?
'Til death do us part?
- l have to decide on the first date?
- Stop it, Gordon.
Charlie's gonna be there when we get back.
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.
Look, I can take it.
But if Charlie gets too attached --
Every time this happens, it gets... a little rougher on him.
Just on him?
I'm glad to be here with you.
Me too.
[Announcer] The surprising Ducks are still in this game... against the Hornets.
Banks moving right in front, stops.
He shoots, he scores!
It's getting rough out there between the Ducks and the Hornets.
Here's Adam Banks in the slot.
He stops, shoots.
He scores!
Back it goes to Averman.
He shoots!
Score!
The ducks win it, 5-3 over the Hornets.
And now it's on to the semifinals... where the Ducks will face the Cardinals.
What a game so far, ladies and gentlemen!
The Ducks and the Cardinals!
Cardinals with it in their own zone, tryin' to clear it out.
Pass to the blue line, intercepted by the Ducks.
Here's their star, Adam Banks.
Banks has great speed.

Goes around one man with a great move!
Steps around another defender!
He scores!
Come on!
Come on, Jesse!
[Announcer] Ducks with it again.
Here's Averman, now getting it over to Banks.
Germaine is right in the slot.
Germaine with it!
He shoots, he scores!
Germaine put it off the goaltender's glove into the net!
And that does it!
The Ducks have won!
Can you believe it?
4-2, and the Ducks now get set to face the Hawks in the state finals.
[Reilly] All right, it's up to you, Gordon.
Now, you miss this shot, you're not just letting your team down, you're letting me down too.
Remember, it's not worth playing - lf you can't win.
- That's right.
Okay, son, let's go.
Let's go, son!
[Yelling]
* ...
Oh, say does that star-spangled *
* Banner yet wave *
* O'er the land of the free *
* And the home of the brave **
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
All right!

Ducks!
Let's go!
[Cheering]
[Booing]
Hey, Banks.
Don't forget what side you're on.
He's a Duck, Jesse.
He'll play like a Duck.
[Announcer] And the game is underway, and right off Larson and McGill with a heavy hit.
That gives you an indication of what you're going to see tonight.
[Reilly] Good hit!
That's the way I want you guys to play it!
The Ducks in green chasing it down against --
A hard hit out at centre ice!
Keep it away from 'em!
Come on, Banks!
Heavy hitting continues in this championship game.
Banks up the centre ice.
He drives it down into the Hawks' zone.
Back in again to Larson, the man behind the net.
Go, go, go!
Get it out of there!
Banks, two comin' hard!
Banks still looking for an opening, moves it up --

Hustle!
Come on, you guys!
Hawks with a 1-0 lead, come back to centre ice.
Larson gives it up to McGill.
Here's McGill, inside, the lead at centre ice.
He's up on the blue line and around the net.
And he scores!
And now the Hawks lead 2-0.
Good save, Goldberg!
All right, all right!
That's the kind of hockey... I want to see played all day, boys.
Larson stopped at the blue line, but the Ducks can't clear it out.
McGill to Brown, left side.
He shoots!
He scores!
The Hawks lead late in the first period, 3-0.
Don't be scared of them, Ducks.
That's what they want.
Keep your heads up.
Play proud.
- Let's fly!
Come on, let's go!
- [Ducks cheering]
[Reilly] All right, pressure, boys.
Pressure, pressure!
All right, hold it, hold it.
I want you to drop Banks like a bad habit. I want him outta the game.
- Finish him off.
You got it?
- Yeah.
Okay, boys, let's go.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right!
Face-off for the second period, and the Hawks win the draw.
They get it back to Stickler.
3-0, Hawks lead.
Stickler to the blue line of the Ducks.
His pass taken away by Conway.
[Bombay] Go after him!
Taken by Adam Banks.
Here's Banks across the blue line!
McGill from behind!
Knocks Banks down!
Banks shoots!
He scores!
Adam Banks with a great goal for the Ducks!
McGill knocked him down from behind, but Banks scored.
Adam.
Adam, are you okay?
- What'd you do?
- My job.
Okay, we need the paramedics in.
He's injured.
Oh, my God.
Come on, son, let's go.
Come on.
Number seven, McGill.
Cross-checking.
Two minutes.
[Hawk] Don't worry, guys.
Did it go in?
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favour.
Kick some Hawk butt.
All right, cake-eater.
He'll be okay, sir.
We need to take some X rays, though.
Hell of a job, son.
They score against us, they're gonna pay the price.
Now, don't worry.
We're gonna get that one back.
You got somethin' to say to me, Bombay?
To think I wasted all those years worrying about what you thought.
You're goin' down, Reilly.
- Let me go after 'em, coach.
Let me get 'em.
- No, we're better than that.
Look, look, it's time to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.
- All right?
Now we got the power play.
- [Ducks] Yeah.
All right.
We're gonna hit 'em where it hurts the most: up there.
Fulton, you're in.
- Coach, they'll be rushing' him.
- Right.
Jesse, make sure you give Fulton plenty of time.
- Right, coach.
- [Charlie] Jesse, do good.
Let's go!
- [Ducks] Yeah!
- Hold it!
Wait!
Whoa!
Let's have fun out there.
- [Ducks] All right!
- All right!
Let's go!
Let's go!
The Ducks trail 3-1, and now they call on number 44, Fulton Reed...
[Bombay] Get the face-off!
[Announcer] ...who has a big, booming shot.
And the Ducks get it back to Fulton Reed.
Hall clears the front of the net.
Here's Reed winding.
He scores!
Fulton Reed has scored, and the Ducks are back in the game!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
Yes!
That's it!
More fun!
More fun!
Of all the sloppy ass -
- Ladies, they don't need our help out there!
Now I want that Fulton Reed covered.
He better not make another shot.
You got it?
I'm tellin' you, you blow this game and nobody makes the team next year!
All right, get out there!
Quick feet, now!
Quick feet!
The puck comes around, now to Blake on the right side.
Blake through the slot with a backhand.
Scores!
Blake with a backhanded goal, and the Hawks regain the two goal lead at 4-2.
Guys, guys, guys, listen up, listen.
We have got to stay fired up and focused, all right?
It ain't over 'til it's over.
Tammy, Tommy, let's show these Hawks something really different.
Come here.
All right.
I want you guys to start up here --
Third period and the Ducks trail 4-2, trying desperately to get back in the game.
The Ducks with Tammy and Tommy Duncan on the ice.
Tammy Duncan goes in front of the net, Tommy with the puck.
Tammy's spinning, and the Hawks are just looking at her.
- Come on.
- Come on!
Now!
Tammy Duncan shoots, she scores!
Yes!
Yes!
We're still alive!
[Crowd booing] I'm on, coach.
Yes, we're still in there!
He Grabs McGill from behind... and throws him over the boards into the bench.
Now he wants to pick a fight with the entire Hawks team.
Fulton Reed has to be restrained by the referee.
Game misconduct.
You're outta here, son.
I'm off, coach.
He barely touched him.
Oreo line!
I want you to remember what we learned.
- Ducks stick together, right?
- Yeah!
So let's see it!
Show me the flying "V."
- All right!
- All right!
Let's get a line change!
Let's go!
[Jesse] Here we go!
Come on, y'all, let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
Flying "V"!
Jesse Hall goes behind his own net, joined by the rest of his team.
Here they come from behind the net!
It's the flying "V"!
Come on!
Come on!
Terry Hall, with the puck, moves the puck ahead to brother Jesse.
They stay onside the blue line.
Jesse Hall with it, trying to come down the slot.
Moves down the right side, now in front of the net.
Jesse scores!
[Crowd quacking]
With the score tied 4-4, the next goal will decide the championship.
Tremendous pressure.
Neither team can afford any mistakes now.
23 seconds left to go in regulation.
Looking for the game-winning goal, here's Morgan moving into the slot.
He shoots and a big save.
Big save, Goldberg!
We'll get 'em in overtime!
Score tied at four.
Now Averman ahead to Charlie Conway.
- Come on, Charlie.
- Conway to centre ice on a breakaway!
Conway moving across the Hawk blue line, down the middle!
He could win the game!
Hey!
Where's the call?
No time left on the clock, but the referee is calling a penalty shot!
[Reilly] What kind of call is that?
Okay, we've got a penalty shot for the Ducks.
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.
All right, Ducks, who's gonna take it?
- l think he should take it.
- Me?
What about Charlie?
- What about Charlie?
- All he does is fan.
Let's let him finish what he started.
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.
Come here.
You been practising that triple deke?
- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.
You may make it, you may not.
But that doesn't matter, Charlie.
What matters is that we're here.
Look around.
Whoever thought we'd make it this far?
One, two, three.
Triple deke.
Take your best shot.
I believe in you, Charlie, win or lose.
- Thanks, coach.
- Go get 'em.
- All right, Charlie.
- Let's go, Charlie.
Okay, now wait for my signal.
Good luck.
[Chanting] Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
[Chanting] Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...
Okay, now don't leave your crease before he touches the puck.
Good luck.
[Blows whistle]
Come on, Charlie.
Come on, Charlie.

Cake-eater.

Right.
Anything else?
Yeah.
Have fun out there, coach.
I must be crazy.
A tryout with the minors.
I'm gonna be goin' up against kids half my age.
Just have a good tryout, Gordon.
One step at a time.
Yeah, you're right.
[Kids hooting]
Bye. I'll call you when I get there.
Banks is first in line next!
Hey, Ducks!

...The Minnesota Pee Wee Championship is up for grabs.
Both teams playing like there's no tomorrow.
Duluth, in the Hawks'zone, looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.
There's a pass out to the blue line.
Intercepted by Gordon Bombay!
Bombay!
He's got a breakaway.
Across the blue line all alone for a chance to win the game!
He's pulled down from behind by Fox of Duluth.
Fox definitely pulled him down from behind and this could be -
Yes, the referee calls for a penalty shot.
Gordon, it's up to you.
I don't wanna see any goats around after the game.
You got it?
Now, you miss this shot... you're not just lettin' me down, you're lettin' your team down.
Apressure situation he's in now.
The 1973 Pee Wee State Championship now rests... on the little shoulders of number 9, Gordon Bombay.
Gordon!
Gordon!
Let's go, son!
All right!
He hit the goalpost!
What a heartbreaker!
Little Gordon Bombay had the chance -
All my client did was attempt to give you what you wanted!
Isn't that right?
This man put his neck on the line for your greed.
Objection.
Your Honour?
Will both counsellors approach the bench?
What's he doing?
I don't have anything to tell you.
I just wanna make a point.
So nod like I'm saying something important.
- Mr. Bombay?
- Gordon, what are you doing?
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.
This drives him nuts and I love it.
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya?
Oh, Mr. Bombay, I'm so glad you could make it.
Please restrict yourself to a relevant cross-examination!
Your Honour, the applicability of societal intent... vis-a-vis individual action is well established.
I'm citing Minneapolis V. Higgins.
The appellant court overruled a judge who disallowed similar testimony.
Now, if I'm not mistaken, that was... you.
Wasn't it,Judge Weathers?
I stand corrected, counsellor.
Objection overruled.
Oh,you really stooped to an all-time low on this, Bombay.
I'm insulted, Frank.
You have no idea how low I can stoop.
I don't mind losing.
I would just like to lose fair.
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.
And what about justice?
That man should be in jail.
It was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me!
Next time do your job, Frankie boy.
- 30 and 0!
I remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case?
We don't count that one because I scored with the court reporter.
- The one you said had the intelligent body?
- That's the one.
- No calls on the Duck phone?
- Not yet.
What's he waiting for?
I saw him in the back of the courtroom.
How about some kudos here, huh?
Mr. Tolbert dropped off ringside seats for tonight's North Stars game.
Hockey?
Forget it!
Gordon, here's the research for the Pearlstein Project.
- Can you get started?
- Jane!
Can't you see I'm reveling here?
Today I'm 30 and 0!
- 30 and one.
- Type,Jeannie, don't speak.
Mr. Bombay's office.
Yes.
It's Ducksworth.
You're right.
He wants to see you.
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
It was nothing, Mr. Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth.
Gordon, another fine job today.
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.
Score.
Don't spike.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean, sir.
This is a business.
It isn't a game.
Next time a little restraint might be in order.
~Hey, man, get off my back I'm doin'the best I can,yeah ~
~ You bust my neck Cut no slack ~
- ~Forget your fellow man Yeah yeah uh-huh ~
- Pull your vehicle over to the right, now!
- This is not good.
- ~ Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah ~
- Licence, please.
- Could you turn down the stereo?
- Sure.
I guess it was a "widdle" noisy.
A "widdle"?
Okay, I'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine?
No, thanks, I'm full.
Okay, out of the car.
Now.
The charges against Mr. Bombay are driving under the influence, driving with an open container and reckless endangerment.
And to think I almost stayed home this morning.
I assume you're representing yourself?
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a licence?
Okay, let's talk business.
What am I facing?
Suspension of licence?
Fines?
What?
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow you to plead guilty to lesser charges.
But that's solely up to the prosecutor.
The city of Minneapolis does not wish to pursue a plea bargain in this case.
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo?
The defendant is released on his own recognizance.
Mr. Ducksworth.
What are you doing here?
I own the place.
How about you?
Just goin' over a few cases.
RICOH Statute stuff.
Oh, I thought you might be researching your defence... against D.U.I. and reckless endangerment.
Did you think I wouldn't find out, Gordon?
There was no reason to concern you with it, sir.
They have no case.
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp.
I found a loophole.
I'm gonna plead not guilty -
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.
There's not going to be a trial.
I am not going to have you drag... this firm's good name through the mud.
I've talked toJudge Weathers and he has agreed to suspend your case.
- Under what conditions?
- Probation, suspension of your driver's licence... and 500 hours of community service.
And a leave of absence from the firm.
A leave of absence?
He can't do that.
- He can't stop me from working!
- He's not.
I am.
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.
It'll teach you compassion, a sense of fair play, how to fit in.
- Community service?
This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.
And hopefully you'll come back a better person and a better attorney, which is why I'm keeping you on salary and have arranged a driver for you.
You know, in the early '7 Os I drove the tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties, amps cranked up to about eight jillion decibels.
All that loud music damaged my hearing, but I got no regrets...
- except for the '80s.
- How could he do this to me?
Community service...
coaching hockey!
I found one!
I'm comin' out!
Karp,you finally found something for once in your life.
Dumpster Dave comes through!
- What do you think?
- Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.
- You gonna take that from him, Karp?
- Remind me to bust you, Averman.
- Thanks, Peter.
Thanks very much.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah!
Right there!
- Yeah!
Here, Petie.
Here, boy.
A little chili to keep you warm, buddy.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look!
I can't believe he ate the can too.
He sniffs.
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.
He sniffs some more.
He stops.
I think this is it!
He's turnin' in a circle.
- He squats!
He scores!
- Yes!
We did it!
Full load.
Stinks!
Come on, come on, give me the dollar!
- Hurry it up already.
- I'm hurrying', okay?
- Go, go, go, go!
- Yeah!
All right!
Let's do it!
Oh, come on.
Stop!
- Yes!
- Okay!
Here we go.
Yeah.
There's more inside.
He's takin'off with it.
This guy deserves what he gets.
Oh, guys, he saw us.
Oh, my!
Rink's gotta be around here someplace.
Just look for a sign that says " Personal Hell. "
How could he do this to me?
I hate kids.
They're barely human.
Come on!
Over here!
Keep it down, please!
Hey, come on.
There's no need for this.
Let's talk, come on.
I'm your friend, aren't I?
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to stop it.
I'm tired of chasing' the puck.
Be careful, man.
It almost hit me that time.
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
It's supposed to hit you.
Does that sound stupid to anyone else?
Good God.
That's the hockey team.
Drive out on the ice.
It'll be all right.
I ain't scared.
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.
We're gonna get in big trouble.
- I'll take care of it.
- They're drugs, I just know it.
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.
This is my dominion.
This is a drug-free zone, you understand?
We ain't buying' nothin'.
I'm feelin' generous today.
So I'm gonna let you get your sorry vanilla bootie outta here... before we be usin' your eyeballs as hockey pucks.
Thanks, bro, but I'm not goin' home 'til I take care of business.
He's got a gun.
Stand back.
Whew!
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.
I'm Gordon Bombay.
I'm the new coach.
What a joke!
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.
Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.
Here's the long and the short of it.
I hate hockey and I don't like kids.
What's this supposed to be, a pep talk?
I'm sure this'll be a real bonding experience.
Maybe one day one of you will even write a book about it in jail.
- Funny.
- Is there a goalie?
Only for a little while.
I'm movin' back to Philly.
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.
Uh,just so you know.
We really suck.
I'll decide who sucks around here.
- Get off me.
- They really suck.
The Pete-meister.
Mr. Rabble-rouser.
Passing the puck over toJesse-roonie, the enforcer.
Ouch!
That hurt!
Oh, it's the Connie-meister, the velvet hammer.
Hi, coach.
I'm Connie.
- Do you play?
- No.
So what's our record anyway?
0 and 9.
One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.
We almost scored a goal too.
So what do we do now... coach?
- What did your old coach have you do?
- He just yelled a lot.
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm?
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us, " Little bastards, where'd you learn to play?
Oh, you suck, you!
Skate, you little bast-"
Heart attack.
Great.
All right, look.
I gotta make a phone call.
Keep scrimmaging.
You, you, you, you and you against you four.
- We got names, you know?
- I'm sure you do.
And I'll bet they're very nice names.
I might even learn 'em.
For now, I'll be in my office.
Oh, and if you need anything, fax me.
Geez, what a jerk.
Where do they find these coaches anyways?
We're impressionable kids, right?
Shouldn't we check his qualifications or somethin'?
Jeannie, who told you not to give me my messages?
Ducksworth!
Then who's handling my cases?
- On three!
- Jane!
- One, two, three!
Charge!
- Are you kidding me?
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to -
Hold on a second!
Hey!
Get your mouth off the windows!
- Hey!
- Get off there!
Get off the car!
- We're being invaded!
- Get off!
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool!
- Is that a real phone?
- Yes, and I'm really on it.
- Not any more.
- Thank you.
- Let's see, who should I -
- Watch the upholstery.
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
- We wanna ride!
- I could kill one of'em just to set an example.
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything!
This looks good.
I'm gonna eat it.
- Wow, I feel like Madonna.
- You wish!
Seats ten comfortably.
Hey, pass me one of those glasses.
Yeah, I see your point.
Oh.
Goldberg!
- It wasn't me, all right!
- Young man, what did you eat?
- Nothing!
It wasn't me!
- Open a window!
Oh, man!
It's my mom!
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.
All right, out!
Everybody, out of the car right now.
Goldberg, why'd you have to ruin the fun?
Are you out of your mind?
What were you thinking putting that car on the ice?
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take.
One crack!
- The ice is not gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
- The new coach?
They send you over here to coach the team and you endanger their lives.
What danger?
I grew up on the ice;
I know when it's safe to drive on.
- How do you know?
- I just know!
All right?
Well, listen, Mr. Zen Master, you may be in tune with the ice universe, but when it comes to my kid, "I just know" doesn't cut it.
Charlie, let's go.
- Mom?
- Give me my candy!
All of it!
Well, I guess practise is over.
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- It's all right, Charlie.
Coach, gonna be at the game tomorrow?
By order of the state of Minnesota, yeah.
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
- Hi, girls.
- Karp!
No!
Goodbye.
The hawks.
My first game and it had to be the Hawks.
Gordon?
Gordon Bombay.
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.
Why don't you just call meJack?
Hey, come back to see your old coach, huh?
Well, actually I'm, uh, coaching...
Pee Wee.
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'.
You got a kid on the team or something?
No, I'm here because I need to be of service to the community.
How about this, huh?
Whoever thought we'd be coaching' against each other?
Yeah, who'd have thought?
So, who's your hotshot player this year?
- Anyone good?
- I got a kid named Banks.
Might go all the way.
Not quite as good as you were.
But he wants it more.
Kid won't give up.
Oh, boy,
I wish they would take that one down.
Don't you?
Well, good luck.
You're gonna need it.
It's up to you, Gordon.
You miss this shot, you're not just... letting me down, you're letting your whole team down too.
I wish your dad could be here to see this.
Make him proud of you!
Win!
Win!
Win!
All right, guys, gather round.
Come on, come on.
- Win!
Win!
Win!
- Win.
Win.
Win!
Win!
Win!
- Win?
- Win!
Win!
Win!
Yeah, we're fired up.
All right!
Watch this!
Oh, great.
Good concept, guys.
Nice - ouch!
Nice goin', fool!
- Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
- Oh, yeah, "I didn't mean to. "
Yeah, sure, you're on my own team.
Oh, sorry, Goldberg.
Didn't mean to.
Would you get off me before I clock you?
Let's go,Jesse!
Go, Terry!
Let's go!
Come on in.
What's this?
The Oreo line!
Hey, come on.
Let's play hockey.
Um, batter, batter, hum, batter, batter!
Hey, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Hum, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Averman!
It's hockey!
There's no batter.
Idiot.
Hum, goalie, goalie, hum, goalie, goalie!
Hey, goalie, goalie, save, goalie, goalie!
Hum, goalie, goalie, hey, goalie, goalie!
No, I got him!
I, I, I got him!
That's one!
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy!
Good show.
Sloppy pass.
Way to stuff it, Banks!
All right, all right!
Let's run it up!
Run it up!
Run it up!
Oh, man!
How could you let him get by you?
All right, line change.
Come on, go, go, go.
Hey!
Banks!
Banks!
Banks!
Hey, you!
Come back here!
Oh!
Why me?
How lazy can you be?
They're killing us out there!
How many times do I have to tell you:
Get those rebounds, get your heads up, get those loose pucks.
Get
- Just -
Just get the hell outta here.
All right!
It's Spaz-way.
He'll screw up.
Hey, hey!
Way to play it, Banks!
All right!
That's okay, Charlie!
Nice try!
Nice fan, Charlie.
Keep swingin'.
Maybe you'll give 'em a cold.
Hey, hey, hey, knock it off!
Against this team we should have twice this many!
Now let's run it up!
Remember it's not worth winning if you can't win big!
All right!
Guys!
No!
Come on, let's talk about this!
Be civilized!
Come on!
Please!
Oh no, guys!
Come on, not again!
Please!
Just take the goal.
Fine!
I don't care!
- I'm so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.
All right!
Hey, knock it off!
That was a lousy third period.
Anybody could beat these pansies.
I want you guys to stay hungry out there!
All right, nice goin', Banks.
New Hawks record.
- Okay, boys.
Let's go.
- All right!
Hey, Gordon!
Nice game.
I enjoyed it thoroughly.
At least I can handle the puck!
Hey, shut up!
You guys stink!
I thought we came here to play hockey.
You know, I knew we forgot something.
Oh, you think it's funny?
You think losing is funny?
Well, not at first, but once you get the hang of it.
We're the ones out there gettin' our butts kicked.
Yeah, it's not like you coach us or anything.
At least we try.
You didn't listen to a word I said.
I said, keep your heads up.
You put your heads down.
I said, hustle.
You went slower!
That was the sloppiest playing I've ever seen.
Why the hell don't you just listen to me?
Why the hell should we?
I don't care.
You want to lose, fine.
You're the ones who look like idiots out there.
Great game!
Hans?
I don't believe it!
Who would throw these away?
- First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
- Fork it over.
Forget it, Karp.
I can see this every day on MTV.
This one's from Minneapolis.
Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom.
- Let's give him a wedgie.
- Good idea,Jesse!
I was just kidding, okay?
Hey!
Give that back!
- Hi, girls.
- Does your mommy know you have that?
Nah, she's busy with the mailman.
That'll make great bathroom reading.
That's mine, you jerk!
I found it!
You don't even know what to do with it, wuss-breath.
- You gonna let him call you wuss-breath?
- No!
Hey!
Hey!
- Oh!
- Come on.
Want some more?
You guys want some more?
Come on!
Yeah!
You want some more?
Come on!
Let's get out!
Move it!
- Thanks a lot.
- All right, man.
One, two, three!
Boom!
What are you laughing at, cream cheese boy?
Go!
If we're gonna cheat, we gotta make those falls look real.
Keep it up!
Whoa!
Score one for the spirit.
Go at him!
Go at him!
Good!
Go at him!
Come on, get angry!
Oh!
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt!
I am hurt.
Good, good.
Now say it again!
Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
- One more time!
- Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
Good!
You guys are ready.
Give me a break, ref!
Open your eyes!
Did you see what he did to me?
Goldberg, you don't take the fall while they're shooting at you.
Oh!
Well, I guess you didn't explain that very well, did ya?
- District Five!
- I throw myself on the ice -
Cut the acting class.
One more dive, I forfeit to theJets!
What?
I'm insulted by that!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
- Quit it!
Face-off!
Let's go!
Charlie!
That guy is twice your size.
The next time he gets you in a corner like that,
I want you to grab your eye like it's cut and then hit the ice!
- Got it?
Let's go.
- Let's go!
Face-off!
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
Here we go.
Hey -
- Come on!
- That's it, Charlie.
- That's it, Charlie!
- Come on!
Damn it, Charlie!
We can't even win when we cheat.
- Stupid cake-eater tricks!
- That was embarrassing.
Charlie!
What the hell is the matter with you?
When I tell you to do something, you do it!
You got it?
Look at me.
- You got it?
- You can't make me cheat.
Jesse, Terry, let's go.
This is what I gave up my overtime pay for?
To see my kids takin' falls?
Gordon.
- How did you know?
- Through the back door at this time of night.
Just like you used to.
You'd spend hours watching me do this.
What do you think?
Is this sharp enough?
Ow!
- Did you cut yourself?
- No.
You always fell for that.
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, I'm Scandinavian.
- It's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.
You probably thought I was dead.
I saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything?
You were so busy screaming at the kids.
I didn't want to spoil the moment.
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.
Why should my store?
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that?
Well, I hardly ever lose a case.
That is not what I asked.
Hmm!
I see you still have this up.
- Thanks very much.
- It is important to remember the past.
I'd just as soon forget it.
That was the worse time in my life.
My dad died that year.
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.
I found this not long ago.
He was proud of you.
I miss him.
You scored 198 goals in that season, Gordon.
It's a shame you quit.
You -
- Could have gone all the way.
Yeah.
- No!
You really loved to play.
You remember?
You remember... you used to play on the ponds until after dark, until your father called you back.
You really flew on that ice, Gordon.
That's all I ever wanted to do.
Then why did you stop?
Reilly?
I saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.
- The guy wins.
- It's not about winning.
It never was.
Just show they how to play.
Show them how to have fun.
Teach them to fly.
That is what they'll remember long after you've gone back to being a doctor.
Lawyer.
And long after they've stopped buying skates from me.
Here... there you are.
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.
- What's this?
- Your new skates.
That is why you came here tonight, isn't it?
- I figured nine and a half was your size.
- Actually, I'm a nine.
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.
Here comes Bombay on an end-to-end rush.
Past the blue line, past centre.
He's not skating, he's flying!
He fakes once, he fakes twice.
Fakes three times!
Shoots!
Scores!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
What a play!
What a guy!
Gordon Bombay does it again!
Great move, Gordy!
You faked him out of his pads.
Come here, son.
You look great out there.
Come on, let's go inside, get something to eat.
A few more minutes?
Please?
- Go on.
Get outta here.
- Thanks.
- Hi, uh -
- Please,just go away.
Charlie doesn't want... to be on the team any more, and neither he nor I have anything to say to you.
- Well, I have something to say to you.
- Oh, really?
Door-to-door mistreatment now.
Now the team can feel miserable between games too, huh?
I came to apologize to Charlie...
to both of you.
- What?
- Apologize.
Well... you should.
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin'?
I was just, uh, walkin' around thinkin' and, uh -
Wanna give us a minute?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Listen, it was very wrong of me... to ask you and the other guys to cheat.
I never should have said to you what I said to you.
I was angry.
I was frustrated.
It took a lot of guts for you to do what you knew was right.
I admire that.
And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that, uh, that I'm -
Oh, boy, this is difficult.
- I'm -
- You're sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right?
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be a lot more fun this time around.
What do you say?
Do you want to stay for dinner?
- What?
- Charlie!
Uh, no, I - I can't.
Uh -
Well, what are you havin'?
Mr. Ducksworth, there are two reasons I came by.
First off, I want to let you know things are going well.
I'm learning a lot about teamwork, fair play and all that junk.
Good, good.
And the second thing?
Well, sir, fair play doesn't come cheap.
These kids, my team, have no money.
They can't afford rink time, safe equipment, proper uniforms, which makes it difficult for them to compete.
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old and stepping out onto that ice... with old copies of the " Enquirer" taped to your shins instead of pads.
The point I'm trying to make, sir, is that you wouldn't be taken seriously and neither are these kids.
So I thought maybe the firm could help 'em out.
How much are we talking about?
- $15,000.
- No way.
Wait a minute.
Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross, the firm that gives back to the community.
Come on.
I'll get you your own jersey.
~ Ooo,yeah ~
~ Can you feel it baby Ooo ~
~I can too, Ooo ~
~ Ooo ~
~ Ooo, come on swing ~
~ Come on swing ~
~ Come on swing ~
~ C-Come on swing Ooo ~
~ Ooo ~
~It's such a good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
~It's such a good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
Who is that kid?
Thanks, Fulton.
- Fulton Reed.
He's in one of my classes.
- How come he's not on the team?
He only plays football.
Some preppie school gave him a scholarship... as long as he doesn't play hockey.
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- I heard it was colleges.
He's been accepted to four of'em.
- Yeah, but I heard he's got to repeat the sixth grade.
- Ah, shut up.
Gordon Bombay?
Bombay was a Hawk.
~...
Good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
~Feel the vibration It's such a good vibration ~~
Dude, check 'em out, man.
Holy cow.
- They're pretty good skaters.
- Anybody know who they are?
That's Tommy Duncan.
He's in my science class.
That's his sister, Tammy.
- Think they'd want to play hockey with us?
- Yeah!
Go get dressed.
I'll do the negotiating.
Just think of it as figure skating... with a stick.
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy!
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive!
Mom isn't gonna like this at all.
So what?
You want me to figure skate, then you gotta play hockey.
What do I know about hockey?
More than you think.
Back to basics!
Skating!
Go!
Go!
Side to side.
Shift your weight.
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.
That's okay, Charlie.
Soft hands.
You don't shoot the puck to your teammate.
You sail it to him.
Karp, on your feet.
- You send it.
- Oh!
Gross!
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it.
Cradle it.
- Oh!
- Again!
Concentration, not strength.
Like the Karate Kid, right?
"Wax on!
Wax off!"
Just shut up and try it, Averman!
- You're such a jerk.
- Send it back, Averman.
Good, Averman.
Charlie.
That's good.
Good.
Now sail it back.
Oh!
Way to go!
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.
Oh!
Here it comes.
Nice and easy.
Good.
- I did it!
I did it!
- All right.
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.
- But when are you gonna work with me in goal?
- Goldberg, do you trust me?
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar mitzvah'd.
This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.
Coach, I think you got the ceremonies mixed up.
It's more like a circumcision.
Coach!
Will you come back here?
What'd I ever do to you, man?
District Five!
Ready!
Oh, man, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
- Aim!
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.
- Oh, please!
No!
- Fire!
I wanna go home!
This doesn't hurt!
You wimps!
Give me your best shot!
Oh!
Come on!
That's good!
Hex goal!
Goalie boot save!
Whoa!
Nice shot, man!
I'm a dog!
I'm a crazed dog!
Come on!
Goldberg!
Goldberg!
I am Goldberg!
The goalie!
Good!
Good!
All right, Charlie!
Good hustle!
Conway, way to go.
All right, Karp!
- You guys hungry?
Tired?
- Yeah!
- Do you ache?
Are you pumped up?
- Yeah!
Good!
That was a hell of a practise.
Be proud of yourself.
Hey, guys!
Excuse me, guys!
You gotta untie me now!
Ha-ha!
Good joke.
Very funny.
I like it.
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach!
Coach, come on, don't leave me hangin' like this!
Coach, don't make me come after you, coach.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Thanks for the ride.
You did real well in practise today, Charlie.
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad?
Mom and I left him.
I don't really remember, but that's what she says.
You know, when I was a boy, I had to take care of my mother too.
Really?
What happened to your dad?
He passed away.
You do a good job takin' care of your mom.
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right?
- Okay.
We'll see ya.
- Okay.
Hey, coach.
- What's that?
- Huh?
- Oh!
- Victory!
You've just entered the tickling zone!
So I'm right in the middle of my cross-examination and I say to the guy,
I usually defend heels like you, you scuzzy, mole-faced rat.
That's a good one, sir.
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Look, it was an accident, all right?
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
I didn't learn.
I just do it.
Do it again.
Yargh!
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal?
Yeah.
Well, one out of five.
Fulton, is it true what they say?
About the scholarships and how they won't let you play hockey?
People talk.
It don't mean nothin'.
- Why don't you play for us?
- I can't.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I can't.
- You afraid?
- No, I mean I can't, you moron.
I don't know how to skate.
Whoa!
Is that all that's stoppin' ya?
~I ride the top of the line I can't settle for less ~
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.
Side to side, good!
Follow me.
Aaah!
Watch it!
Get out of the way!
Sorry!
~ This is all we got baby It's got to be enough ~
~I'd like to try to quit But I don't know how ~
~I needed it then and baby I need it right now ~
Come on, Fulton.
Let's go!
- ~I gotta keep movin' 'til I'm satisfied ~
- Hey!
~ Come on, Come on It's gonna be all right ~~
The Ducks?
We're the Ducks?
Man, what brain-dead jerk came up with that name?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But I didn't have a choice.
We're being sponsored.
By who?
Donald and Daisy?
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks?
You'd rather be District Five?
Some stupid number?
Better than some stupid animal.
I'll have you know, Peter, that the Duck is one of the most noble, agile and intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom.
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.
Neither do hockey players.
Have you guys ever seen a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation?
It's beautiful.
Pretty awesome the way they all stick together.
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight?
No way.
Why?
Because the other animals are afraid.
They know that if they mess with one duck, they gotta deal with the whole flock.
Oh, man!
I'm proud to be a duck.
And I'd be proud to fly with any one of you.
So how about it?
Who's a Duck?
I'll be a Duck.
Yeah.
Me too.
Anybody see Goldberg?
All right!
Now we're the Ducks!
The Mighty Ducks!
- What are we?
- The Ducks!
What the hell are they doing?
Every time you get the puck, you're the quarterback.
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.
Come on, guys.
This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.
What a weird-ass team.
How you doin'?
- You ready?
- I think so.
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.
My God!
Wow!
One out of five.
All right, Let's forget the past.
We lost a few games, tough!
That was District Five.
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right!
Yeah!
Quack, quack.
- Quack.
Quack.
- Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Go...
Ducks!
What the hell was that?
Let's go, Ducks!
Defence!
Defence!
Dig it outta there!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Let's go, Ducks!
Throw it!
Throw it!
To the crease!
Yes!
The Oreo line!
That's my boy!
Defence, Karp!
Defence!
Come on.
I don't wanna go to school today, Mom.
- How many fingers am I holding' up?
- He wouldn't know.
Shut up, Peter.
Karp, are you okay?
- Look at this.
- The Karp-ster used his head to stop the puck.
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.
Get him on the bench, Charlie.
Okay, Ducks, we still got a chance here.
Connie, Terry,Jesse, Guy, time for the secret weapon.
Okay, Fulton.
Remember,just like we talked about.
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.
Oh, no.
- Go!
Get the face-off!
- Line up, boys, let's go.
That's it.
Aaah!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Yeah!
That tie of yours might be what you need to make the play-offs.
- The ducks have a shot at the play-offs?
- Sure.
Everyone but the last two teams are in, remember?
Panthers got the measles and they forfeited the season.
So,you beat the Huskies and you'll make the play-offs.
- Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
- So?
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since I played.
Actually, one little thing has changed.
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.
They redrew the district lines last year.
The lake is not the boundary any more.
You see?
You'd be a Duck.
I'd be a Duck.
Excuse me.
Coach Reilly?
- Yeah?
- I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.
- What's that?
- One of your players is ineligible.
Banks!
Over here!
- This is a joke, right?
- I'm afraid it's no joke.
- Problem?
- No,just a mistake.
Are you this boy's father?
450 North Hennipen, is that your address?
- Yes.
- I'm afraid there's no mistake.
- This boy is playing for the wrong team.
- What?
According to league rules, Adam Banks should be playing for District Five.
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- Is this your doing, Gordon?
I'll expect to see him at our next game.
- We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
- No way.
My son would rather not play than play for your team.
Fine, if that's the way you want it.
But remember, if Adam plays for the Hawks, you'll forfeit every game for the rest of the season.
Boy, I'd hate to see that.
Look, I'm sorry this had to happen, but you can see on the map.
Gordon?
Hey, Bombay!
You stop when I'm talking to you, son!
What's the idea here?
You trying to sabotage me or what?
The law's a bitch when it works against you, isn't it,Jack?
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.
Even with Banks, what do you think you're gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers?
That's right, coach.
They are losers.
We hate losers, don't we?
They don't even deserve to live.
Maybe Banks won't make a difference, but at least we're playing by the rules.
Why'd you turn against me, Gordon?
For six years...
I taught ya how to skate, I taught ya how to score.
I taught ya how to go for the "W."
You could have been one of the greats.
And now look at yourself.
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.
Going to the play-offs!
Whoo!
One win!
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.
All right, everyone, listen up.
I got some good news.
We're getting a new player, Adam Banks.
What?
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.
- We don't need him.
- I'm the coach.
I say we do need him.
- If we make it to the play-offs, he could be a big help.
- If?
All of a sudden you don't think we're good enough.
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.
- What?
- We heard what you said.
You said we were losers, we didn't deserve to live.
- That's not what I meant.
- I saw that picture of you missing that goal.
You were a Hawk, weren't you?
Guess you guys stick together to the end.
You know what?
I don't need your stinkin'equipment.
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.
- I'm talkin' to you, son!
- Forget it, cake-eater.
If you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.
Where do you guys think you're goin'?
I don't believe this.
All right, I'm goin' up to the bench because that's where I'm supposed to be.
Anyone who wants to join me can join me.
Anyone who doesn't -
Well -
Ten minutes to game time, coach.
Yeah, yeah, they'll be out in a minute.
They're, you know, working themselves into a frenzy.
Not much of a frenzy.
We forfeit.
Ducks forfeit.
Flames, you win.
Hey.
Can I sit?
Sure.
You talk to the guys?
I tried.
They think I'm a traitor for even showing up.
I guess they really hate me, huh?
Is it true you were really a Hawk?
Yeah.
Peter said you blew a really big game once.
Yeah, well, Peter's right.
It was the last game of the state finals.
We were tied 2-2 in the end of the third period.
I get a penalty shot.
I go in, I triple deke.
I fake the goalie right out of his pads.
The puck's headed in, and then...
Clang!
Hits the post.
We lost in overtime.
A quarter of an inch this way and it would have gone in.
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way and you'd have missed completely.
I never thought of it that way.
At least you got to play in a championship game.
- That must've been so cool.
- Hey.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
I'd love one.
You know, she has many fine qualities that men find attractive.
I know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.
So, what kind of guys does she usually date?
Jerks.
I mean, most of them like her, but as soon as they catch a glimpse of me -
Pow!
Warp speed!
They are gone!
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, I wouldn't even care... except it's not fair to my mom.
She deserves somebody nice.
Are you gonna come over for dinner again?
I don't know, Charlie.
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
See, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I, um, talked toJesse and Terry's dad, and he's gonna take over coaching for the rest of the year.
- You're quitting?
- I'm stepping aside to keep the team together.
The guys can't play for somebody they don't trust.
I trust you.
The other guys do too.
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.
- I've done all I can.
- No, you haven't.
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.
We are too!
We weren't even the Ducks until you came along.
You made us and now you're stuck with us.
Charlie.
That's right.
The red is oxygen.
Now what are the blue balls?
- Tommy?
- Hydrogen?
Is correct.
Now put them together... and you have a molecule that makes up 96% of your body.
- What is it?
- Pizza?
It's the principal.
I'll be right back.
Work on H2 CO3.
It's a goody.
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way?
- Yeah, did you score?
Leave me alone, guys.
I don't want to talk about the team.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.
Everybody knows he likes you best.
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp!
Take it back now!
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl!
- Lay off!
- Don't shove, Peter.
Atoms away!
My atoms!
You!
Sit!
Sit now!
In your seats now!
I have never in my life -
What have you got to say for yourselves?
Quack.
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!
Thanks for coming by on such short notice, Gordon.
By the way, your court release came through.
- Congratulations.
Your community service is over.
- You're kidding.
So you wanted to talk about my coming back to work then?
- Well, actually -
- Oh, you got your jersey.
Great!
A lot's been happening.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.
Gordon, you know Coach Reilly and Mr. Banks.
Sir, they're the bad guys.
No, actually, Phil is one of my oldest friends.
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together here to try to work out this little problem.
You see, my son Adam wants to play for the Hawks.
His older brother was a Hawk.
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.
It's a tradition.
You understand that, Gordon.
You played.
But the league's already ruled on it.
We've talked to the league, and we worked out a little deal.
- You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League?
- Yes, we did.
The long and short of it is that Adam stays on the Hawks for the rest of the season.
And then next year, they redraft the lines.
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.
What's that?
That you withdraw your protest.
- That's great.
- Good, good.
Well, that's settled then.
No, sir, you don't understand.
I can't withdraw my protest.
- What?
- Mr. Ducksworth, you wanted me to learn about fair play... and how to be part of a team... and I may not have learned everything yet, but I remember something my father said to me.
A team isn't a bunch of kids out to win.
A team is something you belong to, something you feel, something you have to earn.
And I'm not gonna let those kids down.
Gordon, I'm going to make this simple.
Are you prepared to lose your job over some kids?
Some game?
Let me ask you, sir.
Are you prepared to fire me over some kids?
Some game?
Collect your personal belongings, Gordon.
Yes, sir, Mr. Ducksworth!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth!
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.
You may have paid for this jersey, sir, but you didn't earn it.
I'll see you in the play-offs.
- Excuse me.
There are some students here that I'd like to see.
- Who are you?
I'm their hockey coach.
If you could tell me where I can find each of them, please.
They're in room 223.
- All of them?
- All of them.
"I will not quack at the principal. "
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you guys.
- People.
- People, right.
Sit down, please.
All of you.
Okay, don't sit down.
Look, what's done is done.
I want to be your coach again.
You're gonna coach a bunch of losers?
- No, I want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said?
You said we didn't deserve to live.
Karp, I was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means?
- No.
- Okay, then you do.
I didn't mean those things the way they sounded.
You guys know what it's like to be misunderstood, right?
- Yeah, of course.
We're kids.
- So...
Can you forgive me?
Can I be your coach again?
- What about Banks?
- He can be on the team if he wants.
He should have been with us all year.
It's you guys who were cheated.
Let's forget all that crap!
- We're a team, right?
- Yeah.
I made you guys, and I'm sticking with you.
So, what's it gonna be?
We can play tomorrow night and still have a shot at the play-offs... or we can forfeit again and the season's over.
Peter, what do you say?
Well...
I guess it would help if we practised first.
All right.
Let me see if I can get you out of detention.
- Yes.
- Take that.
You really quacked at the principal?
Yeah.
Are we Ducks, or what?
Yeah!
Look at your mother.
Let's see how it is in ten minutes.
I'm gonna kill you!
Hey.
Wasn't sure if you'd show up.
Yeah, whatever.
- I just want to play hockey.
- Good.
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.
On behalf of the Ducks, I'd like to say welcome.
Cake-eater.
Ooh, theJess-man, dissin'the new guy!
TheJess-ster!
Shut up, Averman!
It's just a joke.
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey doesn't mean you're a real Duck.
- They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
- I bet.
Well, suit up.
I'll see you on the ice.
On your left!
Over here!
I'm open!
Come on, right here!
Up front!
- Up front!
- Pass it to Banks!
Come on!
Do somethin' with it!
Yeah!
All right!
Way to go, Banks!
All right!
Score another one for the Ducks!
Goldberg, you're gonna sit this one out.
What?
You're pulling the goalie when we're tied?
Listen, listen, listen!
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.
Okay, Fulton, you're our extra man.
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.
- We pulling the Statue of Liberty play?
- Yeah?
No, take your shot.
You may only get one, so it's gotta be good.
- But, coach, one outta one?
- Soft hands, Fulton.
- Concentration, not strength.
- That's right!
Okay?
Let's get the Huskies!
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one.
Let's go!
- Get in there!
- Come on!
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!
Shoot, Fulton, shoot!
We won!
We made the play-offs!
Boy, this is great.
Guys, look, it's the North Stars.
- Oh, man.
- It's Mike Modano!
- ...
Believe this?
- Cool!
This is too cool.
I can't believe this.
This place is humongous.
What are we doing here?
It's a little play-offs present.
Hey, Gordo!
Gordon Bombay, right?
- You remember me?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- I heard you were a farmer.
Actually, I became a lawyer.
But I'm coaching Pee Wee now and this is my team, the Ducks.
- Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
- We can see that.
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks!
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.
If you ever want a shot, I'll get you a tryout in the minor league clubs.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, nice seein' ya.
Take it easy.
All right, let's have some fun!

- Hey!
- Hey!
~Don't you mess with Mister In-between ~~
You know, I heard the North Stars wore the same underwear... all through the play-offs last year for luck.
So I'm doin' the same thing.
Hmm.
Maybe I should've cooked.
You know, I'm thinkin' maybe we can all go down to the winter festival tonight.
- All three of us?
- Sure.
I don't think I should, 'cause I got a lot of homework.
You should go.
With my mom.
By yourselves.
Mmm, smells great!
Hello.
Go for it.
Hi.
I don't know how they sculpt these.
Hmm, I wonder.
I used to sculpt, but now I do mostly paintings.
How do you think they do the details?
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.
Oh.
I'm nervous.
I'm rambling on and on here.
You probably think I'm weird.
No, I think you're great.
When I was a little girl, I used to pretend that that was an ice castle.
And that was my room, that window right up there.
And last winter I gave Charlie that one.
What about me?
Which window's mine?
I want to live there too.
What?
What did I say?
- It's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy?
Casey, I was just playin' around.
Look, I don't know how you feel about me.
I don't even know how I feel about you.
But I do know there's a little kid back home... who's absolutely falling in love with his coach... and if you can't deal with that, if you're just playing around, then you better let me know.
What are we talking?
'Til death do us part?
- I have to decide on the first date?
- Stop it, Gordon.
Charlie's gonna be there when we get back.
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.
Look, I can take it.
But if Charlie gets too attached -
Every time this happens, it gets... a little rougher on him.
Just on him?
I'm glad to be here with you.
Me too.
The surprising Ducks are still in this game... against the Hornets.
Banks moving right in front, stops.
He shoots, he scores!
It's getting rough out there between the Ducks and the Hornets.
Here's Adam Banks in the slot.
He stops, shoots.
He scores!
Back it goes to Averman.
He shoots!
Score!
The ducks win it, 5-3 over the Hornets.
And now it's on to the semifinals... where the Ducks will face the Cardinals.
What a game so far, ladies and gentlemen!
The Ducks and the Cardinals!
Cardinals with it in their own zone, tryin'to clear it out.

He scores!
Come on!
Come on,Jesse!
Ducks with it again.
Here's Averman, now getting it over to Banks.
Germaine is right in the slot.
Germaine with it!
He shoots, he scores!
Germaine put it off the goaltender's glove into the net!
And that does it!
The Ducks have won!
Can you believe it?
4-2, and the Ducks now get set to face the Hawks in the state finals.
All right, it's up to you, Gordon.
Now,you miss this shot, you're not just letting your team down, you're letting me down too.
Remember, it's not worth playing -
- If you can't win.
- That's right.
Okay, son, let's go.
Let's go, son!
~...
Oh, say does that star-spangled ~
~Banner yet wave ~
~ O'er the land of the free ~
~And the home of the brave ~~
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
All right!

Let's fly!
Come on, let's go!
All right, pressure, boys.
Pressure, pressure!
All right, hold it, hold it.
I want you to drop Banks like a bad habit.
I want him outta the game.

You got it?

Okay, boys, let's go.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right!

He's injured.
Oh, my God.
Come on, son, let's go.
Come on.
Number seven, McGill.
Cross-checking.
Two minutes.
Don't worry, guys.
Did it go in?
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favour.
Kick some Hawk butt.
All right, cake-eater.
He'll be okay, sir.
We need to take some X rays, though.
Hell of a job, son.
They score against us, they're gonna pay the price.
Now, don't worry.
We're gonna get that one back.
You got somethin' to say to me, Bombay?
To think I wasted all those years worrying about what you thought.
You're goin' down, Reilly.
- Let me go after 'em, coach.
Let me get 'em.
- No, we're better than that.
Look, look, it's time to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.
- All right?
Now we got the power play.
- Yeah.
All right.
We're gonna hit 'em where it hurts the most: up there.
Fulton, you're in.
- Coach, they'll be rushing' him.
- Right.
Jesse, make sure you give Fulton plenty of time.
- Right, coach.
- Jesse, do good.
Let's go!
- Yeah!
- Hold it!
Wait!
Whoa!
Let's have fun out there.
- All right!
- All right!
Let's go!
Let's go!
The Ducks trail 3-1, and now they call on number 44, Fulton Reed...

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
Yes!
That's it!
More fun!
More fun!
Of all the sloppy ass
- Ladies, they don't need our help out there!
Now I want that Fulton Reed covered.
He better not make another shot.
You got it?
I'm tellin' you, you blow this game and nobody makes the team next year!
All right, get out there!
Quick feet, now!
Quick feet!
The puck comes around, now to Blake on the right side.
Blake through the slot with a backhand.
Scores!
Blake with a backhanded goal, and the Hawks regain the two goal lead at 4-2.
Guys, guys, guys, listen up, listen.
We have got to stay fired up and focused, all right?
It ain't over 'til it's over.
Tammy, Tommy, let's show these Hawks something really different.
Come here.
All right.
I want you guys to start up here -
Third period and the Ducks trail 4-2, trying desperately to get back in the game.

- Come on.
- Come on!
Now!
Tammy Duncan shoots, she scores!
Yes!
Yes!
We're still alive!
I'm on, coach.
Yes, we're still in there!
He Grabs McGill from behind... and throws him over the boards into the bench.
Now he wants to pick a fight with the entire Hawks team.
Fulton Reed has to be restrained by the referee.
Game misconduct.
You're outta here, son.
I'm off, coach.
He barely touched him.
Oreo line!
I want you to remember what we learned.
- Ducks stick together, right?
- Yeah!
So let's see it!
Show me the flying "V."
- All right!
- All right!
Let's get a line change!
Let's go!
Here we go!
Come on, y'all, let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
Flying "V"!
Jesse Hall goes behind his own net, joined by the rest of his team.
Here they come from behind the net!
It's the flying "V"!
Come on!
Come on!

They stay onside the blue line.
Jesse Hall with it, trying to come down the slot.
Moves down the right side, now in front of the net.

With the score tied 4-4, the next goal will decide the championship.
Tremendous pressure.
Neither team can afford any mistakes now.
23 seconds left to go in regulation.
Looking for the game-winning goal, here's Morgan moving into the slot.
He shoots and a big save.
Big save, Goldberg!
We'll get 'em in overtime!
Score tied at four.
Now Averman ahead to Charlie Conway.
- Come on, Charlie.
- Conway to centre ice on a breakaway!
Conway moving across the Hawk blue line, down the middle!
He could win the game!
Hey!
Where's the call?
No time left on the clock, but the referee is calling a penalty shot!
What kind of call is that?
Okay, we've got a penalty shot for the Ducks.
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.
All right, Ducks, who's gonna take it?
- I think he should take it.
- Me?
What about Charlie?
- What about Charlie?
- All he does is fan.
Let's let him finish what he started.
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.
Come here.
You been practising that triple deke?
- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.
You may make it, you may not.
But that doesn't matter, Charlie.
What matters is that we're here.
Look around.
Whoever thought we'd make it this far?
One, two, three.
Triple deke.
Take your best shot.
I believe in you, Charlie, win or lose.
- Thanks, coach.
- Go get 'em.
- All right, Charlie.
- Let's go, Charlie.
Okay, now wait for my signal.
Good luck.
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...
Okay, now don't leave your crease before he touches the puck.
Good luck.
Come on, Charlie.
Come on, Charlie.

Anything else?
Yeah.
Have fun out there, coach.
I must be crazy.
A tryout with the minors.

Just have a good tryout, Gordon.
One step at a time.
Yeah, you're right.
Bye.
I'll call you when I get there.
Banks is first in line next!

...The Minnesota Pee Wee Championship is up for grabs.
Both teams playing like there's no tomorrow.
Duluth, in the Hawks'zone, looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.
There's a pass out to the blue line.
Intercepted by Gordon Bombay!
Bombay!
He's got a breakaway.
Across the blue line all alone for a chance to win the game!
He's pulled down from behind by Fox of Duluth.
Fox definitely pulled him down from behind and this could be -
Yes, the referee calls for a penalty shot.
Gordon, it's up to you.
I don't wanna see any goats around after the game.
You got it?
Now, you miss this shot... you're not just lettin' me down, you're lettin' your team down.
Apressure situation he's in now.
The 1973 Pee Wee State Championship now rests... on the little shoulders of number 9, Gordon Bombay.
Gordon!
Gordon!
Let's go, son!
All right!
He hit the goalpost!
What a heartbreaker!
Little Gordon Bombay had the chance -
All my client did was attempt to give you what you wanted!
Isn't that right?
This man put his neck on the line for your greed.
Objection.
Your Honour?
Will both counsellors approach the bench?
What's he doing?
I don't have anything to tell you.
I just wanna make a point.
So nod like I'm saying something important.
- Mr. Bombay?
- Gordon, what are you doing?
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.
This drives him nuts and I love it.
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya?
Oh, Mr. Bombay, I'm so glad you could make it.
Please restrict yourself to a relevant cross-examination!
Your Honour, the applicability of societal intent... vis-a-vis individual action is well established.
I'm citing Minneapolis V. Higgins.
The appellant court overruled a judge who disallowed similar testimony.
Now, if I'm not mistaken, that was... you.
Wasn't it,Judge Weathers?
I stand corrected, counsellor.
Objection overruled.
Oh,you really stooped to an all-time low on this, Bombay.
I'm insulted, Frank.
You have no idea how low I can stoop.
I don't mind losing.
I would just like to lose fair.
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.
And what about justice?
That man should be in jail.
It was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me!
Next time do your job, Frankie boy.
- 30 and 0!
I remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case?
We don't count that one because I scored with the court reporter.
- The one you said had the intelligent body?
- That's the one.
- No calls on the Duck phone?
- Not yet.
What's he waiting for?
I saw him in the back of the courtroom.
How about some kudos here, huh?
Mr. Tolbert dropped off ringside seats for tonight's North Stars game.
Hockey?
Forget it!
Gordon, here's the research for the Pearlstein Project.
- Can you get started?
- Jane!
Can't you see I'm reveling here?
Today I'm 30 and 0!
- 30 and one.
- Type,Jeannie, don't speak.
Mr. Bombay's office.
Yes.
It's Ducksworth.
You're right.
He wants to see you.
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
It was nothing, Mr. Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth.
Gordon, another fine job today.
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.
Score.
Don't spike.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean, sir.
This is a business.
It isn't a game.
Next time a little restraint might be in order.
~Hey, man, get off my back I'm doin'the best I can,yeah ~
~ You bust my neck Cut no slack ~
- ~Forget your fellow man Yeah yeah uh-huh ~
- Pull your vehicle over to the right, now!
- This is not good.
- ~ Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah ~
- Licence, please.
- Could you turn down the stereo?
- Sure.
I guess it was a "widdle" noisy.
A "widdle"?
Okay, I'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine?
No, thanks, I'm full.
Okay, out of the car.
Now.
The charges against Mr. Bombay are driving under the influence, driving with an open container and reckless endangerment.
And to think I almost stayed home this morning.
I assume you're representing yourself?
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a licence?
Okay, let's talk business.
What am I facing?
Suspension of licence?
Fines?
What?
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow you to plead guilty to lesser charges.
But that's solely up to the prosecutor.
The city of Minneapolis does not wish to pursue a plea bargain in this case.
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo?
The defendant is released on his own recognizance.
Mr. Ducksworth.
What are you doing here?
I own the place.
How about you?
Just goin' over a few cases.
RICOH Statute stuff.
Oh, I thought you might be researching your defence... against D.U.I. and reckless endangerment.
Did you think I wouldn't find out, Gordon?
There was no reason to concern you with it, sir.
They have no case.
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp.
I found a loophole.
I'm gonna plead not guilty -
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.
There's not going to be a trial.
I am not going to have you drag... this firm's good name through the mud.
I've talked toJudge Weathers and he has agreed to suspend your case.
- Under what conditions?
- Probation, suspension of your driver's licence... and 500 hours of community service.
And a leave of absence from the firm.
A leave of absence?
He can't do that.
- He can't stop me from working!
- He's not.
I am.
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.
It'll teach you compassion, a sense of fair play, how to fit in.
- Community service?
This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.
And hopefully you'll come back a better person and a better attorney, which is why I'm keeping you on salary and have arranged a driver for you.
You know, in the early '7 Os I drove the tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties, amps cranked up to about eight jillion decibels.
All that loud music damaged my hearing, but I got no regrets...
- except for the '80s.
- How could he do this to me?
Community service...
coaching hockey!
I found one!
I'm comin' out!
Karp,you finally found something for once in your life.
Dumpster Dave comes through!
- What do you think?
- Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.
- You gonna take that from him, Karp?
- Remind me to bust you, Averman.
- Thanks, Peter.
Thanks very much.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah!
Right there!
- Yeah!
Here, Petie.
Here, boy.
A little chili to keep you warm, buddy.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look!
I can't believe he ate the can too.
He sniffs.
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.
He sniffs some more.
He stops.
I think this is it!
He's turnin' in a circle.
- He squats!
He scores!
- Yes!
We did it!
Full load.
Stinks!
Come on, come on, give me the dollar!
- Hurry it up already.
- I'm hurrying', okay?
- Go, go, go, go!
- Yeah!
All right!
Let's do it!
Oh, come on.
Stop!
- Yes!
- Okay!
Here we go.
Yeah.
There's more inside.
He's takin'off with it.
This guy deserves what he gets.
Oh, guys, he saw us.
Oh, my!
Rink's gotta be around here someplace.
Just look for a sign that says " Personal Hell. "
How could he do this to me?
I hate kids.
They're barely human.
Come on!
Over here!
Keep it down, please!
Hey, come on.
There's no need for this.
Let's talk, come on.
I'm your friend, aren't I?
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to stop it.
I'm tired of chasing' the puck.
Be careful, man.
It almost hit me that time.
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
It's supposed to hit you.
Does that sound stupid to anyone else?
Good God.
That's the hockey team.
Drive out on the ice.
It'll be all right.
I ain't scared.
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.
We're gonna get in big trouble.
- I'll take care of it.
- They're drugs, I just know it.
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.
This is my dominion.
This is a drug-free zone, you understand?
We ain't buying' nothin'.
I'm feelin' generous today.
So I'm gonna let you get your sorry vanilla bootie outta here... before we be usin' your eyeballs as hockey pucks.
Thanks, bro, but I'm not goin' home 'til I take care of business.
He's got a gun.
Stand back.
Whew!
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.
I'm Gordon Bombay.
I'm the new coach.
What a joke!
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.
Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.
Here's the long and the short of it.
I hate hockey and I don't like kids.
What's this supposed to be, a pep talk?
I'm sure this'll be a real bonding experience.
Maybe one day one of you will even write a book about it in jail.
- Funny.
- Is there a goalie?
Only for a little while.
I'm movin' back to Philly.
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.
Uh,just so you know.
We really suck.
I'll decide who sucks around here.
- Get off me.
- They really suck.
The Pete-meister.
Mr. Rabble-rouser.
Passing the puck over toJesse-roonie, the enforcer.
Ouch!
That hurt!
Oh, it's the Connie-meister, the velvet hammer.
Hi, coach.
I'm Connie.
- Do you play?
- No.
So what's our record anyway?
0 and 9.
One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.
We almost scored a goal too.
So what do we do now... coach?
- What did your old coach have you do?
- He just yelled a lot.
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm?
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us, " Little bastards, where'd you learn to play?
Oh, you suck, you!
Skate, you little bast-"
Heart attack.
Great.
All right, look.
I gotta make a phone call.
Keep scrimmaging.
You, you, you, you and you against you four.
- We got names, you know?
- I'm sure you do.
And I'll bet they're very nice names.
I might even learn 'em.
For now, I'll be in my office.
Oh, and if you need anything, fax me.
Geez, what a jerk.
Where do they find these coaches anyways?
We're impressionable kids, right?
Shouldn't we check his qualifications or somethin'?
Jeannie, who told you not to give me my messages?
Ducksworth!
Then who's handling my cases?
- On three!
- Jane!
- One, two, three!
Charge!
- Are you kidding me?
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to -
Hold on a second!
Hey!
Get your mouth off the windows!
- Hey!
- Get off there!
Get off the car!
- We're being invaded!
- Get off!
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool!
- Is that a real phone?
- Yes, and I'm really on it.
- Not any more.
- Thank you.
- Let's see, who should I -
- Watch the upholstery.
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
- We wanna ride!
- I could kill one of'em just to set an example.
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything!
This looks good.
I'm gonna eat it.
- Wow, I feel like Madonna.
- You wish!
Seats ten comfortably.
Hey, pass me one of those glasses.
Yeah, I see your point.
Oh.
Goldberg!
- It wasn't me, all right!
- Young man, what did you eat?
- Nothing!
It wasn't me!
- Open a window!
Oh, man!
It's my mom!
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.
All right, out!
Everybody, out of the car right now.
Goldberg, why'd you have to ruin the fun?
Are you out of your mind?
What were you thinking putting that car on the ice?
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take.
One crack!
- The ice is not gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
- The new coach?
They send you over here to coach the team and you endanger their lives.
What danger?
I grew up on the ice;
I know when it's safe to drive on.
- How do you know?
- I just know!
All right?
Well, listen, Mr. Zen Master, you may be in tune with the ice universe, but when it comes to my kid, "I just know" doesn't cut it.
Charlie, let's go.
- Mom?
- Give me my candy!
All of it!
Well, I guess practise is over.
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- It's all right, Charlie.
Coach, gonna be at the game tomorrow?
By order of the state of Minnesota, yeah.
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
- Hi, girls.
- Karp!
No!
Goodbye.
The hawks.
My first game and it had to be the Hawks.
Gordon?
Gordon Bombay.
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.
Why don't you just call meJack?
Hey, come back to see your old coach, huh?
Well, actually I'm, uh, coaching...
Pee Wee.
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'.
You got a kid on the team or something?
No, I'm here because I need to be of service to the community.
How about this, huh?
Whoever thought we'd be coaching' against each other?
Yeah, who'd have thought?
So, who's your hotshot player this year?
- Anyone good?
- I got a kid named Banks.
Might go all the way.
Not quite as good as you were.
But he wants it more.
Kid won't give up.
Oh, boy,
I wish they would take that one down.
Don't you?
Well, good luck.
You're gonna need it.
It's up to you, Gordon.
You miss this shot, you're not just... letting me down, you're letting your whole team down too.
I wish your dad could be here to see this.
Make him proud of you!
Win!
Win!
Win!
All right, guys, gather round.
Come on, come on.
- Win!
Win!
Win!
- Win.
Win.
Win!
Win!
Win!
- Win?
- Win!
Win!
Win!
Yeah, we're fired up.
All right!
Watch this!
Oh, great.
Good concept, guys.
Nice - ouch!
Nice goin', fool!
- Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
- Oh, yeah, "I didn't mean to. "
Yeah, sure, you're on my own team.
Oh, sorry, Goldberg.
Didn't mean to.
Would you get off me before I clock you?
Let's go,Jesse!
Go, Terry!
Let's go!
Come on in.
What's this?
The Oreo line!
Hey, come on.
Let's play hockey.
Um, batter, batter, hum, batter, batter!
Hey, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Hum, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Averman!
It's hockey!
There's no batter.
Idiot.
Hum, goalie, goalie, hum, goalie, goalie!
Hey, goalie, goalie, save, goalie, goalie!
Hum, goalie, goalie, hey, goalie, goalie!
No, I got him!
I, I, I got him!
That's one!
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy!
Good show.
Sloppy pass.
Way to stuff it, Banks!
All right, all right!
Let's run it up!
Run it up!
Run it up!
Oh, man!
How could you let him get by you?
All right, line change.
Come on, go, go, go.
Hey!
Banks!
Banks!
Banks!
Hey, you!
Come back here!
Oh!
Why me?
How lazy can you be?
They're killing us out there!
How many times do I have to tell you:
Get those rebounds, get your heads up, get those loose pucks.
Get
- Just -
Just get the hell outta here.
All right!
It's Spaz-way.
He'll screw up.
Hey, hey!
Way to play it, Banks!
All right!
That's okay, Charlie!
Nice try!
Nice fan, Charlie.
Keep swingin'.
Maybe you'll give 'em a cold.
Hey, hey, hey, knock it off!
Against this team we should have twice this many!
Now let's run it up!
Remember it's not worth winning if you can't win big!
All right!
Guys!
No!
Come on, let's talk about this!
Be civilized!
Come on!
Please!
Oh no, guys!
Come on, not again!
Please!
Just take the goal.
Fine!
I don't care!
- I'm so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.
All right!
Hey, knock it off!
That was a lousy third period.
Anybody could beat these pansies.
I want you guys to stay hungry out there!
All right, nice goin', Banks.
New Hawks record.
- Okay, boys.
Let's go.
- All right!
Hey, Gordon!
Nice game.
I enjoyed it thoroughly.
At least I can handle the puck!
Hey, shut up!
You guys stink!
I thought we came here to play hockey.
You know, I knew we forgot something.
Oh, you think it's funny?
You think losing is funny?
Well, not at first, but once you get the hang of it.
We're the ones out there gettin' our butts kicked.
Yeah, it's not like you coach us or anything.
At least we try.
You didn't listen to a word I said.
I said, keep your heads up.
You put your heads down.
I said, hustle.
You went slower!
That was the sloppiest playing I've ever seen.
Why the hell don't you just listen to me?
Why the hell should we?
I don't care.
You want to lose, fine.
You're the ones who look like idiots out there.
Great game!
Hans?
I don't believe it!
Who would throw these away?
- First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
- Fork it over.
Forget it, Karp.
I can see this every day on MTV.
This one's from Minneapolis.
Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom.
- Let's give him a wedgie.
- Good idea,Jesse!
I was just kidding, okay?
Hey!
Give that back!
- Hi, girls.
- Does your mommy know you have that?
Nah, she's busy with the mailman.
That'll make great bathroom reading.
That's mine, you jerk!
I found it!
You don't even know what to do with it, wuss-breath.
- You gonna let him call you wuss-breath?
- No!
Hey!
Hey!
- Oh!
- Come on.
Want some more?
You guys want some more?
Come on!
Yeah!
You want some more?
Come on!
Let's get out!
Move it!
- Thanks a lot.
- All right, man.
One, two, three!
Boom!
What are you laughing at, cream cheese boy?
Go!
If we're gonna cheat, we gotta make those falls look real.
Keep it up!
Whoa!
Score one for the spirit.
Go at him!
Go at him!
Good!
Go at him!
Come on, get angry!
Oh!
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt!
I am hurt.
Good, good.
Now say it again!
Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
- One more time!
- Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
Good!
You guys are ready.
Give me a break, ref!
Open your eyes!
Did you see what he did to me?
Goldberg, you don't take the fall while they're shooting at you.
Oh!
Well, I guess you didn't explain that very well, did ya?
- District Five!
- I throw myself on the ice -
Cut the acting class.
One more dive, I forfeit to theJets!
What?
I'm insulted by that!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
- Quit it!
Face-off!
Let's go!
Charlie!
That guy is twice your size.
The next time he gets you in a corner like that,
I want you to grab your eye like it's cut and then hit the ice!
- Got it?
Let's go.
- Let's go!
Face-off!
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
Here we go.
Hey -
- Come on!
- That's it, Charlie.
- That's it, Charlie!
- Come on!
Damn it, Charlie!
We can't even win when we cheat.
- Stupid cake-eater tricks!
- That was embarrassing.
Charlie!
What the hell is the matter with you?
When I tell you to do something, you do it!
You got it?
Look at me.
- You got it?
- You can't make me cheat.
Jesse, Terry, let's go.
This is what I gave up my overtime pay for?
To see my kids takin' falls?
Gordon.
- How did you know?
- Through the back door at this time of night.
Just like you used to.
You'd spend hours watching me do this.
What do you think?
Is this sharp enough?
Ow!
- Did you cut yourself?
- No.
You always fell for that.
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, I'm Scandinavian.
- It's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.
You probably thought I was dead.
I saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything?
You were so busy screaming at the kids.
I didn't want to spoil the moment.
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.
Why should my store?
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that?
Well, I hardly ever lose a case.
That is not what I asked.
Hmm!
I see you still have this up.
- Thanks very much.
- It is important to remember the past.
I'd just as soon forget it.
That was the worse time in my life.
My dad died that year.
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.
I found this not long ago.
He was proud of you.
I miss him.
You scored 198 goals in that season, Gordon.
It's a shame you quit.
You -
- Could have gone all the way.
Yeah.
- No!
You really loved to play.
You remember?
You remember... you used to play on the ponds until after dark, until your father called you back.
You really flew on that ice, Gordon.
That's all I ever wanted to do.
Then why did you stop?
Reilly?
I saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.
- The guy wins.
- It's not about winning.
It never was.
Just show they how to play.
Show them how to have fun.
Teach them to fly.
That is what they'll remember long after you've gone back to being a doctor.
Lawyer.
And long after they've stopped buying skates from me.
Here... there you are.
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.
- What's this?
- Your new skates.
That is why you came here tonight, isn't it?
- I figured nine and a half was your size.
- Actually, I'm a nine.
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.
Here comes Bombay on an end-to-end rush.
Past the blue line, past centre.
He's not skating, he's flying!
He fakes once, he fakes twice.
Fakes three times!
Shoots!
Scores!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
What a play!
What a guy!
Gordon Bombay does it again!
Great move, Gordy!
You faked him out of his pads.
Come here, son.
You look great out there.
Come on, let's go inside, get something to eat.
A few more minutes?
Please?
- Go on.
Get outta here.
- Thanks.
- Hi, uh -
- Please,just go away.
Charlie doesn't want... to be on the team any more, and neither he nor I have anything to say to you.
- Well, I have something to say to you.
- Oh, really?
Door-to-door mistreatment now.
Now the team can feel miserable between games too, huh?
I came to apologize to Charlie...
to both of you.
- What?
- Apologize.
Well... you should.
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin'?
I was just, uh, walkin' around thinkin' and, uh -
Wanna give us a minute?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Listen, it was very wrong of me... to ask you and the other guys to cheat.
I never should have said to you what I said to you.
I was angry.
I was frustrated.
It took a lot of guts for you to do what you knew was right.
I admire that.
And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that, uh, that I'm -
Oh, boy, this is difficult.
- I'm -
- You're sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right?
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be a lot more fun this time around.
What do you say?
Do you want to stay for dinner?
- What?
- Charlie!
Uh, no, I - I can't.
Uh -
Well, what are you havin'?
Mr. Ducksworth, there are two reasons I came by.
First off, I want to let you know things are going well.
I'm learning a lot about teamwork, fair play and all that junk.
Good, good.
And the second thing?
Well, sir, fair play doesn't come cheap.
These kids, my team, have no money.
They can't afford rink time, safe equipment, proper uniforms, which makes it difficult for them to compete.
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old and stepping out onto that ice... with old copies of the " Enquirer" taped to your shins instead of pads.
The point I'm trying to make, sir, is that you wouldn't be taken seriously and neither are these kids.
So I thought maybe the firm could help 'em out.
How much are we talking about?
- $15,000.
- No way.
Wait a minute.
Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross, the firm that gives back to the community.
Come on.
I'll get you your own jersey.
~ Ooo,yeah ~
~ Can you feel it baby Ooo ~
~I can too, Ooo ~
~ Ooo ~
~ Ooo, come on swing ~

~It's such a good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
~It's such a good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
Who is that kid?
Thanks, Fulton.
- Fulton Reed.
He's in one of my classes.
- How come he's not on the team?
He only plays football.
Some preppie school gave him a scholarship... as long as he doesn't play hockey.
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- I heard it was colleges.
He's been accepted to four of'em.
- Yeah, but I heard he's got to repeat the sixth grade.
- Ah, shut up.
Gordon Bombay?
Bombay was a Hawk.
[..
Good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
~Feel the vibration It's such a good vibration ~~
Dude, check 'em out, man.
Holy cow.
- They're pretty good skaters.
- Anybody know who they are?
That's Tommy Duncan.
He's in my science class.
That's his sister, Tammy.
- Think they'd want to play hockey with us?
- Yeah!
Go get dressed.
I'll do the negotiating.
Just think of it as figure skating... with a stick.
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy!
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive!
Mom isn't gonna like this at all.
So what?
You want me to figure skate, then you gotta play hockey.
What do I know about hockey?
More than you think.
Back to basics!
Skating!
Go!
Go!
Side to side.
Shift your weight.
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.
That's okay, Charlie.
Soft hands.
You don't shoot the puck to your teammate.
You sail it to him.
Karp, on your feet.
- You send it.
- Oh!
Gross!
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it.
Cradle it.
- Oh!
- Again!
Concentration, not strength.
Like the Karate Kid, right?
"Wax on!
Wax off!"
Just shut up and try it, Averman!
- You're such a jerk.
- Send it back, Averman.
Good, Averman.
Charlie.
That's good.
Good.
Now sail it back.
Oh!
Way to go!
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.
Oh!
Here it comes.
Nice and easy.
Good.
- I did it!
I did it!
- All right.
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.
- But when are you gonna work with me in goal?
- Goldberg, do you trust me?
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar mitzvah'd.
This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.
Coach, I think you got the ceremonies mixed up.
It's more like a circumcision.
Coach!
Will you come back here?
What'd I ever do to you, man?
District Five!
Ready!
Oh, man, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
- Aim!
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.
- Oh, please!
No!
- Fire!
I wanna go home!
This doesn't hurt!
You wimps!
Give me your best shot!
Oh!
Come on!
That's good!
Hex goal!
Goalie boot save!
Whoa!
Nice shot, man!
I'm a dog!
I'm a crazed dog!
Come on!
Goldberg!
Goldberg!
I am Goldberg!
The goalie!
Good!
Good!
All right, Charlie!
Good hustle!
Conway, way to go.
All right, Karp!
- You guys hungry?
Tired?
- Yeah!
- Do you ache?
Are you pumped up?
- Yeah!
Good!
That was a hell of a practise.
Be proud of yourself.
Hey, guys!
Excuse me, guys!
You gotta untie me now!
Ha-ha!
Good joke.
Very funny.
I like it.
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach!
Coach, come on, don't leave me hangin' like this!
Coach, don't make me come after you, coach.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Thanks for the ride.
You did real well in practise today, Charlie.
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad?
Mom and I left him.
I don't really remember, but that's what she says.
You know, when I was a boy, I had to take care of my mother too.
Really?
What happened to your dad?
He passed away.
You do a good job takin' care of your mom.
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right?
- Okay.
We'll see ya.
- Okay.
Hey, coach.
- What's that?
- Huh?
- Oh!
- Victory!
You've just entered the tickling zone!
So I'm right in the middle of my cross-examination and I say to the guy,
I usually defend heels like you, you scuzzy, mole-faced rat.
That's a good one, sir.
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Look, it was an accident, all right?
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
I didn't learn.
I just do it.
Do it again.
Yargh!
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal?
Yeah.
Well, one out of five.
Fulton, is it true what they say?
About the scholarships and how they won't let you play hockey?
People talk.
It don't mean nothin'.
- Why don't you play for us?
- I can't.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I can't.
- You afraid?
- No, I mean I can't, you moron.
I don't know how to skate.
Whoa!
Is that all that's stoppin' ya?
~I ride the top of the line I can't settle for less ~
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.
Side to side, good!
Follow me.
Aaah!
Watch it!
Get out of the way!
Sorry!
~ This is all we got baby It's got to be enough ~
~I'd like to try to quit But I don't know how ~
~I needed it then and baby I need it right now ~
Come on, Fulton.
Let's go!
- ~I gotta keep movin' 'til I'm satisfied ~
- Hey!
~ Come on, Come on It's gonna be all right ~~
The Ducks?
We're the Ducks?
Man, what brain-dead jerk came up with that name?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But I didn't have a choice.
We're being sponsored.
By who?
Donald and Daisy?
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks?
You'd rather be District Five?
Some stupid number?
Better than some stupid animal.
I'll have you know, Peter, that the Duck is one of the most noble, agile and intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom.
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.
Neither do hockey players.
Have you guys ever seen a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation?
It's beautiful.
Pretty awesome the way they all stick together.
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight?
No way.
Why?
Because the other animals are afraid.
They know that if they mess with one duck, they gotta deal with the whole flock.
Oh, man!
I'm proud to be a duck.
And I'd be proud to fly with any one of you.
So how about it?
Who's a Duck?
I'll be a Duck.
Yeah.
Me too.
Anybody see Goldberg?
All right!
Now we're the Ducks!
The Mighty Ducks!
- What are we?
- The Ducks!
What the hell are they doing?
Every time you get the puck, you're the quarterback.
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.
Come on, guys.
This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.
What a weird-ass team.
How you doin'?
- You ready?
- I think so.
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.
My God!
Wow!
One out of five.
All right, Let's forget the past.
We lost a few games, tough!
That was District Five.
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right!
Yeah!
Quack, quack.
- Quack.
Quack.
- Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Go...
Ducks!
What the hell was that?
Let's go, Ducks!
Defence!
Defence!
Dig it outta there!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Let's go, Ducks!
Throw it!
Throw it!
To the crease!
Yes!
The Oreo line!
That's my boy!
Defence, Karp!
Defence!
Come on.
I don't wanna go to school today, Mom.
- How many fingers am I holding' up?
- He wouldn't know.
Shut up, Peter.
Karp, are you okay?
- Look at this.
- The Karp-ster used his head to stop the puck.
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.
Get him on the bench, Charlie.
Okay, Ducks, we still got a chance here.
Connie, Terry,Jesse, Guy, time for the secret weapon.
Okay, Fulton.
Remember,just like we talked about.
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.
Oh, no.
- Go!
Get the face-off!
- Line up, boys, let's go.
That's it.
Aaah!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Yeah!
That tie of yours might be what you need to make the play-offs.
- The ducks have a shot at the play-offs?
- Sure.
Everyone but the last two teams are in, remember?
Panthers got the measles and they forfeited the season.
So,you beat the Huskies and you'll make the play-offs.
- Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
- So?
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since I played.
Actually, one little thing has changed.
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.
They redrew the district lines last year.
The lake is not the boundary any more.
You see?
You'd be a Duck.
I'd be a Duck.
Excuse me.
Coach Reilly?
- Yeah?
- I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.
- What's that?
- One of your players is ineligible.
Banks!
Over here!
- This is a joke, right?
- I'm afraid it's no joke.
- Problem?
- No,just a mistake.
Are you this boy's father?
450 North Hennipen, is that your address?
- Yes.
- I'm afraid there's no mistake.
- This boy is playing for the wrong team.
- What?
According to league rules, Adam Banks should be playing for District Five.
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- Is this your doing, Gordon?
I'll expect to see him at our next game.
- We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
- No way.
My son would rather not play than play for your team.
Fine, if that's the way you want it.
But remember, if Adam plays for the Hawks, you'll forfeit every game for the rest of the season.
Boy, I'd hate to see that.
Look, I'm sorry this had to happen, but you can see on the map.
Gordon?
Hey, Bombay!
You stop when I'm talking to you, son!
What's the idea here?
You trying to sabotage me or what?
The law's a bitch when it works against you, isn't it,Jack?
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.
Even with Banks, what do you think you're gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers?
That's right, coach.
They are losers.
We hate losers, don't we?
They don't even deserve to live.
Maybe Banks won't make a difference, but at least we're playing by the rules.
Why'd you turn against me, Gordon?
For six years...
I taught ya how to skate, I taught ya how to score.
I taught ya how to go for the "W."
You could have been one of the greats.
And now look at yourself.
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.
Going to the play-offs!
Whoo!
One win!
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.
All right, everyone, listen up.
I got some good news.
We're getting a new player, Adam Banks.
What?
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.
- We don't need him.
- I'm the coach.
I say we do need him.
- If we make it to the play-offs, he could be a big help.
- If?
All of a sudden you don't think we're good enough.
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.
- What?
- We heard what you said.
You said we were losers, we didn't deserve to live.
- That's not what I meant.
- I saw that picture of you missing that goal.
You were a Hawk, weren't you?
Guess you guys stick together to the end.
You know what?
I don't need your stinkin'equipment.
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.
- I'm talkin' to you, son!
- Forget it, cake-eater.
If you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.
Where do you guys think you're goin'?
I don't believe this.
All right, I'm goin' up to the bench because that's where I'm supposed to be.
Anyone who wants to join me can join me.
Anyone who doesn't -
Well -
Ten minutes to game time, coach.
Yeah, yeah, they'll be out in a minute.
They're, you know, working themselves into a frenzy.
Not much of a frenzy.
We forfeit.
Ducks forfeit.
Flames, you win.
Hey.
Can I sit?
Sure.
You talk to the guys?
I tried.
They think I'm a traitor for even showing up.
I guess they really hate me, huh?
Is it true you were really a Hawk?
Yeah.
Peter said you blew a really big game once.
Yeah, well, Peter's right.
It was the last game of the state finals.
We were tied 2-2 in the end of the third period.
I get a penalty shot.
I go in, I triple deke.
I fake the goalie right out of his pads.
The puck's headed in, and then...
Clang!
Hits the post.
We lost in overtime.
A quarter of an inch this way and it would have gone in.
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way and you'd have missed completely.
I never thought of it that way.
At least you got to play in a championship game.
- That must've been so cool.
- Hey.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
I'd love one.
You know, she has many fine qualities that men find attractive.
I know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.
So, what kind of guys does she usually date?
Jerks.
I mean, most of them like her, but as soon as they catch a glimpse of me -
Pow!
Warp speed!
They are gone!
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, I wouldn't even care... except it's not fair to my mom.
She deserves somebody nice.
Are you gonna come over for dinner again?
I don't know, Charlie.
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
See, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I, um, talked toJesse and Terry's dad, and he's gonna take over coaching for the rest of the year.
- You're quitting?
- I'm stepping aside to keep the team together.
The guys can't play for somebody they don't trust.
I trust you.
The other guys do too.
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.
- I've done all I can.
- No, you haven't.
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.
We are too!
We weren't even the Ducks until you came along.
You made us and now you're stuck with us.
Charlie.
That's right.
The red is oxygen.
Now what are the blue balls?
- Tommy?
- Hydrogen?
Is correct.
Now put them together... and you have a molecule that makes up 96% of your body.
- What is it?
- Pizza?
It's the principal.
I'll be right back.
Work on H2 CO3.
It's a goody.
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way?
- Yeah, did you score?
Leave me alone, guys.
I don't want to talk about the team.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.
Everybody knows he likes you best.
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp!
Take it back now!
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl!
- Lay off!
- Don't shove, Peter.
Atoms away!
My atoms!
You!
Sit!
Sit now!
In your seats now!
I have never in my life -
What have you got to say for yourselves?
Quack.
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!
Thanks for coming by on such short notice, Gordon.
By the way, your court release came through.
- Congratulations.
Your community service is over.
- You're kidding.
So you wanted to talk about my coming back to work then?
- Well, actually -
- Oh, you got your jersey.
Great!
A lot's been happening.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.
Gordon, you know Coach Reilly and Mr. Banks.
Sir, they're the bad guys.
No, actually, Phil is one of my oldest friends.
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together here to try to work out this little problem.
You see, my son Adam wants to play for the Hawks.
His older brother was a Hawk.
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.
It's a tradition.
You understand that, Gordon.
You played.
But the league's already ruled on it.
We've talked to the league, and we worked out a little deal.
- You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League?
- Yes, we did.
The long and short of it is that Adam stays on the Hawks for the rest of the season.
And then next year, they redraft the lines.
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.
What's that?
That you withdraw your protest.
- That's great.
- Good, good.
Well, that's settled then.
No, sir, you don't understand.
I can't withdraw my protest.
- What?
- Mr. Ducksworth, you wanted me to learn about fair play... and how to be part of a team... and I may not have learned everything yet, but I remember something my father said to me.
A team isn't a bunch of kids out to win.
A team is something you belong to, something you feel, something you have to earn.
And I'm not gonna let those kids down.
Gordon, I'm going to make this simple.
Are you prepared to lose your job over some kids?
Some game?
Let me ask you, sir.
Are you prepared to fire me over some kids?
Some game?
Collect your personal belongings, Gordon.
Yes, sir, Mr. Ducksworth!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth!
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.
You may have paid for this jersey, sir, but you didn't earn it.
I'll see you in the play-offs.
- Excuse me.
There are some students here that I'd like to see.
- Who are you?
I'm their hockey coach.
If you could tell me where I can find each of them, please.
They're in room 223.
- All of them?
- All of them.
"I will not quack at the principal. "
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you guys.
- People.
- People, right.
Sit down, please.
All of you.
Okay, don't sit down.
Look, what's done is done.
I want to be your coach again.
You're gonna coach a bunch of losers?
- No, I want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said?
You said we didn't deserve to live.
Karp, I was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means?
- No.
- Okay, then you do.
I didn't mean those things the way they sounded.
You guys know what it's like to be misunderstood, right?
- Yeah, of course.
We're kids.
- So...
Can you forgive me?
Can I be your coach again?
- What about Banks?
- He can be on the team if he wants.
He should have been with us all year.
It's you guys who were cheated.
Let's forget all that crap!
- We're a team, right?
- Yeah.
I made you guys, and I'm sticking with you.
So, what's it gonna be?
We can play tomorrow night and still have a shot at the play-offs... or we can forfeit again and the season's over.
Peter, what do you say?
Well...
I guess it would help if we practised first.
All right.
Let me see if I can get you out of detention.
- Yes.
- Take that.
You really quacked at the principal?
Yeah.
Are we Ducks, or what?
Yeah!
Look at your mother.
Let's see how it is in ten minutes.
I'm gonna kill you!
Hey.
Wasn't sure if you'd show up.
Yeah, whatever.
- I just want to play hockey.
- Good.
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.
On behalf of the Ducks, I'd like to say welcome.
Cake-eater.
Ooh, theJess-man, dissin'the new guy!
TheJess-ster!
Shut up, Averman!
It's just a joke.
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey doesn't mean you're a real Duck.
- They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
- I bet.
Well, suit up.
I'll see you on the ice.
On your left!
Over here!
I'm open!
Come on, right here!
Up front!
- Up front!
- Pass it to Banks!
Come on!
Do somethin' with it!
Yeah!
All right!
Way to go, Banks!
All right!
Score another one for the Ducks!
Goldberg, you're gonna sit this one out.
What?
You're pulling the goalie when we're tied?
Listen, listen, listen!
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.
Okay, Fulton, you're our extra man.
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.
- We pulling the Statue of Liberty play?
- Yeah?
No, take your shot.
You may only get one, so it's gotta be good.
- But, coach, one outta one?
- Soft hands, Fulton.
- Concentration, not strength.
- That's right!
Okay?
Let's get the Huskies!
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one.
Let's go!
- Get in there!
- Come on!
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!
Shoot, Fulton, shoot!
We won!
We made the play-offs!
Boy, this is great.
Guys, look, it's the North Stars.
- Oh, man.
- It's Mike Modano!
- ...
Believe this?
- Cool!
This is too cool.
I can't believe this.
This place is humongous.
What are we doing here?
It's a little play-offs present.
Hey, Gordo!
Gordon Bombay, right?
- You remember me?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- I heard you were a farmer.
Actually, I became a lawyer.
But I'm coaching Pee Wee now and this is my team, the Ducks.
- Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
- We can see that.
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks!
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.
If you ever want a shot, I'll get you a tryout in the minor league clubs.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, nice seein' ya.
Take it easy.
All right, let's have some fun!

You know, I heard the North Stars wore the same underwear... all through the play-offs last year for luck.
So I'm doin' the same thing.
Hmm.
Maybe I should've cooked.
You know, I'm thinkin' maybe we can all go down to the winter festival tonight.
- All three of us?
- Sure.
I don't think I should, 'cause I got a lot of homework.
You should go.
With my mom.
By yourselves.
Mmm, smells great!
Hello.
Go for it.
Hi.
I don't know how they sculpt these.
Hmm, I wonder.
I used to sculpt, but now I do mostly paintings.
How do you think they do the details?
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.
Oh.
I'm nervous.
I'm rambling on and on here.
You probably think I'm weird.
No, I think you're great.
When I was a little girl, I used to pretend that that was an ice castle.
And that was my room, that window right up there.
And last winter I gave Charlie that one.
What about me?
Which window's mine?
I want to live there too.
What?
What did I say?
- It's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy?
Casey, I was just playin' around.
Look, I don't know how you feel about me.
I don't even know how I feel about you.
But I do know there's a little kid back home.... who's absolutely falling in love with his coach.... and if you can't deal with that, if you're just playing around, then you better let me know.
What are we talking?
'Til death do us part?
- I have to decide on the first date?
- Stop it, Gordon.
Charlie's gonna be there when we get back.
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.
Look, I can take it.
But if Charlie gets too attached -
Every time this happens, it gets... a little rougher on him.
Just on him?
I'm glad to be here with you.
Me too.
The surprising Ducks are still in this game... against the Hornets.
Banks moving right in front, stops.
He shoots, he scores!
It's getting rough out there between the Ducks and the Hornets.
Here's Adam Banks in the slot.
He stops, shoots.
He scores!
Back it goes to Averman.
He shoots!
Score!
The ducks win it, 5-3 over the Hornets.
And now it's on to the semifinals... where the Ducks will face the Cardinals.
What a game so far, ladies and gentlemen!
The Ducks and the Cardinals!
Cardinals with it in their own zone, tryin'to clear it out.
Pass to the blue line, intercepted by the Ducks.
Here's their star, Adam Banks.
Banks has great speed.
Right down the middle!
Goes around one man with a great move!
Steps around another defender!
He scores!
Come on!
Come on,Jesse!
Ducks with it again.
Here's Averman, now getting it over to Banks.
Germaine is right in the slot.
Germaine with it!
He shoots, he scores!
Germaine put it off the goaltender's glove into the net!
And that does it!
The Ducks have won!
Can you believe it?
4-2, and the Ducks now get set to face the Hawks in the state finals.
All right, it's up to you, Gordon.
Now,you miss this shot, you're not just letting your team down, you're letting me down too.
Remember, it's not worth playing -
- If you can't win.
- That's right.
Okay, son, let's go.
Let's go, son!
[..
Oh, say does that star-spangled ~

- Let's go!
All right!
Welcome to the Minnesota State Pee Wee Championship.
Have we got a game for you today.
The Hawks, coached byJack Reilly.
Win, win, win, win, win!
Win, win, win, win!
Win, win, win, win, win!
Ducks, let's fire it up!
Come on, let's get fired up!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Go...
Ducks!
Let's go!
Hey, Banks.
Don't forget what side you're on.
He's a Duck,Jesse.
He'll play like a Duck.
And the game is underway, and right off Larson and McGill with a heavy hit.
That gives you an indication of what you're going to see tonight.
Good hit!
That's the way I want you guys to play it!
The Ducks in green chasing it down against -
A hard hit out at centre ice!
Keep it away from 'em!
Come on, Banks!
Heavy hitting continues in this championship game.
Banks up the centre ice.
He drives it down into the Hawks'zone.
Back in again to Larson, the man behind the net.
Go, go, go!
Get it out of there!
Banks, two comin' hard!
Banks still looking for an opening, moves it up -
Banks gets knocked down against the boards.
The puck is intercepted by the Hawks.
Here's Larson, over to Brown.
Brown, in front, goes backhand.
He scores!
Come on!
Hustle!
Come on, you guys!
Hawks with a 1-0 lead, come back to centre ice.
Larson gives it up to McGill.
Here's McGill, inside, the lead at centre ice.
He's up on the blue line and around the net.
And he scores!
And now the Hawks lead 2-0.
Good save, Goldberg!
All right, all right!
That's the kind of hockey...
I want to see played all day, boys.
Larson stopped at the blue line, but the Ducks can't clear it out.
McGill to Brown, left side.
He shoots!
He scores!
The Hawks lead late in the first period, 3-0.
Don't be scared of them, Ducks.
That's what they want.
Keep your heads up.
Play proud.
Let's fly!
Come on, let's go!
All right, pressure, boys.
Pressure, pressure!
All right, hold it, hold it.
I want you to drop Banks like a bad habit.
I want him outta the game.
- Finish him off.
You got it?
- Yeah.
Okay, boys, let's go.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right!
Face-off for the second period, and the Hawks win the draw.
They get it back to Stickler.

McGill knocked him down from behind, but Banks scored.
Adam.
Adam, are you okay?
- What'd you do?
- My job.
Okay, we need the paramedics in.
He's injured.
Oh, my God.
Come on, son, let's go.
Come on.
Number seven, McGill.
Cross-checking.
Two minutes.
Don't worry, guys.
Did it go in?
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favour.
Kick some Hawk butt.
All right, cake-eater.
He'll be okay, sir.
We need to take some X rays, though.
Hell of a job, son.
They score against us, they're gonna pay the price.
Now, don't worry.
We're gonna get that one back.
You got somethin' to say to me, Bombay?
To think I wasted all those years worrying about what you thought.
You're goin' down, Reilly.
- Let me go after 'em, coach.
Let me get 'em.
- No, we're better than that.
Look, look, it's time to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.
- All right?
Now we got the power play.
- Yeah.
All right.
We're gonna hit 'em where it hurts the most: up there.
Fulton, you're in.
- Coach, they'll be rushing' him.
- Right.
Jesse, make sure you give Fulton plenty of time.
- Right, coach.
- Jesse, do good.
Let's go!
- Yeah!
- Hold it!
Wait!
Whoa!
Let's have fun out there.
- All right!
- All right!
Let's go!
Let's go!
The Ducks trail 3-1, and now they call on number 44, Fulton Reed...
Get the face-off!
...who has a big, booming shot.
And the Ducks get it back to Fulton Reed.
Hall clears the front of the net.
Here's Reed winding.
He scores!
Fulton Reed has scored, and the Ducks are back in the game!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
Yes!
That's it!
More fun!
More fun!
Of all the sloppy ass
- Ladies, they don't need our help out there!
Now I want that Fulton Reed covered.
He better not make another shot.
You got it?
I'm tellin' you, you blow this game and nobody makes the team next year!
All right, get out there!
Quick feet, now!
Quick feet!
The puck comes around, now to Blake on the right side.
Blake through the slot with a backhand.
Scores!
Blake with a backhanded goal, and the Hawks regain the two goal lead at 4-2.
Guys, guys, guys, listen up, listen.
We have got to stay fired up and focused, all right?
It ain't over 'til it's over.
Tammy, Tommy, let's show these Hawks something really different.
Come here.
All right.
I want you guys to start up here -
Third period and the Ducks trail 4-2, trying desperately to get back in the game.
The Ducks with Tammy and Tommy Duncan on the ice.
Tammy Duncan goes in front of the net, Tommy with the puck.
Tammy's spinning, and the Hawks are just looking at her.
- Come on.
- Come on!
Now!
Tammy Duncan shoots, she scores!
Yes!
Yes!
We're still alive!
I'm on, coach.
Yes, we're still in there!
He Grabs McGill from behind... and throws him over the boards into the bench.
Now he wants to pick a fight with the entire Hawks team.
Fulton Reed has to be restrained by the referee.
Game misconduct.
You're outta here, son.
I'm off, coach.
He barely touched him.
Oreo line!
I want you to remember what we learned.
- Ducks stick together, right?
- Yeah!
So let's see it!
Show me the flying "V."
- All right!
- All right!
Let's get a line change!
Let's go!
Here we go!
Come on, y'all, let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
Flying "V"!
Jesse Hall goes behind his own net, joined by the rest of his team.
Here they come from behind the net!
It's the flying "V"!
Come on!
Come on!
Terry Hall, with the puck, moves the puck ahead to brotherJesse.
They stay onside the blue line.
Jesse Hall with it, trying to come down the slot.
Moves down the right side, now in front of the net.
Jesse scores!
With the score tied 4-4, the next goal will decide the championship.
Tremendous pressure.
Neither team can afford any mistakes now.
23 seconds left to go in regulation.
Looking for the game-winning goal, here's Morgan moving into the slot.
He shoots and a big save.
Big save, Goldberg!
We'll get 'em in overtime!
Score tied at four.
Now Averman ahead to Charlie Conway.
- Come on, Charlie.
- Conway to centre ice on a breakaway!
Conway moving across the Hawk blue line, down the middle!
He could win the game!
Hey!
Where's the call?
No time left on the clock, but the referee is calling a penalty shot!
What kind of call is that?
Okay, we've got a penalty shot for the Ducks.
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.
All right, Ducks, who's gonna take it?
- I think he should take it.
- Me?
What about Charlie?
- What about Charlie?
- All he does is fan.
Let's let him finish what he started.
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.
Come here.
You been practising that triple deke?
- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.
You may make it, you may not.
But that doesn't matter, Charlie.
What matters is that we're here.
Look around.
Whoever thought we'd make it this far?
One, two, three.
Triple deke.
Take your best shot.
I believe in you, Charlie, win or lose.
- Thanks, coach.
- Go get 'em.
- All right, Charlie.
- Let's go, Charlie.
Okay, now wait for my signal.
Good luck.
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...
Okay, now don't leave your crease before he touches the puck.
Good luck.
Come on, Charlie.
Come on, Charlie.

One step at a time.

...The Minnesota Pee Wee Championship is up for grabs.
Both teams playing like there's no tomorrow.
Duluth, in the Hawks' zone, looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.
There's a pass out to the blue line.
intercepted by Gordon Bombay!
Bombay!
He's got a breakaway.
Across the blue line all alone for a chance to win the game!
He's pulled down from behind by Fox of Duluth.
Fox definitely pulled him down from behind and this could be --
Yes, the referee calls for a penalty shot.
Gordon, it's up to you. I don't wanna see any goats around after the game.
You got it?
Now, you miss this shot... you're not just lettin' me down, you're lettin' your team down.
A pressure situation he's in now.
The 1973 Pee Wee State Championship now rests... on the little shoulders of number 9, Gordon Bombay.
Gordon!
Gordon!
Gordon!
Gordon!
Let's go, son!
All right!
He hit the goalpost!
What a heartbreaker!
Little Gordon Bombay had the chance --
All my client did was attempt to give you what you wanted!
Isn't that right?
This man put his neck on the line for your greed.
Objection.
Your Honour?
Will both counsellors approach the bench?
What's he doing?
I don't have anything to tell you.
I just wanna make a point.
So nod like I'm saying something important.
- Mr Bombay?
- Gordon, what are you doing?
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.
This drives him nuts and I love it.
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya?
Oh, Mr Bombay, I'm so glad you could make it.
Please restrict yourself to a relevant cross-examination!
Your Honour, the applicability of societal intent... vis-a-vis individual action is well established.
I'm citing Minneapolis V. Higgins.
The appellant court overruled a judge who disallowed similar testimony.
Now, if I'm not mistaken, that was... you.
Wasn't it, Judge Weathers?
I stand corrected, counsellor.
Objection overruled.
Oh, you really stooped to an all-time low on this, Bombay.
I'm insulted, Frank.
You have no idea how low I can stoop.
I don't mind losing.
I would just like to lose fair.
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.
And what about justice?
That man should be in jail.
It was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me!
Next time do your job, Frankie boy.
- 30 and 0!
I remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case?
We don't count that one because I scored with the court reporter.
- The one you said had the intelligent body?
- That's the one.
- No calls on the Duck phone?
- Not yet.
What's he waiting for?
I saw him in the back of the courtroom.
How about some kudos here, huh?
Mr Tolbert dropped off a couple ringside seats for tonight's North Stars game.
Hockey?
Forget it!
Gordon, here's the research for the Pearlstein Project.
- Can you get started?
- Jane!
Can't you see I'm reveling here?
Today I'm 30 and 0!
- 30 and one.
- Type, Jeannie, don't speak.
Mr Bombay's office.
Yes. lt's Ducksworth.
You're right.
He wants to see you.
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you very much, Mr Ducksworth!
It was nothing, Mr Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr Ducksworth.
Gordon, another fine job today.
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.
Score.
Don't spike.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean, sir.
This is a business.
It isn't a game.
Next time a little restraint might be in order.
* Hey, man, get off my back I'm doin' the best I can, yeah *
* You bust my neck Cut no slack *
* Forget your fellow man Yeah yeah uh-huh *
- Pull your vehicle over to the right, now!
- This is not good.
- * Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah *
- Licence, please.
- Could you turn down the stereo?
- Sure.
I guess it was a "widdle" noisy.
A "widdle"?
Okay, I'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine?
No, thanks, I'm full.
Okay, out of the car.
Now.
The charges against Mr Bombay are driving under the influence, driving with an open container and reckless endangerment.
And to think I almost stayed home this morning.
I assume you're representing yourself?
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a licence?
Okay, let's talk business.
What am I facing?
Suspension of licence?
Fines?
What?
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow you to plead guilty to lesser charges.
But that's solely up to the prosecutor.
The city of Minneapolis does not wish to pursue a plea bargain in this case.
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo?
The defendant is released on his own recognizance.
Mr Ducksworth.
What are you doing here?
I own the place.
How about you?
Just goin' over a few cases.
ricoh Statute stuff.
Oh, I thought you might be researching your defence... against D.U.l. and reckless endangerment.
Did you think I wouldn't find out, Gordon?
There was no reason to concern you with it, sir.
They have no case.
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp.
I found a loophole. I'm gonna plead not guilty --
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.
There's not going to be a trial.
I am not going to have you drag... this firm's good name through the mud.
I've talked to Judge Weathers and he has agreed to suspend your case.
- Under what conditions?
- Probation, suspension of your driver's licence... and 500 hours of community service.
And a leave of absence from the firm.
A leave of absence?
He can't do that.
- He can't stop me from working!
- He's not. I am.
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.
It'll teach you compassion, a sense of fair play, how to fit in.
- Community service?
This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.
And hopefully you'll come back a better person and a better attorney, which is why I'm keeping you on salary and have arranged a driver for you.
You know, in the early '70s I drove the tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties, amps cranked up to about eight jillion decibels.
All that loud music damaged my hearing, but I got no regrets...
- except for the '80s.
- How could he do this to me?
Community service...
coaching hockey!
I found one!
I'm comin' out!
Karp, you finally found something for once in your life.
Dumpster Dave comes through!
- What do you think?
- Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.
- You gonna take that from him, Karp?
- Remind me to bust you, Averman.
- Thanks, Peter.
Thanks very much.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah!
Right there!
- Yeah!
Here, Petie.
Here, boy.
A little chili to keep you warm, buddy.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look!
I can't believe he ate the can too.
He sniffs.
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.
He sniffs some more.
He stops.
I think this is it!
He's turnin' in a circle.
- He squats!
He scores!
- Yes!
We did it!
Full load.
Stinks!
Come on, come on, give me the dollar!
- Hurry it up already.
- l'm hurrying', okay?
- Go, go, go, go!
- Yeah!
All right!
Let's do it!
Oh, come on.
Stop!
- Yes!
- Okay!
Here we go.
Yeah.
There's more inside.
He's takin' off with it.
This guy deserves what he gets.
Oh, guys, he saw us.
Oh, my!
Rink's gotta be around here someplace.
Just look for a sign that says "Personal Hell."
How could he do this to me?
I hate kids.
They're barely human.
Come on!
Over here!
Keep it down, please!
Hey, come on.
There's no need for this.
Let's talk, come on.
I'm your friend, aren't I?
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to stop it. I'm tired of chasing' the puck.
Be careful, man.
It almost hit me that time.
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
It's supposed to hit you.
Does that sound stupid to anyone else?
Good God.
That's the hockey team.
Drive out on the ice.
It'll be all right.
I ain't scared.
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.
We're gonna get in big trouble.
- l'll take care of it.
- They're drugs, I just know it.
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.
This is my dominion.
This is a drug-free zone, you understand?
We ain't buying' nothin'.
I'm feelin' generous today.
So I'm gonna let you get your sorry vanilla bootie outta here... before we be usin' your eyeballs as hockey pucks.
Thanks, bro, but I'm not goin' home 'til I take care of business.
He's got a gun.
Stand back.
Whew!
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.
I'm Gordon Bombay.
I'm the new coach.
What a joke!
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.
Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.
Here's the long and the short of it.
I hate hockey and I don't like kids.
What's this supposed to be, a pep talk?
I'm sure this'll be a real bonding experience.
Maybe one day one of you will even write a book about it in jail.
- Funny.
- ls there a goalie?
Only for a little while.
I'm movin' back to Philly.
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.
Uh, just so you know.
We really suck.
I'll decide who sucks around here.
- Get off me.
- They really suck.
The Pete-meister.
Mr Rabble-rouser.
Passing the puck over to Jesse-roonie, the enforcer.
Ouch!
That hurt!
Oh, it's the Connie-meister, the velvet hammer.
Hi, coach. I'm Connie.
- Do you play?
- No.
So what's our record anyway?
0 and 9.
One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.
We almost scored a goal too.
So what do we do now... coach?
- What did your old coach have you do?
- He just yelled a lot.
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm?
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us, "Little bastards, where'd you learn to play?
Oh, you suck, you!
Skate, you little bast--"
Heart attack.
Great.
All right, look.
I gotta make a phone call.
Keep scrimmaging.
You, you, you, you and you against you four.
- We got names, you know?
- l'm sure you do.
And I'll bet they're very nice names.
I might even learn 'em.
For now, I'll be in my office.
Oh, and if you need anything, fax me.
Geez, what a jerk.
Where do they find these coaches anyways?
We're impressionable kids, right?
Shouldn't we check his qualifications or somethin'?
Jeannie, who told you not to give me my messages?
Ducksworth!
Then who's handling my cases?
- On three!
- Jane!
- One, two, three!
Charge!
- Are you kidding me?
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to --
Hold on a second!
Hey!
Get your mouth off the windows!
- Hey!
- Get off there!
Get off the car!
- We're being invaded!
- Get off!
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool!
- ls that a real phone?
- Yes, and I'm really on it.
- Not any more.
- Thank you.
- Let's see, who should I --
- Watch the upholstery.
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
- We wanna ride!
- l could kill one of 'em just to set an example.
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything!
This looks good.
I'm gonna eat it.
- Wow, I feel like Madonna.
- You wish!
Seats ten comfortably.
Hey, pass me one of those glasses.
Yeah, I see your point.
Oh.
Goldberg!
- lt wasn't me, all right!
- Young man, what did you eat?
- Nothing!
It wasn't me!
- Open a window!
Oh, man!
It's my mom!
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.
All right, out!
Everybody, out of the car right now.
Goldberg, why'd you have to ruin the fun?
Are you out of your mind?
What were you thinking putting that car on the ice?
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take.
One crack!
- The ice is not gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are?
- l'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
- The new coach?
They send you over here to coach the team and you endanger their lives.
What danger?
I grew up on the ice;
I know when it's safe to drive on.
- How do you know?
- l just know!
All right?
Well, listen, Mr Zen Master, you may be in tune with the ice universe, but when it comes to my kid, "l just know" doesn't cut it.
Charlie, let's go.
- Mom?
- Give me my candy!
All of it!
Well, I guess practise is over.
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- lt's all right, Charlie.
Coach, gonna be at the game tomorrow?
By order of the state of Minnesota, yeah.
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
- Hi, girls.
- Karp!
No!
Goodbye.
The hawks.
My first game and it had to be the Hawks.
Gordon?
Gordon Bombay.
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.
Why don't you just call me Jack?
Hey, come back to see your old coach, huh?
Well, actually I'm, uh, coaching...
Pee Wee.
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'.
You got a kid on the team or something?
No, I'm here because I need to be of service to the community.
How about this, huh?
Whoever thought we'd be coaching' against each other?
Yeah, who'd have thought?
So, who's your hotshot player this year?
- Anyone good?
- l got a kid named Banks.
Might go all the way.
Not quite as good as you were.
But he wants it more.
Kid won't give up.
Oh, boy, I wish they would take that one down.
Don't you?
Well, good luck.
You're gonna need it.
It's up to you, Gordon.
You miss this shot, you're not just... letting me down, you're letting your whole team down too.
I wish your dad could be here to see this.
Make him proud of you!
Win!
Win!
Win!
All right, guys, gather round.
Come on, come on.
- Win!
Win!
Win!
- Win.
Win.
Win!
Win!
Win!

Win!
Win!
Yeah, we're fired up.
All right!
Watch this!
Oh, great.
Good concept, guys.
Nice -- ouch!
Nice goin', fool!
- Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
- Oh, yeah, "l didn't mean to."
Yeah, sure, you're on my own team.
Oh, sorry, Goldberg.
Didn't mean to.
Would you get off me before I clock you?
Let's go, Jesse!
Go, Terry!
Let's go!
Come on in.
What's this?
The Oreo line!
Hey, come on.
Let's play hockey.
Um, batter, batter, hum, batter, batter!
Hey, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Hum, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Averman!
It's hockey!
There's no batter. idiot.
Hum, goalie, goalie, hum, goalie, goalie!
Hey, goalie, goalie, save, goalie, goalie!
Hum, goalie, goalie, hey, goalie, goalie!
No, I got him!
I, I, I got him!
That's one!
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy!
Good show.
Sloppy pass.
Way to stuff it, Banks!
All right, all right!
Let's run it up!
Run it up!
Run it up!
Oh, man!
How could you let him get by you?
All right, line change.
Come on, go, go, go.
Hey!
Banks!
Banks!
Banks!
Hey, you!
Come back here!
Oh!
Why me?
How lazy can you be?
They're killing us out there!
Get those rebounds, get your heads up, get those loose pucks.
Get -
- Just --
Just get the hell outta here.
All right!
It's Spaz-way.
He'll screw up.
Hey, hey!
Way to play it, Banks!
All right!
That's okay, Charlie!
Nice try!
Nice fan, Charlie.
Keep swingin'.
Maybe you'll give 'em a cold.
Hey, hey, hey, knock it off!
Against this team we should have twice this many!
Now let's run it up!
Remember it's not worth winning if you can't win big!
All right!
Guys!
No!
Come on, let's talk about this!
Be civilized!
Come on!
Please!
Oh no, guys!
Come on, not again!
Please!
Just take the goal.
Fine!
I don't care!
- l'm so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.
All right!
Hey, knock it off!
That was a lousy third period.
Anybody could beat these pansies.
I want you guys to stay hungry out there!
All right, nice goin', Banks.
New Hawks record.
- Okay, boys.
Let's go.
- All right!
Hey, Gordon!
Nice game.
I enjoyed it thoroughly.
At least I can handle the puck!
Hey, shut up!
You guys stink!
I thought we came here to play hockey.
You know, I knew we forgot something.
Oh, you think it's funny?
You think losing is funny?
Well, not at first, but once you get the hang of it.
We're the ones out there gettin' our butts kicked.
Yeah, it's not like you coach us or anything.
At least we try.
You didn't listen to a word I said.
I said, keep your heads up.
You put your heads down.
I said, hustle.
You went slower!
That was the sloppiest playing I've ever seen.
Why the hell don't you just listen to me?
Why the hell should we?
I don't care.
You want to lose, fine.
You're the ones who look like idiots out there.
Great game!
Hans?
I don't believe it!
Who would throw these away?
- First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
- Fork it over.
Forget it, Karp.
I can see this every day on MTV.
This one's from Minneapolis.
Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom.
- Let's give him a wedgie.
- Good idea, Jesse!
I was just kidding, okay?
Hey!
Give that back!
- Hi, girls.
- Does your mommy know you have that?
Nah, she's busy with the mailman.
That'll make great bathroom reading.
That's mine, you jerk!
I found it!
You don't even know what to do with it, wuss-breath.
- You gonna let him call you wuss-breath?
- No!
Hey!
Hey!
- Oh!
- Come on.
Want some more?
You guys want some more?
Come on!
Yeah!
You want some more?
Come on!
Let's get out!
Move it!
- Thanks a lot.
- All right, man.
One, two, three!
Boom!
What are you laughing at, cream cheese boy?
Go!
If we're gonna cheat, we gotta make those falls look real.
Keep it up!
Whoa!
Score one for the spirit.
Go at him!
Go at him!
Good!
Go at him!
Come on, get angry!
Oh!
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt!
I am hurt.
Good, good.
Now say it again!
Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
- One more time!
- Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
Good!
You guys are ready.
Give me a break, ref!
Open your eyes!
Did you see what he did to me?
Goldberg, you don't take the fall while they're shooting at you.
Oh!
Well, I guess you didn't explain that very well, did ya?
- District Five!
- l throw myself on the ice --
Cut the acting class.
One more dive, I forfeit to the Jets!
What?
I'm insulted by that!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
- Quit it!
Face-off!
Let's go!
Charlie!
That guy is twice your size.
The next time he gets you in a corner like that, I want you to grab your eye like it's cut and then hit the ice!
- Got it?
Let's go.
- Let's go!
Face-off!
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
Here we go.
Hey --
- Come on!
- That's it, Charlie.
- That's it, Charlie!
- Come on!
Damn it, Charlie!
We can't even win when we cheat.
- Stupid cake-eater tricks!
- That was embarrassing.
Charlie!
What the hell is the matter with you?
When I tell you to do something, you do it!
You got it?
Look at me.
- You got it?
- You can't make me cheat.
Jesse, Terry, let's go.
This is what I gave up my overtime pay for?
To see my kids takin' falls?
Gordon.
- How did you know?
- Through the back door at this time of night.
Just like you used to.
You'd spend hours watching me do this.
What do you think?
is this sharp enough?
Ow!
- Did you cut yourself?
- No.
You always fell for that.
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, I'm Scandinavian.
- lt's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.
You probably thought I was dead.
I saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything?
You were so busy screaming at the kids.
I didn't want to spoil the moment.
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.
Why should my store?
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that?
Well, I hardly ever lose a case.
That is not what I asked.
Hmm!
I see you still have this up.
- Thanks very much.
- lt is important to remember the past.
I'd just as soon forget it.
That was the worse time in my life.
My dad died that year.
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.
I found this not long ago.
He was proud of you.
I miss him.
You scored 198 goals in that season, Gordon.
It's a shame you quit.
You --
- Could have gone all the way.
Yeah.
- No!
You really loved to play.
You remember?
You remember... you used to play on the ponds until after dark, until your father called you back.
You really flew on that ice, Gordon.
That's all I ever wanted to do.
Then why did you stop?
Reilly?
I saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.
- The guy wins.
- lt's not about winning. lt never was.
Just show they how to play.
Show them how to have fun.
Teach them to fly.
That is what they'll remember long after you've gone back to being a doctor.
Lawyer.
And long after they've stopped buying skates from me.
Here... there you are.
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.
- What's this?
- Your new skates.
That is why you came here tonight, isn't it?
- l figured nine and a half was your size.
- Actually, I'm a nine.
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.
Here comes Bombay on an end-to-end rush.
Past the blue line, past centre.
He's not skating, he's flying!
He fakes once, he fakes twice.
Fakes three times!
Shoots!
Scores!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
What a play!
What a guy!
Gordon Bombay does it again!
Great move, Gordy!
You faked him out of his pads.
Come here, son.
You look great out there.
Come on, let's go inside, get something to eat.
A few more minutes?
Please?
- Go on.
Get outta here.
- Thanks.
- Hi, uh --
- Please, just go away.
Charlie doesn't want... to be on the team any more, and neither he nor I have anything to say to you.
- Well, I have something to say to you.
- Oh, really?
Door-to-door mistreatment now.
Now the team can feel miserable between games too, huh?
I came to apologize to Charlie...
to both of you.
- What?
- Apologize.
Well... you should.
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin'?
I was just, uh, walkin' around thinkin' and, uh --
Wanna give us a minute?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Listen, it was very wrong of me... to ask you and the other guys to cheat.
I never should have said to you what I said to you.
I was angry. I was frustrated.
It took a lot of guts for you to do what you knew was right. I admire that.
And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that, uh, that I'm --
Oh, boy, this is difficult.
- l'm --
- You're sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right?
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be a lot more fun this time around.
What do you say?
Do you want to stay for dinner?
- What?
- Charlie!
Uh, no, I -- l can't.
Uh --
Well, what are you havin'?
Mr Ducksworth, there are two reasons I came by.
First off, I want to let you know things are going well.
I'm learning a lot about teamwork, fair play and all that junk.
Good, good.
And the second thing?
Well, sir, fair play doesn't come cheap.
These kids, my team, have no money.
They can't afford rink time, safe equipment, proper uniforms, which makes it difficult for them to compete.
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old and stepping out onto that ice... with old copies of the "Enquirer" taped to your shins instead of pads.
The point I'm trying to make, sir, is that you wouldn't be taken seriously and neither are these kids.
So I thought maybe the firm could help 'em out.
How much are we talking about?
- $15,000.
- No way.
Wait a minute.
Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross, the firm that gives back to the community.
Come on.
I'll get you your own jersey.
* Ooo, yeah *
* Can you feel it baby Ooo * * l can too, Ooo *
* Ooo *
* Ooo, come on swing *
* Come on swing *
* Come on swing *
* C-Come on swing Ooo *
* Ooo * * lt's such a good vibration * * lt's such a sweet sensation * * lt's such a good vibration * * lt's such a sweet sensation *
Who is that kid?
Thanks, Fulton.
- Fulton Reed.
He's in one of my classes.
- How come he's not on the team?
He only plays football.
Some preppie school gave him a scholarship... as long as he doesn't play hockey.
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- l heard it was colleges.
He's been accepted to four of 'em.
- Yeah, but I heard he's got to repeat the sixth grade.
- Ah, shut up.
Gordon Bombay?
Bombay was a Hawk.
* ...
Good vibration * * lt's such a sweet sensation *
* Feel the vibration lt's such a good vibration **
Dude, check 'em out, man.
Holy cow.
- They're pretty good skaters.
- Anybody know who they are?
That's Tommy Duncan.
He's in my science class.
That's his sister, Tammy.
- Think they'd want to play hockey with us?
- Yeah!
Go get dressed.
I'll do the negotiating.
Just think of it as figure skating... with a stick.
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy!
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive!
Mom isn't gonna like this at all.
So what?
You want me to figure skate, then you gotta play hockey.
What do I know about hockey?
More than you think.
Back to basics!
Skating!
Go!
Go!
Side to side.
Shift your weight.
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.
That's okay, Charlie.
Soft hands.
You don't shoot the puck to your teammate.
You sail it to him.
Karp, on your feet.
- You send it.
- Oh!
Gross!
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it.
Cradle it.
- Oh!
- Again!
Concentration, not strength.
Like the Karate Kid, right?
"Wax on!
Wax off!"
Just shut up and try it, Averman!
- You're such a jerk.
- Send it back, Averman.
Good, Averman.
Charlie.
That's good.
Good.
Now sail it back.
Oh!
Way to go!
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.
Oh!
Here it comes.
Nice and easy.
Good.
- l did it!
I did it!
- All right.
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.
- But when are you gonna work with me in goal?
- Goldberg, do you trust me?
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar mitzvah'd.
This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.
Coach, I think you got the ceremonies mixed up. lt's more like a circumcision.
Coach!
Will you come back here?
What'd I ever do to you, man?
District Five!
Ready!
Oh, man, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
- Aim!
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.
- Oh, please!
No!
- Fire!
I wanna go home!
This doesn't hurt!
You wimps!
Give me your best shot!
Oh!
Come on!
That's good!
Hex goal!
Goalie boot save!
Whoa!
Nice shot, man!
I'm a dog!
I'm a crazed dog!
Come on!
Goldberg!
Goldberg!
I am Goldberg!
The goalie!
Good!
Good!
All right, Charlie!
Good hustle!
Conway, way to go.
All right, Karp!
- You guys hungry?
Tired?
- Yeah!
- Do you ache?
Are you pumped up?
- Yeah!
Good!
That was a hell of a practise.
Be proud of yourself.
Hey, guys!
Excuse me, guys!
You gotta untie me now!
Ha-ha!
Good joke.
Very funny. I like it.
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach!
Coach, come on, don't leave me hangin' like this!
Coach, don't make me come after you, coach.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Thanks for the ride.
You did real well in practise today, Charlie.
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad?
Mom and I left him. I don't really remember, but that's what she says.
You know, when I was a boy, I had to take care of my mother too.
Really?
What happened to your dad?
He passed away.
You do a good job takin' care of your mom.
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right?
- Okay.
We'll see ya.
- Okay.
Hey, coach.
- What's that?
- Huh?
- Oh!
- Victory!
You've just entered the tickling zone!
So I'm right in the middle of my cross-examination and I say to the guy, I usually defend heels like you, you scuzzy, mole-faced rat.
That's a good one, sir.
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Look, it was an accident, all right?
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
I didn't learn.
I just do it.
Do it again.
Yargh!
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal?
Yeah.
Well, one out of five.
Fulton, is it true what they say?
About the scholarships and how they won't let you play hockey?
People talk.
It don't mean nothin'.
- Why don't you play for us?
- l can't.
- What do you mean?
- l mean, I can't.
- You afraid?
- No, I mean I can't, you moron. I don't know how to skate.
Whoa!
is that all that's stoppin' ya?
* l ride the top of the line I can't settle for less *
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.
Side to side, good!
Follow me.
Aaah!
Watch it!
Get out of the way!
Sorry!
* This is all we got baby lt's got to be enough * * l'd like to try to quit But I don't know how * * l needed it then and baby I need it right now *
Come on, Fulton.
Let's go!
- * l gotta keep movin' 'til l'm satisfied *
- Hey!
* Come on, Come on lt's gonna be all right **
The Ducks?
We're the Ducks?
Man, what brain-dead jerk came up with that name?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But I didn't have a choice.
We're being sponsored.
By who?
Donald and Daisy?
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks?
You'd rather be District Five?
Some stupid number?
Better than some stupid animal.
I'll have you know, Peter, that the Duck is one of the most noble, agile and intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom.
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.
Neither do hockey players.
Have you guys ever seen a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation?
It's beautiful.
Pretty awesome the way they all stick together.
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight?
No way.
Why?
Because the other animals are afraid.
They know that if they mess with one duck, they gotta deal with the whole flock.
Oh, man!
I'm proud to be a duck.
And I'd be proud to fly with any one of you.
So how about it?
Who's a Duck?
I'll be a Duck.
Yeah.
Me too.
Anybody see Goldberg?
All right!
Now we're the Ducks!
The Mighty Ducks!
- What are we?
- The Ducks!
What the hell are they doing?
Every time you get the puck, you're the quarterback.
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.
Come on, guys.
This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.
What a weird-ass team.
How you doin'?
- You ready?
- l think so.
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.
My God!
Wow!
One out of five.
All right, Let's forget the past.
We lost a few games, tough!
That was District Five.
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right!
Yeah!
Quack, quack.
- Quack.
Quack.
- Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Go...
Ducks!
What the hell was that?
Let's go, Ducks!
Defence!
Defence!
Dig it outta there!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Let's go, Ducks!
Throw it!
Throw it!
To the crease!
Yes!
The Oreo line!
That's my boy!
Defence, Karp!
Defence!
Come on.
I don't wanna go to school today, Mom.
- How many fingers am I holding' up?
- He wouldn't know.
Shut up, Peter.
Karp, are you okay?
- Look at this.
- The Karp-ster used his head to stop the puck.
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.
Get him on the bench, Charlie.
Okay, Ducks, we still got a chance here.
Connie, Terry, Jesse, Guy, time for the secret weapon.
Okay, Fulton.
Remember, just like we talked about.
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.
Oh, no.
- Go!
Get the face-off!
- Line up, boys, let's go.
That's it.
Aaah!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Yeah!
That tie of yours might be what you need to make the play-offs.
- The ducks have a shot at the play-offs?
- Sure.
Everyone but the last two teams are in, remember?
Panthers got the measles and they forfeited the season.
So, you beat the Huskies and you'll make the play-offs.
- Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
- So?
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since I played.
Actually, one little thing has changed.
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.
They redrew the district lines last year.
The lake is not the boundary any more.
You see?
You'd be a Duck.
I'd be a Duck.
Excuse me.
Coach Reilly?
- Yeah?
- l'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.
- What's that?
- One of your players is ineligible.
Banks!
Over here!
- This is a joke, right?
- l'm afraid it's no joke.
- Problem?
- No, just a mistake.
Are you this boy's father?
450 North Hennipen, is that your address?
- Yes.
- l'm afraid there's no mistake.
- This boy is playing for the wrong team.
- What?
According to league rules, Adam Banks should be playing for District Five.
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- ls this your doing, Gordon?
I'll expect to see him at our next game.
- We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
- No way.
My son would rather not play than play for your team.
Fine, if that's the way you want it.
But remember, if Adam plays for the Hawks, you'll forfeit every game for the rest of the season.
Boy, I'd hate to see that.
Look, I'm sorry this had to happen, but you can see on the map.
Gordon?
Hey, Bombay!
You stop when I'm talking to you, son!
What's the idea here?
You trying to sabotage me or what?
The law's a bitch when it works against you, isn't it, Jack?
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.
Even with Banks, what do you think you're gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers?
That's right, coach.
They are losers.
We hate losers, don't we?
They don't even deserve to live.
Maybe Banks won't make a difference, but at least we're playing by the rules.
Why'd you turn against me, Gordon?
For six years... I taught ya how to skate, I taught ya how to score.
I taught ya how to go for the "W."
You could have been one of the greats.
And now look at yourself.
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.
Going to the play-offs!
Whoo!
One win!
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.
All right, everyone, listen up.
I got some good news.
We're getting a new player, Adam Banks.
What?
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.
- We don't need him.
- l'm the coach. I say we do need him.
- lf we make it to the play-offs, he could be a big help.
- lf?
All of a sudden you don't think we're good enough.
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.
- What?
- We heard what you said.
You said we were losers, we didn't deserve to live.
- That's not what I meant.
- l saw that picture of you missing that goal.
You were a Hawk, weren't you?
Guess you guys stick together to the end.
You know what?
I don't need your stinkin' equipment.
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.
- l'm talkin' to you, son!
- Forget it, cake-eater.
If you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.
Where do you guys think you're goin'?
I don't believe this.
All right, I'm goin' up to the bench because that's where l'm supposed to be.
Anyone who wants to join me can join me.
Anyone who doesn't --
Well --
Ten minutes to game time, coach.
Yeah, yeah, they'll be out in a minute.
They're, you know, working themselves into a frenzy.
Not much of a frenzy.
We forfeit.
Ducks forfeit.
Flames, you win.
Hey.
Can I sit?
Sure.
You talk to the guys?
I tried.
They think I'm a traitor for even showing up.
I guess they really hate me, huh?
is it true you were really a Hawk?
Yeah.
Peter said you blew a really big game once.
Yeah, well, Peter's right.
It was the last game of the state finals.
We were tied 2-2 in the end of the third period.
I get a penalty shot.
I go in, I triple deke.
I fake the goalie right out of his pads.
The puck's headed in, and then...
Clang!
Hits the post.
We lost in overtime.
A quarter of an inch this way and it would have gone in.
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way and you'd have missed completely.
I never thought of it that way.
At least you got to play in a championship game.
- That must've been so cool.
- Hey.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
I'd love one.
You know, she has many fine qualities that men find attractive.
I know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.
So, what kind of guys does she usually date?
Jerks. I mean, most of them like her, but as soon as they catch a glimpse of me --
Pow!
Warp speed!
They are gone!
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, I wouldn't even care... except it's not fair to my mom.
She deserves somebody nice.
Are you gonna come over for dinner again?
I don't know, Charlie.
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
See, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I, um, talked to Jesse and Terry's dad, and he's gonna take over coaching for the rest of the year.
- You're quitting?
- l'm stepping aside to keep the team together.
The guys can't play for somebody they don't trust.
I trust you.
The other guys do too.
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.
- l've done all I can.
- No, you haven't.
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.
We are too!
We weren't even the Ducks until you came along.
You made us and now you're stuck with us.
Charlie.
That's right.
The red is oxygen.
Now what are the blue balls?
- Tommy?
- Hydrogen?
is correct.
Now put them together... and you have a molecule that makes up 96 %%% of your body.
- What is it?
- Pizza?
It's the principal. I'll be right back.
Work on H2 C03.
It's a goody.
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way?
- Yeah, did you score?
Leave me alone, guys.
I don't want to talk about the team.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.
Everybody knows he likes you best.
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp!
Take it back now!
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl!
- Lay off!
- Don't shove, Peter.
Atoms away!
My atoms!
You!
Sit!
Sit now!
In your seats now!
I have never in my life --
What have you got to say for yourselves?
Quack.
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!
Thanks for coming by on such short notice, Gordon.
By the way, your court release came through.
- Congratulations.
Your community service is over.
- You're kidding.
So you wanted to talk about my coming back to work then?
- Well, actually --
- Oh, you got your jersey.
Great!
A lot's been happening.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.
Gordon, you know Coach Reilly and Mr Banks.
Sir, they're the bad guys.
No, actually, Phil is one of my oldest friends.
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together here to try to work out this little problem.
You see, my son Adam wants to play for the Hawks.
His older brother was a Hawk.
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.
It's a tradition.
You understand that, Gordon.
You played.
But the league's already ruled on it.
We've talked to the league, and we worked out a little deal.
- You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League?
- Yes, we did.
The long and short of it is that Adam stays on the Hawks for the rest of the season.
And then next year, they redraft the lines.
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.
What's that?
That you withdraw your protest.
- That's great.
- Good, good.
Well, that's settled then.
No, sir, you don't understand.
I can't withdraw my protest.
- What?
- Mr Ducksworth, you wanted me to learn about fair play... and how to be part of a team... and I may not have learned everything yet, but I remember something my father said to me.
A team isn't a bunch of kids out to win.
A team is something you belong to, something you feel, something you have to earn.
And I'm not gonna let those kids down.
Gordon, I'm going to make this simple.
Are you prepared to lose your job over some kids?
Some game?
Let me ask you, sir.
Are you prepared to fire me over some kids?
Some game?
Collect your personal belongings, Gordon.
Yes, sir, Mr Ducksworth!
Thank you very much, Mr Ducksworth!
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, Mr Ducksworth!
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.
You may have paid for this jersey, sir, but you didn't earn it.
I'll see you in the play-offs.
- Excuse me.
There are some students here that I'd like to see.
- Who are you?
I'm their hockey coach.
If you could tell me where l can find each of them, please.
They're in room 223.
- All of them?
- All of them.
"l will not quack at the principal."
"l will not quack at the principal."
- What do you want?
- l want to talk to you guys.
- People.
- People, right.
Sit down, please.
All of you.
Okay, don't sit down.
Look, what's done is done.
I want to be your coach again.
You're gonna coach a bunch of losers?
- No, I want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said?
You said we didn't deserve to live.
Karp, I was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means?
- No.
- Okay, then you do.
I didn't mean those things the way they sounded.
You guys know what it's like to be misunderstood, right?
- Yeah, of course.
We're kids.
- So...
Can you forgive me?
Can I be your coach again?
- What about Banks?
- He can be on the team if he wants.
He should have been with us all year.
It's you guys who were cheated.
Let's forget all that crap!
- We're a team, right?
- Yeah.
I made you guys, and I'm sticking with you.
So, what's it gonna be?
We can play tomorrow night and still have a shot at the play-offs... or we can forfeit again and the season's over.
Peter, what do you say?
Well... I guess it would help if we practised first.
All right.
Let me see if I can get you out of detention.
- Yes.
- Take that.
You really quacked at the principal?
Yeah.
Are we Ducks, or what?
Yeah!
Look at your mother.
Let's see how it is in ten minutes.
I'm gonna kill you!
Hey.
Wasn't sure if you'd show up.
Yeah, whatever.
- l just want to play hockey.
- Good.
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.
On behalf of the Ducks, I'd like to say welcome.
Cake-eater.
Ooh, the Jess-man, dissin' the new guy!
The Jess-ster!
Shut up, Averman!
It's just a joke.
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey doesn't mean you're a real Duck.
- They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
- l bet.
Well, suit up.
I'll see you on the ice.
On your left!
Over here!
I'm open!
Come on, right here!
Up front!
- Up front!
- Pass it to Banks!
Come on!
Do somethin' with it!
Yeah!
All right!
Way to go, Banks!
All right!
Score another one for the Ducks!
Goldberg, you're gonna sit this one out.
What?
You're pulling the goalie when we're tied?
Listen, listen, listen!
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.
Okay, Fulton, you're our extra man.
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.
- We pulling the Statue of Liberty play?
- Yeah?
No, take your shot.
You may only get one, so it's gotta be good.
- But, coach, one outta one?
- Soft hands, Fulton.
- Concentration, not strength.
- That's right!
Okay?
Let's get the Huskies!
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one.
Let's go!
- Get in there!
- Come on!
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!
Shoot, Fulton, shoot!
We won!
We made the play-offs!
Boy, this is great.
Guys, look, it's the North Stars.
- Oh, man.
- lt's Mike Modano!
- ...
Believe this?
- Cool!
This is too cool.
I can't believe this.
This place is humongous.
What are we doing here?
It's a little play-offs present.
Hey, Gordo!
Gordon Bombay, right?
- You remember me?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- l heard you were a farmer.
Actually, I became a lawyer.
But I'm coaching Pee Wee now and this is my team, the Ducks.
- Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
- We can see that.
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks!
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.
If you ever want a shot, I'll get you a tryout in the minor league clubs.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, nice seein' ya.
Take it easy.
All right, let's have some fun!
* You've got to accentuate the positive *
* Eliminate the negative *
* Latch on to the affirmative *
* Don't mess with Mister ln-between *
* You've got to spread joy up to the maximum *
* Bring gloom down to that minimum *
* Have faith or pandemonium *
* You're liable to walk upon the sea *
* To illustrate my last remark *
* Talking about Jonah in a whale and Noah in an ark *
* What did they do when everything looked so dark *
* Then they say *
* You better accentuate the positive *
* Eliminate that negative *
* Latch on to the affirmative *
* Don't mess with Mister ln-between *
* We better accentuate the positive *
* Eliminate all the negative *
* Latch on to the affirmative *
* Don't mess with Mister ln-between *
* No, don't mess with Mister ln-between *
- Hey!
- Hey!
* Don't you mess with Mister ln-between **
You know, I heard the North Stars wore the same underwear... all through the play-offs last year for luck.
So I'm doin' the same thing.
Hmm.
Maybe I should've cooked.
You know, I'm thinkin' maybe we can all go down to the winter festival tonight.
- All three of us?
- Sure.
I don't think I should, 'cause I got a lot of homework.
You should go.
With my mom.
By yourselves.
Mmm, smells great!
Hello.
Go for it.
Hi.
I don't know how they sculpt these.
Hmm, I wonder.
I used to sculpt, but now I do mostly paintings.
How do you think they do the details?
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.
Oh.
I'm nervous.
I'm rambling on and on here.
You probably think I'm weird.
No, I think you're great.
When I was a little girl, I used to pretend that that was an ice castle.
And that was my room, that window right up there.
And last winter I gave Charlie that one.
What about me?
Which window's mine?
I want to live there too.
What?
What did I say?
- lt's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy?
Casey, I was just playin' around.
Look, I don't know how you feel about me.
I don't even know how I feel about you.
But I do know there's a little kid back home... who's absolutely falling in love with his coach... and if you can't deal with that, if you're just playing around, then you better let me know.
What are we talking?
'Til death do us part?
- l have to decide on the first date?
- Stop it, Gordon.
Charlie's gonna be there when we get back.
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.
Look, I can take it.
But if Charlie gets too attached --
Every time this happens, it gets... a little rougher on him.
Just on him?
I'm glad to be here with you.
Me too.
The surprising Ducks are still in this game... against the Hornets.
Banks moving right in front, stops.

Germaine put it off the goaltender's glove into the net!
And that does it!
The Ducks have won!
Can you believe it?
4-2, and the Ducks now get set to face the Hawks in the state finals.
All right, it's up to you, Gordon.
Now, you miss this shot, you're not just letting your team down, you're letting me down too.
Remember, it's not worth playing - lf you can't win.
- That's right.
Okay, son, let's go.
Let's go, son!
* ...
Oh, say does that star-spangled *
* Banner yet wave *
* O'er the land of the free *
* And the home of the brave **
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
All right!

Come on, son, let's go.
Come on.
Number seven, McGill.

Two minutes.
Don't worry, guys.
Did it go in?
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favour.
Kick some Hawk butt.
All right, cake-eater.
He'll be okay, sir.
We need to take some X rays, though.
Hell of a job, son.
They score against us, they're gonna pay the price.
Now, don't worry.
We're gonna get that one back.
You got somethin' to say to me, Bombay?
To think I wasted all those years worrying about what you thought.
You're goin' down, Reilly.
- Let me go after 'em, coach.
Let me get 'em.
- No, we're better than that.
Look, look, it's time to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.

Now we got the power play.
- Yeah.
All right.
We're gonna hit 'em - up there.

Of all the sloppy ass -
- Ladies, they don't need our help out there!
Now I want that Fulton Reed covered.
He better not make another shot.

- Yeah!
So let's see it!
Show me the flying "V."

Let's get a line change!
Let's go!
Here we go!
Come on, y'all, let's go!
Come on!
Come on!

Jesse Hall goes behind his own net, joined by the rest of his team.
Here they come from behind the net!
It's the flying "V"!
Come on!

- Come on, Charlie.
- Conway to centre ice on a breakaway!
Conway moving across the Hawk blue line, down the middle!
He could win the game!
Hey!
Where's the call?
No time left on the clock, but the referee is calling a penalty shot!
What kind of call is that?
Okay, we've got a penalty shot for the Ducks.
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.
All right, Ducks, who's gonna take it?
- l think he should take it.
- Me?
What about Charlie?
- What about Charlie?
- All he does is fan.
Let's let him finish what he started.
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.
Come here.
You been practising that triple deke?
- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.
You may make it, you may not.
But that doesn't matter, Charlie.
What matters is that we're here.
Look around.
Whoever thought we'd make it this far?
One, two, three.
Triple deke.
Take your best shot.
I believe in you, Charlie, win or lose.
- Thanks, coach.
- Go get 'em.
- All right, Charlie.
- Let's go, Charlie.
Okay, now wait for my signal.
Good luck.
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...
Okay, now don't leave your crease before he touches the puck.
Good luck.
Come on, Charlie.

ANNOUNCER:
The Minnesota Pee Wee Championship is up for grabs.
Both teams playing like there's no tomorrow.
Duluth, in the Hawks' zone, looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.
There's a pass out to the blue line.
Intercepted by Gordon Bombay!
Bombay!
He's got a breakaway.
Across the blue line all alone for a chance to win the game!
He's pulled down from behind by Fox of Duluth.
Fox definitely pulled him down from behind and this could be...
Yes, the referee calls for a penalty shot.
What a game!
Hi, Gordon, it's up to you.
I don't wanna see any goats around here after the game.
You got it?
Now, you miss this shot... you're not just lettin' me down, you're lettin' your team down too.
ANNOUNCER:
A pressure situation he's in now.
The 1973 Pee Wee State Championship now rests on the little shoulders of number nine, Gordon Bombay.
(CHEERING)
CROWD: (CHANTING) Gordon!
Gordon!
Gordon!
Gordon!
Gordon!
Let's go, son!
All right!
(CROWD CHEERING)
(WHISTLE BLOWING)
ANNOUNCER:
He hit the goalpost, with a chance to win the game!
What a heart-breaker!
Little Gordon Bombay had the chance...
All my client did was attempt to give you what you wanted!
Isn't that right?
This man put his neck on the line for your greed.
Objection.
Your Honor?
Will both Counselors approach the bench?
MAN:
What's he doing?
(WHISPERING) I don't have anything to tell you.
I just wanna make them wait.
So nod like I'm saying something important.
- Mr. Bombay?
- Gordon, what are you doing?
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.
This drives him nuts and I love it.
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya?
Oh, Mr. Bombay, I'm so glad you could make it.
Please restrict yourself to a relevant cross-examination!
Your Honor, the applicability of societal intent,
Vis-a-Vis individual action is well established.
I'm citing Minneapolis V. Higgins, in which the appellant court overruled a judge who disallowed similar testimony.
Now, if I'm not mistaken, that was... you.
Wasn't it, Judge Weathers?
I stand corrected, counselor.
Objection overruled.
FRANK:
Oh, you really stooped to an all-time low on this, Bombay.
BOMBAY:
I'm insulted by that, Frank.
You have no idea how low I can stoop.
I mean, I don't mind losing.
I would just like to lose fair.
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.
And what about justice?
That man should be in jail.
It was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me!
Next time, do your job, Frankie boy.
- 30 and 0!
I remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case?
We don't count that one because I scored with the court reporter.
The one you said had the intelligent body?
That's the one.
- No calls on the Duck phone?
- Not yet.
What's he waiting for?
I saw him in the back of the courtroom.
How about some kudos here, huh?
Mr. Tolbert dropped off ringside seats for tonight's North Stars game.
Hockey?
(BLOWS RASPBERRY) Forget it!
Gordon, here's the research for the Pearlstein Project.
- Can you get started?
- Jane!
Can't you see I'm reveling here?
Today I'm 30 and 0!
- 30 and one.
- Type, Jeannie, don't speak.
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Mr. Bombay's office.
Yes.
It's Ducksworth.
You're right.
He wants to see you.
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
It was nothing, Mr. Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Gordon, another fine job today.
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.
Score.
Don't spike.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean, sir.
This is a business.
It isn't a game.
Next time, a little restraint might be in order.
(TIRES SCREECH)
(MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, man, get off my back
I'm doin' the best I can, yeah
You bust my neck Cut no slack
Forget your fellow man Yeah, yeah, uh-huh
(SIREN BLARES)
COP:
Pull your vehicle over to the right, now!
This is not good.
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
- Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah
- COP:
License, please.
- Could you turn down the stereo?
- Sure.
I guess it was a widdle noisy.
A "widdle"?
Okay, I'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine?
No, thanks, I'm full. (CHUCKLES)
COP:
Okay, out of the car.
Now.
(SIGHS)
The charges against Mr. Bombay are driving under the influence, driving with an open container and reckless endangerment.
(CHUCKLES) And to think I almost stayed home this morning.
I assume you're representing yourself?
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a license?
Okay, let's talk business.
What am I facing?
Suspension of license?
Fines?
What?
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow you to plead guilty to lesser charges.
But that's solely up to the prosecutor.
The city of Minneapolis does not wish to pursue a plea bargain in this case, Your Honor.
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo?
The defendant is released on his own recognizance.
Mr. Ducksworth.
What are you doing here?
I own the place.
How about you?
Just goin' over a few cases.
RICOH Statute stuff.
Oh, I thought you might be researching your defense against D.U.I. and reckless endangerment.
Did you think I wouldn't find out, Gordon?
There was no reason to concern you with it, sir.
They have no case.
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp.
I found a loophole.
I'm gonna plead not guilty...
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.
There's not going to be a trial.
I am not going to have you drag this firm's good name through the mud.
I've talked to Judge Weathers and he has agreed to suspend the disposition of your case.
Under what conditions?
Probation, suspension of your driver's license, and 500 hours of community service.
And a leave of absence from the firm.
A leave of absence?
He can't do that.
- He can't stop me from working!
- He's not.
I am.
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.
It'll teach you compassion, a sense of fair play, how to fit in.
- Community service?
This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.
And hopefully, you'll come back a better person and a better attorney, which is why I'm keeping you on salary and have arranged a driver for you.
You know, in the early '70s,
I drove the tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties, amps cranked up to about eight gillion decibels.
Doctor said all that loud music damaged my hearing, but I got no regrets.
Except for the '80s.
- (CHUCKLES)
- How could he do this to me?
Community service...
coaching hockey!
I found one!
I'm comin' out!
BOY:
Karp, you finally found something for once in your life.
Dumpster Dave comes through!
(GROANS) What do you think?
Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.
You gonna take that from him, Karp?
No.
Remind me to bust your head, Averman.
- Thanks, Peter.
Thanks very much.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah!
Right there!
- Yeah!
Here, Petie.
Here, boy.
A little chili to keep you warm, buddy.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look!
PETER:
I can't believe he ate the can too.
AVERMAN:
He sniffs.
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.
He sniffs some more.
He stops.
I think this is it!
He's turnin' in a circle.
- He squats!
He scores!
- Yes!
We did it!
(GROANING) Full load.
Stinks!
AVERMAN:
Come on, come on, give me the dollar!
- PETER:
Hurry it up already.
- AVERMAN:
I'm hurrying', okay?
- PETER:
Go, go, go, go!
- Yeah!
All right!
Let's do it!
BOYS:
Oh, come on.
Stop!
- Yes!
- Okay!
Here we go.
Yeah.
There's more inside.
KARP:
He's takin' off with it.
This guy deserves what he gets.
- (TIRES SCREECH) - (SCREAMING)
(LAUGHING)
Oh, guys, he saw us.
Oh, my!
(GROANS)
(CHEERING)
Rink's gotta be around here someplace.
Just look for a sign that says "Personal Hell."
How could he do this to me?
I hate kids.
They're barely human.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
BOY:
Come on!
Over here!
Keep it down, please!
Hey, please, come on.
There's no need for this.
Let's talk, come on.
I'm your friend, aren't I?
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to stop it.
I'm getting tired of chasing' the puck.
Be careful, man.
It almost hit me that time.
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
It's supposed to hit you.
Does that sound stupid to anyone else?
Good God.
That's the hockey team.
Drive out on the ice.
It'll be all right.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
BOY:
I ain't scared.
Come on.
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.
- PETER:
We'll get in big trouble.
- BOY:
Chill, all right?
- I'll take care of it.
- KARP:
They're drugs, I just know it.
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.
This is my dominion.
This is a drug-free zone, you understand?
We ain't buying' nothin'.
I'm feelin' generous today.
So I'm gonna let you get your sorry vanilla bootie outta here before we be usin' your eyeballs as hockey pucks.
Thanks, bro, but I'm not goin' home 'til I take care of business.
- He's got a gun.
- Stand back.
(EXHALES)
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.
I'm Gordon Bombay.
I'm the new coach.
(ALL LAUGH) What a joke!
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.
- Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.
- Geez, he is the coach!
Here's the long and the short of it.
I hate hockey and I don't like kids.
What's this supposed to be, a pep talk?
Look, I'm sure this'll be a real bonding experience.
Maybe one day, one of you will even write a book about it in jail.
- Funny.
- Is there a goalie?
Only for a little while.
I'm movin' back to Philly.
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.
Uh, just so you know.
We really suck.
I'll decide who sucks around here.
- BOY:
Get off me.
- They really suck.
The Pete Meister.
Mr. Rabble Rouser.
Passing the puck over to Jesse Roonie, the enforcer.
- (GRUNTS)
- Ouch!
That hurt!
Oh, it's the Connie-meister, the velvet hammer.
Hi, coach.
I'm Connie.
- Do you play?
- No.
So what's our record anyway?
0 and 9.
One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.
We almost scored a goal too.
So what do we do now... coach?
- What did your old coach have you do?
- He just yelled a lot.
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm?
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us,
"Little bastards, where'd you learn to play?
Oh, you suck, you!
Skate, you little bast..." (GASPS)
Heart attack.
Great.
(SIGHS) All right, look.
I gotta make a phone call.
Keep scrimmaging.
You, you, you, you and you against you four.
- We got names, you know?
- I'm sure you do.
And I bet they're very nice names.
I might even learn 'em.
For now, I'll be in my office.
Oh, and if you need anything, fax me.
(CHUCKLES)
Geez, what a jerk.
Where do they find these coaches anyways?
We're impressionable kids, right?
Shouldn't we check his qualifications or somethin'?
BOMBAY:
Jeannie, who told you not to give me my messages?
Ducksworth!
Then who's handling my cases?
- BOY:
On three!
- Jane!
- One, two, three!
Charge!
- Are you kidding me?
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to...
Hold on a second!
- (KIDS SHOUTING)
- Hey!
Get your mouth off the windows!
- Hey!
- Get off there!
- (SHOUTING)
- Get off the car!
- We're being invaded!
- Get off!
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool!
- Is that a real phone?
- Yes, and I'm really on it.
- Not any more.
- Thank you.
- Let's see, who should I...
- Watch the upholstery.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride!
(CHANTING) We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
I could kill one of 'em just to set an example, sir.
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything!
(CHEERING)
This looks good.
I'm gonna eat it.
- Wow, I feel like Madonna.
- You wish!
- Seats ten comfortably.
- CONNIE:
Shut up, Karp.
- Hey, pass me one of those glasses.
- (GROWLING)
- Yeah, I see your point.
- (SNIFFING)
CONNIE:
Oh.
- (SNIFFING)
- ALL:
Goldberg!
- It wasn't me, all right!
- Young man, what did you eat?
- Nothing!
It wasn't me!
- Open a window!
Oh, man!
It's my mom!
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.
All right, out!
Everybody, out of the car right now.
Goldberg, why'd you have to ruin the fun?
GOLDBERG:
It was not me who farted!
Are you out of your mind?
What were you thinking putting that car on the ice?
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take.
One crack!
- The ice isn't gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are?
I'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
The new coach?
They send you to coach the team and you endanger their lives.
What danger?
I grew up on the ice, I know when it's safe to drive on.
- How do you know?
- I just know!
All right?
Well, listen, Mr. Zen Master, you may be in tune with the ice universe, but when it comes to my kid, "I just know" doesn't cut it.
Charlie, let's go.
Mom?
Give me my candy!
All of it!
All of it, now!
Well, I guess practice is over.
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- It's all right, Charlie.
Coach, gonna be at the game tomorrow?
By order of the state of Minnesota, yeah.
- (DRUMS BEATING) - (CHANTING) Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!

Hawks!
Hawks!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
- One, two, three, four, five!
- (WHISTLE BLOWING)
- Hi, girls.
- (GRUNTING)
- Karp!
No!
- Goodbye.
The hawks.
My first game and it had to be the Hawks.
Gordon?
Gordon Bombay.
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.
Why don't you just call me Jack?
Hey, come back to see your old coach, huh?
Well, actually I'm, uh, coaching...
Pee Wee.
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'.
You got a kid on the team or something?
No, I'm here because I need to be of service to the community.
How about this, huh?
Whoever thought we'd be coaching' against each other?
Yeah, who'd have thought?
So, who's your hotshot player this year?
- Anyone good?
- I got a kid named Banks.
Might go all the way.
Not quite as good as you were.
But he wants it more.
Kid won't give up.
Oh, boy,
I wish they would take that one down.
Don't you?
Well, good luck.
You're gonna need it.
It's up to you, Gordon.
You miss this shot, you're not just letting me down, you're letting your whole team down too.
I wish your dad could be here to see this.
Make him proud of you!
(CHANTING) Win!
Win!
Win!
All right, guys, gather round.
Come on, come on.
- Win!
Win!
Win!
- BOYS:
Win.
Win.
Win!
Win!

- Win?
- Win!
Win!
Win!
Yeah, we're fired up.
BOY:
All right!
Watch this!
Oh, great.
Good concept, guys.
Nice...
Ouch!
(GROANS) Nice goin', fool!
- Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
- Oh, yeah, "I didn't mean to."
Yeah, sure, you're on my own team.
- Yeah, no problem!
- Oh, sorry, Goldberg.
Didn't mean to.
Would you get off me before I clock you?
Let's go, Jesse!
Go, Terry!
(WOMAN CLAPS AND CHEERS)
- (WHISTLE BLOWING)
- Let's go!
Come on in.
What's this?
The Oreo line!
Hey, come on.
Let's play hockey.
Um, batter, batter, hum, batter, batter!
Hey, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
Hum, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
Averman!
It's hockey!
There's no batter.
Idiot.
Hum, goalie, goalie, hum, goalie, goalie!
Hey, goalie, goalie, save, goalie, goalie!
Hum, goalie, goalie, hey, goalie, goalie!
(GRUNTS)
No, I got him!
I got him!
(CHEERING)
That's one!
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy!
Good show.
Sloppy pass.
Way to stuff it, Banks!
(CROWD SINGING) We will, we will rock you!
All right, all right!
Let's run it up!
Run it up!
Run it up!
Oh, man!
How could you let him get by you?
All right, line change.
Come on, go, go, go.
(GRUNTS)
(WHISTLE BLOWING)
- Hey!
- (GRUNTING)
- (GRUNTS) - (WHISTLE BLOWING)
- (CROWD CHEERING) - (GROANS)
(CHANTING) Banks!
Banks!
Banks!
Hey, you!
Come back here!
Oh!
- (WHISTLE BLOWING)
- Why me?
How lazy can you be?
They're killing us out there!
How many times do I have to tell you:
Get those rebounds, get your heads up, get those loose pucks.
- Get...
Just...
- (WHISTLE BLOWING)
Just get the hell outta here.
All right!
It's Spaz-way.
He'll screw up.
(CROWD CHEERING)
- (CROWD GASPING) - (GROANS)
(WHISTLE BLOWING)
Hey, hey!
Way to play it, Banks!
All right!
That's okay, Charlie!
Nice try!
Nice fan, Charlie.
Keep swingin'.
Maybe you'll give 'em a cold.
- (ALL CHATTERING)
- Hey, hey, hey, knock it off!
Against this team, we should have twice this many!
Now let's run it up!
Remember, it's not worth winning if you can't win big!
- REILLY:
All right!
- (CHEERING)
Guys!
No!
Come on, let's talk about this!
Be civilized!
Come on!
Please!
(CROWD CHEERING)
Oh no, guys!
Come on, not again!
Please!
Just take the goal.
Fine!
I don't care!
- I'm so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.
(BUZZER)
All right!
Hey, knock it off!
That was a lousy third period.
Anybody could beat these pansies.
I want you guys to stay hungry out there!
All right, nice goin', Banks.
New Hawks record.
- Okay, boys.
Let's go.
- All right!
Hey, Gordon!
Nice game.
I enjoyed it thoroughly.
(CHUCKLES)
BOY:
At least I can handle the puck!
(INDISTINCT ARGUING)
Hey, shut up!
You guys stink!
I thought we came here to play hockey.
You know, I knew we forgot something.
(LAUGHING)
Oh, you think it's funny?
You think losing is funny?
Well, not at first, but once you get the hang of it.
We're the ones out there gettin' our butts kicked.
Yeah, it's not like you coach us or anything.
At least we tried.
You didn't listen to a word I said.
I said, keep your heads up.
You put your heads down.
I said, hustle.
You went slower!
That was the sloppiest playing I've ever seen.
Why the hell don't you just listen to me?
Why the hell should we?
BOMBAY:
I don't care.
You want to lose, fine.
You're the ones who look like idiots out there.
REILLY:
Great game!
Hans?
(CHEERING)
I don't believe it!
Who would throw these away?
First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
Yeah, guys.
Fork it over.
Forget it, Karp.
I can see this every day on MTV.
Hey, guys, this one's from Minneapolis.
- Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom.
- (LAUGHING)
- Let's give him a wedgie.
- Good idea, Jesse!
PETER:
Come on!
I was just kidding, okay?
Hey!
Give that back!
Hi, girls.
Does your mommy know you have that?
Nah, she's busy with the mailman.
That'll make great bathroom reading.
That's mine, you jerk!
I found it!
You don't even know what to do with it, wuss-breath.
You gonna let him call you wuss-breath?
No!
Hey!
Hey!
(GRUNTS)
- Oh!
- Come on.
Want some more?
You guys want some more?
Come on!
Yeah!
You want some more?
Come on!
(GASPING)
(INDISTINCT JEERING)
(JEERING CONTINUES)
(GROWLING)
Let's get out!
Move it!
- Thanks a lot.
- All right, man.
One, two, three!
Boom!
(GROANING)
What are you laughing at, cream cheese boy?
Let's go!
BOMBAY:
If we're gonna cheat, we gotta make those falls look real.
Keep it up!
Whoa!
Score one for the spirit.
Go at him!
Go at him!
Good!
Go at him!
Come on, get angry!
Oh!
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt!
I am hurt.
Good, good.
Now say it again!
ALL:
Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
One more time!
Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
Good!
You guys are ready.
- (GRUNTING) - (CHEERING)
(BUZZER)
Give me a break, ref!
Open your eyes!
Did you see what he did to me?
- Goldberg!
- What?
You don't take the fall while they're shooting at you.
Oh!
Well, I guess you didn't explain that very well, did ya?
- I throw myself on the ice...
- District Five!
Cut the acting class.
One more dive, I forfeit to the Jets!
What?
I'm insulted by that!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
- Quit it!
- (WHISTLE BLOWING)
- Face-off!
Let's go!
Charlie!
That guy is twice your size.
So the next time he gets you in a corner like that,
I want you to grab your eye like it's cut and then hit the ice!
- Got it?
Let's go.
- REFEREE:
Let's go!
Face-off!
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
Here we go.
Hey!
- Come on!
- That's it, Charlie.
- That's it, Charlie!
- Come on!
Damn it, Charlie!
We can't even win when we cheat.
- Stupid cake-eater tricks!
- CONNIE:
That was embarrassing.
Charlie!
What the hell is the matter with you?
When I tell you to do something, you do it!
You got it?
Look at me.
- You got it?
- You can't make me cheat.
Jesse, Terry, let's go.
This is what I gave up my overtime pay for?
To see my kids takin' falls?
Gordon.
How did you know?
Through the back door at this time of night.
Just like you used to.
You'd spend hours watching me do this.
What do you think?
Is this sharp enough?
Ow!
- Did you cut yourself?
- No. (CHUCKLES)
You always fell for that.
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, I'm Scandinavian.
- (CHUCKLES) It's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.
You probably thought I was dead.
(CHUCKLES)
I saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything?
You were so busy screaming at the kids.
I didn't want to spoil the moment.
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.
Why should my store?
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that?
Well, I hardly ever lose a case.
(CHUCKLES)
That is not what I asked.
BOMBAY:
Hmm.
I see you still have this up.
- Thanks very much.
- It is important to remember the past.
I'd just as soon forget it.
That was the worse time of my life.
My dad died that year.
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.
I found this not long ago.
He was proud of you.
I miss him.
You scored 198 goals in that season, Gordon.
It's a shame you quit.
You...
- Could have gone all the way.
Yeah.
- No!
You really loved to play.
You remember?
You remember... you used to play on the ponds until after dark, until your father called you back.
You really flew on that ice, Gordon.
That's all I ever wanted to do.
Then why did you stop?
Reilly?
I saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.
- The guy wins.
- It's not about winning.
It never was.
Just show them how to play.
Show them how to have fun.
Teach them to fly.
That is what they'll remember long after you've gone back to being a doctor.
- Lawyer.
- (CHUCKLES)
And long after they've stopped buying skates from me.
Here... there you are.
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.
- What's this?
- Your new skates.
That is why you came here tonight, isn't it?
I figured nine and a half was your size.
Actually, I'm a nine.
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.
Here comes Bombay on an end-to-end rush.
Past the blue line, past center.
He's not skating, he's flying!
He fakes once, he fakes twice.
Fakes three times!
Shoots!
Scores!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
What a play!
What a guy!
Gordon Bombay does it again!
Great move, Gordy!
You faked him out of his pads.
Come here, son.
You look great out there, Gordy.
Come on, let's go inside, it's getting late.
- A few more minutes?
- (SIGHS)
Please?
- Go on.
Get outta here.
- Thanks.
(SIGHS)
(KNOCKING)
- Hi, um...
- Please, just go away.
Charlie doesn't want to be on the team any more, and neither he nor I have anything to say to you.
Well, I have something to say to you.
Oh, really?
Door-to-door mistreatment now.
Now the team can feel miserable between games too, huh?
I came to apologize to Charlie... to both of you.
- What?
- Apologize.
Well... you should.
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin'?
I was just walkin' around thinkin' and, uh...
Wanna give us a minute?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Listen, it was very wrong of me to ask you and the other guys to cheat.
I never should've said what I said to you.
I was angry.
I was frustrated.
It took a lot of guts for you to do what you knew was right.
I admire that.
And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that, uh, that I'm...
Oh, boy, this is difficult.
- I'm...
- You're sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, all right?
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be a lot more fun this time around.
What do you say?
Do you want to stay for dinner?
- What?
- Charlie!
Uh, no, I...
I can't.
Uh...
Well, what are you havin'?
Mr. Ducksworth, there are two reasons I came by.
First off, I want to let you know things are going well.
I'm learning a lot about teamwork, fair play and all that junk.
Good, good.
And the second thing?
Well, sir, fair play doesn't come cheap.
These kids, my team, have no money.
They can't afford rink time, safe equipment, proper uniforms, which makes it difficult for them to compete.
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old and stepping out onto that ice with old copies of the Enquirer taped to your shins instead of pads.
The point I'm trying to make, sir, is that you wouldn't be taken seriously, and neither are these kids.
So I thought maybe the firm could help 'em out.
How much are we talking about?
- Fifteen thousand dollars.
- No way.
Wait a minute.
Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross, the firm that gives back to the community.
Come on.
I'll get you your own jersey.
(CHEERING)
Ooo, yeah
- Can you feel it baby?
- Ooo
- I can too
- Ooo
Ooo
- Ooo
- Come on, swing
Come on, swing
Come on, swing
- Come on swing
- Ooo
(GRUNTING)
Ooo
It's such a good vibration
(GRUNTING)
It's such a sweet sensation
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
- Who is that kid?
- Thanks, Fulton.
Fulton Reed.
He's in one of my classes.
How come he's not on the team?
He only plays football.
Some preppie school gave him a scholarship as long as he doesn't play hockey.
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- I heard it was colleges.
He's already been accepted to four of 'em.
Yeah, but I heard he's gotta repeat the sixth grade.
Ah, shut up.
Gordon Bombay?
Bombay was a Hawk.
Good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
- Feel the vibration
- It's such a good vibration
Dude, check 'em out, man.
Holy cow.
- They're pretty good skaters.
- BOMBAY:
Anybody know who they are?
That's Tommy Duncan.
He's in my science class.
And that's his sister, Tammy.
BOMBAY:
Think they'd want to play hockey with us?
TOGETHER:
Yeah!
Go get dressed.
I'll do the negotiating.
Just think of it as figure skating...
with a stick.
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy!
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive!
Mom isn't gonna like this at all.
So what?
You want me to figure skate, then you gotta play hockey.
What do I know about hockey?
More than you think.
Back to basics!
Skating!
Go!
Go!
Side to side.
Shift your weight.
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.
That's okay, Charlie.
Soft hands.
You don't shoot the puck to your teammate.
You sail it to him.
Karp, on your feet.
- You send it.
- Oh!
Gross!
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it.
Cradle it.
- (ALL GROAN) Oh!
- BOMBAY:
Again!
Concentration, not strength.
Like the Karate Kid, right?
"Wax on!
Wax off!"
Just shut up and try it, Averman!
- You're such a jerk.
- BOMBAY:
Send it back, Averman.
Good, Averman.
Charlie.
Good!
Good.
Now, sail it back.
PETER:
Oh!
Way to go!
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.
- (SPLATTERING)
- Oh!
Here it comes.
Nice and easy.
Good.
- I did it!
I did it!
- All right.
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.
But when are you gonna work with me in goal?
Goldberg, do you trust me?
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar Mitzvah'd.
This is your bar Mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.
Coach, I think you got the ceremonies mixed up.
It's more like a circumcision.
Coach!
Will you come back here?
What'd I ever do to you, man?
District Five!
Ready!
Oh, man, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
- Aim!
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.
- Oh, please!
No!
- Fire!
(SCREAMING)
I wanna go home!
(SCREAMING)
(LAUGHING) This doesn't hurt!
You wimps!
Give me your best shot!
Oh!
Come on!
Hex goal!
Goalie boot save!
Come and get me!
Whoa!
Nice shot, man!
I'm a dog!
I'm a crazed dog!
Come on!
(CHANTING) Goldberg!
Goldberg!
I am Goldberg!
The goalie!
(GROWLING)
Good!
Good!
All right, Charlie!
Good hustle, Conway!
Way to go.
All right, Karp!
- You guys hungry?
Tired?
- ALL:
Yeah!
- Do you ache?
Are you pumped up?
- Yeah!
Good!
That was a hell of a practice.
Be proud of yourself.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Hey, guys!
Excuse me, guys!
You gotta untie me now!
Ha-ha!
Good joke.
Very funny.
I like it.
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach!
Coach, come on, don't leave me hangin' like this!
Coach, don't make me come after you, coach.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Thanks for the ride.
You did real well in practice today, Charlie
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad?
Mom and I left him.
I don't really remember, but that's what she says.
You know, when I was a boy, I had to take care of my mother too.
Really?
What happened to your dad?
He passed away.
You do a good job takin' care of your mom.
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right?
- Okay.
Well, see ya.
- Okay.
Hey, coach.
- What's that?
(JEERS)
- Huh?
Whoa!
- Oh!
- Victory!
(LAUGHING)
BOMBAY:
You've just entered the tickling zone!
(LAUGHING)
BOMBAY:
So I'm right in the middle of my cross-examination, and I say to the guy,
"I usually defend heels like you, you scuzzy, mole-faced rat."
(CHUCKLING) That's a good one, sir.
- (SMASHES)
- Whoa!
(SCREECHING)
Hey!
Hey!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Look, it was an accident, all right?
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
I didn't learn.
I just do it.
Do it again.
- (SMASHES) - (YELLS)
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal?
Yeah.
Well, one out of five.
Fulton, is it true what they say?
About the scholarships and how they won't let you play hockey?
People talk.
It don't mean nothin'.
- Why don't you play for us?
- I can't.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I can't.
- You afraid?
- No, I mean I can't, you moron.
I don't know how to skate.
Whoa!
Is that all that's stoppin' ya?
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.
Side to side, good!
Follow me.
(SCREAMING)
(SCREAMING)
- Watch it!
Get out of the way!
- (WOMAN SCREAMS)
Sorry!
Come on, Fulton.
Let's go!
Hey!
Whoa!
The Ducks?
We're the Ducks?
Man, what brain-dead jerk came up with that name?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But I didn't have a choice.
We're being sponsored.
- By who?
Donald and Daisy?
- (LAUGHING)
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks?
You'd rather be District Five?
Some stupid number?
Better than some stupid animal.
I'll have you know, Peter, that the duck is one of the most noble, agile and intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom.
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.
Neither do hockey players.
(CHUCKLES)
Have you guys ever seen a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation?
It's beautiful.
Pretty awesome the way they all stick together.
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight?
No way.
Why?
Because the other animals are afraid.
They know that if they mess with one duck, they gotta deal with the whole flock.
Oh, man!
I'm proud to be a duck.
And I'd be proud to fly with any one of you.
So how about it?
Who's a Duck?
I'll be a Duck.
Yeah.
Me too.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
- PETER:
Anybody see Goldberg?
- All right!
- Now we're the Ducks!
- (CHEERING)
- The Mighty Ducks!
- (CHEERING)
- What are we?
- ALL:
The Ducks!
What the hell are they doing?
Every time you get the puck, you're the quarterback.
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.
Come on, guys.
This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.
- What a weird-ass team.
- (LAUGHS)
How you doin'?
- You ready?
- I think so.
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.
My God!
Wow!
- (CROWD GASPING)
- One out of five.
All right, Let's forget the past.
We lost a few games, tough!
That was District Five.
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right!
Yeah!
Quack, quack.
- Quack.
Quack.
- ALL:
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
(CHANTING) Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Go...
Ducks!
- (CHEERING)
- What the hell was that?
BOMBAY:
Let's go, Ducks!
Defense!
Defense!
Dig it outta there!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Let's go, Ducks!
BOY:
Throw it!
Throw it!
To the crease!
(CHEERING)
Yes!
The Oreo line!
That's my boy!
(LAUGHING)
Defense, Karp!
Defense!
Come on.
(CROWD GASPING)
(WHISTLE BLOWING)
I don't wanna go to school today, Mom.
Karp, how many fingers am I holding' up?
- He wouldn't know that anyway.
- Shut up, Peter.
- Karp, are you okay?
- Look at this.
The Karp-ster used his head to stop the puck.
Mr. Karp-a-lanee.
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.
Get him on the bench, Charlie.
(KARP GROANS)
Okay, Ducks, we still got a chance here.
Connie, Terry, Jesse, Guy, time for the secret weapon.
Okay, Fulton.
Remember, just like we talked about.
- PETER:
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.
- (ALL CHEER)
(CHEERING)
Oh, no.
- Go!
Get the face-off!
- Line up, boys, let's go.
That's it.
(SCREAMS)
Whoa!
- (WHISTLE BLOWING) - (CHEERING)
Whoo!
Yeah!
That tie of yours might be what you need to make the play-offs.
- The Ducks have a shot?
- Sure.
Everyone but the last two teams are in, remember?
Panthers got the measles and they forfeited the season.
So, you beat the Huskies and you'll make the play-offs.
Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
So?
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since I played.
Actually, one little thing has changed.
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.
They redrew the district lines last year.
The lake is not the boundary any more.
You see?
You'd be a Duck.
I'd be a Duck.
- Excuse me.
Coach Reilly?
- Yeah?
I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.
- What's that?
- One of your players is ineligible.
Banks!
Over here!
- This is a joke, right?
- I'm afraid it's no joke.
- Is there a problem?
- No, just a mistake, Mr. Banks.
Are you this boy's father?
450 North Hennipen Avenue, is that your address?
- Yes.
- I'm afraid there's no mistake.
This boy is playing for the wrong team.
- What?
- According to league rules,
Adam Banks should be playing for District Five.
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- Is this your doing, Gordon?
I'll expect to see him at our next game.
We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
No way!
My son would rather not play than play for your team.
Fine, if that's the way you want it.
But remember, if Adam plays for the Hawks, you'll forfeit every game for the rest of the season.
Boy, I'd hate to see that.
Look, I'm sorry this had to happen, but you can see on the map, it's very clearly delineated.
Gordon?
Hey, Bombay!
You stop when I'm talking to you, son!
What's the idea here?
You trying to sabotage me or what?
The law's a bitch when it works against you, isn't it, Jack?
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.
Even with Banks, what do you think you're gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers?
That's right, coach.
They are losers.
We hate losers, don't we?
They don't even deserve to live.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe Banks won't make a difference, but at least we're playing by the rules.
Why'd you turn against me, Gordon?
For six years...
I taught ya how to skate, I taught ya how to score.
I taught ya how to go for the "W."
You could have been one of the greats!
And now look at yourself.
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.
Going to the play-offs!
Whoo!
One win!
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.
All right, everyone, listen up.
I got some good news.
We're getting a new player, Adam Banks.
- What?
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.
- We don't need him.
- I'm the coach.
I say we do need him.
If we make it to the play-offs, he could be a big help.
"If"?
All of a sudden, you don't think we're good enough?
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.
- What?
- We heard what you said.
You said we were losers, we didn't deserve to live.
That's not what I meant.
I saw that picture of you missing that goal.
You were a Hawk, weren't you?
Guess you guys stick together to the end.
You know what?
I don't need your stinkin' equipment.
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.
- I'm talkin' to you, son!
- Forget it, cake-eater.
If you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.
Where do you guys think you're goin'?
I don't believe this.
(SIGHS)
All right,
I'm goin' up to the bench because that's where I'm supposed to be.
Anyone who wants to join me can join me.
Anyone who doesn't...
Well...
Ten minutes to game time, coach.
Yeah, yeah, they'll be out in a minute.
They're... you know, working themselves into a frenzy.
(DOOR SLAMS)
Not much of a frenzy.
We forfeit.
Ducks forfeit.
Flames, you win.
Hey.
Can I sit?
Sure.
(SIGHS) You talk to the guys?
I tried.
They think I'm a traitor for even showing up.
I guess they really hate me, huh?
Is it true you were really a Hawk?
Yeah.
Peter said you blew a really big game once.
Yeah, well, Peter's right.
It was the last game of the state finals.
We were tied 2-2 in the end of the third period.
I get a penalty shot.
I go in, I triple deke.
I fake the goalie right out of his pads.
The puck's headed in, and then...
- Clang!
Hits the post.
- (GROANS)
We lost in overtime.
A quarter of an inch this way and it would've gone in.
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way
- and you'd have missed completely.
- (CHUCKLES)
I never thought of it that way.
At least you got to play in a championship game.
God, that must've been so cool.
Hey.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
I'd love one.
You know, she has many fine qualities that men find attractive.
I know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.
So, what kind of guys does she usually date?
Jerks.
I mean, most of them like her, but as soon as they catch a glimpse of me...
Pow!
Warp speed!
They are gone!
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, I wouldn't even care, except it's not fair to my mom.
She deserves somebody nice.
Are you gonna come over for dinner again?
I don't know, Charlie.
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
See, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I, um...
talked to Jesse and Terry's dad, and he's gonna take over coaching for the rest of the year.
You're quitting?
I'm stepping aside to keep the team together.
The guys can't play for somebody they don't trust.
I trust you.
The other guys do too.
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.
- Charlie, I've done all I can.
- No, you haven't.
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.
We are too!
We weren't even the Ducks until you came along.
You made us and now you're stuck with us.
Charlie.
That's right.
The red is oxygen.
Now, what are the blue balls?
(GIGGLING)
- Tommy?
- Hydrogen?
Is correct.
Now put them together, and you have a molecule that makes up 96% of your body.
- What is it?
- Pizza?
(GIGGLING)
(KNOCKING)
It's the principal.
I'll be right back.
Work on H2 CO3.
It's a goody.
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way?
- Yeah, did you score?
Leave me alone, guys.
I don't want to talk about the team.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.
Everybody knows he likes you best.
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp!
Take it back now!
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.
- CONNIE:
Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl!
- Lay off!
- Don't shove, Peter.
(ALL ARGUING)
Atoms away!
My atoms!
You!
Sit!
Sit, now!
In your seats, now!
I have never in my life...
What have you got to say for yourselves?
BOY:
Quack.
(CLASS CHANT) Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!
Thanks for coming by on such short notice, Gordon.
By the way, your court release came through.
Congratulations.
Your community service is over.
You're kidding.
So you wanted to talk about my coming back to work then?
- Well, actually...
- Oh, you got your jersey.
Great!
A lot's been happening, sir.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.
(LAUGHS)
Gordon, you know Coach Reilly and Mr. Banks.
(MUMBLING) Sir, they're the bad guys.
(CHUCKLES) No, actually, Phil is one of my oldest friends.
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together here to try to work out this little problem.
You see, my son Adam wants to play for the Hawks.
His older brother was a Hawk.
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.
REILLY:
It's a tradition.
Now, you understand that, Gordon.
You played.
Sure, I can.
But the league's already ruled on it.
We've talked to the league, and we worked out a little deal.
You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League?
Yes, we did.
REILLY:
The long and short of it is that Adam stays on the Hawks for the rest of the season.
And then next year, they redraft the lines.
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.
What's that?
That you withdraw your protest.
- That's great.
- Good, good.
- Well, that's settled then.
- No, sir, you don't understand.
I can't withdraw my protest.
- What?
- BOMBAY:
Mr. Ducksworth, you wanted me to learn about fair play, and how to be part of a team,
and I may not have learned everything yet, but...
I remember something my father said to me.
A team isn't a bunch of kids out to win.
A team is something you belong to, something you feel,
something you have to earn.
And I'm not gonna let those kids down.
Gordon, I'm going to make this simple.
Are you prepared to lose your job over some kids?
Some game?
Let me ask you, sir.
Are you prepared to fire me over some kids?
Some game?
Collect your personal belongings, Gordon.
Yes, sir, Mr. Ducksworth!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth!
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.
(QUACKING)
You may have paid for this jersey, sir, but you didn't earn it.
I'll see you in the play-offs.
(BELL RINGS)
Excuse me.
There are some students here that I'd like to see.
- Who are you?
- I'm their hockey coach.
If you could tell me where I can find each of them, please.
They're in room 223.
- All of them?
- All of them.
ALL: "I will not quack at the principal."
"I will not quack at the principal."
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you guys.
- People.
- People, right.
Sit down, please.
All of you.
Okay, don't sit down.
Look, what's done is done.
I want to be your coach again.
You wanna coach a bunch of losers?
- No, I want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said?
You said we didn't deserve to live.
Karp, I was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means?
- No.
- Okay, then you do.
I didn't mean those things the way they sounded.
You guys know what it's like to be misunderstood, right?
- Yeah, of course.
We're kids.
- So...
Can you forgive me?
Can I be your coach again?
- What about Banks?
- He can be on the team if he wants.
He should have been with us all year.
It's you guys who were cheated.
But let's forget all that crap!
- We're a team, right?
- DUCKS:
Yeah.
I made you guys, and I'm sticking with you.
So, what's it gonna be?
We can play tomorrow night and still have a shot at the play-offs... or we can forfeit again and the season's over.
Peter, what do you say?
Well...
I guess it would help if we practiced first.
All right.
Let me see if I can get you out of detention.
- Yes.
- Take that.
You really quacked at the principal?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Are we Ducks, or what?
Yeah!
Look at your mother.
- Let's see how it is in ten minutes.
- I'm gonna kill you!
Hey.
Wasn't sure if you'd show up.
Yeah, whatever.
- I just want to play hockey.
- Good.
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.
On behalf of the Ducks, I'd like to say welcome.
Cake-eater.
Ooh, the Jess-man, dissin' the new guy!
The Jess-ster!
Shut up, Averman!
AVERMAN:
It's just a joke.
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey doesn't mean you're a real Duck.
They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
I bet.
Well, suit up.
I'll see you on the ice.
On your left!
Over here!
I'm open!
Come on, right here!
Up front!
- Up front!
- Pass it to Banks!
Come on!
Do somethin' with it!
- (WHISTLE BLOWING)
- Yeah!
All right!
Way to go, Banks!
(CHEERING)
(DUCKS TALKING EXCITEDLY)
Goldberg, you're gonna sit this one out.
What?
You're pulling the goalie when we're tied?
Listen, listen, listen!
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.
Okay, Fulton, you're our extra man.
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.
We pulling the Statue of Liberty play?
- Yeah?
- No, take your shot.
You may only get one, so it's gotta be good.
- But, coach, one outta one?
- Soft hands, Fulton.
- Concentration, not strength.
- BOMBAY:
That's right!
Okay?
Let's get the Huskies!
- Let's go!
Come on!
- (ALL YELLING)
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one.
Let's go!
- Get in there!
- Come on!
JESSE:
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!
Shoot, Fulton, shoot!
We won!
We made the play-offs!
CHARLIE:
Boy, this is great.
CONNIE:
Guys, look, it's the North Stars.
- Oh, man.
- It's Mike Modano!
- Believe this?
- Cool!
- This is too cool.
- I can't believe this.
CONNIE:
This place is humongous.
What are we doing here?
It's a little play-offs present.
Hey, Gordo!
Gordon Bombay, right?
- You remember me?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- I heard you were a farmer.
Actually, I became a lawyer.
But I'm coaching Pee Wee now and this is my team, the Ducks.
Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
DUCKS:
We can see that.
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks!
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.
If you ever want a shot, I'll get you a tryout in the minor-league clubs.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, nice seein' ya.
Take it easy.
BOMBAY:
All right, let's have some fun!
You've got to accentuate the positive
Eliminate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister In-between
You've got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to that minimum
Have faith or pandemonium
You're liable to walk upon the sea
To illustrate my last remark
Talking about Jonah in a whale and Noah in an ark
What did they do when everything looked so dark
Then they say
You better accentuate the positive
Eliminate that negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister In-between
We better accentuate the positive
Eliminate all the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister In-between
No, don't mess with Mister In-between
- Hey!
- Hey!
Don't you mess with Mister In-between
You know, I heard the North Stars wore the same underwear... all through the play-offs last year for luck.
So I'm doin' the same thing.
Hmm.
Maybe I should've cooked.
You know, I'm thinkin' maybe we can all go down to the winter festival tonight.
- All three of us?
- Sure.
I don't think I should, 'cause I got a lot of homework.
You should go.
With my mom.
By yourselves.
(DOORS SLAMS)
Mmm, smells great!
Hello.
(WHISPERING) Go for it.
Hi.
CASEY:
I don't know how they sculpt these.
Hmm, I wonder.
I used to sculpt, but now I do mostly paintings.
How do you think they do the details?
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.
Oh.
I'm nervous.
I'm rambling on and on here.
You probably think I'm weird.
No, I think you're great.
When I was a little girl, I used to pretend that that was an ice castle.
And that was my room, that window right up there.
And last winter I gave Charlie that one.
What about me?
Which window's mine?
I want to live there too.
What?
What did I say?
- It's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy?
Casey, I was just playin' around.
Look, I don't know how you feel about me.
I don't even know how I feel about you.
But I do know there's a little kid back home... who's absolutely falling in love with his coach... and if you can't deal with that, if you're just playing around, then you better let me know.
What are we talking?
'Til death do us part?
- I have to decide on the first date?
- Stop it, Gordon.
Charlie's gonna be there when we get back.
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.
Look, I can take it.
But if Charlie gets too attached...
Every time this happens, it gets... a little rougher on him.
Just on him?
I'm glad to be here with you.
Me too.
ANNOUNCER:
The surprising Ducks are still in this game against the Hornets.
Banks moving right in front, stops.
He shoots, he scores!
It's getting rough out there between the Ducks and the Hornets.
Here's Adam Banks in the slot.
He stops, shoots.
He scores!
Back it goes to Averman.
He shoots!
Score!
The ducks win it, 5-3 over the Hornets.
And now it's on to the semifinals... where the Ducks will face the Cardinals.
What a game so far, ladies and gentlemen!
The Ducks and the Cardinals!
Cardinals with it in their own zone, tryin' to clear it out.
Pass to the blue line, intercepted by the Ducks.
Here's their star, Adam Banks.
Banks has great speed.
Right down the middle!
Goes around one man with a great move!
Steps around another defender!
He scores!
Come on!
Come on, Jesse!
ANNOUNCER:
Ducks with it again.
Here's Averman, now getting it over to Banks.
Germaine is right in the slot.
Germaine with it!
He shoots, he scores!
Germaine put it off the goaltender's glove into the net!
And that does it!
The Ducks have won!
Can you believe it?
4-2, and the Ducks now get set to face the Hawks in the state finals.
REILLY:
All right, it's up to you, Gordon.
Now, you miss this shot, you're not just letting your team down, you're letting me down too.
Remember, it's not worth playing...
- If you can't win.
- That's right.
Okay, son, let's go.
Let's go, son!
(YELLS)
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
Oh, say does that star-spangled
Banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
All right!
ANNOUNCER:
Welcome to the Minnesota State Pee Wee Championship.

Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
- Go Ducks!

(CHEERING)
(BOOING)
Hey, Banks.
Don't forget what side you're on.
He's a Duck, Jesse.
He'll play like a Duck.
ANNOUNCER:
And the game is underway, and right off Larson and McGill with a heavy hit.
That gives you an indication of what you're going to see tonight.
REILLY:
Good hit!
That's the way I want you guys to play it!
ANNOUNCER:
The Ducks in green chasing it down against...
A hard hit out at center ice!
Keep it away from 'em!
Come on, Banks!
Heavy hitting continues in this championship game.
Banks up the center ice.
He drives it down into the Hawks' zone.
Back in again to Larson, the man behind the net.
- Go, go, go!
- Get it out of there!
Banks, two comin' hard!
Banks still looking for an opening, moves it up.
Banks gets knocked down against the boards.
The puck is intercepted by the Hawks.

Larson gives it up to McGill.
Here's McGill, inside, the lead at center ice.
He's up on the blue line and around the net.
And he scores!
And now the Hawks lead 2-0.
Good save, Goldberg!
All right, all right!
That's the kind of hockey
I want to see played all day, boys.
Larson stopped at the blue line, but the Ducks can't clear it out.
McGill to Brown, left side.
He shoots!
He scores!
The Hawks lead late in the first period, 3-0.
Don't be scared of them, Ducks.
That's what they want.
Keep your heads up.
Play proud.
- Let's fly!
Come on, let's go!
- (DUCKS CHEERING)
REILLY:
All right, pressure, boys.
Pressure, pressure!
All right, hold it, hold it.
I want you to drop Banks like a bad habit.
I want him outta the game.
- Finish him off.
You got it?
- Yeah.
Okay, boys, let's go.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right!

He's injured.
Oh, my God.
Come on, son, let's go.
Come on.
Number seven, McGill.
Cross-checking.
Two minutes.
HAWK:
Don't worry, guys.
Did it go in?
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favor.
Kick some Hawk butt.
All right, cake-eater.
He'll be okay, Sir.
We need to take some X-rays, though.
Hell of a job, son.
They score against us, they're gonna pay the price.
Now, don't worry.
We're gonna get that one back.
You got somethin' to say to me, Bombay?
To think I wasted all those years worrying about what you thought.
You're goin' down, Reilly.
Let me go after 'em, coach.
Let me get 'em.
No, we're better than that.
Look, look, it's time to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.
- All right?
Now we got the power play.
- DUCKS:
Yeah.
All right.
We're gonna hit 'em where it hurts the most:
Up there.
DUCKS:
Yeah.
Fulton, you're in.
- Coach, they'll be rushing' him.
- Right.
Jesse, make sure you give Fulton plenty of time.
- Right, coach.
- CHARLIE:
Jesse, do good.
Let's go!
- DUCKS:
Yeah!
- Hold it!
Wait!
Whoa!
Let's have fun out there.
- DUCKS:
All right!
- All right!
Let's go!
Let's go!

Who has a big, booming shot.
And the Ducks get it back to Fulton Reed.

Here's Reed winding.

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
Yes!
That's it!
More fun!
More fun!
Of all the sloppy ass...
Ladies, they don't need our help out there!
Now I want that Fulton Reed covered.
He better not make another shot.
You got it?
I'm tellin' you, you blow this game and nobody makes the team next year!
All right, get out there!
Quick feet, now!
Quick feet!
The puck comes around, now to Blake on the right side.
Blake through the slot with a backhand.
Scores!
Blake with a backhanded goal, and the Hawks regain the two goal lead at 4-2.
Guys, guys, guys, listen up, listen.
We have got to stay fired up and focused, all right?
It ain't over 'til it's over.
Tammy, Tommy, let's show these Hawks something really different.
Come here.
All right.
I want you guys to start up here...
Third period and the Ducks trail 4-2, trying desperately to get back in the game.
The Ducks with Tammy and Tommy Duncan on the ice.
Tammy Duncan goes in front of the net, Tommy with the puck.
Tammy's spinning, and the Hawks are just looking at her.
- Come on.
- Come on!
Now!

Yes!
Yes!
We're still alive!
(CROWD BOOING)
I'm on, coach.
Yes, we're still in there!
He Grabs McGill from behind... and throws him over the boards into the bench.
Now he wants to pick a fight with the entire Hawks team.
Fulton Reed has to be restrained by the referee.
Game misconduct.
You're outta here, son.
I'm off, coach.
He barely touched him.
Oreo line!
I want you to remember what we learned.
- Ducks stick together, right?
- Yeah!
So let's see it!
Show me the flying "V."
- All right!
- All right!
Let's get a line change!
Let's go!
JESSE:
Here we go!
Come on, y'all, let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
Flying "V"!
Jesse Hall goes behind his own net, joined by the rest of his team.

Tremendous pressure.
Neither team can afford any mistakes now.
23 seconds left to go in regulation.
Looking for the game-winning goal, here's Morgan moving into the slot.

Big save, Goldberg!
We'll get 'em in overtime!
Score tied at four.
Now Averman ahead to Charlie Conway.
- Come on, Charlie.
- Conway to center ice on a breakaway!
Conway moving across the Hawk blue line, down the middle!
He could win the game!
Hey!
Where's the call?
No time left on the clock, but the referee is calling a penalty shot!
REILLY:
What kind of call is that?
Okay, we've got a penalty shot for the Ducks.
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.
All right, Ducks, who's gonna take it?
- I think he should take it.
- Me?
What about Charlie?
- What about Charlie?
- All he does is fan.
Let's let him finish what he started.
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.
Come here.
You been practicing that triple deke?
- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.
You may make it, you may not.
But that doesn't matter, Charlie.
What matters is that we're here.
Look around.
Whoever thought we'd make it this far?
One, two, three.
Triple deke.
Take your best shot.
I believe in you, Charlie, win or lose.
- Thanks, coach.
- Go get 'em.
- All right, Charlie.
- Let's go, Charlie.
(ALL CHEERING)
ALL:
Go, Charlie!
Okay, now wait for my signal.
Good luck.
(CHANTING) Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
(CHANTING) Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...
Okay, now don't leave your crease before he touches the puck.
Good luck.
(BLOWS WHISTLE)
Come on, Charlie.
Come on, Charlie.
(CROWD CHEERING)
(SILENCE)
(CHEERING)
Thank you, Hans.
I'm proud of you, Gordon.
(CHANTING) Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks,
Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks,
Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks...
Look, don't take any bad dives, okay?
Just remember, keep your head up, man.
Cake-eater.
Remember, strength, not concentration.
BOMBAY:
Right.
And for God's sakes, soft hands.
Right.
Anything else?
Yeah.
Have fun out there, coach.
I must be crazy.
A tryout with the minors.
I'm gonna be goin' up against kids half my age.
Just have a good tryout, Gordon.
One step at a time.
Yeah, you're right.
(KIDS HOOTING)
Bye.
I'll call you when I get there.
Banks is first in line next!
Hey, Ducks!
No matter what happens, we'll see you next season.
- We got a title to defend.
- (CHEERING)
I'm closing up
I'm closing in
Couldn't wait for this moment to come
Couldn't wait for this day to begin
Won't be afraid
Got so much pride
And I've never been a loser
And I just can't lose tonight
Winning it all, ain't gonna walk away
Giving it all, no matter what you say
Ain't gonna fall, don't wanna lose today
Winning it all
This time it's right
My time has come
Gonna give everything that I've got
Till it's over and victory's won
No second chance
No giving up
Because no one remembers a loser
And I don't intend to be one
Winning it all, ain't gonna walk away
Giving it all, no matter what you say
Ain't gonna fall, don't wanna lose today
Oh, winning it all
Winning it all, ain't gonna walk away
Giving it all, no matter what you say
Ain't gonna fall, don't wanna lose today
Winning it all
Winning it all, ain't gonna walk away
Giving it all
Buddy you're a boy make a big noise

You got blood on yo' face, you big disgrace
Wavin' your banner all over the place

We will we will rock you
...The Minnesota Pee Wee Championship is up for grabs.
Both teams playing like there's no tomorrow.
Duluth, in the Hawks'zone, looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.
There's a pass out to the blue line.
Intercepted by Gordon Bombay!
Bombay!
He's got a breakaway.
Across the blue line all alone for a chance to win the game!
He's pulled down from behind by Fox of Duluth.
Fox definitely pulled him down from behind and this could be -
Yes, the referee calls for a penalty shot.
Gordon, it's up to you.
I don't wanna see any goats around after the game.
You got it?
Now, you miss this shot... you're not just lettin' me down, you're lettin' your team down.
Apressure situation he's in now.
The 1973 Pee Wee State Championship now rests... on the little shoulders of number 9, Gordon Bombay.
Gordon!
Gordon!
Let's go, son!
All right!
He hit the goalpost!
What a heartbreaker!
Little Gordon Bombay had the chance -
All my client did was attempt to give you what you wanted!
Isn't that right?
This man put his neck on the line for your greed.
Objection.
Your Honour?
Will both counsellors approach the bench?
What's he doing?
I don't have anything to tell you.
I just wanna make a point.
So nod like I'm saying something important.
- Mr. Bombay?
- Gordon, what are you doing?
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.
This drives him nuts and I love it.
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya?
Oh, Mr. Bombay, I'm so glad you could make it.
Please restrict yourself to a relevant cross-examination!
Your Honour, the applicability of societal intent... vis-a-vis individual action is well established.
I'm citing Minneapolis V. Higgins.
The appellant court overruled a judge who disallowed similar testimony.
Now, if I'm not mistaken, that was... you.
Wasn't it,Judge Weathers?
I stand corrected, counsellor.
Objection overruled.
Oh,you really stooped to an all-time low on this, Bombay.
I'm insulted, Frank.
You have no idea how low I can stoop.
I don't mind losing.
I would just like to lose fair.
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.
And what about justice?
That man should be in jail.
It was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me!
Next time do your job, Frankie boy.
- 30 and 0!
I remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case?
We don't count that one because I scored with the court reporter.
- The one you said had the intelligent body?
- That's the one.
- No calls on the Duck phone?
- Not yet.
What's he waiting for?
I saw him in the back of the courtroom.
How about some kudos here, huh?
Mr. Tolbert dropped off ringside seats for tonight's North Stars game.
Hockey?
Forget it!
Gordon, here's the research for the Pearlstein Project.
- Can you get started?
- Jane!
Can't you see I'm reveling here?
Today I'm 30 and 0!
- 30 and one.
- Type,Jeannie, don't speak.
Mr. Bombay's office.
Yes.
It's Ducksworth.
You're right.
He wants to see you.
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
It was nothing, Mr. Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth.
Gordon, another fine job today.
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.
Score.
Don't spike.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean, sir.
This is a business.
It isn't a game.
Next time a little restraint might be in order.
~Hey, man, get off my back I'm doin'the best I can,yeah ~
~ You bust my neck Cut no slack ~
- ~Forget your fellow man Yeah yeah uh-huh ~
- Pull your vehicle over to the right, now!
- This is not good.
- ~ Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah ~
- Licence, please.
- Could you turn down the stereo?
- Sure.
I guess it was a "widdle" noisy.
A "widdle"?
Okay, I'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine?
No, thanks, I'm full.
Okay, out of the car.
Now.
The charges against Mr. Bombay are driving under the influence, driving with an open container and reckless endangerment.
And to think I almost stayed home this morning.
I assume you're representing yourself?
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a licence?
Okay, let's talk business.
What am I facing?
Suspension of licence?
Fines?
What?
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow you to plead guilty to lesser charges.
But that's solely up to the prosecutor.
The city of Minneapolis does not wish to pursue a plea bargain in this case.
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo?
The defendant is released on his own recognizance.
Mr. Ducksworth.
What are you doing here?
I own the place.
How about you?
Just goin' over a few cases.
RICOH Statute stuff.
Oh, I thought you might be researching your defence... against D.U.I. and reckless endangerment.
Did you think I wouldn't find out, Gordon?
There was no reason to concern you with it, sir.
They have no case.
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp.
I found a loophole.
I'm gonna plead not guilty -
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.
There's not going to be a trial.
I am not going to have you drag... this firm's good name through the mud.
I've talked toJudge Weathers and he has agreed to suspend your case.
- Under what conditions?
- Probation, suspension of your driver's licence... and 500 hours of community service.
And a leave of absence from the firm.
A leave of absence?
He can't do that.
- He can't stop me from working!
- He's not.
I am.
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.
It'll teach you compassion, a sense of fair play, how to fit in.
- Community service?
This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.
And hopefully you'll come back a better person and a better attorney, which is why I'm keeping you on salary and have arranged a driver for you.
You know, in the early '7 Os I drove the tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties, amps cranked up to about eight jillion decibels.
All that loud music damaged my hearing, but I got no regrets...
- except for the '80s.
- How could he do this to me?
Community service...
coaching hockey!
I found one!
I'm comin' out!
Karp,you finally found something for once in your life.
Dumpster Dave comes through!
- What do you think?
- Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.
- You gonna take that from him, Karp?
- Remind me to bust you, Averman.
- Thanks, Peter.
Thanks very much.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah!
Right there!
- Yeah!
Here, Petie.
Here, boy.
A little chili to keep you warm, buddy.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look!
I can't believe he ate the can too.
He sniffs.
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.
He sniffs some more.
He stops.
I think this is it!
He's turnin' in a circle.
- He squats!
He scores!
- Yes!
We did it!
Full load.
Stinks!
Come on, come on, give me the dollar!
- Hurry it up already.
- I'm hurrying', okay?
- Go, go, go, go!
- Yeah!
All right!
Let's do it!
Oh, come on.
Stop!
- Yes!
- Okay!
Here we go.
Yeah.
There's more inside.
He's takin'off with it.
This guy deserves what he gets.
Oh, guys, he saw us.
Oh, my!
Rink's gotta be around here someplace.
Just look for a sign that says " Personal Hell. "
How could he do this to me?
I hate kids.
They're barely human.
Come on!
Over here!
Keep it down, please!
Hey, come on.
There's no need for this.
Let's talk, come on.
I'm your friend, aren't I?
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to stop it.
I'm tired of chasing' the puck.
Be careful, man.
It almost hit me that time.
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
It's supposed to hit you.
Does that sound stupid to anyone else?
Good God.
That's the hockey team.
Drive out on the ice.
It'll be all right.
I ain't scared.
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.
We're gonna get in big trouble.
- I'll take care of it.
- They're drugs, I just know it.
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.
This is my dominion.
This is a drug-free zone, you understand?
We ain't buying' nothin'.
I'm feelin' generous today.
So I'm gonna let you get your sorry vanilla bootie outta here... before we be usin' your eyeballs as hockey pucks.
Thanks, bro, but I'm not goin' home 'til I take care of business.
He's got a gun.
Stand back.
Whew!
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.
I'm Gordon Bombay.
I'm the new coach.
What a joke!
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.
Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.
Here's the long and the short of it.
I hate hockey and I don't like kids.
What's this supposed to be, a pep talk?
I'm sure this'll be a real bonding experience.
Maybe one day one of you will even write a book about it in jail.
- Funny.
- Is there a goalie?
Only for a little while.
I'm movin' back to Philly.
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.
Uh,just so you know.
We really suck.
I'll decide who sucks around here.
- Get off me.
- They really suck.
The Pete-meister.
Mr. Rabble-rouser.
Passing the puck over toJesse-roonie, the enforcer.
Ouch!
That hurt!
Oh, it's the Connie-meister, the velvet hammer.
Hi, coach.
I'm Connie.
- Do you play?
- No.
So what's our record anyway?
0 and 9.
One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.
We almost scored a goal too.
So what do we do now... coach?
- What did your old coach have you do?
- He just yelled a lot.
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm?
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us, " Little bastards, where'd you learn to play?
Oh, you suck, you!
Skate, you little bast-"
Heart attack.
Great.
All right, look.
I gotta make a phone call.
Keep scrimmaging.
You, you, you, you and you against you four.
- We got names, you know?
- I'm sure you do.
And I'll bet they're very nice names.
I might even learn 'em.
For now, I'll be in my office.
Oh, and if you need anything, fax me.
Geez, what a jerk.
Where do they find these coaches anyways?
We're impressionable kids, right?
Shouldn't we check his qualifications or somethin'?
Jeannie, who told you not to give me my messages?
Ducksworth!
Then who's handling my cases?
- On three!
- Jane!
- One, two, three!
Charge!
- Are you kidding me?
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to -
Hold on a second!
Hey!
Get your mouth off the windows!
- Hey!
- Get off there!
Get off the car!
- We're being invaded!
- Get off!
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool!
- Is that a real phone?
- Yes, and I'm really on it.
- Not any more.
- Thank you.
- Let's see, who should I -
- Watch the upholstery.
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
- We wanna ride!
- I could kill one of'em just to set an example.
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything!
This looks good.
I'm gonna eat it.
- Wow, I feel like Madonna.
- You wish!
Seats ten comfortably.
Hey, pass me one of those glasses.
Yeah, I see your point.
Oh.
Goldberg!
- It wasn't me, all right!
- Young man, what did you eat?
- Nothing!
It wasn't me!
- Open a window!
Oh, man!
It's my mom!
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.
All right, out!
Everybody, out of the car right now.
Goldberg, why'd you have to ruin the fun?
Are you out of your mind?
What were you thinking putting that car on the ice?
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take.
One crack!
- The ice is not gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
- The new coach?
They send you over here to coach the team and you endanger their lives.
What danger?
I grew up on the ice;
I know when it's safe to drive on.
- How do you know?
- I just know!
All right?
Well, listen, Mr. Zen Master, you may be in tune with the ice universe, but when it comes to my kid, "I just know" doesn't cut it.
Charlie, let's go.
- Mom?
- Give me my candy!
All of it!
Well, I guess practise is over.
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- It's all right, Charlie.
Coach, gonna be at the game tomorrow?
By order of the state of Minnesota, yeah.
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!
Hawks!

One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
- Hi, girls.
- Karp!
No!
Goodbye.
The hawks.
My first game and it had to be the Hawks.
Gordon?
Gordon Bombay.
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.
Why don't you just call meJack?
Hey, come back to see your old coach, huh?
Well, actually I'm, uh, coaching...
Pee Wee.
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'.
You got a kid on the team or something?
No, I'm here because I need to be of service to the community.
How about this, huh?
Whoever thought we'd be coaching' against each other?
Yeah, who'd have thought?
So, who's your hotshot player this year?
- Anyone good?
- I got a kid named Banks.
Might go all the way.
Not quite as good as you were.
But he wants it more.
Kid won't give up.
Oh, boy,
I wish they would take that one down.
Don't you?
Well, good luck.
You're gonna need it.
It's up to you, Gordon.
You miss this shot, you're not just... letting me down, you're letting your whole team down too.
I wish your dad could be here to see this.
Make him proud of you!
Win!
Win!
Win!
All right, guys, gather round.
Come on, come on.
- Win!
Win!
Win!

Yeah, we're fired up.
All right!
Watch this!
Oh, great.
Good concept, guys.
Nice - ouch!
Nice goin', fool!
- Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
- Oh, yeah, "I didn't mean to. "
Yeah, sure, you're on my own team.
Oh, sorry, Goldberg.
Didn't mean to.
Would you get off me before I clock you?
Let's go,Jesse!
Go, Terry!
Let's go!
Come on in.
What's this?
The Oreo line!
Hey, come on.
Let's play hockey.
Um, batter, batter, hum, batter, batter!
Hey, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Hum, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Averman!
It's hockey!
There's no batter.
Idiot.
Hum, goalie, goalie, hum, goalie, goalie!
Hey, goalie, goalie, save, goalie, goalie!
Hum, goalie, goalie, hey, goalie, goalie!
No, I got him!
I, I, I got him!
That's one!
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy!
Good show.
Sloppy pass.
Way to stuff it, Banks!
All right, all right!
Let's run it up!
Run it up!
Run it up!
Oh, man!
How could you let him get by you?
All right, line change.
Come on, go, go, go.
Hey!
Banks!
Banks!
Banks!
Hey, you!
Come back here!
Oh!
Why me?
How lazy can you be?
They're killing us out there!
How many times do I have to tell you:
Get those rebounds, get your heads up, get those loose pucks.
Get
- Just -
Just get the hell outta here.
All right!
It's Spaz-way.
He'll screw up.
Hey, hey!
Way to play it, Banks!
All right!
That's okay, Charlie!
Nice try!
Nice fan, Charlie.
Keep swingin'.
Maybe you'll give 'em a cold.
Hey, hey, hey, knock it off!
Against this team we should have twice this many!
Now let's run it up!
Remember it's not worth winning if you can't win big!
All right!
Guys!
No!
Come on, let's talk about this!
Be civilized!
Come on!
Please!
Oh no, guys!
Come on, not again!
Please!
Just take the goal.
Fine!
I don't care!
- I'm so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.
All right!
Hey, knock it off!
That was a lousy third period.
Anybody could beat these pansies.
I want you guys to stay hungry out there!
All right, nice goin', Banks.
New Hawks record.
- Okay, boys.
Let's go.
- All right!
Hey, Gordon!
Nice game.
I enjoyed it thoroughly.
At least I can handle the puck!
Hey, shut up!
You guys stink!
I thought we came here to play hockey.
You know, I knew we forgot something.
Oh, you think it's funny?
You think losing is funny?
Well, not at first, but once you get the hang of it.
We're the ones out there gettin' our butts kicked.
Yeah, it's not like you coach us or anything.
At least we try.
You didn't listen to a word I said.
I said, keep your heads up.
You put your heads down.
I said, hustle.
You went slower!
That was the sloppiest playing I've ever seen.
Why the hell don't you just listen to me?
Why the hell should we?
I don't care.
You want to lose, fine.
You're the ones who look like idiots out there.
Great game!
Hans?
I don't believe it!
Who would throw these away?
- First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
- Fork it over.
Forget it, Karp.
I can see this every day on MTV.
This one's from Minneapolis.
Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom.
- Let's give him a wedgie.
- Good idea,Jesse!
I was just kidding, okay?
Hey!
Give that back!
- Hi, girls.
- Does your mommy know you have that?
Nah, she's busy with the mailman.
That'll make great bathroom reading.
That's mine, you jerk!
I found it!
You don't even know what to do with it, wuss-breath.
- You gonna let him call you wuss-breath?
- No!
Hey!
Hey!
- Oh!
- Come on.
Want some more?
You guys want some more?
Come on!
Yeah!
You want some more?
Come on!
Let's get out!
Move it!
- Thanks a lot.
- All right, man.
One, two, three!
Boom!
What are you laughing at, cream cheese boy?
Go!
If we're gonna cheat, we gotta make those falls look real.
Keep it up!
Whoa!
Score one for the spirit.
Go at him!
Go at him!
Good!
Go at him!
Come on, get angry!
Oh!
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt!
I am hurt.
Good, good.
Now say it again!
Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
- One more time!
- Take the fall!
Act hurt!
Get indignant!
Good!
You guys are ready.
Give me a break, ref!
Open your eyes!
Did you see what he did to me?
Goldberg, you don't take the fall while they're shooting at you.
Oh!
Well, I guess you didn't explain that very well, did ya?
- District Five!
- I throw myself on the ice -
Cut the acting class.
One more dive, I forfeit to theJets!
What?
I'm insulted by that!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
- Quit it!
Face-off!
Let's go!
Charlie!
That guy is twice your size.
The next time he gets you in a corner like that,
I want you to grab your eye like it's cut and then hit the ice!
- Got it?
Let's go.
- Let's go!
Face-off!
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
Here we go.
Hey -
- Come on!
- That's it, Charlie.
- That's it, Charlie!
- Come on!
Damn it, Charlie!
We can't even win when we cheat.
- Stupid cake-eater tricks!
- That was embarrassing.
Charlie!
What the hell is the matter with you?
When I tell you to do something, you do it!
You got it?
Look at me.
- You got it?
- You can't make me cheat.
Jesse, Terry, let's go.
This is what I gave up my overtime pay for?
To see my kids takin' falls?
Gordon.
- How did you know?
- Through the back door at this time of night.
Just like you used to.
You'd spend hours watching me do this.
What do you think?
Is this sharp enough?
Ow!
- Did you cut yourself?
- No.
You always fell for that.
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, I'm Scandinavian.
- It's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.
You probably thought I was dead.
I saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything?
You were so busy screaming at the kids.
I didn't want to spoil the moment.
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.
Why should my store?
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that?
Well, I hardly ever lose a case.
That is not what I asked.
Hmm!
I see you still have this up.
- Thanks very much.
- It is important to remember the past.
I'd just as soon forget it.
That was the worse time in my life.
My dad died that year.
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.
I found this not long ago.
He was proud of you.
I miss him.
You scored 198 goals in that season, Gordon.
It's a shame you quit.
You -
- Could have gone all the way.
Yeah.
- No!
You really loved to play.
You remember?
You remember... you used to play on the ponds until after dark, until your father called you back.
You really flew on that ice, Gordon.
That's all I ever wanted to do.
Then why did you stop?
Reilly?
I saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.
- The guy wins.
- It's not about winning.
It never was.
Just show they how to play.
Show them how to have fun.
Teach them to fly.
That is what they'll remember long after you've gone back to being a doctor.
Lawyer.
And long after they've stopped buying skates from me.
Here... there you are.
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.
- What's this?
- Your new skates.
That is why you came here tonight, isn't it?
- I figured nine and a half was your size.
- Actually, I'm a nine.
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.
Here comes Bombay on an end-to-end rush.
Past the blue line, past centre.
He's not skating, he's flying!
He fakes once, he fakes twice.
Fakes three times!
Shoots!
Scores!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
What a play!
What a guy!
Gordon Bombay does it again!
Great move, Gordy!
You faked him out of his pads.
Come here, son.
You look great out there.
Come on, let's go inside, get something to eat.
A few more minutes?
Please?
- Go on.
Get outta here.
- Thanks.
- Hi, uh -
- Please,just go away.
Charlie doesn't want... to be on the team any more, and neither he nor I have anything to say to you.
- Well, I have something to say to you.
- Oh, really?
Door-to-door mistreatment now.
Now the team can feel miserable between games too, huh?
I came to apologize to Charlie...
to both of you.
- What?
- Apologize.
Well... you should.
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin'?
I was just, uh, walkin' around thinkin' and, uh -
Wanna give us a minute?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Listen, it was very wrong of me... to ask you and the other guys to cheat.
I never should have said to you what I said to you.
I was angry.
I was frustrated.
It took a lot of guts for you to do what you knew was right.
I admire that.
And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that, uh, that I'm -
Oh, boy, this is difficult.
- I'm -
- You're sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right?
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be a lot more fun this time around.
What do you say?
Do you want to stay for dinner?
- What?
- Charlie!
Uh, no, I - I can't.
Uh -
Well, what are you havin'?
Mr. Ducksworth, there are two reasons I came by.
First off, I want to let you know things are going well.
I'm learning a lot about teamwork, fair play and all that junk.
Good, good.
And the second thing?
Well, sir, fair play doesn't come cheap.
These kids, my team, have no money.
They can't afford rink time, safe equipment, proper uniforms, which makes it difficult for them to compete.
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old and stepping out onto that ice... with old copies of the " Enquirer" taped to your shins instead of pads.
The point I'm trying to make, sir, is that you wouldn't be taken seriously and neither are these kids.
So I thought maybe the firm could help 'em out.
How much are we talking about?
- $15,000.
- No way.
Wait a minute.
Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross, the firm that gives back to the community.
Come on.
I'll get you your own jersey.
~ Ooo,yeah ~
~ Can you feel it baby Ooo ~
~I can too, Ooo ~
~ Ooo ~
~ Ooo, come on swing ~
~ Come on swing ~
~ Come on swing ~
~ C-Come on swing Ooo ~
~ Ooo ~
~It's such a good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
~It's such a good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
Who is that kid?
Thanks, Fulton.
- Fulton Reed.
He's in one of my classes.
- How come he's not on the team?
He only plays football.
Some preppie school gave him a scholarship... as long as he doesn't play hockey.
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- I heard it was colleges.
He's been accepted to four of'em.
- Yeah, but I heard he's got to repeat the sixth grade.
- Ah, shut up.
Gordon Bombay?
Bombay was a Hawk.
~...
Good vibration ~
~It's such a sweet sensation ~
~Feel the vibration It's such a good vibration ~~
Dude, check 'em out, man.
Holy cow.
- They're pretty good skaters.
- Anybody know who they are?
That's Tommy Duncan.
He's in my science class.
That's his sister, Tammy.
- Think they'd want to play hockey with us?
- Yeah!
Go get dressed.
I'll do the negotiating.
Just think of it as figure skating... with a stick.
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy!
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive!
Mom isn't gonna like this at all.
So what?
You want me to figure skate, then you gotta play hockey.
What do I know about hockey?
More than you think.
Back to basics!
Skating!
Go!
Go!
Side to side.
Shift your weight.
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.
That's okay, Charlie.
Soft hands.
You don't shoot the puck to your teammate.
You sail it to him.
Karp, on your feet.
- You send it.
- Oh!
Gross!
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it.
Cradle it.
- Oh!
- Again!
Concentration, not strength.
Like the Karate Kid, right?
"Wax on!
Wax off!"
Just shut up and try it, Averman!
- You're such a jerk.
- Send it back, Averman.
Good, Averman.
Charlie.
That's good.
Good.
Now sail it back.
Oh!
Way to go!
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.
Oh!
Here it comes.
Nice and easy.
Good.
- I did it!
I did it!
- All right.
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.
- But when are you gonna work with me in goal?
- Goldberg, do you trust me?
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar mitzvah'd.
This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.
Coach, I think you got the ceremonies mixed up.
It's more like a circumcision.
Coach!
Will you come back here?
What'd I ever do to you, man?
District Five!
Ready!
Oh, man, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
- Aim!
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.
- Oh, please!
No!
- Fire!
I wanna go home!
This doesn't hurt!
You wimps!
Give me your best shot!
Oh!
Come on!
That's good!
Hex goal!
Goalie boot save!
Whoa!
Nice shot, man!
I'm a dog!
I'm a crazed dog!
Come on!
Goldberg!
Goldberg!
I am Goldberg!
The goalie!
Good!
Good!
All right, Charlie!
Good hustle!
Conway, way to go.
All right, Karp!
- You guys hungry?
Tired?
- Yeah!
- Do you ache?
Are you pumped up?
- Yeah!
Good!
That was a hell of a practise.
Be proud of yourself.
Hey, guys!
Excuse me, guys!
You gotta untie me now!
Ha-ha!
Good joke.
Very funny.
I like it.
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach!
Coach, come on, don't leave me hangin' like this!
Coach, don't make me come after you, coach.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Thanks for the ride.
You did real well in practise today, Charlie.
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad?
Mom and I left him.
I don't really remember, but that's what she says.
You know, when I was a boy, I had to take care of my mother too.
Really?
What happened to your dad?
He passed away.
You do a good job takin' care of your mom.
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right?
- Okay.
We'll see ya.
- Okay.
Hey, coach.
- What's that?
- Huh?
- Oh!
- Victory!
You've just entered the tickling zone!
So I'm right in the middle of my cross-examination and I say to the guy,
I usually defend heels like you, you scuzzy, mole-faced rat.
That's a good one, sir.
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Look, it was an accident, all right?
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
I didn't learn.
I just do it.
Do it again.
Yargh!
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal?
Yeah.
Well, one out of five.
Fulton, is it true what they say?
About the scholarships and how they won't let you play hockey?
People talk.
It don't mean nothin'.
- Why don't you play for us?
- I can't.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I can't.
- You afraid?
- No, I mean I can't, you moron.
I don't know how to skate.
Whoa!
Is that all that's stoppin' ya?
~I ride the top of the line I can't settle for less ~
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.
Side to side, good!
Follow me.
Aaah!
Watch it!
Get out of the way!
Sorry!
~ This is all we got baby It's got to be enough ~
~I'd like to try to quit But I don't know how ~
~I needed it then and baby I need it right now ~
Come on, Fulton.
Let's go!
- ~I gotta keep movin' 'til I'm satisfied ~
- Hey!
~ Come on, Come on It's gonna be all right ~~
The Ducks?
We're the Ducks?
Man, what brain-dead jerk came up with that name?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But I didn't have a choice.
We're being sponsored.
By who?
Donald and Daisy?
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks?
You'd rather be District Five?
Some stupid number?
Better than some stupid animal.
I'll have you know, Peter, that the Duck is one of the most noble, agile and intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom.
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.
Neither do hockey players.
Have you guys ever seen a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation?
It's beautiful.
Pretty awesome the way they all stick together.
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight?
No way.
Why?
Because the other animals are afraid.
They know that if they mess with one duck, they gotta deal with the whole flock.
Oh, man!
I'm proud to be a duck.
And I'd be proud to fly with any one of you.
So how about it?
Who's a Duck?
I'll be a Duck.
Yeah.
Me too.
Anybody see Goldberg?
All right!
Now we're the Ducks!
The Mighty Ducks!
- What are we?
- The Ducks!
What the hell are they doing?
Every time you get the puck, you're the quarterback.
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.
Come on, guys.
This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.
What a weird-ass team.
How you doin'?
- You ready?
- I think so.
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.
My God!
Wow!
One out of five.
All right, Let's forget the past.
We lost a few games, tough!
That was District Five.
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right!
Yeah!
Quack, quack.
- Quack.
Quack.
- Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Quack!
Go...
Ducks!
What the hell was that?
Let's go, Ducks!
Defence!
Defence!
Dig it outta there!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Let's go, Ducks!
Throw it!
Throw it!
To the crease!
Yes!
The Oreo line!
That's my boy!
Defence, Karp!
Defence!
Come on.
I don't wanna go to school today, Mom.
- How many fingers am I holding' up?
- He wouldn't know.
Shut up, Peter.
Karp, are you okay?
- Look at this.
- The Karp-ster used his head to stop the puck.
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.
Get him on the bench, Charlie.
Okay, Ducks, we still got a chance here.
Connie, Terry,Jesse, Guy, time for the secret weapon.
Okay, Fulton.
Remember,just like we talked about.
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.
Oh, no.
- Go!
Get the face-off!
- Line up, boys, let's go.
That's it.
Aaah!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Yeah!
That tie of yours might be what you need to make the play-offs.
- The ducks have a shot at the play-offs?
- Sure.
Everyone but the last two teams are in, remember?
Panthers got the measles and they forfeited the season.
So,you beat the Huskies and you'll make the play-offs.
- Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
- So?
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since I played.
Actually, one little thing has changed.
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.
They redrew the district lines last year.
The lake is not the boundary any more.
You see?
You'd be a Duck.
I'd be a Duck.
Excuse me.
Coach Reilly?
- Yeah?
- I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.
- What's that?
- One of your players is ineligible.
Banks!
Over here!
- This is a joke, right?
- I'm afraid it's no joke.
- Problem?
- No,just a mistake.
Are you this boy's father?
450 North Hennipen, is that your address?
- Yes.
- I'm afraid there's no mistake.
- This boy is playing for the wrong team.
- What?
According to league rules, Adam Banks should be playing for District Five.
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- Is this your doing, Gordon?
I'll expect to see him at our next game.
- We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
- No way.
My son would rather not play than play for your team.
Fine, if that's the way you want it.
But remember, if Adam plays for the Hawks, you'll forfeit every game for the rest of the season.
Boy, I'd hate to see that.
Look, I'm sorry this had to happen, but you can see on the map.
Gordon?
Hey, Bombay!
You stop when I'm talking to you, son!
What's the idea here?
You trying to sabotage me or what?
The law's a bitch when it works against you, isn't it,Jack?
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.
Even with Banks, what do you think you're gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers?
That's right, coach.
They are losers.
We hate losers, don't we?
They don't even deserve to live.
Maybe Banks won't make a difference, but at least we're playing by the rules.
Why'd you turn against me, Gordon?
For six years...
I taught ya how to skate, I taught ya how to score.
I taught ya how to go for the "W."
You could have been one of the greats.
And now look at yourself.
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.
Going to the play-offs!
Whoo!
One win!
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.
All right, everyone, listen up.
I got some good news.
We're getting a new player, Adam Banks.
What?
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.
- We don't need him.
- I'm the coach.
I say we do need him.
- If we make it to the play-offs, he could be a big help.
- If?
All of a sudden you don't think we're good enough.
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.
- What?
- We heard what you said.
You said we were losers, we didn't deserve to live.
- That's not what I meant.
- I saw that picture of you missing that goal.
You were a Hawk, weren't you?
Guess you guys stick together to the end.
You know what?
I don't need your stinkin'equipment.
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.
- I'm talkin' to you, son!
- Forget it, cake-eater.
If you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.
Where do you guys think you're goin'?
I don't believe this.
All right, I'm goin' up to the bench because that's where I'm supposed to be.
Anyone who wants to join me can join me.
Anyone who doesn't -
Well -
Ten minutes to game time, coach.
Yeah, yeah, they'll be out in a minute.
They're, you know, working themselves into a frenzy.
Not much of a frenzy.
We forfeit.
Ducks forfeit.
Flames, you win.
Hey.
Can I sit?
Sure.
You talk to the guys?
I tried.
They think I'm a traitor for even showing up.
I guess they really hate me, huh?
Is it true you were really a Hawk?
Yeah.
Peter said you blew a really big game once.
Yeah, well, Peter's right.
It was the last game of the state finals.
We were tied 2-2 in the end of the third period.
I get a penalty shot.
I go in, I triple deke.
I fake the goalie right out of his pads.
The puck's headed in, and then...
Clang!
Hits the post.
We lost in overtime.
A quarter of an inch this way and it would have gone in.
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way and you'd have missed completely.
I never thought of it that way.
At least you got to play in a championship game.
- That must've been so cool.
- Hey.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
I'd love one.
You know, she has many fine qualities that men find attractive.
I know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.
So, what kind of guys does she usually date?
Jerks.
I mean, most of them like her, but as soon as they catch a glimpse of me -
Pow!
Warp speed!
They are gone!
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, I wouldn't even care... except it's not fair to my mom.
She deserves somebody nice.
Are you gonna come over for dinner again?
I don't know, Charlie.
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
See, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I, um, talked toJesse and Terry's dad, and he's gonna take over coaching for the rest of the year.
- You're quitting?
- I'm stepping aside to keep the team together.
The guys can't play for somebody they don't trust.
I trust you.
The other guys do too.
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.
- I've done all I can.
- No, you haven't.
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.
We are too!
We weren't even the Ducks until you came along.
You made us and now you're stuck with us.
Charlie.
That's right.
The red is oxygen.
Now what are the blue balls?
- Tommy?
- Hydrogen?
Is correct.
Now put them together... and you have a molecule that makes up 96% of your body.
- What is it?
- Pizza?
It's the principal.
I'll be right back.
Work on H2 CO3.
It's a goody.
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way?
- Yeah, did you score?
Leave me alone, guys.
I don't want to talk about the team.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.
Everybody knows he likes you best.
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp!
Take it back now!
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl!
- Lay off!
- Don't shove, Peter.
Atoms away!
My atoms!
You!
Sit!
Sit now!
In your seats now!
I have never in my life -
What have you got to say for yourselves?
Quack.
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!
Thanks for coming by on such short notice, Gordon.
By the way, your court release came through.
- Congratulations.
Your community service is over.
- You're kidding.
So you wanted to talk about my coming back to work then?
- Well, actually -
- Oh, you got your jersey.
Great!
A lot's been happening.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.
Gordon, you know Coach Reilly and Mr. Banks.
Sir, they're the bad guys.
No, actually, Phil is one of my oldest friends.
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together here to try to work out this little problem.
You see, my son Adam wants to play for the Hawks.
His older brother was a Hawk.
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.
It's a tradition.
You understand that, Gordon.
You played.
But the league's already ruled on it.
We've talked to the league, and we worked out a little deal.
- You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League?
- Yes, we did.
The long and short of it is that Adam stays on the Hawks for the rest of the season.
And then next year, they redraft the lines.
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.
What's that?
That you withdraw your protest.
- That's great.
- Good, good.
Well, that's settled then.
No, sir, you don't understand.
I can't withdraw my protest.
- What?
- Mr. Ducksworth, you wanted me to learn about fair play... and how to be part of a team... and I may not have learned everything yet, but I remember something my father said to me.
A team isn't a bunch of kids out to win.
A team is something you belong to, something you feel, something you have to earn.
And I'm not gonna let those kids down.
Gordon, I'm going to make this simple.
Are you prepared to lose your job over some kids?
Some game?
Let me ask you, sir.
Are you prepared to fire me over some kids?
Some game?
Collect your personal belongings, Gordon.
Yes, sir, Mr. Ducksworth!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth!
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.
You may have paid for this jersey, sir, but you didn't earn it.
I'll see you in the play-offs.
- Excuse me.
There are some students here that I'd like to see.
- Who are you?
I'm their hockey coach.
If you could tell me where I can find each of them, please.
They're in room 223.
- All of them?
- All of them.
"I will not quack at the principal. "
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you guys.
- People.
- People, right.
Sit down, please.
All of you.
Okay, don't sit down.
Look, what's done is done.
I want to be your coach again.
You're gonna coach a bunch of losers?
- No, I want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said?
You said we didn't deserve to live.
Karp, I was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means?
- No.
- Okay, then you do.
I didn't mean those things the way they sounded.
You guys know what it's like to be misunderstood, right?
- Yeah, of course.
We're kids.
- So...
Can you forgive me?
Can I be your coach again?
- What about Banks?
- He can be on the team if he wants.
He should have been with us all year.
It's you guys who were cheated.
Let's forget all that crap!
- We're a team, right?
- Yeah.
I made you guys, and I'm sticking with you.
So, what's it gonna be?
We can play tomorrow night and still have a shot at the play-offs... or we can forfeit again and the season's over.
Peter, what do you say?
Well...
I guess it would help if we practised first.
All right.
Let me see if I can get you out of detention.
- Yes.
- Take that.
You really quacked at the principal?
Yeah.
Are we Ducks, or what?
Yeah!
Look at your mother.
Let's see how it is in ten minutes.
I'm gonna kill you!
Hey.
Wasn't sure if you'd show up.
Yeah, whatever.
- I just want to play hockey.
- Good.
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.
On behalf of the Ducks, I'd like to say welcome.
Cake-eater.
Ooh, theJess-man, dissin'the new guy!
TheJess-ster!
Shut up, Averman!
It's just a joke.
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey doesn't mean you're a real Duck.
- They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
- I bet.
Well, suit up.
I'll see you on the ice.
On your left!
Over here!
I'm open!
Come on, right here!
Up front!
- Up front!
- Pass it to Banks!
Come on!
Do somethin' with it!
Yeah!
All right!
Way to go, Banks!
All right!
Score another one for the Ducks!
Goldberg, you're gonna sit this one out.
What?
You're pulling the goalie when we're tied?
Listen, listen, listen!
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.
Okay, Fulton, you're our extra man.
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.
- We pulling the Statue of Liberty play?
- Yeah?
No, take your shot.
You may only get one, so it's gotta be good.
- But, coach, one outta one?
- Soft hands, Fulton.
- Concentration, not strength.
- That's right!
Okay?
Let's get the Huskies!
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one.
Let's go!
- Get in there!
- Come on!
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!
Shoot, Fulton, shoot!
We won!
We made the play-offs!
Boy, this is great.
Guys, look, it's the North Stars.
- Oh, man.
- It's Mike Modano!
- ...
Believe this?
- Cool!
This is too cool.
I can't believe this.
This place is humongous.
What are we doing here?
It's a little play-offs present.
Hey, Gordo!
Gordon Bombay, right?
- You remember me?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- I heard you were a farmer.
Actually, I became a lawyer.
But I'm coaching Pee Wee now and this is my team, the Ducks.
- Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
- We can see that.
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks!
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.
If you ever want a shot, I'll get you a tryout in the minor league clubs.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, nice seein' ya.
Take it easy.
All right, let's have some fun!

- Hey!
~Don't you mess with Mister In-between ~~
You know, I heard the North Stars wore the same underwear... all through the play-offs last year for luck.
So I'm doin' the same thing.
Hmm.
Maybe I should've cooked.
You know, I'm thinkin' maybe we can all go down to the winter festival tonight.
- All three of us?
- Sure.
I don't think I should, 'cause I got a lot of homework.
You should go.
With my mom.
By yourselves.
Mmm, smells great!
Hello.
Go for it.
Hi.
I don't know how they sculpt these.
Hmm, I wonder.
I used to sculpt, but now I do mostly paintings.
How do you think they do the details?
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.
Oh.
I'm nervous.
I'm rambling on and on here.
You probably think I'm weird.
No, I think you're great.
When I was a little girl, I used to pretend that that was an ice castle.
And that was my room, that window right up there.
And last winter I gave Charlie that one.
What about me?
Which window's mine?
I want to live there too.
What?
What did I say?
- It's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy?
Casey, I was just playin' around.
Look, I don't know how you feel about me.
I don't even know how I feel about you.
But I do know there's a little kid back home... who's absolutely falling in love with his coach... and if you can't deal with that, if you're just playing around, then you better let me know.
What are we talking?
'Til death do us part?
- I have to decide on the first date?
- Stop it, Gordon.
Charlie's gonna be there when we get back.
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.
Look, I can take it.
But if Charlie gets too attached -
Every time this happens, it gets... a little rougher on him.
Just on him?
I'm glad to be here with you.
Me too.
The surprising Ducks are still in this game... against the Hornets.
Banks moving right in front, stops.
He shoots, he scores!
It's getting rough out there between the Ducks and the Hornets.
Here's Adam Banks in the slot.
He stops, shoots.

Back it goes to Averman.

Here's Averman, now getting it over to Banks.
Germaine is right in the slot.
Germaine with it!
He shoots, he scores!
Germaine put it off the goaltender's glove into the net!
And that does it!
The Ducks have won!
Can you believe it?
4-2, and the Ducks now get set to face the Hawks in the state finals.
All right, it's up to you, Gordon.
Now,you miss this shot, you're not just letting your team down, you're letting me down too.
Remember, it's not worth playing -
- If you can't win.
- That's right.
Okay, son, let's go.
Let's go, son!
~...
Oh, say does that star-spangled ~
~Banner yet wave ~
~ O'er the land of the free ~
~And the home of the brave ~~
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
All right!

Let's fly!
Come on, let's go!
All right, pressure, boys.
Pressure, pressure!
All right, hold it, hold it.
I want you to drop Banks like a bad habit.

Come on, son, let's go.
Come on.
Number seven, McGill.
Cross-checking.
Two minutes.
Don't worry, guys.
Did it go in?
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favour.
Kick some Hawk butt.
All right, cake-eater.
He'll be okay, sir.
We need to take some X rays, though.
Hell of a job, son.
They score against us, they're gonna pay the price.
Now, don't worry.
We're gonna get that one back.
You got somethin' to say to me, Bombay?
To think I wasted all those years worrying about what you thought.
You're goin' down, Reilly.
- Let me go after 'em, coach.
Let me get 'em.
- No, we're better than that.
Look, look, it's time to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.
- All right?
Now we got the power play.
- Yeah.
All right.
We're gonna hit 'em where it hurts the most: up there.
Fulton, you're in.
- Coach, they'll be rushing' him.
- Right.
Jesse, make sure you give Fulton plenty of time.
- Right, coach.

Wait!

More fun!
More fun!
Of all the sloppy ass
- Ladies, they don't need our help out there!
Now I want that Fulton Reed covered.
He better not make another shot.

Quick feet, now!
Quick feet!

Game misconduct.
You're outta here, son.

- Yeah!
So let's see it!

Where's the call?
No time left on the clock, but the referee is calling a penalty shot!
What kind of call is that?
Okay, we've got a penalty shot for the Ducks.
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.
All right, Ducks, who's gonna take it?
- I think he should take it.
- Me?
What about Charlie?
- What about Charlie?
- All he does is fan.
Let's let him finish what he started.
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.
Come here.
You been practising that triple deke?
- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.
You may make it, you may not.
But that doesn't matter, Charlie.
What matters is that we're here.
Look around.
Whoever thought we'd make it this far?
One, two, three.
Triple deke.
Take your best shot.
I believe in you, Charlie, win or lose.
- Thanks, coach.
- Go get 'em.
- All right, Charlie.
- Let's go, Charlie.
Okay, now wait for my signal.
Good luck.
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...
Okay, now don't leave your crease before he touches the puck.
Good luck.
Come on, Charlie.
Come on, Charlie.

Whoo-ooh!
Hey, you clumsy clod!
Father, where have you been?
Out and about.
I wish you wouldn't go wandering off.
What is he doing here?
Ernie thought he'd join us.
Isn't that nice?
It's a beautiful night.
You could have found better company.
What did you say?
Oh, Father, please.
Here, Grandpops.
Go buy yourself a tutti frutti.
Get lost, Mr. Toad--
Oh, sorry-
- Noad.
Father!
All aboard.
Take them through, Mr. Skull.
Only $2.00 for the most terrifying ride with Mr. Bones.
Step right up!
You look like a lovely couple.
Thank you.
Only $2.00.
Give Mr. Skull your ticket.
Hurry. $2.00.
Come on, now, children, each and every one.
There we go.
[haunting yells] [hideous laughter]
Stop it!
Sit down!
Aah!
Aah!
It's not real.
It is!
Rrra!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Aah!
What the...
Not you again.
I'm terribly sorry.
Come on, you old fool.
Get out.
I was only pretending.
You crazy wacko.
Why don't you go back to the Geriatrics?
Aah!
Someone call an ambulance, quick!
Keep back!
Keep back!
God.
I think that's Father.
He's just had a bit of a fall.
Father?
Speak to me, Father.
Speak to me!
Leah, where am I?
It's all right.
You had a wee fall.
No.
No.
No.
Just lie still.
Shh.
Lie still.
Everything's going to be fine.
Hey!
Hey, Lonny.
How's America?
Oh, you know-- pretty cool.
Yeah.
"Pretty cool"?
I like that.
It's good to see you.
Man, you're really tall now.
Going up.
Here we are.
Let's shove all this off.
[Leah] Lonny, how are your mom and dad?
Great.
They send you and Grandpa their love.
Oh, that's nice.
I thought Grandpa would be at the airport.
Grandad hasn't been well lately.
He had a little turn last week.
Oh.
But will he be OK?
Please God, he will be, yes.
Anyway, he's home now and looking forward to seeing you.
That's good.
I've really missed him, Kanziora.
He's about my favorite cool guy, and you're not so bad youself.
Oh, you boys will have a wonderful time,
I know.
[Leah] Here we are.
It's great to be back, Aunt Leah.
It's such a wild old house.
Yeah.
Can I go up and see Grandpa first?
Of course, but be very quiet because he may be asleep.
I will.
Come on, Kanziora.
Grandpa?
Are you awake?
Got you!
Grandpa.
Oh, Lonny, my boy, let me look at you.
You've grown into such a fine young man.
Grandpa, you remember Kanziora from last summer.
Hello.
Yeah.
Kanziora.
How are you?
Good.
Oh, that's wonderful!
So how are you feeling, then, Grandpa?
Since you guys got here, much, much better.
Let's sit down on the bed so we can see each other.
It's awfully dark in here.
Shall I turn on a light?
No.
No.
No.
When you turn on the light, that's what hurts my eyes.
Why don't you go open up the curtains and the french doors and let in some air?
She never lets me open them up.
Such a silly old woman.
Oh, that's much better.
Looks like a beautiful night out there.
Yeah.
There's a big moon and everything.
Is there?
Oh, I sure would love to see it.
Give me a hand up.
Grab a hand, now.
1, 2, 3.
Here we go, Grandpa.
Yes, here we go.
Ah, yes.
We're going to see what the wondrous night has to offer us.
Magnificent.
Magnificent.
A truly wondrous sight.
Ooh.
Oh.
I tell you boys-- that... that is the essence of all life.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
I'm all right.
I'm...
I'm all right.
What's going on in here?
Father, get back into bed immediately.
Oh, no.
Sausage and chips again?
Revolting muck!
You, too, boys.
Your tea's downstairs.
Eat it while it's hot.
Kanziora, catch.
Stop showing off!
Just behave yourself!
There you go.
He didn't like it, either.
Oh.
Oh!
Grosser than gut soup.
Choice.
You can't be serious.
I love tomato sauce.
Do you want some?
OK.
If you insist.
Hi.
G'day, boys.
How you doing?
You got a spare snarler for your Uncle Ernie?
Did you have a good flight?
It wasn't bad.
Is she upstairs with the-- the old bear?
Yes.
Good on you.
I think I'll have another snarler.
They're bloody delicious.
Is he really your uncle?
No.
Lonny, do you think Ernie and your aunt are doing it?
What?
Man, anything's possible.
Ah.
Yuck.
Lonny, I got something really weird to show you.
Do you want to see?
Sure.
Where did you find these?
They fell out of a book from last summer, but look.
There's none of your grandfather.
Strange, ay?
He was sitting in that chair.
So?
Where's he gone?
People just don't disappear from photos.
Wow.
How you two boys getting on in here?
Aunt Leah, look at this.
Grandpa was in the garden when we took these.
He was sitting in that chair, but it's empty now.
How, uh... very odd.
Oh, probably just a trick of the light.
Now, finish up, and I'll get you some ice cream.
But, Lonny, there is something strange going on.
I know there is.
Did you see your aunt's face when she saw the photos?
Oh, man.
You've got an overstimulated imagination, which usually leads to madness.
Madness, Kanziora!
Ha ha ha!
Does not.
That house gives me the creeps.
Don't you feel it?
Madness!
Ha ha ha!
[howling]
Listen.
Did you hear that?
Cuckoo.
Cuckoo.
Cuckoo.
In this book I've been reading, it says in the mountains of Carpathia the birds sing at night.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
Look, I got to get some shut-eye.
I'm really beat.
I'll come over in the morning.
Dream weird.
I will.
See you later, mashed potater.
In a while, crocodile.
Sweet dreams, child.
[from outside of room] Whoo-ooh-hoo!
Go away!
Mom, Ben's got a dead polecat!
Hello, stranger.
Hi, Mrs. Kanziora.
How's your aunt, Lonny?
She's fine.
Hi, Mr. Kanziora.
Good to have you back, son.
She's a marvelous lady, living in that big old house with a sick father.
You're on your own this time?
Yeah.
Dad's gone on tour in Europe with the Philharmonic.
My mom and little brother have gone with him.
Listen to what Lonny's saying.
It's very interesting.
Mmm, what's that?
Let's go.
You be careful.
Swim between the flags.
Have fun.
Wow.
Far out.
Wait.
I couldn't sleep last night thinking about those photos.
They don't come out.
Who?
Vampires.
You can't take photos of them or see them in mirrors.
Oh, man.
You kiwis are real fruitcakes.
I am not.
It's true.
Grandpa Cooger a vampire?
Kanziora, you have truly flippoed, man.
Last one in us a double dork!
Come on!
Woo!
Woo!
Yee-ha!
Woo!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Kanziora!
Woo!
Whoa!
Woo!
Hey, Lonny.
Do you feel like visiting your grandfather?
You mean, check out if he's been sucking neck?
There's only one way to find out.
Take him garlic-- they hate that-- or some holy water.
We could steal it from a catholic church.
We could sprinkle it on his cornflakes.
What do you reckon, Lonny?
Let's do it.
Come on.
Say yes, please.
OK, but I'm having nothing to do with it.
This is your scam, man.
Cor.
You keep watch.
You know what, man?
You're insane.
I'm not.
I'm just being scientific.
Yes, professor.
Well.
Well.
What's happening here, boy, hmm?
Nothing.
Honest.
Is that a fact?
What's that you're hiding?
Just a chocolate milkshake.
Chocolate milkshake?
Show me, boy.
You're wouldn't be telling lies, would you?
Not in God's house.
Well, show me, boy!
Aw.
Aw.
Let's get out of here!
Hold it!
Come on.
Come back here, will you?
His heartbeat is very faint today.
I could hardly hear it.
His time has come.
Yes, my dear, it has.
I think you're possessed of enormous courage.
Thank you.
If there's any change, ring Dr. Gallbladder.
I will.
Yes.
All right.
Grandpa, are you all right?
I see you!
Ha ha ha!
Don't be frightened.
Come on in.
Kanziora, light the candle.
It is a bit dark in here.
Oh, excuse me.
Here.
There, now.
That's much better, isn't it?
So how are you feeling, Grandpa?
When I get a visit from you boys,
I feel a hundred years younger.
Has that dreadful man gone?
Which man, Grandpa?
Ernie Noad, rhymes with Toad.
You know, he comes barbing in here like he owns this place.
There's a no-hoper.
I'll tell you--
I do not know what your aunt sees in a guy like him.
In my day, you know what we called guys like him?
Slimeballs.
Oh, your laughter is music to my ears.
You know, I don't have fun anymore.
She won't even let me play popagano.
I have an idea.
Lonny, why don't you turn on the tape recorder?
It's his favorite music--
The Magic Flute.
Yeah.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
Oh, he was a beautiful boy.
[music plays]
[singing in German]
Wow!
It's magic!
All right!
Woo!
Woo!
Oh!
Come on, Grandpa.
You'll be all right.
Oh.
There you go.
Oh.
[choking]
Grandpa?
Grandpa?
Oh, no.
Aunt Leah, come quick!
Grandpa, say something.
Aunt Leah!
Grandpa!
What happened, Lonny?
He just collapsed.
Didn't he, Kanziora?
Father?
Father?
Please leave now.
Father, come back.
Did you see the teeth?
Fangs, man!
Fangs!
That was crazy!
Shh.
Kanziora, look.
The old guy is really sick, so just cool it, please.
I'm sorry, Lonny.
But he'll be all right.
I know he will.
Yeah.
I hope so.
Ha!
Man, you are so useless.
Am not!
Come on.
Try me.
I'm ready for it.
Easy out.
Easy out.
Bozo!
Get the ball, Bozo!
I am!
Leah.
Oh, Ernie.
I got you a little something.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
How lovely!
What's happening?
Shh.
Pervert.
Moonlight chocolates.
Oh, Ernie!
Aah!
It's Father.
Come on.
Should we?
Yeah.
He's gone, Lonny.
It's a blessing, a real blessing.
Farewell, Father.
I better go now.
My mom will be wondering where I am.
He was a nice old guy, Ay?
I'm really sorry what I said about him-- being a vampire and all that stuff.
That's OK.
Well, he sure knew how to do magic, Ay?
That was really cool.
Yeah.
Look, I better go in now, be with Aunt Leah.
OK.
See you later, mashed potater.
In a while, crocodile.
Lonny!
You don't need to worry about him.
He's being very brave.
Here he is now.
Who is it?
Hello?
Mom.
Oh, Mom.
It's so sad about Grandpa.
We were having such a great time together.
I'm really going to miss him.
Yeah, I'm OK.
Please don't worry about me.
So how are Bobby and Dad?
Say hi.
OK.
Bye, Mom.
I love you, too.
"Of all the creatures
"that lurk in the mists of the imagination,
"none is more powerful or magnificent
"than the vampire.
"These wandering undead live in a world of darkness where they are trapped for all eternity."
"Some vampires, however,
"draw a source of power
"from the rays of the full moon, said by many to be the essence of all existence."
"It is not a well-known fact
"that some vampires attempt to lead a normal human life,
"but this is often with considerable difficulty
"since they are all nocturnal creatures and have unorthodox cravings."
Wow.
Christopher, Mom wants you to go down to the shop to get some milk.
Now!
Monsters-- they'll rot your brain.
Go away!
Did you know me, Brigit, and Serena are entering the teen talent time at the carnival?
It's $100 first prize.
Leave me alone, would you?
Christopher, phone.
OK.
Hello.
Kanziora, it's me.
Hi.
You're invited to the wake.
The what?
The party for Grandpa.
Wear a suit and tie.
Got to go.
Bye.
Mom, do I have a suit and tie?
Whatever for?
I'm invited to a party.
That's nice, dear.
Whose?
Lonny's grandfather's.
It's a funeral party.
Aw, Dad!
Thank you for having me.
Thank you for coming.
Bye-bye, Martha.
Very sad.
Hello, Kanziora.
How are you?
Fine, thanks.
In you go.
[music playing]
So did you know my grandpa well?
I knew him well.
He wouldn't want you to be sad.
Chin up.
Excuse me.
Hoy!
G'doy, moyte!
What did you say?
I've been practicing my kiwi accent.
It's not "Hoy.
G'doy, moyte."
It's hi.
G'day, mate.
Lonny.
Go and get your friend a nice drink-- something festively funereal.
Come on.
My nephew's friend-- come to pay his respects to Father.
We've got muck in a bowl with dead goobers floating in it.
Mind the midgets!
The midgets are coming through.
This is Wilder than feeding time at the LA Zoo.
She's coming over.
Hey, darling.
How are you?
All right, are you?
How you doing?
Bloody bonds of beauty, huh?
Whoa!
Ha ha ha!
Cor!
Oh, sorry.
That's all right, son.
Senior Sergeant, are you all right?
Yes.
I don't think you know my nephew.
Lonny from California and his friend Kanziora.
Ahoy.
G'day, mate.
This is, uh,
Senior Sergeant Dicky Ticker, our local constable, and his wife...
Winona.
Frightfully jolly wake.
Your father-- he was an absolutely marvelous man.
[Leah] Thank you.
I've never seen a real live corpse up close before.
[inhales deeply]
Gee, he pongs a bit, ay?
She's been sprinkling room deodorizer over him.
Has not.
Lonny, could I check something out?
What?
Stand beside me for a minute.
Don't!
Bingo.
Lonny!
Get away from that coffin!
Somebody's already tipped a plate of stuffed eggs over him.
Be respectful of the dead, child.
One day it will be you in there.
Let's get out of here before I barf all over my shoes.
Are you all right, Lonny?
You look very strange.
This is getting weird, man.
What did I tell you?
You wouldn't believe me.
Butt out, would you?
It's just not possible.
They're not real, those fangs.
Grandpa's dead!
He's dead!
I've been doing some research, and, according to my books, they don't die.
Who?
Vampires, dummy.
The only way you can kill them is to drive a stake through their heart.
So he's not dead, right?
Is that what you're saying?
He can't be.
They're the undead.
Ah, there you are.
The last of the guests has just gone.
It all went wonderfully well, didn't it?
What a beautiful evening.
His last on this island Earth.
It's very sad for me, Lonny, terribly sad.
I shall miss him so much.
Yes, Aunt.
I have to pop over to Ernie's place for a little while.
I'm sure you boys can amuse yourselves.
Is that all right?
Yes, Aunt.
We'll be fine.
I'm sure you will.
There's plenty of food in there if you're hungry, so bye-bye.
I'm starved!
I knew you'd say that.
[synthesizer playing]
Hey, this is great.
Check it out.
Let's do some tunes.
Want some of this chocolate cakes?
It's delicious.
Have a go.
All right.
Cool!
Everybody!
Yeah!
Chopsticks.
Yeah!
[playing Chopsticks]
[melody broken]
Lonny, what's happening to my fingers?
I can't stop playing!
Me, neither.
Bravo!
Aah!
No.
No.
Don't be afraid.
It's me.
Cooger!
Your grandfather.
I have you to thank for this.
You have awoken me with your strength, vitality, energy, vulnerability, and that which feeds the soul its nocturnal substance.
No!
You're not real!
You're not!
Kanziora, this is a major nightmare!
Get me out of here!
It's OK, Lonny.
Really, it's OK.
Lonny, dear Lonny, forgive me for frightening you.
I can't help it.
It's the way I am.
Kanziora, understands, don't you, boy?
Uh... yes.
He'll be all right, Mr. Cooger.
He's just nervous.
Bite your ass.
Ha ha ha!
But... why are you a...
A vampire.
Vampire!
I'm not ashamed.
We are who we are.
They make movies about you!
Yeah, right.
And you go around scaring people to death and biting them and turning them into vampires.
And you have blood dripping from your mouths.
Ha ha ha!
Oh, that's a good one.
But I hate to disappoint you.
Movies are not real.
Your dreams are real.
Your imagination is more powerful than any movie.
Have you ever sucked people's blood?
Kanziora, what a dumb question.
Don't even mention that word.
Boys, you see before you an ancient man whose time on this planet is slipping away, but I was different.
You see, I chose to live the human life-- the path from birth to decay and death.
But I should have known-- we always return.
Permit me to introduce myself!
Ha ha ha!
I am... your hume servant Denoch-- a vampire of innocent origin from the 18th Century.
Lonny...
Kanziora, can I interest you, perhaps, in a little music and magic to remember me by?
Come!
Come!
Take my hand.
Lonny, come.
You remember.
Mozart.
Huh?
[The Magic Flute playing]
And now, we go out into the night.
Oh, no!
Aah!
To us, dear Leah, and a wonderful life, our life.
Nooo!
Aah!
Aaah!
Oh, whew.
What happened?
We fell out of the sky.
Oh, dear.
How the mighty have fallen.
Can you get up?
Yeah.
This is someone's place.
Let's get out of here.
Are you OK?
Can you walk?
No problem.
No problem.
Who the hell's there?
It's Ernie the nerd.
Think you're bloody smart, do you?
Watch this.
Beggars, ay?
Well, come on, then.
I'll take you on one at a time, and I'll knock your bloody blocks off.
Whoo hoo!
Get away from me, you bloody demon!
Ha ha ha!
Ernie, what are you... doing?
Ernie!
Ernie, speak to me!
What is it, love?
What's the matter?
Get up.
The old bastard's still alive.
[The Magic Flute playing]
Grandpa, can't you go any faster?
No.
Too weak.
Too old.
I must rest.
Man, I'm going to get it.
We've got to get him back home.
Listen, boys, I can't go there.
I want to be part of the ancient way again.
But you can hardly walk.
Please, don't take me home.
Terrible things will happen there.
I want to live.
I want to fly like Peter Pan with you boys.
We will have such great adventure.
Help me.
Save me.
Please.
Come on, Kanziora.
You got the bright ideas.
Where can we take him?
Come on, think.
I know.
There's a shed in the garden.
Perfect.
A shed?
How humiliating.
Come on, Leah.
You can tell me.
Oh, Ernie.
It probably was Father out there.
He's not exactly one of us.
You're having me on.
Watch the road!
Jesus Christ!
You're saying your old man's a bloody vampire?
It's our family's darkest secret.
You see, he's been alive for over 200 years, but the unspeakable has happened.
Now that he is dead, he could return to being a true vampire.
You're not one, are you?
Mercifully not.
Glad to hear it.
There's one way to stop those jokers.
I've seen it on TV.
Stake clean through the heart.
What are you saying?
Certainly not!
He's a monster.
My father's not a monster!
He's a vampire!
You know what those bastards get up to.
They're only after blood.
A good old stake through the heart will shut him up for good.
Help me, Kanziora.
Oh, no!
Aunt Leah's car!
Aah!
That was close, ay?
Uh-oh.
Where's Grandpa gone?
I don't know.
Grandpa, where are you?
I'm over here!
Get me out!
Ha ha ha!
Get me out!
Hope Mom and Dad don't hear us.
Oh...
Shh!
You have to be real quiet.
Shh!
You'll be safe here, Grandpa.
Ay, Kanziora?
Yeah.
This coat will keep you warm.
This is quite cozy.
We'll visit tomorrow.
But don't go out.
Please, Grandpa.
Stay here.
Promise?
[coughing]
What is it?
Garlic.
Would you mind?
Makes me quite nauseous.
Kanziora, I got to go.
OK.
Wish me luck.
Just be cool.
It was a great night, wasn't it?
The best, man.
Grandpa... we're going now, so nighty-night.
Sleep tight.
Don't let the vampire bite.
Ha ha ha!
Vampire-- ha ha ha!
[humming]
[chainsaw buzzing]
Lonny, where have you been?
Aunt Leah, I've been... up at Kanziora's.
Why?
Something dreadful has happened.
Your grandfather's body has just disappeared.
Really?
Uh, how?
We don't exactly know, but it's not there.
Did you see anybody enter the house after we left?
No.
Are you sure?
Honest.
Look, can I go to bed?
I'm wiped out.
Of course, dear.
I'll be right up to turn off the light.
Good night, everybody.
Good night, dear.
Go away, please.
Go away.
Thirsty.
Thirsty!
Thirsty!
Good boy.
Yeah.
More.
Just one more, OK?
Who's that?
Just getting a drink!
Dad's coming.
What's all the bloody noise out here?
Stay here.
I know what to do.
You out here, Christopher?
What the...
Hey, wake up, son.
Hey...
Wakey, wakey.
Are you all right?
Where-- where am I?
Having a little walk in your sleep.
You all right?
Come on.
Back to bed.
Oh, dear.
I should get back to the shed.
Hello.
Can I speak to Lonny, please?
No.
I'm sorry, Kanziora.
He's busy today.
Can I talk?
Good-bye.
Why?
You're not going anywhere today until I've sorted out this terrible business.
That's not fair.
In my house, do as you're told.
Understood?
Yes, Aunt Leah.
Swear to God you know nothing about this.
Swear on the... on the Almighty's name.
You wouldn't lie to me, would you?
No, Aunt Leah.
I swear it.
Good boy.
Now, finish your breakfast and make your bed.
Today you'll play in the garden.
OK.
And if I'm really, really good, can I go swimming later?
We'll see.
# What am I going to do for my red o pooh?
#
# It's so very sore I don't know what to do #
# Listen, my little sisters, just look at all my blisters #
# Let them be a warning to you #
Hey, Christopher.
Where's your American friend?
We want to meet him.
Busy!
Tammy said he looked like River Phoenix.
Liar.
Come on.
Let's start again.
# What am I going to do for...?
#
Mr. Cooger.
Christopher, where the hell are you?
What are you doing?
Just looking for something!
Get outside!
There's work to be done!
Now, come on!
OK!
I can't stay here.
It's too dangerous.
I've got to be someplace abandoned and dark.
I'm sorry, Mr. Cooger.
Can you wait just a little while longer?
# It's so very sore I don't know what to do #
That dreadful racket.
Don't worry.
I've got a plan.
Christopher, get your lazy ass out here!
Coming!
Has anyone seen Christopher?
He's been acting strange all morning.
Did he really go sleepwalking last night, Dad?
I found him in the middle of the flower bed.
Ben, will you go find Christopher?
Tell him to get ready.
Christopher!
Get ready!
Come on!
I'm coming!
Now!
Go away!
Hurry.
Come on.
Are you all right?
Ehh.
Can you breathe?
Eeh!
Here they come.
Christopher!
Mom, what's that funny smell?
I don't smell anything.
It's your bum!
Be quiet!
It's revolting-- like moldy chops.
Christopher, did you invite Lonny to the barbecue?
Oh, he's not allowed out.
Isn't that so sad?
Mmm.
Blaah!
What was that?
He did a big fart!
Easy, Ben.
Heat.
Light.
Get me out.
I'm starting to feel very strange!
How strange?
Please don't do anything strange.
Not here!
Just hang on, Mr. Cooger.
Get me out.
I need darkness.
The cave.
The cave!
Boy, take me to the cave!
Help me, Kanziora.
I need darkness!
The cave.
The cave!
What's happened?
I'm glad to see you.
Where is he?
In the boot.
You mean the trunk.
I've got something to tell you.
Ernie the nerd's making stakes to slam through his heart.
What?
We got to hide him good.
They're looking for him now.
Don't tell him they want to stake him.
He's got to know.
We've got to protect him.
He needs us.
If we tell him, he'll probably start biting people.
Shh!
He'll hear us.
Please, Lonny.
Don't tell him.
Sure, buddy.
I won't.
Come on, Grandpa.
Walk.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Hey, guys!
Oh, no!
What?
Girls!
Let's go this way.
Come on!
Aah!
Oh, my God!
It's a corpse!
Sorry, lady.
Sorry!
Come on, Grandpa.
You'll be all right.
We don't have far to go.
Hot sun!
What do you want?
Who's this?
My grandpa.
Mind your own business.
He fell all over those ladies!
Ha ha!
Doesn't he like the sun?
Lonny!
Where are you going?
Can we come?
No.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, too much sun!
Oh!
Excuse me.
You're Kanziora's sister, aren't you?
Yeah.
Tammy.
Well, I'm Leah Cooger, Lonny's aunt.
Tell me, have you seen the boys about today?
Ha ha ha!
Yeah, we have.
They're down at the beach, ay?
Yes?
With some guy wrapped up like a mummy.
Like a... mummy?
He looked to gag, ay?
Where did they go?
Towards the caves.
Thank you very much.
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Here we are.
Ah!
This is more like it!
Yeah!
Now, boys, if you'll just help me get down.
Oh!
Oh!
I'll tell you, what an endurance test!
Grandpa, we'll get you some food.
Good.
You'll get very hungry here.
And, uh, perhaps a little, uh, alcoholic refreshment?
I'll get you some booze.
Good.
You see, it's for my poor circulation in the extremities.
Ha ha!
Now, uh...
I must rest.
Too much excitement for one day.
We'll come back later, OK?
Good.
And after sunset.
And do be careful.
We will.
Don't you worry about us.
Please remember the... poor circulation.
Ha ha ha!
Oh!
Oh!
[phone rings] [ring]
[ring] [footsteps] [ring]
Hello?
Oh, Senior Sergeant Ticker.
Who?
Oh!
Yes, I remember her.
Tallish woman in a polka-dot frock.
She what?
Oh, there must be some mistake.
She swears it was him?
Oh.
Quite impossible!
Yes!
She's... she's hysterical.
Oh.
Oh, dear.
Too much sun, perhaps.
Yes.
Well, of course.
No.
No trouble at all.
Oh, my God.
It's begun.
Oh, Ernie!
Ernie!
Quick!
[Ernie] What is it?
That was Ticker.
Someone's recognized Cooger.
She's in the hospital under sedation.
We must move quickly now.
I denied it, of course.
Go to the caves.
I know he's there.
Bring him back.
I'll deal with it.
Hello, Lonny.
Hi.
It was hilarious today, Mom.
Lonny's grandfather tripped over these ladies on the beach.
Dear, poor Mr. Cooger died.
Hi, honey.
That was your grandfather, ay?
What?
He was alive!
Watch your lip.
Put these on the table.
Sorry to hear about Mr. Cooger.
Yeah.
A delightful character.
Go have some chops.
Hello!
Anyone home?
Hello!
Mr. Cooger!
Ah, ha ha!
Oh, that's much better!
Good evening.
Grandpa, we've been seen!
Aunt Leah and Ernie know where you are.
He's on his way.
What can I do?
Ha ha ha!
Look, Lonny, my boy,
I don't want you to worry.
Let him come!
Ha ha ha!
I don't want you to concern yourself with such relatively unimportant human matters.
We've brought you some stuff.
You boys have done well.
And I flogged a huge bottle of gin for you.
Oh!
God bless your little souls!
Ha ha!
Well, it's time for me medicine.
You know, for the circulation?
Mmm!
Ooh!
Ha ha ha!
Yeah, uh...
I'll tell you,
I better have another, you know.
Mmm.
Just in case, you know.
Aha!
Got the beggar!
Grandpa!
Die, you monster!
Die!
Oh, really?
Ha ha ha!
Die, you monster!
How pathetic!
Take this!
Well, take this!
Ha ha ha!
Give me five, Grandpa!
Yeah!
What about me?
Ha ha ha!
Oh, ha ha!
Oh, I tell you, because of you, I feel eternally young.
Now, I want to celebrate.
Where shall we go?
Hey, what about McDonald's?
But it's not safe there.
You'll be seen.
Lonny, my boy, let's be daring.
I want to have fun.
Mr. McDonald!
Here we come!
Mr. McDonald, here we are.
Ha ha ha!
Now, got to look like I fit in with the crowd, huh?
Ha ha ha!
Yessirree!
Yeah?
Ha ha ha!
Grandpa, you look cool.
Give me five, and 5 makes 10.
And here we go!
Ooh!
Ooh, wee!
This is a magnificent place here, yes.
Ooh!
Grandpa, don't you feel well?
No, no.
I'm OK, I tell you.
It's just, uh, 281 years are starting to show.
Here.
Let me sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.
What's the matter with him?
Maybe he needs food.
Grandpa, would you like a big mac?
A big what?
A big mac.
They don't eat meat.
He wants... blood.
OK.
Two quarter pounders, two large fries... two raw meat patties?
Thank you.
Hey!
Ooh, we're going to have a lot of fun tonight.
But...
what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
That's not for me.
Please, I...
I can't, I'm... just the sight of it makes me sick.
Now, please.
No, no.
I can't.
No.
I'm not going to have it, no.
Mr. Cooger, you need your strength.
No, no, no.
Please!
Drink!
Come on, Grandpa.
Open up.
Ah!
Ah!
Ooh!
Not bad.
Quite delicious.
I'll have another.
Waiter!
Garcon?
No waiters here?
Oh, no!
Look out!
You beggars thought you could outdo me, ay?
Ay?
Yeah, Sergeant Ticker, please.
This man is a vampire!
Yeah, mate, and I'm Joan Collins.
Come on, Grandpa.
Let's go.
Now!
Run!
Are you coming home with me or what, you demon?
Stop!
Whatever you're doing--
You?
But you're supposed to be... dead.
I am dead!
Ha ha ha!
Aah!
Fly, Grandpa, fly!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Ugh!
Ah!
Get in the car!
Hurry up!
Lonny, stop that!
Ernie, help!
Don't let them take him!
They'll kill him!
That's enough.
Get in there!
Get in!
No!
Leah, you don't understand!
It was those beautiful boys that gave me life!
I didn't mean any harm.
I was having a little fun.
Fun?
You call resurrecting yourself from the dead and running around buting people fun?
You give me no choice, Father.
That no-hoper Ernie put you up to this, that worthless bum!
I'm not listening.
But he's harmless!
Quiet!
Quiet!
Stop your bloody yelling!
Don't you see?
He's not human.
They'll stake him through the heart!
But he's just a harmless old man!
Drive up the Cemetery Hill.
They've take him to the burial ground!
The what?
The burial ground where the family vault is.
I don't know what's going on.
Can't you go faster?
Around here, we obey the road code.
This isn't Hawaii Five-0.
Well, they've probably done it by now!
Can't you go a teensy-weensy bit faster?
I don't want to die this way.
I-
- I-
- I promise.
I'll behave myself.
You don't understand, do you?
You're already meant to be dead!
But, Leah!
I am your father!
Ahh!
Come on, you pile of rotting flesh!
Uh!
Uh...
This is it!
Hey, wait a minute!
I'm in charge here!
Oh!
Hold him still, for Christ's sakes!
[Sergeant Ticker] Hold it!
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?
Grandpa, run!
Ernie, you all right, mate?
Follow me, boys.
Soon you will hear The Fluttering Of My Wings, and I will be no more.
Meet me down by the sea.
[weeping]
Oh, Father...
I'm sorry!
Mr. Cooger!
Grandpa, where are you?
You'll find me where there's gaiety, laughter, and fun for all!
Ha ha ha ha...
Sit back and enjoy teen talent time!
First up, a very talented young man from Fauna Beroa...
This boy's a real ding dong.
Bringing his trumpet to give us How Great Thou Art.
Accompanied at the organ by Mrs. Betty Gutsell, here is Hamish McWhirter!
[playing How Great Thou Art]
Feeling better now, are we, my son?
And have we been saying our prayers?
Yes, Father.
Good boy.
Boy, close, ay?
Yeah.
Oh, man, where is he?
He's around, Lonny.
I see Mom and Dad!
They're going to kill me!
OK.
[How Great Thou Art continues]
Hi.
Where have you been?
Playing with Lonny.
I didn't know where you'd gone.
I'm sorry.
Don't do that again, Christopher.
She's been worried sick.
Be quiet.
Sorry.
Be quiet.
Hamish McWhirter, ladies and gentlemen.
What a talent!
What a goob!
Now for something more exotic.
We're expecting on the stage three lovely ladies.
They say they've only been singing together for the last three days, correct?
And here they are.
Don't they look lovely?
All right!
It's Serena, Tammy and Brigit who sing their hula song,
My Red O Pooh.
# What am I going to do for my red o pooh?
#
# It's so very sore, I don't know what to do...?
#
Oh, man!
She's a doll!
Ha ha ha!
# Let them be a warning to you #
# Yesterday, my steamer docked at half past nine #
# The sun has shining bright... #
Ticker!
Can I have a chip?
Just one.
# That's how I got my red o pooh, ooh #
# All the pretty little girls were playing around #
# Getting a suntan, so I thought I'd get one, too #
# Out on the beach, I played my ukulele #
# Getting a suntan #
There he is!
# That was not the thing to do... #
Oh!
# My red o pooh-- #
[Emcee] Everyone, stay calm!
Please, stay calm!
Please, stay in your positions.
# What am I going to do... #
Get off!
# It's so very sore, I don't know what to do #
# I guess the only way to spend an hour every day... #
Oh!
[applause]
Hey!
Psst!
[audience cheers]
Holy mother of God.
It's the deceased!
Where the hell are they going?
Christopher, come back!
Aah!
Oh.
[applause]
What the hell are you going to do?
Don't ask me!
Help!
Oh.
[applause]
Grandpa, watch out!
Oh, no!
Father!
Father!
Father!
Oh, Father, speak to me!
Speak to me!
Leah...
I'm sorry.
I've been a naughty boy, haven't I?
Are you OK, Aunt Leah?
Yes.
I'm fine now.
But, Aunt Leah, there's something I don't understand.
How come you aren't one of them?
Oh, Lonny.
It's all so long ago.
Once upon a time, your grandfather fell in love with a beautiful woman-- Bella Louise, my mother, and he loved her completely in the human way, not the ancient way, you understand?
He... never bit her?
That's right, Kanziora.
So...
Thank God we were spared.
But come along now.
Father wants to see you both.
Grandpa!
Wow!
Isn't he magnificent?
Lonny,
Kanziora, come.
Come.
It's time now for me to say good-bye.
Good-bye?
But where are you going?
Your grandfather has decided to leave.
It's the best thing for all concerned.
But... where will he go?
It's time to take my freedom and join the others.
Others?
There's more?
Oh, yes.
Many more, like myself, who wander this planet in search of love and understanding.
You boys have set me free with your honesty and your bravery, and I'll never forget you both ever.
But... but will we ever see you again, Grandpa?
Oh, Lonny, I'll always be there!
Ay, Kanziora?
And in your dreams,
I will return.
I will!
Leah, my traveling coat, please.
Leah, my... my beautiful daughter Leah.
Oh, Father!
Kanziora.
Give me five, Lonny.
And 5 makes 10?
I'll always love you, Lonny.
Farewell.
See you later... mashed potater.
In a little while, crocodile.
Farewell!
What is she saying?
I think she's booting the sucker out.
Good.
Why do you think your aunt likes him?
You know, Kanziora, love's a very strange thing.
Makes 'em go funny in the head.
Really screwy, man.
Ha ha!
Never laid a hand on him.
How can you be so cruel?
Please, just go now, and just leave me alone!
OK.
Keep your hair on!
I'm going!
And if old fang face shows up for a bit of blood sucking, stuffed if I'll be around to help you.
Silly dame!
I know when I'm not wanted!
Christ!
I could murder a feed.
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!
Gee, Lonny, I hope we don't ever get old.
Imagine what that would be like.
Yeah.
You know... kind of be nice... just to... stay the same... like we are now... tonight... for ever and ever.
Yeah.
That would be lovely, ay?
[Shriek]
Ah ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha!
[ Moaning ]
Next time a book a table for 8:00, Wolfgang
I expect to be seated at 8 o'clock.
[ Screaming and popping ]
A good wine.
Not a great wine.
But locally grown that's for sure.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
A pleasant enough bouquet.
Almost reminds me of a good scream Sherry.
Hee hee hee hee!
I hope you brought your appetite, kiddies, because tonight's tasteless tidbit is something I'm sure you'll savor.
It's a real epigoreandelight about a nice young couple who find the restaurant business a little hard to swallow.
I call this adventure in finedying what's cookin'.
[Moaning]
I don't know, I don't know.
Maybe we need to expand the menu.
What about...
Squid kabob?
That could be interesting.
I got it, I got it-- squid on a stick.
Yeah.
Squid on a stick-- it's a finger food and takeaway food all in one.
Our troubles are over.
Squid on a stick will put us on the map.
Honey, if you bury that thing in my neck, you'll wreck the blade.
It's an expensive cleaver.
They don't make 'em anymore.
Squid on a stick is an even stupider idea than owning a restaurant that only serves squid.
Remember what they told colonel Sanders in 1956--
"a chicken restaurant?
You must be mad."
If that's madness, you can count me in.
Honey, we'll be the baskin-Robbins of seafood.
I think erma's onto something.
Squid is nice and all, but maybe a little diversification would be good.
Who asked you, gaston?
You're just a drifter.
What do you know?
I know this much-- anybody can become a drifter by selling what people don't want.
I have this recipe for barbecue-- barbecue, any idiot can do barbecue.
Not my barbecue.
I pay you to clean up.
Just clean up, o.K.?
Hey, Phil.
Morning, Fred, erma.
Tough night?
Tough ain't the word.
Between the muggers and the killers
I'm getting to God damn old for this shit.
We got your squid sandwich coming right up.
No offense, but I couldn't stomach squid mcmuffin today.
Hey, Phil?
Let me guess.
Squid?
Ha!
Hey,
I'm sorry for what Fred said before.
He's a visionary.
I respect that.
What is a classy lady like you doing with a guy like him?
Well, maybe it's like you said he's got a vision.
You ought to leave him and come live with me.
I've got vision, too.
Well, that's sweet, but, uh...
Thanks for the offer.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Would you like me to walk you home?
No.
I can take care of myself.
Besides, Fred's going to be home soon.
Bye.
Bye.
[Bell rings]
Mr. chumley.
Hi.
Feel free to remind me if I'm wrong, but last week, did we or did we not have a conversation in which you agreed you would deliver into my hands yesterday the three months' back rent that you owe me?
Yes, sir, we did say something along those lines.
And what day is today?
Is today, yesterday?
No.
Today is today.
And do you know how I know today is today?
Because if today were yesterday.
I'd have a check in my hands.
Mr. chumley business is picking up.
If you could find it in your heart to give me more time.
Can I get you something to eat?
No!
The only thing I want from you is my money.
I could write a check-- but you ain't got it.
No, sir.
I'm going to be back tomorrow with an eviction notice and a new set of locks.
And a new set of locks.
One other tiny little thing-- you're one lousy cook.
You're one lousy cook.
You fat son of a bitch!
You can't do that!
Don't you go.
Oh!
Oh, my God, Mr. chumley, I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.
Oh!
Mr. chumley?
Mr. chumley, are you all right?
I didn't mean it.
You're crazy!
I'm calling the cops!
Please, you don't understand.
Mr. chumley!
[Dog barking]
How the other half live.
Hi.
Hi.
Boy, you're sure in a good mood.
Are you wearing perfume?
Well, I was walking home and all of sudden I felt sexy.
You're home late.
What kept you?
What's the matter?
Mr. chumley stopped by today after you left.
Oh, no!
No.
It's not as bad as you think.
Really, now listen to me.
You still have a little room left on one of your credit cards, right?
Right?
So...
We take some of that money and we buy a whole ton of pork.
It's the other white meat.
Oh, shut up!
Fred!
You should think about keeping us off the street not in debt.
I've given you everything I have and nothing to show for it.
Well, what am I suppose to do?
I don't know how to give up.
Look, if you were to say right now that you never wanted to see me again,
I'd understand.
All I can say is...
I'm sorry.
You're not going to get rid of me that easily.
I married you for richer or for poorer.
Besides, you owe me a shit load of money.
I think I'm going to cry.
I'll make us some coffee.
There's no point in doing that, gaston.
We're being evicted.
Fred 'n' erma's is history.
This is terrible.
This is terrible.
Hey, Phil.
What a night.
I'm so damn hungry,
I could actually eat a squid sandwich.
We're only serving coffee today.
Don't you have any eggs or something?
We may have a couple left.
And steaks?
Steak and eggs sounds great.
Uh,
I didn't want to say anything.
I thought you'd say not to.
You know that barbecue idea I was talking about?
Well, I took the initiative and spoke with this supplier who gave me a good deal.
I hope you're not angry with me.
I ain't angry, I'm starved.
Grill that baby.
I hope you like it, officer.
It's specially cured.
It's an old family recipe.
God, that smells good.
Even the coffee tastes better.
Hey, Fred?
Your landlord's named chumley, right?
Uh-huh.
Why?
We found his car and his empty wallet.
What happened?
Don't know.
Looked like a hell of a struggle, though-- blood all over the place.
Blood?
Is he dead?
Don't know.
There was no body.
We only know he never made it home.
Judging from the car, if he's walking around, it's a miracle.
Don't overcook that, erma.
I like it rare.
Whatever's cooking on that grill smells incredible.
Throw one on for me.
Make that two.
Make that two.
Ladies...
Here you go.
Gaston, can I have a word with you, please?
That's Mr. chumley's handkerchief.
Where did you get it?
He gave it to me.
You're lying.
I can't believe you.
I do you a favor, and you call me a liar.
I do you a favor, and you call me a liar.
There's your steak.
Hope you like it.
Mmm.
That's incredible.
I can't believe what you said about Mr. chumley.
This city's turning into a sewer.
I'll tell you, makes early retirement look better and better.
If only I could find something else to do with myself.
Mmm.
[Bell rings]
Throw one on for me.
Hey, gaston...
Is this all the steak there is?
No.
There's more in the freezer.
Could you bring some out front?
Sure thing.
I'm sorry, gaston.
I don't mean to accuse you of anything.
It's o.K., man.
I understand.
[Bell rings]
Hey, gaston, we got people waiting.
Fred, will you hold this door open?
Yeah.
Sure.
[Chop]
You killed Mr. chumley!
Gee, Fred, you make it sound so ugly.
You killed Mr. chumley!
Yes.
O.K., I killed him.
Just hold that door open.
Gaston, Fred, where are you?
We've got customers!
He'll be right out there, erma.
Fred, get a grip.
It's a dog eat dog world out there.
And we're all just different flavors of alpo.
Hey, don't keep the door open long he'll spoil.
Oh, I don't know what the recipe is, but that brilliant.
Thank you.
We must have made $1,500 today.
Oh, wow.
So this is what the restaurant business is like.
What's wrong?
Well, you know, it's just...
You don't like making money?
Gaston, you're a genius.
How'd a guy like you ever end up on the streets?
You know how it is-- a run of bad luck.
I'm getting some steaks out of the freezer.
No, no.
Um, I'll do it.
Why don't you put the chairs on the table?
You and me got to talk.
Yeah, you're damn right we got to talk.
This has got to...
Stop.
I'm going to call the cops.
And what will you say, Fred?
I killed your landlord because you owed him money?
There's not much motive in that.
Besides, you're the one who cut him last night.
There were witnesses-- those guys that live on the street.
I wasn't even the one that cooked him.
Your wife did that.
So, you're going to keep your mouth shut...
Aren't you...
Partner?
Partner?
50-50.
That sounds fair to me.
I supply the meat.
All you do is cook it however many ways you want.
[Door opens]
I've got a little surprise.
I've been saving this for the day we had something to celebrate.
I'd almost given up.
I'll put it on some ice.
No!
Uh, no.
Mmm, honey, um, I'm really tired.
We've been here all day.
Why don't we go out and celebrate, o.K.?
Fred, what's the matter with you?
Maybe he had a vision.
Fred, dick swartsburg, just ordered seconds.
He's the restaurant critic for the daily bugle.
Do you know what that means?
It means we're a hit.
It means he loves us.
Really.
You see, Fred, it's your dream come true.
We are all going to be filthy rich.
Yeah, I...
Guess we are.
Mmm.
Hey, you know, that's not bad.
Mmm.
That is actually damn good.
Mmm!
Yes!
Yes!
We are going to be rich!
Here you go, rare and juicy like you ordered.
Thank you.
Phil, how you doing?
The usual?
My wife wants to know why I never eat at home.
If she cooked like you guys, I'd never leave.
Hey, we got a break on your landlord.
There was this metal in the blood sample we took-- a very unusual alloy.
It came from a knife brand not made anymore.
We're checking the company's records, see who bought it.
We'll I.D. The killer any day now.
55, 56, 57.
$7,857.
We'd better start thinking about expanding.
I've got to go tell Fred.
Almost $8,000.
Ha ha ha!
That is our best day yet.
What's eating you?
Don't say that, you hear me?
Don't say that!
I don't get you.
I...
I'm going home.
Pal, you're overreacting.
You heard what Phil said.
We've had it!
Maybe we'll put Phil on the menu.
He's a cop, for Christ's sake!
Why don't you go home?
I'll clean up.
No!
I got to think.
Suit yourself.
There's got to be a way out of this.
See you tomorrow.
[Gasps]
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Can I come in for a minute?
Why?
I'm worried about Fred.
Well, that makes two of us.
I don't know what's wrong.
I do.
He's feeling guilty.
Erma...
I don't know how to tell you this.
It's Fred.
He's been killing people.
What?
It's too horrible.
This whole secret recipe thing, it's Fred's idea.
It's not mine.
Are...
Are you telling me that we've been-- that's why he stays late at the restaurant.
I saw him when he killed Mr. chumley.
I promised to keep his secret, but I'm scared for him.
He knows the cops are onto him.
He said he'd kill himself.
He took your gun.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God!
I'll go back to try and stop him.
You call farley and tell him to hurry there.
Erma, it's going to be o.K.
Erma, it's going to be o.K.
Fred?
You here?
Back here, gaston.
Back here, gaston.
Aah!
Aah!
[Sizzling]
As usual, we'll do things my way.
I say you're going to blow your freaking brains out.
[Bell rings]
[Door closes]
Murder-suicide plays much better-- the distraught couple, the cops closing in.
They were arguing, officer, when I got here.
It was horrible.
She picked up a cleaver, and he fired.
[Click]
[Click click]
God!
You said that Fred was going to kill himself using my gun.
Fred knows I never put bullets in my gun.
Nope, never.
I won't let her.
Thanks for the call.
Now, what are we going to do with him?
I don't know.
He has a big mouth.
I say he dies.
[Bell rings]
Officer!
Officer!
Officer!
Thank God you made it.
Here are the killers.
They killed chumley, and who knows who else?
Yeah, yeah, what to do, what to do?
What do you mean?
Arrest them!
I could, but, you see...
I've developed this taste.
What?
And this would solve my early retirement problem-- something to do with myself.
Farley's flame-broiled sound o.K. To you guys?
Sounds pretty good to me, Phil.
What do you think, erma?
I think it sounds downright mouth-watering, Fred.
Then fire it up.
I'm starving.
It's already hot.
No!
No!
No!
No!
[Screaming]
I suppose it's a little too late for gaston to save face.
Talk about afleshin the pan!
I guess that's what happens when youbutchermoney where your mouth is.
As for me, kiddies, I say it's time for taps.
Mmm.
Till next time, restaurateurin peace.

AH HA HA HA!
NEXT TIME A BOOK A TABLE FOR 8:00, WOLFGANG
I EXPECT TO BE SEATED AT 8 O'CLOCK.
A GOOD WINE.
NOT A GREAT WINE.
BUT LOCALLY GROWN THAT'S FOR SURE.
HA HA HA HA HA.
A PLEASANT ENOUGH BOUQUET.
ALMOST REMINDS ME OF A GOOD SCREAM SHERRY.
HEE HEE HEE HEE!
I HOPE YOU BROUGHT YOUR APPETITE, KIDDIES,
BECAUSE TONIGHT'S TASTELESS TIDBIT
IS SOMETHING I'M SURE YOU'LL SAVOR.
IT'S A REAL EPIGOREANDELIGHT
ABOUT A NICE YOUNG COUPLE
WHO FIND THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS
A LITTLE HARD TO SWALLOW.
I CALL THIS ADVENTURE IN FINEDYING
WHAT'S COOKIN'.
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE WE NEED TO EXPAND THE MENU.
WHAT ABOUT...
SQUID KABOB?
THAT COULD BE INTERESTING.
I GOT IT, I GOT IT-
SQUID ON A STICK.
YEAH.
SQUID ON A STICK-
IT'S A FINGER FOOD AND TAKEAWAY FOOD ALL IN ONE.
OUR TROUBLES ARE OVER.
SQUID ON A STICK WILL PUT US ON THE MAP.
HONEY, IF YOU BURY THAT THING IN MY NECK,
YOU'LL WRECK THE BLADE.
IT'S AN EXPENSIVE CLEAVER.
THEY DON'T MAKE 'EM ANYMORE.
SQUID ON A STICK IS AN EVEN STUPIDER IDEA
THAN OWNING A RESTAURANT THAT ONLY SERVES SQUID.
REMEMBER WHAT THEY TOLD COLONEL SANDERS IN 1956-
"A CHICKEN RESTAURANT?
YOU MUST BE MAD."
IF THAT'S MADNESS, YOU CAN COUNT ME IN.
HONEY, WE'LL BE
THE BASKIN-ROBBINS OF SEAFOOD.
I THINK
ERMA'S ONTO SOMETHING.
ERMA'S ONTO SOMETHING.
SQUID IS NICE AND ALL,
BUT MAYBE A LITTLE DIVERSIFICATION
WOULD BE GOOD.
WHO ASKED YOU, GASTON?
YOU'RE JUST A DRIFTER.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
I KNOW THIS MUCH-
ANYBODY CAN BECOME A DRIFTER
BY SELLING WHAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT.
I HAVE THIS RECIPE FOR BARBECUE-
BARBECUE, ANY IDIOT CAN DO BARBECUE.
NOT MY BARBECUE.
I PAY YOU TO CLEAN UP.
JUST CLEAN UP, O. K.?
I PAY YOU TO CLEAN UP.
JUST CLEAN UP, O. K.?
HEY, PHIL.
MORNING, FRED, ERMA.
TOUGH NIGHT?
TOUGH AIN'T THE WORD.
BETWEEN THE MUGGERS AND THE KILLERS
I'M GETTING TO GOD DAMN OLD FOR THIS SHIT.
WE GOT YOUR SQUID SANDWICH COMING RIGHT UP.
NO OFFENSE, BUT I COULDN'T STOMACH SQUID MCMUFFIN TODAY.
HEY, PHIL?
LET ME GUESS.
SQUID?
HA!
HEY,
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT FRED SAID BEFORE.
HE'S A VISIONARY.
I RESPECT THAT.
WHAT IS A CLASSY LADY LIKE YOU
DOING WITH A GUY LIKE HIM?
WELL, MAYBE IT'S LIKE YOU SAID HE'S GOT A VISION.
YOU OUGHT TO LEAVE HIM
AND COME LIVE WITH ME.
I'VE GOT VISION, TOO.
WELL, THAT'S SWEET, BUT, UH...
THANKS FOR THE OFFER.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO WALK YOU HOME?
NO.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.
NO.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.
BESIDES, FRED'S GOING TO BE HOME SOON.
BYE.
MR. CHUMLEY.
HI.
FEEL FREE TO REMIND ME IF I'M WRONG,
BUT LAST WEEK, DID WE OR DID WE NOT
HAVE A CONVERSATION IN WHICH YOU AGREED
YOU WOULD DELIVER INTO MY HANDS YESTERDAY
THE THREE MONTHS' BACK RENT THAT YOU OWE ME?
YES, SIR, WE DID SAY SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES.
AND WHAT DAY IS TODAY?
IS TODAY, YESTERDAY?
NO.
TODAY IS TODAY.
AND DO YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW TODAY IS TODAY?
BECAUSE IF TODAY WERE YESTERDAY.
I'D HAVE A CHECK IN MY HANDS.
MR. CHUMLEY BUSINESS IS PICKING UP.
IF YOU COULD FIND IT IN YOUR HEART TO GIVE ME MORE TIME.
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT?
NO!
THE ONLY THING I WANT FROM YOU IS MY MONEY.
THE ONLY THING I WANT FROM YOU IS MY MONEY.
I COULD WRITE A CHECK-
BUT YOU AIN'T GOT IT.
NO, SIR.
I'M GOING TO BE BACK TOMORROW WITH AN EVICTION NOTICE
AND A NEW SET OF LOCKS.
ONE OTHER TINY LITTLE THING-
YOU'RE ONE LOUSY COOK.
YOU FAT SON OF A BITCH!
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
DON'T YOU GO.
OH!
OH, MY GOD, MR. CHUMLEY, I'M SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
OH!
OH!
MR. CHUMLEY?
MR. CHUMLEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.
YOU'RE CRAZY!
I'M CALLING THE COPS!
PLEASE, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
MR. CHUMLEY!
HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVE.
HI.
BOY, YOU'RE SURE IN A GOOD MOOD.
ARE YOU WEARING PERFUME?
WELL, I WAS WALKING HOME AND ALL OF SUDDEN I FELT SEXY.
WELL, I WAS WALKING HOME AND ALL OF SUDDEN I FELT SEXY.
YOU'RE HOME LATE.
WHAT KEPT YOU?
WHAT KEPT YOU?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
MR. CHUMLEY STOPPED BY TODAY AFTER YOU LEFT.
MR. CHUMLEY STOPPED BY TODAY AFTER YOU LEFT.
OH, NO!
NO.
IT'S NOT AS BAD AS YOU THINK.
REALLY, NOW LISTEN TO ME.
YOU STILL HAVE A LITTLE ROOM LEFT
ON ONE OF YOUR CREDIT CARDS, RIGHT?
RIGHT?
SO...
WE TAKE SOME OF THAT MONEY
AND WE BUY A WHOLE TON OF PORK.
IT'S THE OTHER WHITE MEAT.
OH, SHUT UP!
FRED!
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT KEEPING US OFF THE STREET NOT IN DEBT.
I'VE GIVEN YOU EVERYTHING I HAVE AND NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT.
WELL, WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO DO?
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GIVE UP.
LOOK, IF YOU WERE TO SAY RIGHT NOW
THAT YOU NEVER WANTED TO SEE ME AGAIN,
I'D UNDERSTAND.
ALL I CAN SAY IS...
I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET RID OF ME THAT EASILY.
I MARRIED YOU FOR RICHER OR FOR POORER.
I MARRIED YOU FOR RICHER OR FOR POORER.
BESIDES, YOU OWE ME A SHIT LOAD OF MONEY.
I THINK I'M GOING TO CRY.
I'LL MAKE US SOME COFFEE.
THERE'S NO POINT IN DOING THAT, GASTON.
WE'RE BEING EVICTED.
FRED 'N' ERMA'S IS HISTORY.
THIS IS TERRIBLE.
HEY, PHIL.
WHAT A NIGHT.
I'M SO DAMN HUNGRY,
I COULD ACTUALLY EAT A SQUID SANDWICH.
WE'RE ONLY SERVING COFFEE TODAY.
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY EGGS OR SOMETHING?
WE MAY HAVE A COUPLE LEFT.
WE MAY HAVE A COUPLE LEFT.
AND STEAKS?
STEAK AND EGGS SOUNDS GREAT.
UH,
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING.
I THOUGHT YOU'D SAY NOT TO.
YOU KNOW THAT BARBECUE IDEA I WAS TALKING ABOUT?
WELL, I TOOK THE INITIATIVE
AND SPOKE WITH THIS SUPPLIER WHO GAVE ME A GOOD DEAL.
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT ANGRY WITH ME.
I AIN'T ANGRY, I'M STARVED.
GRILL THAT BABY.
I HOPE YOU LIKE IT, OFFICER.
IT'S SPECIALLY CURED.
IT'S AN OLD FAMILY RECIPE.
GOD, THAT SMELLS GOOD.
EVEN THE COFFEE TASTES BETTER.
HEY, FRED?
YOUR LANDLORD'S NAMED CHUMLEY, RIGHT?
UH-HUH.
WHY?
WE FOUND HIS CAR AND HIS EMPTY WALLET.
WHAT HAPPENED?
DON'T KNOW.
LOOKED LIKE A HELL OF A STRUGGLE, THOUGH-
BLOOD ALL OVER THE PLACE.
BLOOD?
IS HE DEAD?
DON'T KNOW.
THERE WAS NO BODY.
WE ONLY KNOW HE NEVER MADE IT HOME.
JUDGING FROM THE CAR, IF HE'S WALKING AROUND,
IT'S A MIRACLE.
DON'T OVERCOOK THAT, ERMA.
I LIKE IT RARE.
WHATEVER'S COOKING ON THAT GRILL SMELLS INCREDIBLE.
THROW ONE ON FOR ME.
MAKE THAT TWO.
LADIES...
HERE YOU GO.
GASTON, CAN I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU, PLEASE?
THAT'S MR. CHUMLEY'S HANDKERCHIEF.
WHERE DID YOU GET IT?
HE GAVE IT TO ME.
YOU'RE LYING.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.
I DO YOU A FAVOR, AND YOU CALL ME A LIAR.
THERE'S YOUR STEAK.
HOPE YOU LIKE IT.
MMM.
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT MR. CHUMLEY.
THIS CITY'S TURNING INTO A SEWER.
I'LL TELL YOU, MAKES EARLY RETIREMENT LOOK BETTER AND BETTER.
IF ONLY I COULD FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO WITH MYSELF.
MMM.
THROW ONE ON FOR ME.
HEY, GASTON...
IS THIS ALL THE STEAK THERE IS?
NO.
THERE'S MORE IN THE FREEZER.
COULD YOU BRING SOME OUT FRONT?
SURE THING.
SURE THING.
I'M SORRY, GASTON.
I DON'T MEAN TO ACCUSE YOU OF ANYTHING.
IT'S O. K., MAN.
I UNDERSTAND.
HEY, GASTON, WE GOT PEOPLE WAITING.
FRED, WILL YOU HOLD THIS DOOR OPEN?
YEAH.
SURE.
YOU KILLED MR. CHUMLEY!
GEE, FRED, YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO UGLY.
YOU KILLED MR. CHUMLEY!
YES.
O. K., I KILLED HIM.
JUST HOLD THAT DOOR OPEN.
GASTON, FRED, WHERE ARE YOU?
WE'VE GOT CUSTOMERS!
HE'LL BE RIGHT OUT THERE, ERMA.
FRED, GET A GRIP.
IT'S A DOG EAT DOG WORLD OUT THERE.
AND WE'RE ALL JUST DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF ALPO.
HEY, DON'T KEEP THE DOOR OPEN LONG HE'LL SPOIL.
OH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RECIPE IS, BUT THAT BRILLIANT.
OH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RECIPE IS, BUT THAT BRILLIANT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WE MUST HAVE MADE $1,500 TODAY.
OH, WOW.
SO THIS IS WHAT THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS LIKE.
WHAT'S WRONG?
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST...
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST...
YOU DON'T LIKE MAKING MONEY?
GASTON, YOU'RE A GENIUS.
HOW'D A GUY LIKE YOU
EVER END UP ON THE STREETS?
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS- A RUN OF BAD LUCK.
I'M GETTING SOME STEAKS OUT OF THE FREEZER.
NO, NO.
UM, I'LL DO IT.
WHY DON'T YOU PUT THE CHAIRS ON THE TABLE?
YOU AND ME GOT TO TALK.
YEAH, YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT WE GOT TO TALK.
THIS HAS GOT TO...
STOP.
I'M GOING TO CALL THE COPS.
AND WHAT WILL YOU SAY, FRED?
I KILLED YOUR LANDLORD BECAUSE YOU OWED HIM MONEY?
THERE'S NOT MUCH MOTIVE IN THAT.
BESIDES, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CUT HIM LAST NIGHT.
THERE WERE WITNESSES-
THOSE GUYS THAT LIVE ON THE STREET.
I WASN'T EVEN THE ONE THAT COOKED HIM.
YOUR WIFE DID THAT.
SO, YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT...
AREN'T YOU...
PARTNER?
AREN'T YOU...
PARTNER?
PARTNER?
50-50.
THAT SOUNDS FAIR TO ME.
I SUPPLY THE MEAT.
ALL YOU DO IS COOK IT
HOWEVER MANY WAYS YOU WANT.
I'VE GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE.
I'VE GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE.
I'VE BEEN SAVING THIS
FOR THE DAY WE HAD SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE.
I'D ALMOST GIVEN UP.
I'LL PUT IT ON SOME ICE.
NO!
UH, NO.
MMM, HONEY, UM, I'M REALLY TIRED.
WE'VE BEEN HERE ALL DAY.
WHY DON'T WE GO OUT AND CELEBRATE, O. K.?
FRED, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
MAYBE HE HAD A VISION.
MAYBE HE HAD A VISION.
FRED, DICK SWARTSBURG, JUST ORDERED SECONDS.
HE'S THE RESTAURANT CRITIC FOR THE DAILY BUGLE.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
IT MEANS WE'RE A HIT.
IT MEANS HE LOVES US.
REALLY.
YOU SEE, FRED, IT'S YOUR DREAM COME TRUE.
WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE FILTHY RICH.
YEAH, I...
GUESS WE ARE.
YEAH, I...
GUESS WE ARE.
MMM.
HEY, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT BAD.
HEY, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT BAD.
MMM.
THAT IS ACTUALLY DAMN GOOD.
MMM!
YES!
YES!
WE ARE GOING TO BE RICH!
HERE YOU GO, RARE AND JUICY LIKE YOU ORDERED.
THANK YOU.
PHIL, HOW YOU DOING?
THE USUAL?
MY WIFE WANTS TO KNOW WHY I NEVER EAT AT HOME.
IF SHE COOKED LIKE YOU GUYS, I'D NEVER LEAVE.
IF SHE COOKED LIKE YOU GUYS, I'D NEVER LEAVE.
HEY, WE GOT A BREAK ON YOUR LANDLORD.
THERE WAS THIS METAL
IN THE BLOOD SAMPLE WE TOOK-
A VERY UNUSUAL ALLOY.
IT CAME FROM A KNIFE BRAND NOT MADE ANYMORE.
WE'RE CHECKING THE COMPANY'S RECORDS,
SEE WHO BOUGHT IT.
WE'LL I. D. THE KILLER ANY DAY NOW.
WE'LL I. D. THE KILLER ANY DAY NOW.
55, 56, 57.
$7,857.
WE'D BETTER START THINKING ABOUT EXPANDING.
I'VE GOT TO GO TELL FRED.
ALMOST $8,000.
HA HA HA!
THAT IS OUR BEST DAY YET.
HA HA HA!
THAT IS OUR BEST DAY YET.
WHAT'S EATING YOU?
DON'T SAY THAT, YOU HEAR ME?
DON'T SAY THAT!
I DON'T GET YOU.
I...
I DON'T GET YOU.
I...
I'M GOING HOME.
I'M GOING HOME.
PAL, YOU'RE OVERREACTING.
YOU HEARD WHAT PHIL SAID.
WE'VE HAD IT!
MAYBE WE'LL PUT PHIL ON THE MENU.
HE'S A COP, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME?
I'LL CLEAN UP.
NO!
I GOT TO THINK.
SUIT YOURSELF.
THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY OUT OF THIS.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO FRIGHTEN YOU.
CAN I COME IN FOR A MINUTE?
WHY?
I'M WORRIED ABOUT FRED.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT FRED.
WELL, THAT MAKES TWO OF US.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG.
I DO.
HE'S FEELING GUILTY.
ERMA...
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THIS.
IT'S FRED.
HE'S BEEN KILLING PEOPLE.
WHAT?
IT'S TOO HORRIBLE.
THIS WHOLE SECRET RECIPE THING,
IT'S FRED'S IDEA.
IT'S NOT MINE.
ARE...
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT WE'VE BEEN-
THAT'S WHY HE STAYS LATE AT THE RESTAURANT.
I SAW HIM WHEN HE KILLED MR. CHUMLEY.
I PROMISED TO KEEP HIS SECRET,
BUT I'M SCARED FOR HIM.
HE KNOWS THE COPS ARE ONTO HIM.
HE SAID HE'D KILL HIMSELF.
HE TOOK YOUR GUN.
OH, NO.
OH, MY GOD!
I'LL GO BACK TO TRY AND STOP HIM.
YOU CALL FARLEY AND TELL HIM TO HURRY THERE.
ERMA, IT'S GOING TO BE O. K.
ERMA, IT'S GOING TO BE O. K.
FRED?
YOU HERE?
BACK HERE, GASTON.
AAH!
AAH!
AS USUAL, WE'LL DO THINGS MY WAY.
I SAY YOU'RE GOING TO BLOW YOUR FREAKING BRAINS OUT.
MURDER-SUICIDE PLAYS MUCH BETTER-
THE DISTRAUGHT COUPLE, THE COPS CLOSING IN.
THEY WERE ARGUING, OFFICER, WHEN I GOT HERE.
IT WAS HORRIBLE.
SHE PICKED UP A CLEAVER, AND HE FIRED.
GOD!
YOU SAID THAT FRED WAS GOING TO KILL HIMSELF USING MY GUN.
FRED KNOWS I NEVER PUT BULLETS IN MY GUN.
NOPE, NEVER.
I WON'T LET HER.
THANKS FOR THE CALL.
NOW, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH HIM?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE HAS A BIG MOUTH.
I SAY HE DIES.
OFFICER!
OFFICER!
OFFICER!
THANK GOD YOU MADE IT.
HERE ARE THE KILLERS.
THEY KILLED CHUMLEY,
AND WHO KNOWS WHO ELSE?
YEAH, YEAH, WHAT TO DO, WHAT TO DO?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
ARREST THEM!
I COULD,
BUT, YOU SEE...
I'VE DEVELOPED THIS TASTE.
WHAT?
AND THIS WOULD SOLVE MY EARLY RETIREMENT PROBLEM-
SOMETHING TO DO WITH MYSELF.
FARLEY'S FLAME-BROILED SOUND O. K. TO YOU GUYS?
SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD TO ME, PHIL.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, ERMA?
I THINK IT SOUNDS
DOWNRIGHT MOUTH-WATERING, FRED.
THEN FIRE IT UP.
I'M STARVING.
IT'S ALREADY HOT.
NO!
NO!
NO!
NO!
I SUPPOSE IT'S A LITTLE TOO LATE FOR GASTON TO SAVE FACE.
TALK ABOUT AFLESHIN THE PAN!
TALK ABOUT AFLESHIN THE PAN!
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOUBUTCHERMONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS.
WHEN YOUBUTCHERMONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS.
AS FOR ME, KIDDIES, I SAY IT'S TIME FOR TAPS.
MMM.
TILL NEXT TIME, RESTAURATEURIN PEACE.
TILL NEXT TIME, RESTAURATEURIN PEACE.
Mind yourself.
Oh, my God, Tara.
Your water's broke.
Her water.
Tara!
Marry me!
I'm your man!
Thirty flooded acres!
Go away and leave us alone.
- I'm talking to Tara.
-Go away, Mick.
Who else'll have you now?
- Huh?
-Home, now.
Sleep it off.
How are they?
Fine, thank you, Sergeant.
It's Mick and the sergeant at it again.
They're like tomcats.
They'll only come near me at night.
At least we've a man on our side from now on.
Aren't you the lucky lad, Jimmy?
This dump is going to be all yours one day... if you're not careful.
Oh, Tara.
I couldn't bear to touch it, the poor wee thing.
Mrs. Ryan.
I'm only here because I feel sorry for you.
You can spare your sorrow for yourself.
What can we do for you?
A button.
A fairly big one that's fairly small... with four holes, as opposed to two.
I'm making my niece a dress.
She's emigrating.
Lucky bitch.
What about this?
It's the latest fashion, you know.
She's my niece, not a trollop.
- Would this do?
-Sixpence.
God love us.
Poor wee bastard.
Shut your gob.
Who's the father?
There'll be no luck about this place until you own up.
If everyone around here owned up to their sins... there'd be a queue at the confession box a mile long.
Come on!
Pull!
Holy God.
Why me?
Since you gave up the drink, has it been any easier?
Worse.
Far worse.
Drink's an anesthetic.
It takes away the feelings for a while, the pain.
And the joy.
I can't remember.
God sees your suffering and understands.
Then why can't she?
You're not the only man who wants to marry her.
Is it Mick you're talking about?
If he so much as lays a finger on her...
I'll strangle him with me--
Don't commit murder in your heart, man.
May God forgive me, Father... but that's the way I feel sometimes.
Mick has blown his brains out!
Come on!
The rain drove him crazy.
- Why?
-'Cause his cows was dying.
He had no wife, that's why.
In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Give us a hand, you two.
You should've seized the gun off of him, Sergeant.
The state he was in.
Revoked his license!
Leave me be.
Scandal is a contagion.
And one sinner... can infect an entire community.
Tara Maguire... name the man who wronged you... or the whoremaster will bring down... yet more corruption and disaster on the heads of us all!
Tara?
Tara!
Tara, my dear child... trust in your neighbors and your friends... and in the Lord!
She's not a leper.
You're flying in the face of the parish... and Mick's suicide was the last straw.
That's one mortal sin they can't nail on me.
I wish to God I was in Dublin or London.
With a baby tucked under your arms?
You wouldn't last five minutes.
- Leave it there.
-Don't be stupid.
Own up.
Whose baby is it?
Ask your husbands.
He's my baby!
Mine!
Look!
"Murder in the Red Barn."
- Will there be guns in it?
-Is it a cowboy?
There's guns in it, all right... and an axe... and a boy and a cow.
I wonder what "The Nun's Story" will be about.
It's about a nun.
What do you get if you win the raffle?
The first prize... is a pound of butter and a packet of tea.
We have a double bed.
Could sleep three easy.
Is that right?
"The Crappy Boy."
"The Crappy Buy." Come here to me, you.
Did you not wash behind your ears this morning, lad?
How much is six pence?
For you, three pence.
Only for you, though.
What is that?
I bet those flowers are for Tara.
Morning, Father.
Morning, Father.
Just like all the other men in this place.
Scared to death of the priest.
Scared to death of you, more like.
I could have gone... to the ecclesiastical outfitters in Dublin, Tara... but I'd rather you had the money.
If you're not too proud to take it, that is.
What's your inside leg, Father?
I don't understand your question.
Here, hold this.
Up higher.
That's it.
You still angry at me?
You read me from the pulpit, and I'll never forgive you... but I need your money.
He looks like a tough wee customer right enough.
I'll have it within the week.
Do you want the same--
Exactly the same, if you please.
Change is a dangerous thing.
Change of fashion, change of heart, of mind... change of religion... it's all a sign of these shallow times.
Mick's death could've been avoided, Tara.
He killed himself over bad money... and rotten land, not for my sake.
But the sergeant, now, there's a man... who could be relied on by anyone.
Indeed.
He's just the person to set you on the straight and narrow.
What do you say?
I'll be needing half the cash in advance, by the way.
Tara, don't drive another soul to drink and despair.
What the hell are you doing?
Woodwork, sir.
It's me hobby.
I wish I had the time for woodwork.
If ever you do, sir, I'll lend you me tools.
Let me smell your breath.
Get out on patrol-now.
You're supposed to be a policeman, not a carpenter.
Tara... up to your old tricks again?
What do you think?
Once a smuggler, always a smuggler.
It's food, that's all.
And a suit for Father Malone.
It's time he changed out of sackcloth and ashes anyway.
Would you look at the two of us?
The lawbreaker and the lawmaker.
I'm earning a bit extra for me and the baby.
You trying to make life more difficult for us?
There's nothing I want less.
Let me go, then.
What's happened to your hand?
Just a little nick, cleaning me bicycle.
Marry me, or I'll go mad.
I'd go mad if I did.
Let me look after the two of you.
We don't need looking after.
You will.
Splendid.
Splendid!
Do you know, I can smell money.
Vonnie, dream's over.
Back to reality.
How are youse?
Youse are welcome.
Youse are welcome here, too!
Thank you, Seamus.
Thank you, Gerry.
- I've got a piano.
-So have I.
You can give them all the Shakespeare you want.
They won't know the difference.
- You coming to the show?
-Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
In front of the children.
Vonnie.
Looks like the last place God made.
Isn't that what you said about the place we were last week?
- I was wrong.
-Will you shut up, Vonnie?
You're always grousing.
Let's get this show off the road.
I got first tabs on her.
You can have the sister.
With a bit of luck, man... we'll have a great time, huh?
If these chancers on the green cause you any trouble... you've only to say the word.
They're only trying to scrape a living... same as the rest of us.
Ah, Sergeant.
Complimentary tickets... for yourself...
and your family?
I'll be there every night... on duty.
What do you think you're doing?
Hello.
I'm Tom Casey.
I'm from the Department of Agriculture.
We're investigating these chickens... for the old epidemic... and I can see you don't believe a word I'm saying.
I was stealing one of your chickens.
Right.
I'd better call Sergeant Hegalty, then.
No, no.
Wait a minute.
I'll pay you for it.
Ten bob.
What?
You must be joking.
It's not worth two bob.
Sergeant!
Sergeant!
Wait a minute.
Will you hold your horses here?
Wait till I see what I have for you here.
Now...
- Five bob do it?
-No.
For now.
I'll owe you the rest.
I'll give it to you after the show tonight.
I want the five bob you owe me before the show.
You must think I'm a terrible idiot.
Oh, no, no, no.
I can see you're not.
Good.
Hope you taste better than you look.
You bloody chancer.
We don't want more trouble.
He flew right under me jacket, I'm telling you.
Behave yourself this year, or I'll tell John-Joe.
You can talk.
At least it'll bring a bit of custom into the shop.
We made five bob already.
Would you?
I would.
My mother, she said put your shirts back on.
It's not decent half-naked.
Tell her to come over here herself, will you?
One, two, three.
Up.
There she goes.
What's the new sergeant like here?
He's nice.
He's after Tara Maguire.
Is he, by Christ?
Who's after the sister?
Blacksmith.
So you're out of luck there as well.
It's a woman driving.
I hate hanging around on these jobs.
The place is crawling with customs men.
Relax, Richie.
If they put you in jail, I'll bake you a cake.
Do you know what this is?
Sure.
Wireless with pictures.
Is this more cloth for His Holiness?
'Tis.
Let's hope he gets another year in Purgatory... for saying Mass in smuggled clothes.
Come on, Tara.
Just for old times' sake.
One extra.
For a man named Cassidy.
He'll be passing your way.
What is it?
Second-hand false teeth?
Razor blades.
I hear you're marrying the sergeant.
Good move, Tara.
Where'd you hear that?
Father Malone.
He told the wife's sister's auntie.
If you believe all you hear, you'll eat all you see.
Smuggling with a baby.
That's a new one.
Best to start 'em young, like gamecocks.
You coming to the show tonight?
Didn't we see it last year?
Might be even better this year.
That wouldn't be hard.
Jesus.
That's not another one of mine, is it?
Sure.
Hasn't he tattoos all over his bum?
Your razor blades.
Thanks.
They're cheaper in the north.
I use them in an act.
Razor blades, my foot.
We'll definitely have to go now... see the old armchair up on the stage.
Why are you always following me around?
Because you're as slippery as an eel.
And remember, I know what happened to you in Dublin.
Nobody knows what happened in Dublin... so shut your gob.
Hope he doesn't electrocute himself.
Look at him now.
Good man, eh?
Good man.
It's not the first time he's stole electric.
I'd be lost without you, Tom.
Ba njaxed.
You're banjaxed with me, Freddie.
So what's the difference?
'Tis I, Hamlet the Dane!
Romeo!
Romeo!
Wherefore alt thou, Romeo?
Is this a padre that I see before me?
How are you, Freddie?
Good to see you.
How long are you here for this time?
Well, a week or two... depending on the box office.
Grand.
I'll announce it from the pulpit.
You'll pack out, Freddie.
We'll make the usual donation.
Grand.
One thing, mind.
Legs.
No unseemly display of flesh.
Is that clear?
Of course, Father.
Grand.
Are we late?
Not at all.
They can't start without us.
Next, please.
Sixpence.
Thank you.
Come on, boys.
Down by the Sally Gardens
My love and I did meet
Sir, we never had anything to do with insurrection.
We're a law-abiding family, sir, and always have been.
Well, now, honest to God, sir.
I cannot believe a word coming out of her lying lips.
No.
Now, you can, sir.
I told me son... that if he ever wanted to fight for his country... there was no use in him coming to me for the old gun.
I have it well hidden, sir.
In the thatch.
Out of harm's way.
Can you speak somewhat slower, man?
I can hardly understand a word the damn fool says.
Will you shut up, you idiot?
Don't worry, sir.
if I hear anything... coming out about the rising of the moon... 'twill be the first thing I do is let you know... and that's God's truth, sir!
I have to agree with that.
That's God's truth, sir.
Only one son of mine ever bore arms... and that was me first born, you know, Douglas.
He was shot a while back, the yeoman of Wexler.
Easy, easy!
What's the damn fool saying?
He's a bit soft in the head, sir... since the mule kicked him.
That's why he rambles on.
I think we can proceed, sir.
I have searched the premises thoroughly.
The only thing to be caught... in this godforsaken hole is the cold.
You'd catch more than that if you knew where to look.
- What did he say?
-No idea, sir.
You're next.
Our hearts are broke with the murder... mayhem, and general debauch.
Rebellion is a hanging offense, madame!
Nonetheless, I compliment you on your choice of armchair.
Fit for the king himself.
Captain Williams, let us proceed--
Where is the damn boy?
I saw him going out that way, sir.
Maybe to join his regiment of friends.
God bless him.
Watching without paying.
I caught you.
We're even, so.
You wouldn't have the loan of a few pounds, would you?
I'll give it back to you before Christmas.
Are you Tara or Brigid?
Tara.
The one with the baby?
Aw, Christ.
Of all the luck.
I've sworn to capture every Croppy Boy... that dares show his face... and the rest I'll hunt down like foxes!
And furthermore... there will be scaffolds on every hill... from here to Sligo!
The battalion has returned.
It's raining buckets, Captain.
Tara.
Tara, it's me, Brendan.
Can I touch?
For a quid.
Come back tomorrow night.
The show's always different.
That tire's as bald as an egg.
Shouldn't be on the road.
Dear, oh, dear.
I just simply hadn't noticed.
Oh, Tom.
Did you enjoy the show, Sarge?
Do you have the insurance documents for these vehicles?
We do, of course.
We have the death certificate... birth certificate, dog license.
The lot.
Right away, showman.
Actor, if you don't mind.
This isn't a circus.
As near as, damn it.
Oh, now, my dear sergeant... let's be Christian about this.
Bear with me while I take off my tatters and greasepaints... and we'll have a drink together... to celebrate a successful first night.
I'm not a drinking man.
Oh?
You surprise me.
I want those documents now.
I'll post them to you first thing in the morning.
You'll have them by the end of the month.
I'm only joking, Sergeant.
Tara, it's Sergeant Hegalty.
He wants to talk.
You're looking grand, Tara.
Lovely.
What's that you brought with you?
It's a...it's a crib.
I made it for you and the baby.
I can't take it.
I only want him to sleep in my crib, that's all.
No.
Please, try to understand.
I can't put him in there.
Why?
Look at it, won't you?
It's beautiful.
You know why.
I don't like what you're trying to do.
It won't eat him.
It's wood.
That's all it is.
Please!
Wood.
Leave us alone.
Nqw!
It's only wood.
I can wait.
At least it can keep him warm for an hour.
Seven...
Cassidy.
Dear boy.
Thank you so much.
Now my little princess.
Bravo.
Thomas?
Well-earned, well-earned.
Here we are.
Thank you so much indeed.
Thank you for a lovely performance last night.
There we are.
That's it.
- And what about Timmy?
-it's my job.
That last pile...it's my son's.
He doesn't qualify yet for a share.
I was ten years on the road before I got a penny.
And you did it all on a one-wheeled bicycle.
Will you play fair, Freddie?
Play fair?
This time last year, you were in the gutter, lad.
This time this year, we're all in the gutter.
Where's the gold you owe us from the Fair of Muff?
It's like getting blood out of a turnip!
But just think!
I mean, the price of petrol... running repairs on the tent, income tax.
Income tax?
That's the best one yet!
You do all right, Rachel.
No one asks you to share your perks.
How dare you?
Unhand me, or I'll evict you from your parts!
Holy God, every week the same.
We're all in the same leaky boat.
I'm warning you, Freddie, I'm ready to jump overboard.
In all of my years...never!
Ingrates!
I could've gone to England, made a fortune... but I stayed here to preserve the genius... of our Irish theater!
I promise to make stars of you!
We're not peasants in the fields!
Dead souls in factories!
We are actors!
Tom...
I realized years ago... there's no crock of gold in this life.
There's just two magic hours up here, every night.
Ah, Freddie.
We're only dreaming.
Give up that dream, Tom, and you're finished.
Maybe we're finished anyway.
Tom, when I retire... all this can be yours.
I'd better go get a needle and thread, then.
Hello?
Hi.
How do you do?
Listen, I'm truly sorry I put me foot in it yesterday.
I had no notion you were married.
Since when?
I didn't want an old husband.
I just wanted a baby.
Liar.
You didn't even want a baby... till the baby started wanting you.
He's no fool, that baby.
Look, I'm only here for a week.
What are you doing for the rest of the day?
Cheek!
Clear off, you buck idiot!
Hey!
This is me Sunday shirt!
Give us a break, will you?
I'll break your head, that's what.
Are you mad?
Get out of here!
Get out!
You're the idiot.
I'll see you in the front row tonight.
Let you in for half price, if you're lucky.
Are you stone mad entirely?
Will you leave me alone?
Never.
I'm staying here all day and all night... until you come out for a walk with me.
Go away and take a running jump for yourself.
Take a running jump, huh?
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Stop that, or you'll be sorry.
Where's the man that's going to stop me?
In there with you?
I'm sure it's not the first time... you've seen a man without his trousers, huh?
How are they from behind?
Try the jacket.
Yeah, that's grand.
Grand.
That's a... a nice lipstick you're wearing, Tara.
Unusual.
How are you, Jimmy?
How are you?
He's great.
Lovely.
That's five pound you owe me.
If you're not getting married... that child ought to go to St. Jude's Orphanage in Dublin.
The nuns there will look after him... body and soul, better than you can, Tara.
I could bury him alive.
How would that suit you?
You can't fly in the face of God, my girl.
Sergeant Hegarty... you could redeem that man.
We can only redeem ourselves.
What is it you're after?
I heard about the daddy.
What did you hear?
Heard he killed himself... after the baby was born.
Lord God, that must've been terrible for you, Tara.
What are you collecting the feathers for?
A hat I'm making.
Oh?
Going somewhere special?
- Look at her.
-She's gorgeous.
Look at that hat on her.
Stop this!
Stop!
I distinctly requested... that no short skirts were to be worn.
Yes, but the flesh is well covered.
There'll be some Shakespeare after the interval, Father.
Will there?
Weak minds are easily twisted by wanton imaginings.
Why do you think God gave actresses legs?
Keep God out of this, showman.
Jeez, anyone would think we were dancing naked.
You're worse than tinkers.
Interval!
You can do all your fighting outside of the tent!
But this is better than the show!
Father, I've got lovely chocolates and...
Come on, move out!
Come on!
Come on.
Oh, hello.
I didn't think you'd come.
Are you enjoying it?
It's a great gas so far.
What's this?
Tell me, are you long at it?
No.
No, believe it or not... it's me first time on the road.
Thought as much.
It'll be me last time, you know.
The way I'm thinking... soon as this season's over...
I'm going back to America.
- America?
-Yeah.
Excuse me, my dear.
That's a splendid hat.
I made it meself.
Do you sing, as well?
Thomas, "Othello" tonight.
"Othello"?
We must keep the Vatican happy.
I'll see you later.
I don't know the lines yet.
Don't worry.
I'll prompt you.
What's all this?
Play actors, sir.
The IRA exploded a bomb this evening.
Nobody from this district, sir.
The boys around here couldn't blow up a balloon.
And I've had reports of a rash of smuggling going on.
The border's miles long.
You might as well try... and stop the wind from crossing over and back.
This is your last chance, Hegalty.
Next time, it won't be a transfer.
You'll be cashiered.
It's a waste of time, Sergeant.
There's not an IRA man for miles.
To hell with all men.
And women.
...thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly.
I'll tear her all to pieces.
Tell me but this... have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief... spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
Huh?
I gave her such a one... 'twas my first gift.
I know not that... but such a handkerchief--
I am sure it was your wife's-- did I today see Cassio wipe his beard with.
O, now, forever... farewell the tranquil mind!
Farewell content!
Farewell the plumed troop... and the big wars that make ambition virtue!
O, farewell!
The spirit-stirring drum... the ear-piercing fife... and all quality, pride, pomp and circumstance... of glorious war!
Farewell!
Othello's occupation's gone!
What are you going to do when you grow up, huh?
What am I going to do when I grow up?
If I grow up.
Here.
There you are, now.
We can tell your mammy you're on the wireless.
There's the smile.
Give us a kiss.
Put him down before you drop him.
He's fine.
Well, are you coming or not?
Why should I?
Come on.
Make hay while the sun shines.
Will you look at this?
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
My own first cousin
That did me betray
And for one fair guinea
Swore my life away
As I was mounted on the platform high
My aged father was standing by
My aged father did me deny
And the name he gave me
Was The Crappy Boy
I'd stand in the snow listening to you.
With a voice like that, you should be somewhere else.
Sure.
Didn't he go all round America last year?
Well, halfway around there.
Halfway round.
What happened?
Did your bicycle get a puncture?
Well, I was in a nightclub there... and I drank a drink they had there... called a Screwdriver.
By God, it'd make poteen taste like holy water.
And that was in Philadelphia.
And I woke up the next day, I was in San Francisco.
I'm telling you, that's the only way to travel.
That settles it.
I'm going meself next year.
I wish you would.
Go away.
Come on... while the day's in it.
- See you.
-Yeah, all right.
Tara, you're too fast for me.
You don't do it right.
I nearly burst into laughing when he led you and Jimmy... up the hayfield on that old donkey.
The Blessed Virgin wasn't in it.
He's the maddest fella ever I met, I tell you.
And best of all, he's been to America.
What would you say if your little sister... ended up in Boston?
Tara, easy now.
You don't know who he is or where he comes from.
You're a terrible woman for galloping ahead of yourself.
I'm late.
I'm late.
Oh, here.
Who are you waiting on?
What's it to do with you?
It's everything to do with me.
Steer clear, man.
She's spoken for.
Is that right?
She said nothing to me about it.
She wouldn't.
She's frightened.
Frightened of you?
Frightened of the truth.
What truth?
The baby's mine.
Ask her.
Quiet.
You're waking the dead.
Back in your box.
What are you doing here, sitting in the dark?
What's eating you, man?
I can't wait to see the back of this dump.
Did her ladyship stand you up?
You're safer counting on racehorses than on women.
I left a wife in Tralee 30 years ago.
Never regretted it.
A woman, a baby, and a mystery man for a father.
It's dynamite.
They say the paramour blew his head off with a shotgun.
And maybe she drove him to it.
She won't drive me, I'm telling you.
Where the hell are we next week?
Tullyvin.
The crack'll be mighty, eh?
"The crack'll be mighty."
How many times have I heard that before?
"The crack'll be mighty."
Will you look at us?
We're nothing but a bunch of cut-price tinkers... married to the road and a bottle of booze.
I'm packing this in.
You really need to go careful in this life.
You give up one kind of magic, you find you need another.
Rather a waste.
I was hoping you'd bring the girl along.
There's bags of sewing to be done.
And if she can sing as well...
I could sack Vonnie.
Tara.
Brendan?
I've told him the truth.
You're lying.
Why?
Why do you think, woman?
If you won't have me, you'll have nobody.
Let me go.
I'll never let you go.
You're destroying my life, Brendan.
I love you.
I love you.
Get your hands off her.
Now, one of youse is a liar.
Which is it?
Tara?
You're out of your depth here.
Clear off.
I'm not asking you!
I'm asking her.
Tom...
Brendan, you're crucifying me.
We lay together not fifty yards from here.
You offered yourself to me.
Show me the man that could've refused.
I've kept your secret from that night on... because you begged me to.
It was a beautiful summer's evening.
I was walking in the orchard.
When he first came here from Dublin... he was the most powerful man I'd ever seen.
I didn't know then... the way drink had nearly ruined him... nor the danger burning in him.
I was nervous of him... but flattered... so I laid down with him on the grass.
A few weeks later, I knew I was pregnant.
I was in turmoil.
When I told him, he begged me to marry him.
I couldn't.
He promised he'd keep the secret.
Then just before the baby was born... he started coming to me... always in the dead of night... like a hunter.
Then you should marry him, so.
I don't love him.
How could I spend my life locked up in that barracks?
Him of all people.
To hell with it.
To hell with you, then!
It's our last night here tomorrow night.
Where are you heading?
Tullyvin, then on to Dublin.
Could you give me a lift to Dublin?
If I got you as far as Dublin, you'd never get rid of me.
You've never been married?
No.
For who'd have me?
Maybe some poor soft idiot with another man's child.
You know, kids don't scare me.
And if he's lonely, I know how to get him... a brother or sister to keep him company.
This is Heaven.
And I never thought I'd make it.
It's not bad on a good day... but it's no good on a bad day.
California...
now, that's the place for us.
The sun shines there 24 hours a day.
Dreamer.
It's a lucky woman who catches a dreamer.
Why did you come back here, Tom?
From America.
Fate, I suppose.
Holy"-
Look out, we're sinking!
Let's go.
I'm frightened.
Tara, come here.
No.
We mustn't be caught together, Tom.
Down by the lake.
Then into the hay with them.
Naked to the world.
Aye.
Her hair spread out.
Her hair spread out.
That's what you call the aerial.
Higher!
Higher, man!
Up in the air, where the pictures are!
A pint and a small one.
Huh?
Don't make a song and dance about it.
There.
Look at that.
Holy God.
Didn't I tell you so?
Like a hound out of Hell.
Can you hear me, creature of the darkness?
Yes, master.
Raise the needle.
Approach the subjects.
Flesh to flesh.
You powers of light and dark... invest this vestal creature... with a gift that raises mind above base matter.
For you, there can be no rest... until you have sewn flesh unto flesh.
Begin!
Sew, creature, sew.
It's a fake.
It's candle wax or putty.
I wouldn't count on it.
No blood.
Light shall battle dark, and dark shall be defeated!
Mrs. Smith?
I can see.
I can see!
That man is a miracle worker.
I can see!
Nonsense.
It's only a trick.
Mercy.
Sergeant, will you do something?
Keep order, man.
She can see.
Thank you, sir.
Bless you... and reward you forever.
There'll be queues at the box office... for weeks to come.
He might have a cure for the lumbago.
All out!
All out!
See the greatest show on earth!
Come along, everybody!
Come along, that's it!
Here we go!
The greatest show on earth!
I'm going to shake his hand.
Freddie P. Fitzgerald!
As seen on screen and radio!
Come on!
Come along, everybody!
Touch the healer!
Touch the greatest healer in the world!
Brigid, did you find me other shoe?
I've come to see you on official business.
That's...that's mine.
Give it back.
No.
It's evidence.
I've committed no crime.
Your playboy has.
Last winter, he served three months in Mountjoy Jail.
Liar.
Last winter, he was in America.
He's the liar.
I telephoned Dublin Castle, and they checked up on him.
Three months for bigamy and desertion.
You'll be going nowhere, girl... not with my child.
Your child?
Marry me.
We could put in for a transfer.
We could set up house in Dublin, if that's what you want.
Please leave us alone.
I can see the fright in your eyes, girl.
Believe me... you're not half as afraid of me as I am meself.
Brendan...
I have no feelings for you.
You don't have to love me.
I love you.
Can't you see?
I just need you about the place.
I can't let you escape... not with that fella.
Are you blind, woman?
He's a criminal.
A foul, dirty criminal.
Get out of my house.
God forgive me for telling you... but you must be saved.
There is a rational explanation for everything on this earth... unless God and the Church declare otherwise.
What happened to Mrs. Smith last night... it was the cataracts on her eyes falling off.
The artist has a kind of power... for good or ill... but God's power is paramount.
There will be an immediate procession... of the Blessed Sacrament throughout the village.
The hour of The Playboys is past!
Henceforth, dear brethren... frequent not dens of iniquity... nor palaces of sin!
Let's go!
What the hell are you playing at?
Don't move, you two!
You put the heart across me!
Where did you get the explosives?
You could've got yourselves killed!
The truth, boy!
The Playboys, sir!
We took it out of the caravan when he wasn't looking.
Which one?
Which one?
- You're a liar.
-Huh?
You've never been to America in your entire life.
Last winter, you were in jail in Dublin for bigamy.
What?
Who told you that?
Who do you think?
Tom, if you think I'm going to gamble away... my future and my baby's future... on a chancer like you, you're mad!
I picked the wrong man once before.
I'm not making the same mistake again.
Wait, Tara.
Wait until I give you the truth of it.
It was me brother who committed the bigamy.
I just took the blame for him.
Why?
So he could go back to the wife and the kids... the ones he left behind in America.
You're full of cock and bull.
Tara, all you have to do is ask anyone in Dublin.
I'm not in Dublin.
Is it Joe Cassidy you're after?
No.
The other bloke.
Hold it.
Hold it.
You're under arrest, man.
What's he done?
Possession of explosives, offenses against the state.
Aw, codswallop!
Have you and the whole parish gone mad entirely?
March.
I know why you're doing this.
Oh, yeah?
Out with it, then.
Come on, man.
You have the guts?
No one knows better than yourself, Sergeant.
John-Joe, no.
It's about time he owned up.
There's your secret.
Move, you.
Your days are numbered, boy.
You'll be locked up for ten years.
Conspiring to cause an explosion... membership of an illegal organization... endangering the lives of innocent children.
He's your baby, Sergeant.
You're not fit to touch the hem of her garment.
You and the other fella are not wanted in me house anymore.
It's too risky altogether.
Go away, you, you dirty dog!
What are we going to do without Tom?
We're banjaxed.
He isn't an IRA man, is he?
Freddie, he's no more an IRA man than I am.
This afternoon, the entire company... will visit the nearest picture house.
Good thinking, Freddie.
We're not beat yet.
Can't you wait downstairs?
Father!
Now you listen to me, Tara.
My only concern... is for the salvation of that child's soul.
You must marry the sergeant.
He's the natural father.
Do you know what I'm going to tell you?
You still owe me two quid on that suit.
Out of my way.
Tara!
Come on.
Come on!
- Beautiful.
-Oh, dear.
I wish I could see it all over again.
You will tonight when you're in it.
Will we get away with it, I wonder?
A civil war in this neck of the woods?
It'll go like a bomb.
Clearly, Vonnie must play Scarlett O'Hara.
Rachel shall take the part of the long-suffering Melanie.
In the regrettable absence of poor Tom...
I myself will portray Rhett Butler.
Freddie... you're too old.
Cassidy... will portray the part of Rhett Butler.
I, myself... will play... as cast.
She's a little beauty, Tara.
If she ever left... this place would be as dead as a doornail.
Will they fetch enough over the border... to pay our way to America?
Will you hold your horses?
You and me aren't through customs yet.
If you get caught, your brother will take the rap.
Wait a minute, now.
It's the God's truth I told you.
He was desperate to see his wife and kids in America.
I had to help him out.
Besides that, he slipped me 200 quid for me pains.
You lying bigamist.
Tonight only!
The world famous film of "Gone With The Wind!"
Performed in person... live on stage... with The Playboys!
Adventure!
War!
Romance!
Did you see that?
What's Cassidy doing in the priest's car?
That's the least of our worries.
When did you last see the truck?
This is the customs patrol.
We're banjaxed.
We're banjaxed.
Let me do the talking.
Customs.
Anything to declare?
Detective Constable Freddie Fitzgerald...
Enniskillen.
We're transporting a load of pigs.
Can I see your identification?
Rats... the place is crawling with them.
Would you look at the two of them?
It looks like somebody is enjoying themselves.
Laughing eyes and curly hair
Singin' polly wolly doodle all the day
Fare thee well, fare thee well
Fare thee well, my fairy fay
We're gain' to Louisiana Eur to see my Susyanna
Singin' polly wolly doodle all the day
A grasshopper sit-tin' on a railroad track
Singin' polly wolly doodle all the day
Pickin' his teeth with a carpet tack
Singin' polly wolly doodle all the day
Act spontaneous, can't you?
improvise.
There's Tom.
Thank God.
Cassidy's disappeared.
There's half a packed house waiting out there.
- What are they waiting for?
-"Gone With The Wind."
Here, quick.
You're playing Clark Gable.
I can't play everything myself, can I?
I haven't even seen the film!
It's the same as "Othello."
Boy meets girl with a war going on.
If in doubt, pretend to be wounded.
Where's that bastard Cassidy?
IRA business, I expect.
He is an idiot.
We'll still be on the road... when their little squabble is long forgotten.
Come on, get dressed.
Bring those clothes, quickly.
Ashley...
Ashley!
I'm going to marry Melanie.
Kiss me, Ashley.
You're not a gentleman, anyway.
And you're not a lady, either.
Oh, lawdy, lawdy.
Lawdy, lawdY!
Is you warm enough, Miss Scarlett?
Why is all of them fighting all the time?
They are fighting for our freedom.
The freedom to be slaves?
Do I come on yet?
Strictly speaking, no... but you may as well trot across.
I wasn't doing anything!
Jesus.
I thought it was me mummy.
Sergeant?
She won't leave without you, me boyo.
For God's sake, man, what are you--Jesus!
You go away!
Go away!
So the saucy rebels said, and 'twas a handsome boast
Had they not forgot, alas, to reckon with the host
While we were marching through Georgia
Hurrah, hurrah
We bring the jubilee
Hurrah, hurrah
The flag that makes you free
So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea
While we were marching through Georgia
To be quite honest, honey...
I don't give a twopenny damn.
He's stolen the baby!
Sergeant Hegalty, he's stolen the baby!
There he is, Tara!
There!
Sergeant!
Hand him over.
Come on, man.
Move an inch, and you'll be sorry.
Hand him over.
You'll all be sorry.
You'll be sorry most of all, Tara.
I love you.
Please.
Please.
Brendan, whosoever harms one of my little ones... shall be cast into everlasting fire.
For God's sake, lads, will you stop it?
Right.
Yeah.
That's it.
Come on.
If the passion of the people could be bottled... we could all of us sail to the moon.
Come on!
Get in there!
Come on, Sarge.
Come back to him.
Come back, come back.
Stop it, Brendan.
Stop it!
Come on, Sergeant.
Get up, get up.
- Get up!
-Hit him, Tom!
Get up!
If I was sober, you'd be dead.
You'd be dead if I was drunk.
Give it up, Sarge.
Help me, can't you?
We came lighthearted.
Lighthearted we shall depart.
Thank you.
Good luck.
Allow me.
Fair lady, you're in the way.
I'm only going as far as Dublin, mind.
That's what I said when I joined.
Good-bye!
Bye!
[ Woman ] Theorizing that one could time travel within his own lifetime,
Dr. Sam Beckett stepped into the Quantum Leap accelerator... and vanished.
He awoke to find himself trapped in the past, facing mirror images that were not his own... and driven by an unknown force to change history for the better.
His only guide on this journey is Al, an observer from his own time, who appears in the form of a hologram that only Sam can see and hear.

You killed my three brothers, Tyler.
That just leaves you and me.
[ Man ] Take him, Tyler.
And this town ain't big enough for the two of us.
Oh, boy.
The question is, Tyler, who's it gonna be... me... or you?
[ Man ] Put him away, Tyler.
Couldn't we just, uh, talk about- about this?
The time for talkin' is through.
Now's the time for hot lead.
- [ Groans ] - [ Women Gasping ]
I'm sorry, I- I didn't think that- he-

- He would, uh-
Thank you!
Thank you, all!
Now, let's give a big round of applause... for the man who single-handedly cleaned up Coffin, Arizona.

And for those of you who missed it,

Mr. Means, can we have your autograph?
Uh, sure.
"The Last Gunfighter:

That's- W-Well, what's your name?

All right.
To Cindy and Kyle.
Hey.
Tyler...
Means- That's me.
Okay, there you go.
Thanks.
Have a good time.
Grandpa T. Grandpa T.
Can I carry your gun?
No, you may not.
Stevie, guns aren't things to fool around with, even if they're loaded with blanks.
Aw, Mom!
Grandpa T. had a gun when he was 1 2.
I'll tell you what, uh, Stevie- T., you've told enough stories already.
One of these days, I wish you'd get started on the truth.
But they were true!
Or else they wouldn't have been printed in that Reader's Digest, would they?
Stevie, not everybody can tell when T.'s tellin' a story and when he's not.
It's just too bad that fellow happened to be from Reader's Digest.
Lucy?
We've got tables that need waiting' on.
Okay,just a minute.
T., please don't let him play with your gun, okay?
Just take it home and put it away someplace.
Okay.
Okay.
As soon as you wash up, come back.
I'll get you both some lunch.
Love you.
And you- love you too.
Come on, Grandpa T.
I just don't understand why you got to have a gun when you were a kid-
I can't.
Well, times have changed a lot since I was a kid.
Stevie, you know, you don't need a gun nowadays.
[ Groans ]
That's easy, Stevie.
You just make it up like your granddaddy did.
But he didn't make it up.
D-Did you?
Uh-
Well, I might have maybe exaggerated a little bit, but- And the rest he just lied about.
[ Chuckles ] See, Stevie, you can't believe everything you hear.
Now, if the town wasn't makin' money building a hero for this centennial celebration, why your granddaddy'd be over at Mr. East's hotel, having drinks and telling stories... and goin' to sleep with a glass in his hand,
instead of parading around in some dime-store outfit, pretending to be a gunslinger for a bunch of tourists.
But he wasn't pretending.
He really was one!
You're the one who's a liar.
Now, Stevie, is that the way your granddaddy told you to speak to me?
No, sir.
He said never waste your breath on anyone who's dumber than a mule.
And that any sheriff that fat and slow wasn't worth gettin' to know, 'cause he'd he dead before he knew it.
We don't wanna be late for lunch.
Will you excuse us, Sheriff?
Thank you.
Hey, Grandpa, can I wear your gun belt after lunch?
Uh- I mean, I'll stay out of Mom's sight.
I think maybe today we should just do what she says, okay?
Well, you want me to take this up to your room?
Okay.
[ Chuckles ]
All right.
But, listen.
You be careful with this, okay?
You be very careful.
A gun is not a toy, you know.
I don't know why Mom's got to go ruin all the fun all the time.
[ Portal Opening ] Nice hat.
Nice.!
Really stylish.
Awesome.
Fantastic outfit too.
What happened- Did Tonto and Bill Hickok have a collision?
Very funny.
I happen to be a local hero or somethin' like that.
You sure you're not a walking ad for a fringe company?
It's, uh, November 28, 1 957, and your name is- Tyler Means.
Yeah.
Ty- Tyler Means.
You're 82 years old, and you live in Coffin, Arizona.
Isn't that a nice name
- Coffin.
This place started out as a robbers' hangout, and then it took off when- When they discovered silver in the mid-1 87 0s.
Hey, you want me to tell you this stuff or you want to read it?
All right.
Back then, this place was wide open, and it was controlled by four vicious gunslingers... by the name of the Cl-Cl- Claggett brothers.
Anyway, apparently, you rode into town... with an old gunfighter partner of yours, and the next thing you know- We got into a shootout with the Claggett boys.
Yeah, and you saved the town.
But then, you settled down.
You're the B.M.O.C., and all the townsfolks, they're very amused by your wild stories... and your boasting and your bragging... and your gambling and your drinkin', but... after a couple of decades of sponging,
the townsfolk kind of get sick of it, and your tales get wilder, and you become a local joke- the town drunk.
You're weaving your tales and mooching drinks.
Until I met this magazine writer.
Mmm.
And Ziggy doesn't have anything more than that, because these little towns didn't keep good records.
But when something comes up-
[ Sighs ] you'll be the first to know.
Uh, in the meantime,
Hi-ho, Silver!
Oy vey.
-* [ Honky Tonk Piano ] - [ Laughter, Chattering ]
Ladies and gentlemen, the hero of Coffin.
Arizona,
Mr. Tyler Means!
[ Applause ]
Thank you.
Thank you.
No-no.
No.
No, thanks.
Oh, since when?
Since, uh, now.
T.,you want to come over here?
I swear, I don't know who's a bigger handful-Stevie or him.
You know, the boy has something we can incorporate into the series.
It could be very interesting.
T., Mr. Steiner here wants to write up your life story for the television.
He's from Hollywood.
How you doin'?
How does that idea strike you, Mr. Means?
You two sit yourself down here with Mr. Steiner while I get you some lunch.
And, Stevie, mind your manners.
It's T. Mr. Steiner wants to talk to.
Let me lay it out for you, Mr. Means.
NBC's been looking for a good idea for a new Western.
Th-They're very popular right now.
Now we read your story in the magazine, and it gave us an idea.
"The Last Gunfighter:
The Life and Times ofTyler Means."
Grandpa T., you're gonna be on TV.
Oh, I-I don't think... that's exactly what he meant, Stevie.
[ Laughs ] No.
We were thinking of having someone play him when he was younger.
Uh, Randolph Scott, Robert Taylor, uh, maybe Dana Andrews?
Now, what I'd like to do, Mr. Means, is have some of the people who handle the business affairs for us... talk to you and work out a contract that would cover the rights to your life story.
And then we would sit down, and you would tell me your history.
Oh, Grandpa T.'s got lots of' stories.
And that's just what they are to0- stories.
Well, that's what TV is all about.
Now, of course, we'd have to fictionalize somewhat.
[ Chuckles ] Ain't no need to do that. mister.
Tyler's already done it.
[ Laughs ]
That all sounds all right.
That sounds fine.
Um, as long as it's fair, and you'd take care of my family.
Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem.
Wow, Grandpa T., you're gonna be famous.
Well, I'll tell you right now.
It don't matter who plays him.
Nobody in his right mind's gonna watch it.
You gonna make book on that, are you, Sheriff?
What kind of odds you givin'?
[ Steiner Laughs ]
[ Lucy ] Here we go.
The sheriff's the local bookie?
Ah, he's more like our local cynic, I think.
It comes with the job.
The badge doesn't pay enough for a man to live on.
- The West has always been like that.
- Well, you're right.
Wyatt Earp was a gambler while he wore the star.
Okay, Mr. Means.
Do we have a deal?
All right.
Yeah.
Then we've got ourselves a television series.
Yeah.
And the pilot will be the story about how you cleaned up this town.
Oh, uh-Well, uh- Sam.
Sam.
You've got to get out of town.
- What?
- Oh, it's a great way to start the series.
We got to talk.
Now meet me outside.
I'd like to start right away.
We can clear up some of the background while you eat.
Yeah, listen, uh, tell you what.
Could we, uh, maybe do that a little bit later, all right?
I gotta go right now, if you'll excuse me and go take a nap.
A-A nap?
Yeah.
When you get to be my age, you gotta store energy, and sometimes-
Are you feeling okay?
Oh, I'm fine.
I'll see you later.
I think I've had enough too, Mom.
No, no.
You come sit down.
Finish your lunch.
Hey!
You look familiar.
[ Horse Sputters, Whinnies ]
Didn't you come out on Bonanza?
[ Man ] Whee.!
[ Al ] That was Hoss.
Oh, Sam, I just saw that guy from Bonanza.
What?
Yeah.
He's drivin' that pair of- pair- pair-pair-
There, now, that's a pair.!
Ay-yi-yi.
[ Whistles ]
Al?
What?
Huh?
Oh!
Oh, listen-
Listen.
I've been talkin' to you in the waiting-
Uh, to-to Tyler, the guy you leaped into, in the waiting room.
And Ziggy rates the chances of this guy telling a straight story... at 1 6% or less.
I don't think the guy knows what really happened.
He-He spins yarns, and he likes to be the hero.
So, he likes to tell stories.
What's that have to do with me leaving town?
Tomorrow, at high noon- Yeah?
you get killed in a shootout.
In a shootout?
Yes.
You got to be kidding me.
Who would want to shoot me?
Well, I-I- [ Man ] Me.
Oh, boy.
[ Nickers ] [ Spurs Clinking ]
T.?
[ Sighs ]
I don t know what's gotten into you.
But you shouldn't have just left...
- Mr. Steiner hangin' there like that.
- I just needed to get some air.
I'll give you some air.
[ Cocks Pistol ]
Uh, be cool, Sam.
Nothing happens until tomorrow.
Russ, don't just stand there.
Arrest him!
It's a centennial play.
I'm kind of curious to see where this is goin'.
Pardon me, ma'am, for distressing' you.
My business is with this... lyin', double-faced cardsharp.
I think he's talkin' about you, Sam.
So you killed the Claggett boys, did you?
Uh, yeah, I-I think so.
Yeah.
The mistake you made, mister, was in assuming I was dead.
I'm alive, Tyler.
Outlivin' you is gonna be easy.
I'm sorry.
Um-
I'm not quite getting what's going on here.
Uh, I'm Ben Steiner.
And you are?
Tell him.
- Tell all of'em.
- [ Ziggy Beeping ]
Yeah, Ziggy says there's a 96% chance this is your old partner, uh, Pat Knight.
This is, uh- [ Clears Throat ]
- Pat Knight.
- Kinda like seein' Lazarus, isn't it?
This guy's killed more men than Clint Eastwood.
[ Lucy ] It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Knight.
But I would appreciate it if you would just put your gun away... and-and leave.
I didn't come here to leave.
Of course not.
You come here for the centennial,
He knows why I'm here.
[ Resets Hammer]
Tomorrow there's gonna be a reckoning.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to see about a room and a... bath.
Ma'am.
[ Spurs Clinking ]
Well, now, looks like our local hero's been called out for real.
Wonder what's he gonna do about it.
What's it all about, Tyler?
Uh, it's just a kind of a little misunderstanding is all.
Uh, Mr. Means.
I hate to say this, but I've got a network... and an awful lot of money riding on you.
Does this have something to do with your story in the Reader's Digest?
Oh, Sam, uh, in the original history, you get killed before you make the deal, and that leaves Lucy and Steve in a big jam.
So I think you better talk about this a little bit.
[ Clears Throat ]
Get away from here and talk about it.
I think, Mr. Steiner, if you just go ahead and have your business people draw up the contracts,
I will take care of any little misunderstandings.
Yeah, Grandpa T.!
Bam, bam, bam!
Shhh.
Yeah.
I tell you what.
I'll lay 3-to-1 odds...
Tyler either crawfishes or Pat Knight shoots him deader'n a dog.
No way.
I'll take a little piece of that.
Let's make it 4-to-1 .
There's not gonna be any shooting.
Guns don't solve anything.
Unless you're the last man standing.
[ Laughs ]
Sorry.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Gentlemen, I'm gonna go home and get some rest.
If I were you, Sheriff, I wouldn't bet on any fight happening.
So what is this Tyler guy sayin' anyway back in the waiting room?
Hm, he says he wants a drink, and he wants another physical.
Another?
He likes the nurses.
Ohh.
Outside of that, nothing.
Do you have anything more on Stevie and Lucy?
No,just-just what I said before- it's tough times.
Uh, Lucy's having trouble making ends meet now.
And when you get killed, the TV deal gets canceled.
And Stevie grows up, runs away from home and becomes a hood.
Spends the rest of his life in and out of jail.
Well, where's his father in all of this?
Uh-
Peter Means is his father's name, and he was killed in action in World War II.
So then, I'm-I'm his only father image.
Yeah.
And he's counting on me... to be the hero that I always told him I was, but when I'm not then- Then the bubble burst, and he lashed out on his own.
That sounds kind of simple, but you get the gist of it.
All right.
So what am I supposed to do?
Am I supposed to kill Pat Knight?
Can I have his gun when you shoot him?
Stevie, don't talk like that.
Now, go wash up for dinner.
Go on. [ Clucks Tongue ] Aw, Mom.
T.?
Hmm?
What's going on?
Nothin'.
I was just talking to myself.
About killing Pat Knight?
Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Well. then, why are you even talking about it?
Because I was remembering a-a story- a time when I used to ride with Pat, you know, and-and-
And somebody came up to me and offered me money to kill him,
- but I turned him down.
- Ooh, Sam, that's pretty good.
I don't remember you telling me that story... or even talking about him.
Well, there are a lot of things I haven't... told you about.
I bet there are.
Mmm.
[ Laughs ]
But, T., this-this man, he wasn't kidding around.
Lucy, please.
I'm gonna be okay.
I won't do anything foolish.
Good. 'Cause I couldn't stand it if something happened to you.
I swear to you.
I won't let you and Stevie down.
[ Sighs ]
T., you always say that, but it never happens.
Like when this Mr. Steiner showed up and offered to pay you for your stories,
I thought, "Now we can send Stevie to college.
He can
- He can be somebody when he grows up."
But now...
I have a bad feeling about all this.
[ Sighs ]
You gonna change before dinner?
Yeah, in a minute.
Okay.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna settle this once and for all.
You said in a minute.
-* [ Blues Piano ]
- It'll be just fine.
* [ Continues ]
About time there, Tyler.
I was afraid you weren't gonna stop by this evening.
Thanks.
I'm still not drinking.
[ Knight ] Runnin'out of spending money, Tyler?
Evenin'.
Be happy to buy you a drink.
Just make sure you pay me back before noon.
Mr. Means.
Mr. Knight has been telling me some very interesting stories.
Wish I could have been here.
Yeah, that way, we'd all know what we're talking about.
[ Bartender ] Mr. Steiner, long distance phone call for you.
It's from, uh, Hollywood in California.
I'll take it in my room.
Gentlemen.
I don't recall asking' you to join me.
Look, Pat.
I gotta be honest here.
My mind's not as good as it used to be, so I-
I don't remember why you're here.
[ Knight Laughs ]
Uh-uh.
Not this time.
I can see it in your eyes.
You know exactly why I'm here.
We're gonna settle it at noon tomorrow.
Look, whatever I did- whatever happened- okay?
I'm sorry, okay?
Uh, I'm sorry.
That mean you're gonna give up the TV deal too?
What would I do that for?
[ Laughs ]
You haven't changed a bit.
No, no, you- You don't understand.
I'm not interested in the TV deal for myself.
See, the TV deal is for Lucy and Stevie.
You know, so he can go to college.
Remember that night in Abilene?
Abilene.
Uh, Abilene.
I'm- I'm a little hazy on that.
[ Beeping ]
- Uh, no.
Nada.
Zip.
Zilch.
- Patience, that was her name.
Patience.
[ Laughs ]
And she was anything but.
You and I almost drew down on each other then, but we settled it another way.
And I'm glad we did.
I am very glad that we did.
[ Raps Glass On Table ]
Once partners, always partners.
Once partners, always partners.
Last man standing is the winner.
You better do it.
You better do it.
Uh, it's better than swapping lead.
[ Inhales, Exhales Deeply ]
To Patience.
- [ Liquid Pouring ] - [ Scoffs ]
[ Drunken Laughter ]
And then, what about that bank...
[ Laughing ] they hired us to guard up in...
Hoffberg.
Hoffberg?
That was great.
Yeah.
We stole all them sacks of gold dust... and found out they were filled with sand!
[ Laughing ] [ Laughing ] That was great.
Too bad- Too bad if I'd had to kill all them folks.
Uh, yeah.
Hey.
Hey, how about that time when- [ Laughs ] when we stole those horses from that guy with the cute daughters?
[ Laughs ]
I don't know
- I don't know... what tired us out more riding'-wh-which one.
[ Drunken Laughter ] Sam, what are you talking about?
[ Laughing ] Wait a minute.
I
- I don't remember no daughters.
[ Laughing Subsides ]
Maybe I saw that in a movie or somethin'.
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
[ Wheezing Laugh ]
Ooh, whoo-whoo-whoo.
You know, Ty?
Mm?
I sure am gonna hate havin' to kill you.
Well, I tell you, why don't we- why don't we have another drink and just forget the whole thing?
Just forget it right now.
[ Chuckles ] Oh, no.
I can't do that.
Mm-hmm.
Gotta uphold my honor.
Besides, I've got a side bet with the sheriff... on which way you're gonna fall.
I'm sayin' face up.
That, of course, is assuming you can hit me.
[ Wheezing Laugh ]
Hey, what the- Hey!
I reckon I can do that.
[ Sam:
Drunkenly ] Har-har.
You'll have to walk the plank if you're-
[ Coughing ]
[ Laughing ]
Sam, you are gonna be a mess in the morning.
[ Muttering ]
And probably a dead mess.
[ Sam ] Quiet.
[ Ziggy Beeping ] Nobody's gonna get killed.
Shh, shh, shh.
You're gonna shoot him, though, aren't you?
Ohh, boy.
Stevie, there's a hole right there.
Watch that hole.
Stevie.
[ Exhales Sharply ]
This isn't a game that we're talkin' about, you know.
You know, guns kill people.
You're not afraid to face him, are you?
Afraid to- Yeah, I'm afraid to face him.
Anybody who says they're not afraid to stand in front of a loaded gun... is either crazy or stupid... or suicidal or nuts or out of their- [ Stevie ] But we can't back down.
Everybody'll make fun of us.
And-
An-An-And the kids'll go back to teasing' me all over again.
Oh, wait a second.
Wait a second.
Sit down here.
Sit down.
[ Sighs ] Now listen to me.
I know this may sound corny to you probably, but... life is precious.
And, you see, once you're dead, you're... dead.
But everybody's gonna laugh at us.
Th-They're gonna say you're just a drunk.
[ Sam Clears Throat ]
It doesn't really matter what other people do or say.
What matters is what you know in here... about yourself and about others.
Because the most important person you have to listen to... is you.
Right?
I
- I guess so.
Well, you guess right.
So come on, come on.
Give your ol' grandpa a kiss good night. huh?
Okay.
[ Kissing Sound ]
Now get some sleep, 'cause it's late.
I'm sure of it.
Okeydokey.
Okay.
Sleep tight.
[ Door Creaking ] [ Sam ] Whew.!
- A lot of pride in that boy.
- [ Door Closes ]
Yeah, well, there's a lot of pride in Pat Knight too.
You know, Sam, uh, it might not be a bad idea for you to, uh, familiarize yourself with Tyler's gun.
No.
No?
No, don't you see?
There aren't gonna be any gunfights.
See, I got it all figured out.
[ Chuckles ] Wh-
Listen to this.
I'm gonna get him thrown in jail, see?
That way, there- there won't be any gunfights.
[ Ziggy Beeps ]
No gunfights.
Yeah.
No.
You still get killed tomorrow.
But, you know, it only takes one guy... to decide to have a gunfight.
In the Old West, they were really ambushes.
Ambushes?
Yeah, in the back kind of stuff.
Ambushes?
Yeah, ambushes.
I better see if there are some bullets in the house.
I didn't think-Ambushes.
All right, fine.
[ Rooster Crowing ]
[ Al ] Now, are we in the head-pounding stage... or in the spinning, rising waves of nausea?
Hmm?
Take your pick.
That's impressive.
Yeah, I just... hope that Pat Knight feels worse than I do.
[ Cylinder Clicking ] Oh, my gosh.
Don't tell me you were a gunslinger in the navy.
Well, back in the old days, they were called "gunfighters" or "pistoleros"... or, uh, " shootists." Mm-hmm.
And I had the best quick-draw artist in America teach me.
Really?
Yes, really.
Her name was...
Her name-
Fifi " Boom-Boom" LaRue.
Al.
She was a stripper in New Orleans.
She had the finest matched pair- Al!
[ Groans ] Matched pair of.44 pistols.
She had 'em in little secret holsters- real cute.
It was part of her act.
But she could draw, lemme tell you.
I know.
'Cause I studied her-
Yeah, I bet you- very closely.
Yeah, I bet you did.
[ Hammer Clicks ]
Now come with me.
You gotta learn this.
Wow!
Fifi taught you that?
Yes.
She taught me a lot of stuff.
Wait a second.
Wait-wait-wait- Now you're gonna learn.
This is too close.
Wait, wait, wait?
It's not too close!
I wanna be back there.
It's farther back there.
No-no-no.
Fifteen to 20 feet, that was normal for gunfighters.
Huh?
Anything farther than that, that's just Hollywood.
Now, line yourself up.
No, face the target, Sam.
Turn this way.
Face the-
You're gonna shoot over there, okay?
Okay.
Hang your hand down here, nice and loose, loose, loose.
[ Groans ] You're gonna catch the hammer of the gun with the inside of your thumb, and as you pull up, you cock that sucker like that- Bang!
Okay, try it.
[ Exhales ] Okay.
Yeah.
You almost got it.
Now try it again.
[ Grunts ]
Not bad.
Not bad.
But don't rush it.
Come on.
Let's see you do it.
You gotta catch the hammer with the inside of your thumb as you're drawing' the gun up.
Clear the holster, and you're rea-That's it.
Pull the trigger!
[ Al ] Good.!
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.
"Ay-yi-yi'"?
That was a pretty good shot.
I was aiming for the one on the right.
Shhh.
Oh.
Oh, well, at least you're in the neighborhood.
[ Laughs ] Al, this is impossi-
[ Three Gunshots ]
Huh, huh, huh-
[ Groans ]
Don't do to talk to yourself while you're shootin'.
Breaks your concentration.
So much for him havin' a hangover too.
It's awful decent of you to give your opposition shooting tips.
What kind of opposition is that?
I was just out takin' some air.
I heard the noise.
You are pitiful, T.
Look, Pat.
You're better at this th-than, uh, I am.
We both know that.
But doesn't it seem that... two reasonable men should be able to figure out a solution... to all this without havin' to-
Only one of us is reasonable.
The other's a liar.
Look.
I know you don't believe me, but I don't know... what you're talking about.
I was the one who walked out into the street and fought the four Claggett boys... face-to-face and shot 'em all... dead.
Not you.
Well, I guess Tyler omitted that from his article.
Look.
I can understand now why you're so angry at me, what-what with the article and-and all.
Angry doesn't begin to describe it.
No man likes to have his reputation bushwhacked... by his partner.
Oh, hey!
Maybe- Maybe he ambushed the Claggetts.
Try that.
Wait a second.
I was just thinkin' that maybe-
Ambush- Wait, I remember.
You ambushed a couple of the Claggett boys, didn't ya?
I caught Elwyn comin' off his horse.
[ Laughs ]
But Wendell had a gun when he came out of that outhouse.
And Jonah and Jamie, I faced-off fair and square.
Yeah, with a little help from you.
With a little help from me.
[ Laughs ] All you ever did was make 'em duck.
Yeah, but the point is, you didn't do it alone...
or face-to-face.
You bent your story, same way I did.
It-It's not so terrible.
I didn't bend my story.
You outright lied.
You said you did it alone.
Yeah, well, if you wanted to be such a big hero, why didn't you stick around?
Good one.
You know why?
Someone had to ride out to the Claggett place and break the news to Ruthie.
[ Together] Ruthie?
Someone had to...
comfort that poor girl.
[ Ziggy Beeping ]
Ruthie Claggett, younger sister of the Claggett boys
- Ruthie.
Uh-
Must've been some comforting, considering that you never came back.
Well, let's just say it took longer than I expected.
Oh, that sounds like an interesting story.
Look, Pat.
If I change my story now, I'll lose everything.
You made the problem, mister, and it's up to you to make it right.
Yeah, but the only thing that's at stake here is-is your pride.
Now you can't believe that it's worth killing' somebody over a matter of pride.
What the hell else did we ever have?
I think we'd better get some more bottles and... work on your fast draw.
[ Hammer Clicks ]
I'm not gonna go out there and play his stupid game, Al.
Well, you gotta do something.
We're running out of time.
[ Sighs ]
You're not gonna run away, are you, Grandpa?
Look, Stevie, in the Old West, when there were few laws and even fewer lawmen, people wore guns as-as part of their wardrobe.
They used them to defend themselves.
But not anymore.
Yeah, well, that's not what you said before he came to town.
Don't you remember what we were talkin' about last night?
Yeah, but a man doesn't quit!
A man just doesn't run away!
[ Breathlessly ] You see, you- you always told me that.
And now you're gonna run away.
And the whole town's gonna know you're just a coward.
[ Sighs ]
If Knight wants to kill me, he's gonna have to do it in cold blood, because I'm not goin', Al.
I am not goin'.
[ Clock Ticking ]
[ Ziggy Beeping ] [ Al ] Sam, sitting there isn't gonna do it.
Ziggy says you still get killed.
Okay, okay.
Then maybe I should do what Stevie said.
[ Ziggy Squealing ]
Maybe I should just run away.
[ Beeping, Twittering Continue ]
Yeah.
Bingo!
Sam, that's it.
What?
You run away.
You live to be 95, and you die of natural causes in your sleep, peacefully.
Great.
Great.
What about Stevie?
Uh- [ Beeping ]
Stevie- Well, he still grows up.
Yeah.
Uh, he runs away, and he still does jail time like before.
But it gets worse.
He picks a fight in some bar and gets killed.
Al, I can't stand by and watch this kid ruin his life, damn it!
Well, it's better than committing suicide facing off this guy Pat Knight.
He could shoot your eyes out before you blink.
[ Beeping, Twittering ] Could he?
Huh?
What?
Outdraw me.
Could-
I mean, the guy is 82 years old, right?
Now, granted, he-he's more accurate than I am, but- but my reflexes have gotta be faster.
Sam.
My synapses have gotta be quicker, because I'm 50 years younger!
Get real!
What?
Ziggy only gives you a 1 7% chance... of drawing as fast as this guy.
He's old, but he's still good.
[ Clock Ticking ]
I'm gonna get my gun.
Well, since I got some time to kill, anybody interested in a hand?
[ Ticking Continues ]
Aren't you going to do something?
No law against playing' poker, even if you are playin' by yourself.
[ Ticking Continues ]
[ Footsteps ]
[ Door Creaks Open ]
Morning, Stevie.
My grandpa's not a liar.
Kind of heavy, the way it hangs there, isn't it?
It's not that heavy.
Sheriff.
Mr. Knight.
- How old are you, son?
- Twelve.
- Bu-But I'm gonna be 1 3 in December.
- [ Ticking Continues ]
I was 1 5 before I killed my first man.
[ Smacks Lips ]
But I guess, uh, today you grow up faster.
Al, have you seen my gun?
What do you mean, have I seen your gun?
I can't find my gun.
[ Lucy ] Stevie?
You can't find your gun?
Stevie?
Where did you leave it?
T., have you seen Stevie?
Uh-oh.
[ Ziggy Beeps ] I gotta go to the saloon.
You can't go to that fight!
Sam, Stevie is gonna try and quick draw with Pat Knight, and he's gonna get killed.
If I don't go, Stevie's gonna do it for me.
[ Gasps ] My Lord!
Come on.
- [ Shuddering ]
- Stevie, don't do anything stupid.
Tell me, Stevie.
Your grandpa send you,
- or did you come on your own?
- I came on my own.
Got no quarrel with you, Stevie.
You said you cleaned up the town.
But you didn't.
He did.
No, Stevie.
He didn't.
- Yes, he did!
- [ Running Footsteps ]
Stevie-
[ Bonging ]
You're on time.
Underdressed, as usual.
[ Bonging Continues ] Give me the gun, Stevie.
No, no, no.
You're just going to run away again.
No, I'm not.
Now, give me the gun.
[ Bonging Continues ]
Now don't you think there's been enough killing already?
Easy to say when you're livin' on another man's reputation.
You just gonna hold that thing?
Sam, this is completely loony.
I guess sometimes you can't run away from your fate, can you?
Sometimes I guess you can't.
I'll be waiting.
[ Lucy ] No.!
I'm not going to let you get yourself killed!
Tyler, I guess you'll be wantin'this.
[ Spurs Clinking ] [ Door Creaking ]
Uh, Sam, don't worry, okay?
'Cause I-I'm gonna think of somethin' clever to get you out of this.
Mom, what's he doin'?
Sometimes there isn't a clever way out.
Praying, I hope.
Uh- See, I think you're too close.
Anything closer than 20 yards, and h-he can't miss.
Anything over 20 feet, and I don't stand a chance.
[ Chattering, Laughing ]
Ladies and gents, the drinks are on the house!
[ Cheering ] Come over here.
Let me buy you a drink.
How about a big round of applause for our hero, Mr. Tyler Means!
Whoo!
You did it.
You sign the deal.
Everything turns out great for Lucy and Stevie.
Great.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
You know, that didn't mean anything.
It did to them.
Tell you what, uh-
Give me
- Give me a chance to make it up to you, all right?
Hey, Mr. Steiner, come over here for a second, would ya?
Listen, Mr. Steiner.
I was wonderin' if maybe, uh- maybe we could find... a consulting job or something like that for Pat on my TV show.
'Cause he would really help me keep my memory fresh.
- [ Ziggy Beeping ]
- Mr. Means, he just tried to kill you.
I know that.
But once partners, always partners.
[ Laughing ] Well, sure.
All right.
Why not?
All right.
Get ready to leap, partner.
Hey, wait a second.
Maybe we could give him a part in the show.
In the show?
Yeah, isn't that a good idea?
You got a problem with that?
* [ Singing '60s Pop ]
[ Cheers, Applause ] [ Groans ]
[ Muttering ]
Oh, God.
They love us!
'Cause we're bad, girlfriend!
They want an encore.
What are we gonna do, Cherea?
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go do it!
We don't have any more songs.
Just do a reprise.
Come on.
Cherea!
No, no.
I don't
- I don't [ Man ] Let's go.!
- Oh, boy!

Hey lads!
Look at that chick in the gumboots!
Staring like hell!
Really asking for it.
A bit weird, that one.
Svenni!
Svenni!
Did you catch anything?
A barrel's worth of roe and about 60 kilos of cod.
Hey, there's a dance tonight.
Uncle Stink and his band.
What the hell are you doing?
Get lost!
We'll finish the windows tonight.
There's plenty to do tomorrow.
What's all the hassle?
I've just got off the boat and there's a dance tonight.
Haven't you been banned?
They've lifted the ban.
You're not going anywhere.
You're helping with the house.
It was a damn stupid idea to build that monstrosity in this godforsaken place.
Plenty of space to fill.
If you don't like it here, get off south and get a job making cardboard boxes and see what they pay you for it.
I don't want to go south.
I want to go to the dance.
Don't you dare mention it again.
You build your house yourself!
Can't it wait until tomorrow?
It's getting too dark to see.
We do have lights, you know.
It's your fault she talks back like this - constantly.
Ragnar, please.
I just thought we could leave it until tomorrow.
But of course if we are moving this autumn...
Last autumn if I remember correctly.
Well, then, all the more reason to get it finished.
Since when have you been giving the orders?
It's just this one evening.
You two are not going anywhere!
Oh yes I am!
Six o'clock sharp then.
Stop!
Stop!
Leave him be and shut up!
Why did you go with him?
He couldn't do it by himself.
You're scared shitless of the old man.
I came to the dance, didn't I?
What's going on?
Sit down!
Just a minute.
Give me the wallet, you stupid bitch!
What the hell's going on here?
Get out!
You lot!
That's enough!
Bloody fishermen ruining the dance for us.
Pull yourself together!
Out!
Stop it, you jerks, will you!
Hey, boys in blue.
What is the meaning of this?
She's playing hard to get.
She bites.
I'm charging you with assault and for insulting a policeman on duty.
This could cost you dearly.
It'll mean prison if I really press charges.
I can't lose her over some court case now.
It's the middle of the lumpfish season.
She should have gone to a home for juvenile delinquents when it all started.
Can't she make a formal apology?
I wouldn't give much for an apology from Ingunn Ragnarsdóttir.
It's court for her.
Didn't you slap Elín Gudjóns around the other day?
She deserved it.
You'd like to whip every arse in the district, wouldn't you?
Oh no.
There may be a connection between your aggression and the accident you had as a child.
In which case you are not in control of your faculties.
You were nine when the tendency first developed.
I was seven when I had the fall.
Don't think that I fight more than most people around here.
The results of head injury can take years to emerge.
I think it should be examined.
She may be crazy, you mean?
You don't say.
Others do.
I can refer you to a specialist down south.
Tests would be quicker than the jail, wouldn't they?
A week, I'd expect.
Unless they find something and keep her in hospital.
Staying in town, great.
Passengers for Reykjavík, please get your way on board.
Hello, my darling.
Damn good show you put on last night.
It was real fun on the receiving end.
What a punch!
You're in top form, babe.
Do you always carry on like this when you step ashore?
Hey, sweety, you were the one who smashed into the cop.
Not us.
A real nutcase.
Listen,we've had enough of the old tin can.
We're doing a run.
Stark raving fucking bonkers!
We'll check out the nightclubs tonight, then tomorrow it's the first flight to Mallorca.
Are you with us?
Listen, I'll pay for you.
We'll have a wild time!
Not like I'll be having at the madhouse.
You won't come to Mallorca?
Be my guest.
I'll never make it.
Not on this flight.
Clit!
Clit!
Pull yourself together!
You can't walk south!
Vigdís to Hamravík.
Vigdís to Hamravík.
Hello, Hamravík, Ragnar here, hello, Lalli.
Where are you, Ragnar?
On the east side of the Edge.
What about you?
Off Gnúpur.
Any fish your way?
We've hauled in one line, not much on it.
Covered in seaweed.
Same here.
Just a load of old crap.
We'll keep trying till the middle of the month.
Svenni with you?
Must be him scaring the fish away.
I can't complain about him.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Over and out.
Couldn't you fix the pipe on better, lad?
The tank's empty.
Didn't you undo it?
Help me, he's so heavy.
I'd never have believed he was such a weight.
Hey, is he still drunk?
More drunk than you!
What a jerk, always has been.
"Those were the days, my friend!"
Shut up!
We're trying to help you.
"We knew how to rave it up then!"
Nations of the world, fuck off!
Fuck off!
That's it.
Let go.
I'm Sveinn Ragnarsson, I'm from around here.
Any jobs going on the boat?
I suppose there'll have to be.
Sveinn!
Sveinn!
Sveinn!
Sveinn!
At the age of 12 Ingaló attacked her elderly teacher who was incapable of defending himself.
Her classmates put an end to it by tying her down to the teacher's chair.
Where they got that rope I'll never know.
He was a brute.
So this is probably right too:
When Ingaló was 15 she was caught on the beach, beating her mother with a broomstick.
She took my Corn Flakes.
Doesn't it mention that?
She slapped my face too.
And it says you threatened the foreman at the fish plant with a knife.
There was nothing else I could do.
You'd have done the same.
I got fired of course.
You'll have to undergo tests.
An IQ test, a personality test.
Several, to make comparisons.
Then you'll be given scans in another department.
Is that all it says?
Nothing about when I got confirmed?
What a bummer.
It's one bad thing after another at this place.
Damn it,I'd thought I'd been through enough already.
And there's no way to get painkillers.
I've asked them over and again to step up the dose.
But they don't ever listen to you, like you were a junkie or something.
Have you been here long then?
You bet.
Almost seven months.
They've operated on some bloody pain here.
What, your pelvis then?
No, it's the groin.
Well I never.
One mistake after another.
I went too, it was my knee.
I just hope I'll still be able to dance afterwards.
My God, who was the doctor?
Stefan Jónsson's his name.
He's good.
Really?
Have you heard that?
Oh, yes.
A fine doctor.
What a relief.
I live for dancing.
I just hope they don't have to amputate.
No, for god's sake.
Are they going to put you in physiotherapy?
Yes, they are, are you going to end up there too?
I certainly hope so.
Maybe we'll meet up again then.
Who knows?
Wouldn't it be fun though?
It's me.
Svenni!
How's it going?
I'm calling from Krapafjord.
I'm working on the Matilda.
With the crew that beat you up?
They're a tough bunch.
Are they treating you alright?
Yeah.
They call me "the cod killer".
Why did you go to sea?
You're such a kitten.
We're still one man short.
And dad?
Who's with him now?
No idea.
Didn't you call him to say where you are?
I called him.
I told him to piss off.
What happened?
Come on, don't get worked up.
What's all this about?
Spit it out.
I'll tell you later.
They've been asking about you.
Who have?
The blokes on the boat.
Some of them.
One of them anyway.
He said you wouldn't last five minutes gutting big fish in bad weather.
Even if you did smash the Hog's face in at the dance.
And punched Clit.
It was a pain in the arse when those maniacs showed up in Nes.
I have the results of the tests.
Nothing abnormal there, nor on the scans.
No signs of damage after your head injury.
The IQ tests show consistent above-average intelligence.
So what way am I crazy then?
You are not crazy, Ingunn.
Try telling them back home.
What a letdown.
Tests that cost the taxpayer a fortune, just to find out there's nothing wrong.
I wouldn't say there's nothing wrong.
So, what is it?
You're too willful.
The taxi's waiting.
Then the waiter said he's only blacked out for a second ...
There is a bitter aftertaste.
That's the last of our Chablis.
Do you have Sancerre?
One moment, sir.
So those were horsemussels.
That's what the menu said.
In Double Dutch.
You could use it for bait.
It's safer to have something with a skin on it.
How should you know?
I'll start on the soup then.
Funny soup.
It's so watery.
That's water with lemon slices.
For dipping your fingers in after eating the mussels.
So why are you eating it?
Just to keep you company.
You're polishing it all off.
Waste not, want not.
Excellent soup.
My compliments to the chef.
I've got to go back to hospital.
For an entroscopy.
So it's your guts, is it.
You're not mad then?
No, except that...
I love my wife.
A bloody insult.
Check the net properly.
We are.
Nothing wrong with this crap.
No, no, no.
It might be by the rigging.
Aren't you going to get a move on, you little bastard!
Svenni, this isn't a pleasure cruise.
You've got to work here.
Don't you want any more, lads?
There you go.
Ugh, not that skate trash.
It's delicious fish.
None of that whining.
A load of trash.
The old man was pleased with it.
Yeah, wasn't he?
This is what you do, and stop fooling around.
What do you think we're doing?
Cutting the fish!
Do you call this fish?
It's great, just stop it.
Finished?
You ought to go down in the hold and keep an eye on Ásgeir.
So he doesn't capsize the bugger.
With all that catch in it!
It'd be better to get the cook up here on deck with us.
Always keeps herself busy.
She cooks tasty sausages.
Stick them up your arse.
I'd like to see her gutting big fish in bad weather.
Fat chance of any fish while Torfi's at the bridge.
We ought to spare the rest.
Just like him.
No sooner hits a shoal than he heads for land.
I think he's allergic to fish.
Okay then.
Let's give him a shower!
Hey, Sealy!
Aren't you coming?
Get a move on.
Hand me my bag will you?
That's not what I call handing, damn it.
See you, lads.
Bye.
Bye, Gulli.
Bye.
Lads, there's a beauty contest here tomorrow.
Go and find out if Láfi's collected the booze.
Me?
Yeah, you.
Come on, Sealy.
And no tasting on the way.
Bring it all.
Don't forget the mix!
Shut your mouth, Thumper just for once.
Hey, what's going on there?
What are you waiting for?
Christmas?
Try jogging it back and forth in its tracks.
Easy does it!
It's no use.
It's stuck tight.
Stuck tight.
Get back on land.
You'll be washed out.
I'm not leaving my car!
Buy a new one then.
They come cheap now.
No, this is a good car.
89 model.
Kalli drive!
Who's that?
King Kalli.
He owns the village.
Put the drive in and slam down the accelerator.
It's stuck.
Are you trying to kill yourself?
Shouldn't we go after him?
He'll only get more stubborn.
Put it in reverse and go easy.
It's stuck deep.
No!
No!
My car!
My car!
Leave him alone.
You won't get him back like that.
Take it easy Karl, your brother is here.
You brother's gone back in.
Okay.
Call Gísli.
How long's he been out there?
At least an hour.
Stuck tight.
Catch!
Tie it to the bumper.
Just go easy.
Don't jerk it.
That's the way, that's the way.
It's a minor breakdown.
She won't have to be laid up.
I don't know why we keep that old tin can going.
For its historical value maybe.
It's hopeless.
If the outfit goes under, this place'll be wiped off the map.
Their map down south.
Our future's in their hands, you know that.
There's been talk of a merger with the saltfish outfit.
Like they're doing down the coast?
A public share issue?
No, I'm not bankrupt yet.
My grandfather had men he could rely on when he started up.
The depression was just another storm to sail through.
They braved U-boats in the war.
Top skippers in the country, year after year.
We'd be creditworthy again after the merger.
A hundred million from the fund.
Have you talked to the bigwigs down south yet?
Yes.
But we'd still be in the red, debts of 300 million.
And the Matilda.
She's a liability.
She's showing her age.
We'd never sell her.
I've been wondering how to make her pay for some of the debts she's incurred.
She doesn't even fill her quota.
The nets we've been given aren't good enough.
As to the crew a bunch of trash.
Can't we get him drunk so he'll stop this hippie crap?
Get out of here you stinking pig!
Rosy baby, shall I fuck you to pieces?
Play something we all know.
I don't know anything.
You're just great.
Do you know this one:
"The mighty lad at the helm steers the boat from land.."
There he goes again!
Gulli!
That's awful!
Listen.
Can you follow this?
Sorry, from the beginning.
He's bringing his guitar on the next trip.
Do you play?
Not at all.
How long have you been at sea?
A year and a half around here.
Before that three years in the East
I only know one thing to do.
That we all gain by.
The company, you, the village.
If we got rid of the Matilda we could transfer her quota to the other boat, Tindur.
You mean leave her to rot on the beach?
If the boat went down we could wipe out two hefty debts.
And whoever takes part would get a cut of the insurance.
By God I'd love to screw Rosy.
They drop from the loft.
They keep old stockfish up there.
Disgusting!
Am I supposed to sleep in this?
There are other beds.
But with worms in them too?
True.
It's midnight, no more singing.
Come on!
I said half an hour.
We were just chatting quietly.
Okay Aggi, we're leaving, pal.
Geiri, bring the bottle with you.
Come on Sealy!
I'm coming.
Bugger him for ruining it all.
Much bigger than back home.
Come on.
He tried to jump on my head.
Really?
When?
Outdoors?
No, in the hall.
And Dad the day afterwards.
A quick smoke, girls.
Who is this?
Isn't that great?
Wait, here he comes.
In his birthday suit.
Do you always yawn on the job?
A bit pale, aren't you?
A cock of steel!
Who's that girl under you?
Here we are then.
Hey, the door's stuck.
I can't open it.
You're deaddrunk.
Absolutely deaddrunk.
And now it's time to count the votes.
Will you leave the stage, girls, and put on your gowns.
Sveinn, toughen up.
Forget about those bastards.
Act normal.
At least try to get your own back on that bitch.
Somehow.
She made fun of you.
Come on, stop scowling.
You're not the first to go on show.
Nor the least.
Be proud of it.
It's a tradition.
I went through it too myself once.
Her name was Hrefna.
She went south.
I know the street where she lives.
It's funny the girl didn't know about the caretaker's tricks.
She's from here, after all.
Drink up Sveinn.
It'll make you feel better.
It's all just a joke.
No one cares about those photos.
Can't feel bored with these beauties around.
It'll be a tough choice: every one of them a cover girl.
She'll kill them.
Just take a look at that figure.
Perfect.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Didn't you see her bum?
Distinctly strange.
Never seen the like.
I'd give number 3 my dick.
Got a decent pair of jugs anyway.
She's a cow.
Which one did you pick?
Not the penguin, surely?
None of them.
Now it's Lára Hermannsdóttir's turn on the stage again.
Laura, 20, is a lively type.
Likes clothes and horse riding.
Not a bad combination at all...
Are they doing this yet again?
...a stunning beauty on a stallion.
Lára deserves to win.
She's got guts.
A round of applause for Lára Hermannsdóttir, please.
And Auðbjörg Þorvarðardóttir...
Won't they ever finish?
...on stage again.
She's 19 and sings.
Graces the church choir with her soprano.
Bogga, you're fantastic!
I must ask the audience to be patient.
Here comes one of the jury with the paper we can hardly wait to read.
The jury and the audience agree by 65 votes.
The winner is
Lára Hermannsdóttir!
Lára won, she won!
I must go and congratulate her!
Rigged!
Rigged!
Skúli's got no taste in women.
That number 3, I wouldn't mind getting my gums round her plums.
Get out of my closet!
No, don't, please.
Help.
Mother!
Thumper, wake up!
No, I'll take the knife.
Come on, I'll take the knife.
Put that knife back.
And shut up.
Cool it.
Take it easy.
What are you doing?
Stop it.
Let's take another.
Knives out.
Where's the superstud?
Ingaló!
Where's that superstud?
Sveinn ought to play his guitar.
He plays so... sweetly.
Bad tempered, kitchen whore?
Meanness suits some people.
Stína, come over here.
You come over here.
Forget it then.
Hey, the queen's here!
Skúli!
He's got some nerve!
Unworthy as I am to kiss your royal hoof ...
What a horrible pig!
Let's go, Skúli.
You wankers!
Fed with beauty queens, and wallowing in worms!
And letting that pervert photograph your arses without even chasing him off!
That was your brother.
And that rotten fish up there?
Do you want it for worm soup?
Are you in love with those worms?
Haven't you ever thought of sweeping the loft out?
Join me if you dare!
It's clean up time!
Where's that shit of a caretaker?
Stuck?
Sealy, come on!
There he is!
Give me the keys!
Quick!
Are you going up to the loft?
Break down the door!
Out of the way!
Break down the door!
Get it all out!
Good morning!
Bloody hell!
How dare you treat food like that.
It's been sold to Nigeria.
What the hell's going on?
The cops are coming!
This is going too far.
Who's responsible?
If the ringleader doesn't show up, I'll dock it from all your wages.
Could be at least a week's pay.
Vilhjálmur.
I think I...
Just a minute.
There's another side to it.
We cleaned out the loft to stop worms getting into our beds.
Just doing you a favour.
You know you're not allowed to keep fish in a place like that.
We want new mattresses.
Ours are crawling with worms.
Nice bedfellows.
Is the man drunk?
Cut the jokes.
We're going on strike.
Strike?
We?
Who?
Us here.
Our rooms are like pigsties.
Seven persons to a room and if we try to sleep together the caretaker bursts in and takes pictures of us.
Even tells us when to go to sleep.
Pervert!
Sex maniac!
Filth!
We can't always afford a hotel.
The food in your canteen.
Hash one day, mash the next, and costs half a day's pay.
Some of us don't earn enough to live on.
You know that.
Make changes.
Meet our claims or we stay out.
Let's get the others!
You realize this action is illegal.
No more illegal than our conditions!
Shouldn't we knock some sense into him?
Skúli for parliament!
Just sober up.
Isn't the Tindur landing 250 tons now?
Who'll save that?
Outsiders!
The fish rotting and they go on strike.
And what a strike!
Barrack pack!
Now it's up to the negotiator.
Could you get over here?
When?
Not a second later than now.
I never knew Skúli was such a good speaker.
I wouldn't say that.
Where are you off to?
To look for my brother.
Welcome to town, Sigvaldi.
Go to bed, darling.
Thanks.
Since the situation's that bad, I can't help.
Why didn't you bring in foreign workers?
Bad luck.
A serious strike will lose me 200 tons of cod.
Which I can ill afford at the moment.
Is that true about the worms?
Yes.
I can't promise anything.
...after repeated infringement of regulations about conditions for seasonal workers.
The dormitory must be made separate from the plant and we won't tolerate sleeping on rotten mattresses with bugs falling off the roof.
And canteen prices must come down.
If not the wage agreements are just a joke.
Don't you understand the situation?
The anti-inflation measures?
Haven't you heard about the voluntary wage freeze?
You're like the engineers and lawyers and all those shits.
Wildcat strikes, breaking all the agreements.
Even the union chairman is here, so there's a lot at stake.
At the national union we think wildcat strikes are serious.
That's why I'm here.
But it's clear who's in the right.
Canteen prices are an old problem.
And the situation that Skúli described is unacceptable and illegal.
So what are you going to do?
We've got to bring out the facts when the wage agreements run out.
Weigh things up.
The bosses had a year to improve conditions and I don't reckon they've done much about it.
We have Skúli here who knows what the conditions are like here and elsewhere, as I have heard.
I suggest, that Skúli should come with me to Reykjavík, and draw up a list of claims.
Then if the bosses reject them...
Skúli, you'll wipe the floor with them there.
...we'll strike.
Legally.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Here you are.
Thanks.
Cheers.
Coming with me to Reykjavík?
Yes.
I don't think I'll go.
All right...
Svenni.
Get in bed.
No, your bed.
We'll probably be off the Edge.
Okay, no problem.
Shouldn't we get a move on?
Don't you need a hand?
When are we leaving?
Now.
"The mighty lad at the helm steers the boat from land,
He can not stay a day longer, with the lovely ladies ashore..."
Hand me the thermos.
I take the big one.
"...fills the boat with redfish and capelin.."
"..heads for port,looks proud, but his heart is heavy.."
"..for the wave's aflame, the wave pulls,the wave tugs..."
120 fathoms.
That should do.
I quite understand him leaving the poor kid back there.
He was useless.
But not bringing the cook, I don't get it.
"She aroused hopes and desires.
In the night wet dreams"...
Put a rhyme to it.
Something like "tears in streams".
Hopes and desires!
Ingaló's a smart chick.
I bet she's not that bad in bed.
King.
It's a queen, you jerk.
Queen then.
She looked a prettier sight at the stove than you ever did, you big slob.
Two for the big one and one for the little one.
I've got a spade and three aces.
And the last tricks.
Ten out of eleven.
Want another?
What if she does arouse hopes and desires?
It's not her fault.
Complain to the union then.
The girl deserves it.
Leak in the engine room!
Turn the pumps on!
Turn the pumps on!
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
The engine room's leaking!
Thumper, out with the lifeboat.
Gunnlaugur, SOS.
Ásgeir!
Ásgeir!
Can the pumps handle it?
I can't swim.
You'll float, you're all wind!
Bollocks!
It's stuck tight!
Got a knife?
Do you need a knife?
No knife, you wanker?
Where are you going?
Matilda IS 167, we're sinking.
Off the Edge.
Mayday.
Have you got a knife?
Here it is!
Open the channel you bastards!
Out with it!
Matilda IS 167, we're sinking off the Edge.
Do you read me?
It's too high.
I don't dare.
Give me the rope.
Wait for me!
Get a move on!
I'm holding it.
Go on, jump.
Did you bring the steak?
Yeah.
You're crazy.
Let me see.
I've got the gravy too.
I've got a knife.
Be careful.
Give me first.
Tastes fine.
Want some?
Just a bit.
The Matilda's going down.
She was a good boat.
She was a shithouse.
You can't go bothering the boss with your problems.
You ought to keep a better eye on your boss, you bastard.
I could tell you what's the pattern on his Y-fronts.
Save that for later.
What a luck!
Yes, yes.
Alright.
Bye.
What can I do for you, Ingaló?
Have a seat.
You could tell me why the cook was left behind when the
Matilda left port.
No I can't.
You'll have to ask the skipper.
Was I being punished for cleaning up that rotten fish?
Everyone knows who started the trouble.
But that doesn't affect who goes on board.
Didn't you oversleep?
No I didn't.
All my stuff's on board.
And my brother too.
Your brother?
Think yourself lucky.
You missed an ordeal.
The Matilda sank last night.
They spent the night in a life- raft.
They've just been found.
What about Sveinn?
The skipper said the crew was rescued.
Welcome ashore lads!
Where's Sveinn?
Are you still looking for him?
Where's Sveinn?
Isn't he with you?
He was asleep in the cabin.
What are you talking about?
He wasn't on board.
This clause.
Number four.
It needs altering.
Yes.
That's right.
It's vague.
If we take out this sentence...
ALL OTHERS WERE RESCUED
Damn it.
Goddamn it.
The poor kid.
Yes, it's been going well.
My part's over.
It goes to the annual congress tomorrow.
Reasonably.
The next pay deal will hinge on it.
That's a dead cert.
Yeah, I've got a place on a boat from Ólafsvík.
Ólafsvík?
Well, see you, Skúli.
Goodbye.

Yes there's a problem.
I remember the first day I saw you on the day of our marriage.
Wearing a bright yellow turban.
You asked me my name and said... you're a very beautiful girl and I'm wondering whether you'll find me appealing.
Maybe the God is taking a test.
I feel I'm such a burden.
In the village I could be of use.
Maybe the children and I should go out to the cars?

Humble though it is.
Hello, Auntie Joan Di.

Are you a criminal of some sort?
Well that depends on how you define the word.
I was a doctor.

Don't try to recruit me.
You've got your non-practising Catholics...

So you've been here a longtime, then?
Three of four years.
Oh yeah oh yeah.

Er, do you have a hamburger?
Hamburger
Chopped beef chop the beef
You chop it then you push it into a patty.

Minute and a half like, flip it.
Grilled onions, cheese on a hamburger.
Hamburger, you gotta know.
You mean burger.
Hey!

He's my friend.
Madam, do you know this fellow?
Yes, I do.
But he doesn't have any passport.
Yes well, he, he, he's with me, he's fine
Oh Shit!
If he is with you then it's all right.
Okay?
Now you owe me three
Don't you think we should have a look at that wrist?
I guess.
Come on then.
Come on boys.
No wait
Okay.
I still think you should let Doctor Sunil have a look at this.
Doctor Max fixed it.
Well if you want it to heal you really ought to stop abusing yourself.
Well listen to you.
Are you just nuts or are you doing penance for some major past sin here?
It's not penance, I love it here.
You love it here?
Came on a whim in the first place but then I stayed.
In the beginning it was really frustrating trying to convince them not to be so.
So bloody passive and then.
I realised that I was fighting a thousand years of acceptance.
Well maybe you should stop interfering.
Maybe I should.
Joan Di.
Kamla, you've got to stop doing this.
Happy people are fat, Joan Di.
Thanks.
So where do you get the bucks for this set-up?
I get a bit from the Swiss organisation and my ex-husband sends
Jack.
He's great.
Uh-huh!
I'm not very good at loving just one person.
Seems to work out better if I spread it around a bit.
Can I ask you something?
Don't you feel it's just a little bit stupid trying to drill a hole in water like this?
Not nearly as stupid as asking for a hand and being turned down.
Well
Max.
May I be so bold as to ask what you believe in?
Do you believe in anything?
Absolutely, lady.
I believe in the Dallas Cowboys, the most oohsisteht winners of the modern era
Excuse me, Mr Max.
Do you saw 'films'?
Do I saw 'films'?
He's asking that do you seem 'flim' when you were small?
If I saw 'films' when I You mean movies, pictures?
I saw 'films' all the time.
I saw three a week two on Saturday cartoons Donald Duck.
You're great with kids, anyway.
Do you know what I've come to think in my old age, Max?
No idea, you're pretty much an enigma to me.
I think, in life, a person really only has three choices.
And I don't suppose there's any way you're not gonna tell me is there?
To run to spectate or to commit.
That's very tidy.
Simple minded but tidy.
You're awfully, badly twisted around,
Well one of us sure the hell is.
I'm off, Sister Joan.
Ah, goodnight, god bless Doctor Sunil.
Yeah.
Comes from a wealthy medical family.
Donates his time.
Very generous spirited young man.
And clearly not twisted around.
Hey!
No, no, I have to go home.
Hello, miss.
Come.
Okay, bye, see you tomorrow.
Manooj baba is come.
Hey, hey everybody listen.
Good news really good news.
And what is that?
Hasari has got a regular customer.
And who is that person?
That schoolgirl.
On a monthly basis, you say?
Oh yes.
You must pay for the tea today.
Yes, yes.
Kamla, wine.
The Gods have smiled Hasari has got a regular customer.
A great day.
It's been a lucky day.
Here this is for Amrita.
For her dowry.
Let's start a little shelf for her.
Bring me a glass of water.
Yes, baba.
Here.
What's that, baba?
Seeds.
What for?
So that we can watch something grow.
Coming, son.
God bless you.
Ask him, ask him, ask him.
Baba.
There is a doctor from America.
He sees two 'flims' and also Mickey Mouse on Saturday.
Can he eat with us?
Go go ask him.
Come, come.
Doctor Max, Doctor Max.
Will you eat with us today?
Sure.
See this is the earth from our village.
And water from our new home.
When these seeds grow into flowers.
We'll pluck them and put them in your hair.
On your wedding day.
Shambu go and get some tea.
Yes, baba.
And then everybody will look at you.
And say oh, how beautiful she is.
And I'll shed tears of joy.
I was so frightened my brother gave me something to drink.
I went out to piss under a tree and fell asleep.
And when I woke up.
I thought I married the tree.
I still love that tree.
If I could pay off the money lender
I'd go straight back to my village.
So what's a dowry, Ram?
A heavy burden.
Why do you bother?
Well, it's our duty.
An honour.
Thank you, Surya.
Without this our daughters can't marry.
Ma!
Joan Di, Joan Di.

And he's got all his stuff.
What can you expect Said!
Your wife was incredible.
Kamla, you were absolutely
Thank you for your kind words.
I was dearly blessed to marry her.
Have you birthed many babies?
Not for a long time.
Max.
We desperately need a doctor here full time.
Will you just
I'm sorry.
Maybe you have it in you to be a saint, Sister Joan, but it's just not my style.
Oh, so what are you going to be when you grow up, doctor?
Look, don't do that, lady!
Don't patronise me because you are on some goddam good do-gooder trip.
Don't you snarl at me or I'll smack you upside the head.
Don't do this!
You know I don't even feel good about what we did down there today.
Bringing in another little mouth to feed in this cesspool of a country
Feel good!
Who the hell cares if you feel good?
What makes you so special?
You're jusst another person like the rest of us doing the beset you can to.
...to tade care of yourself any too bloody well as far as I can make out.
Don't talk to me like you think you know me,laby!
Look, you need help
Don't be a coward, ask for it.
I don't need your help.
Have a pleasant journey home, Max.
Goodbye and god bless you.
Mr Max.
I -
- I think you have a good heart.
Thank you for allowing me to be of use.
I told you, my passport is lost in the mail, but I can't believe it's going to take three weeks to transfer a couple of hundred dollars.
I just gave it to you.
One-one-zero-zero-one-six-two.
Two.
I don't know, my visa...
Hello?
Goodbye!
No dinero, no bucks for three weeks.
- This is driving me crazy
- Max the bill.
I'll need you plane ticket.
- My plane ticket.
- Yeah.
It's just a little guarantee.
With a face like mine you don't trust me?
- It's not a question of trust, Max.
- Oh, of course not.
The government renuires foreign exchange.
So it's the government's fault?
My husband is a very strict man.
And, er-- we have to tell your husband.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
And there is absolutely no other way out of this place?
Hunched back camel-- burrow, nothing?
No not until the bill is paid.
Not until the bill is paid, all right.
Here you go.
Please take care of it.
Can I leave this here?
Mm-mm.
Thank you.
For you.
...not contagious.
I don't know that, all I know is...
You don't know it, you don't know.
You know nothing.
Please, please...
I've been vvoring with these people for five years...
Let them go to hospital.
Just a minute, just a minute, just a minute.
You stay out of it!
Listen-- just a minute.
Leprosy is not infectious.
I am leper.
But my daughter but my daughter is not leper.
Oh, I'm not interested in all that.
All I know is that lepers shouldn't come here.
Joan Di.
Joan Di.
Hello, Anouar.
Hello-- tell us ...Dotor Lowe was telling us- that many of us could be helped.
...that all it would take- is money for medication.
Please-- would you buy us the medication?
Anouar, it, it'd cost a fortune.
Well-- as we are not allowed to come to the clinic then perhaps Doctor Lowe would come visiting us occasionally.
Anouar, Doctor Lowe is no longer a part of this endeavour.
There is only his cherished memory.
...because I am having visions.
Good morning, good morning!
Hell of a good morning.
I may have the body of a sparrow but I have the eyes of an eagle.
What are you doing, Sister Joan practising medicine without a license?
Oh God, junior, you're great.
Oh, what a surprise!
Now don't get carried away, I'm just here to get you organised.
Will you shut up?
What made you change your mind?
Well, I had a religious experience.
You see, I talked to Jesus to day...
Oh yeah, and I'm a bloody bathing beauty.
Actually-
- I am temporarily deprived of my plane ticket.
Ah so, how long am I stuck with you?
Couple of weeks, till I get you organised.
No, six months, not a day less.
- You're crazy, lady.
- Not worth the aggravation.
One month and not a day more.
Three months-- and that's my final offer.
Nine weeks-- or until my plane flies and that's my final offer.
You're on.
Olay, now sit down.
Here write.
We need detailed case histories we need an IV.
Er, you need a truch load of broad spectrum antibiotic pain killers basic vaccine...
God save me from knights in shining armour.
Hey!
Good morning, Doctor Max.
- What are you doing?
- Good morning, doctor.
Hi, Hasari.
Er, Kamla I was wandering if you would like to be my assistant.
At the clinic, what do you think?
Hasari I need Kamla as my assistant at the clinic
Is it all right?
You are staying here?
Well-- for a bit.
What do you think?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Cool!
All right.
Twist and shout-- twist and shout.
Come on, come on baby...
Hasari, where have you been?
I've been waiting almost five minutes.
I'm sorry-- it was the traffic.
Oh no, mum, come.
Oh, you're looking very different today.
Yes.
You not go to school?
No, we are going baara bizarre.
She is getting married, Hasari.
Oh-- that's very nice.
Soon I'll take her children to school.
Hasari, you must remember the shop where we are going.
Because it is the nicest shop in the city.
And when your daughter gets married-- you should, you should take her to this shop.
Am I not right?
Turn to the right please and don't mind her.
She's just a little chatterbox.
But mama, you get such beautiful saris.
Come on, let's get down.
Dipti dear, how do you think he can afford a shop like this?
But mama, I didn't mean it.
Don't take it so seriously.
That was very insensitive, my dear
Mama, just look at the sari.
Well, youy shouldn't say these things.
One you know what I mean.
I said it again.
One every two days, okay?
Understand---great.
Only four hours to go, junior.
Oh, go for it!
Okay, little fella, let's check you out.
Let's check you out.
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
This baby's not gaining weight.
Are you giving him the extra milk we gave you?
Some, not all.
She's probably selling it.
Selling it?
Gotta pay the rent.
On that dump?
Well now Poomina's going to school somebody's got to pay the rent.
That's the way things work round here.
I'm not liking the school to be in, okay.
From tomorrow I'll not go.
I will go back to work...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, yo!
We have the technology.
Okey dokey.
This.
...Is the extra milk for the baby.
And this is the extra extra milk for the rent.
So it's very simple, give it to the kid or I'll kill you.
Thank you, sir.
And Poomina... you, young lady will stay in school.
Come here little
You're gonna need all the luck you can get.
Gonna be a fireman when he grows up.
I get no respect.
Hey!
Take me to 'Rifles' building.
Baba I'm cooking, baba.
I'm cooking rice,baba.
Where's your mother?
Careful go get me some water.
Kamla, do you have any water in there?
I am fried!
Hasari.
Hasari, you have three fine potential scholars here.
This one will be ready for a proper school in another couple of years.
It's more than a father could hope.
Fifteen years from now, Dallas, Texas, Doctor Manooj Pal.
Thanks.
Joan we can't keep going out to that leper colony, it's wasting like what, two hours a day walking.
I know but
Well Poomina... where have you been, young lady?
You should be in school!
I know who this is from.
It's a summons to see 'himself
Now Mr Ghatak, I understand there should be an increase in rent if we have larger quaters, but
I don't see why we should have to pay more protection.
More people, more problems the strangers.
And if I don't charge you what will I tell others?
We can't afford it!
If you can expand, you can afford to pay more.
Excuse me, sir, this isn't a drinking den, this is a free clinic.
You are from a rich country, doctor.
For you money is a piece of paper with which you buy something you want.
For me it's a wall.
A beautiful wall.
A protective wall.
A wall that separates me from the degradation oh the other side.
This wall is my achievement, Miss Bethel.
I am proud of it.
And what you don't understand is that those poor souls on the other side they are also proud of it.
Do you understand?
Oh yes.
Please sit down.
Please sit down.
So you wish to start the treatment of lepers,hmm?
Yes.
But your neighbours are simple, not educated.
They won't tolerate lepers.
They'll change.
Change?
You are a romantic, Miss Bethel.
I've learned not to trust those who say they do things for the benefit of others.
Man can be tamed by having an abundance or by having nothing.
Who is rebellious?
Who is disobedient?
Those who have only a little.
So..
...If there isn't enough for all it's best that people have nothing.
My children bask in the light of my strength.
It brings--stability.
But I burden my children carefully.
Kindly.
Reading their faces adding to their burden in tiny increments.
So tranquility an end to pointless aggression.
You really ought to give up thinking, doctor.
Learn to enjoy yourself.
Have some--pastries, Miss Bethel.
Thank you.
I'm sure we can provide the means.
To remove those coulds from your forehead.
Don't offer me candy!
What are you trying to do, bride mel?
Get your hands...
Stop!
Stop.
Take those boys away.
Get out--get out!
What in the name of God do you think you're doing?
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
With me, any duplicity's possible.
What was all that about?
Nothing, just a little--low family joke.
Stop it--stop it!
Leave me alone you silly--eejit.
I think we have to break the godfather's hold on us.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
We have to be cautious, this is not the most appropriate time.
Oh come on, Sunil, how do you proceed with caution against someone who considers you a chicken with a weight around your neck?
You want to change things... you have to risk.
Look, you back off this ,you compromise with this guy and he will eat you alive.
You, you can stand up.
But we can't do that, we live here.
I'm telling you if you stand up he will back off,I guarantee it.
Max, this is not one of your American gangster TV shows, you know.
Let me ask you something, let me askyou something, Max, now...
HOW this is a self help society.
So help yourself.
So, so... are we not getting swept up with your thing here?
I take of fence to that, saint Joan.
Ah well, I'm sorry you're so sensitive but this, this is too important to piss about.
It's hard to know when to trust you.
I mean, you're, you're angry with everything.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
And you can afford to talk like this because.
...you're not going to be here tomorrow, you're going home.
I am here!
Max, we should think thrice before we do anything.
For Ghatak is is the saviour here.
He has given us the jobs.
Saviour.
Hasari -- isn't it '2
Come on, speak out.
See, he's given me a job.
And I've been eating his salt.
So what -- you're paying for it...
And I promised him to remain loyal...
Let him speak!
Now you know, it's, it's difficult tO...
I, I hope you understand Joan Di.
I don't understand you people, you're acting like sheep.
You bow your heads and take this nightmare like you have no choice.
But I'm telling you if you don't stop this asshole now he will ruin you for the rest of your lives.
Ashish, Ashish, when Ghatak's son came into my shop he beat my son up...
May I be allowed to speak?
Just a minute, Kamla wants to say something.
Now you want to speak.
It's only because this is our home now.
We've never know such friends.
I think the god father is strong.
And could kill us.
But we must choose.
Maxis, is only trying to help all of us and we should support him.
I think we should stand up.
Well
I've got a property which I could let out.
Say two hundred and fifty rupees a month.
But not a rupee less!
Those goras are going to build a new clinic on someone else's property.
But they won't pay protection.
I think the doctor must go.
How many times a heart beats in a man's lifetime?
I have calculated it two billion times.
Very few.
The woman the nurse she is okay.
The doctor
American doctor.
He should go.
He should go now.
I'm ill I'm sick!
I can't be bothered about it now.
Are they going to bring in the lepers?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Yes!
Good.
Let them climb well out on the branch.
Then we'll out it.
When I' m gone ...who will you be loyal to '2
Sorry I didn't realise it was you.
Your father, babu.
Remember loyalty.
The godfather has made our life possible here.
We shouldn't anger him.
I think we can trust Max daddah.
He'll stand by us.
You know you are very beautiful.
Oh, Kamla
What about the children?
We won't make noise.
Max, is this going to be your room?
No Joan Di's room.
Is this fun?
No.
Look, Max honestly
I didn't know all this would work.
But it has.
Now all you need is a Indian bride.
Oh yeah, and you're gonna pick her?
Get outta town!
God, I never thought this day would come and yous all worked your socks off and
I wish I had some champagne, but we haven't so we've got some sweets.
Everyone can come to the new clinic.
And I declare it officially open.
Hey, Manooj!
Amrita.
Baba.
Excuse me, can I go?
Baba.
Hurry UP-
Bye.
Good news?
Job back home.
Could you
Oh my God, lepers.
Put these in my box.
Well there goes the neighbourhood.
Sshhh you barbarian!
We are trying not to be lepers.
Oh I didn't get the concept.
Of course, not lepers.
You had me fooled.
Since it is a special day.
We are taking you to the clinic in grand style.
Oh, you are, let's go!
Meeta is very excited by this ride through Calcutta.
She has never been sightseeing before.
Oh Anouar, you are incorrigible.
I know, I'm very encouraging.
You're very that's not what I said.
Hey Poomina, where have you been hiding, huh?
Huh?
Hello, Poomina, an old friend wants to see you.
- I have to go with my friend I can't go.
- You come with us.
- I have to go with them.
- Come on.
I've got to go with them.
O you like the clinic huh?
Ah, little Poomina you have new friends now.
And they like you, huh?
And they like your smile.
My God, we've got a crazy man driving.
Hasari, hasari come quick Gahtak's men are attacking the lepers.
Hey, what, what's going on?
Hasari what's happening?
What's wrong?

We'll P33'!
All right?
We'll P33'!
So by all means protect us.
Rickshaw wallah!
Tomorrow.
Come and see me.
Will she will her face be all right?
She is going to be absolutely beautiful.
And if you do exactly what I say and don't open it up again you're not even going to see a scar, sweetheart.
But you're going to have to stay here, do you understand?
Huh?
Joan, you're gonna have to make her stay here.
I'll try.
You don't goddam try, you do it!
God I hate this place.
I hate this place.
I hate this place.
Almost done, sweetheart.
Almost done.
What have you got to say?
I told them your father provides us with a great deal and and I, I had promised him that I will remain loyal.
You're off the list.
Leave your rickshaw here.
Babu please.
Your rickshaw will be reserved for people who deserve our trust.
Go.
Babu, I, I, I'll be ruined.
This is as if the ground has opened
I have to speak to Mr Ghatak.
Mr Ghatak!
Mr Ghatak!
Please let me talk to baba, babu.
My father is ill.
I'm making the decisions.
My decision is final.
Now go.
Or do you want him to break your fingers?
Please listen please let me please let me talk to babu
Please let me explain
I quit, I should have stayed quit.
I became a doctor because my goddam father was a doctor.
I played football because he played football.
I ran for class president because my daddy was class president.
And I'm done with it.
Listen to me, Max.
If you want to leave, tell us to go and stuff ourselves but don't try and blame anybody except yourself.
All right then, I quit.
I have given you light years more than I planned.
I am not magic Max and I will not be invested in these people, with their needs and their clinging and their desperation.
It's just too goddam painfull!
That's what it is working with people, painful.
And it's a struggle not to lose compassion or humanity but it's a struggle we can't afford to lose.
Oh, bullshit.
Ghatak is right.
People are just out for themselves and everything else is a fraud.
O
What are you, saint Joan?
Are you a fool or a fraud?
Both.
Both of those.
But I'm here because I want to be here.
Max, maybe the world was meant to break your heart.
From the moment we're born, we're shipwrecked struggling between hope and despair.
Oh God
All of us.
God junior.
Not everyone's out out for this, you know.
You did the very best you could.
No, no
Better than most.
No I did not, lady.
I messed up real bad.
You're only human, Max.
Yeah, I khow.
Let us, let us not ever forget what is it, er, run, spectate, commit.
Running, spectator.
Whatever they are.
The more you run the harder they'll chase you.
Oh goddam.
They took away my rickshaw.
So what do you want me to do about it, get it back for you?
But we trusted you.
I guess that was your mistake, huh?
They took away my rickshaw.
You will have nothing to do with these people
Or that clinic any more.
Hasari, please, what I will earn will be for you and me.
Sshhh, lie down quickly, lie down.
Go to sleep come on, lie down.
How will I get a job now?
Sshhh, go to sleep, close your eyes.
How will I put food in your mouths?
We have what you saved for my dowry.
Take some more.
Take this one.
This one too.
Hasari?
Hello, Hasari.
You didn't go to work today?
It was a morrning shift, baba.
I bought some food.
Hasari, look
I know you feel
I let you down but don't punish Kamla.
What happened is between you and me.
And we need her at the clinic.
Oh Hasari, please!
The clinic is for everyone.
And I think they'll pay me.
No more clinic!
I'm your husband and you will do what I will say.
Stay away from him.
He is not one of us.
This is not his home.
He's a he's tree with on roots.
NO, but he is
He will only be good to you as long as you please him.
That is just not true Hasari.
Please, don't teach me what is true.
Just leave us alone.
I've lost my rickshaw.
I've lost my livelihood.
I don't know what is going to happen to us.
Max.
I have something confidential to ask you.
This disease of ours it is not a visitation for our past sins but an illness, yes?
Right.
I want to start a workshop.
We have weavers and carpenters.
We could weave cloth instead of begging.
Anouar, it's a good idea but I
Listen Max I know about this godfather, he's a clever man.
He has got everyone to turn their backs on you.
But I can show you how to get your way back into their hearts.
That is why I want you to follow me.
Please, I show you something.
What is it?
You will see it come on.
You devil!
You stole it?
No, sahib.
Where'd you get it?
The police, sahib.
And, er we have borrowed it from the police.
Ta-da.
It's great.
I konw it's a little ratty but
I'm good with my hands, you're good with your so, we can make it good as new.
What do you think.
Well?
If I go out on the streets with this machine
I'll die in the gutter with my throat cut.
No you won't .
Because the license the cops.
That can all be fixed with bribes or something.
And as far as the godfather's concerned, we just don't work in his area.
And we have nothing to do with the sucker, here.
So please take it.
Please.
Oh goddam, Hasari!
Doctor Max, you you don't understand.
Tell me.
You are a gora a white man.
You're you're different.
You you think you can buy people's hearts by giving them things.
Building clinics being a big man.
For me trust is in the heart.
And that is something which cannot be purchased.
Purchased is that what you think?
Is that what you really feel?
All right.
All right.
Look, I'm a small man.
No, shit!
Born small and that's my fate.
And I will not allow you again to tempt me with big thoughts.
Oh no no, sir.
Uh-uh.
Small ain't the word for you, pal
You are a little brown illiterate gutless victim.
And you should take all this crap from the cops and the gangsters.
And you should keep on locking up your wife being suspicious being jealous for no goddam reason.
You have no right to say such things to me.
Well then go ahead, stop me.
Come on goddam it!
DO it!
Hasari I did not do this all on my own
You participated too.
And did I take your goddam rickshaw did I make you live in this shit hole'?
No!
So if you want to be pissed at me go ahead, that's fine.
But you should get pissed at the people who are really using you.
Do you know what I think?
I think you should bow down so low that you don't have to get up.
Sweet little sixteen.
Whoa Max. you are good!
Now you look beau Ah, I'll kill you!
You look beautiful but still no running, jumping, picking up anything heavy.
All right?
And you're going to stay here and stay away from you know who.
And she's going to school.
You heard the lady, and she's going to school
Shake the head yes.
Good, you understand?
Say yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Be careful.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
I'm serious.
Hah, busted!
Well rickshaw wallahs, eat your heart out, Hasari, looking great.
Shambu, go and shut that door.
Okay, babu.
I'll get it.
Godfather has more eyes than a pineapple.
Manooj, bring that stool.
Yes, babu.
Hurry UP-
Let me help you.
Please let me do it!
Sorry.
Push that log in
Hasari
I.u m promised the kids I'd take them to the cinema to the new Anil Kapur movie.
Well, if a man promises something.
Baba baba, are you okay?
Baba
It's all right.
Go back to your work.
Yes, baba.
Can I see that, please?
It's nothing, it's
Open your hand.
Just cough.
If it's nothing, open your hand.
You're not taking the medication, are you?
Hasari not everything I do is wrong.
I am a doctor.
Tuberculosis is something to be messed with.
Do you understand it can kill you?
Do you?
HEY you know best, right?
You got one hour, kids.
Max daddah, Anil Kapur is the best fighter in the world.
What are you talking about, better than Rambo
Yes, better than Rambo.
You're crazy.
He's much better than Rambo.
It's Captain Manooj Pal, the pirate doctor.
You are so fun, magic Max, I wish my father was so fun as you.
Whoa, whoa!
Don't you ever say that.
I wish my daddy had loved me half as much as your daddy loves you.
He's a very' special man, do you understand that?
- Yes
- Yeah?
Okay,
And he's backing me up.
Oh no, he's in trouble.
Okay, everybody off the road.
Out of the way.
Max daddah!
Run, run, move it!
Shambu!
He'll be okay, it's just just a little bruise, a little scared.
When he wakes up.
Goodnight.
Isn't it a work of art?
This is Arjun's chariot.
Pity it won't be used, though.
What?
Will they let you use it?
I'm going to talk to the old man.
Listen to him.
I'll catch him when he's alone.
He's not like his son.
He came to the city with a little bundle.
Hasari don't
They could have killed my little son yesterday.
Yes.
- Max, it's not the point.
- But Hasari
- He's doing this to frighten all of us.
-If you'd be the next tomorrow?
- Max has nothing to do with it.
- What would happen to your family?
And in fact godfather has nothing to do with this.
It's his son.
Chomotkar da.
What's happening?
The godfather is dying.
And the son is raising rent.
Ram da, take care of this.
Don't involve yourself.
But they are our own people
If the old man is dying we
Rickshaw work, Zindahad
Rickshaw union, Zindahad.
My father is ill!
Your godfather is dying!
This is how you show your respect.
Do you think I want to raise the rent?
Huh?
Do you know how much it costs to change a spoke on a wheel?
Do you realise how much money I have to spend to keep you people on the road?
First you all know this man.
He is only a son.
Godfather was a different man.
You can't risk your lives with this man.
I propose end of lets pay
Rickshaw union, Zindahad.
So you want to strike?
Strike!
Those of you who want to strike leave your rickshaws here.
Those of you who want to work there are customers out there, get out
I-I6)' he)' where are you going?
Don't don't go!
They tried to kill my son.
Nobody thinks about us rickshaw pullers or bothers with our stories.
They trust us to take their children to school but they forget the boiling tar on the road which blisters our feet.
Cars trying to run us down.
We are threatened by corrupt police, we pay off officials we pay off Goondas.
I'm proud to take my countrymen from place to place but I can't keep silent any longer.
As someone said, if a man bows down too many times.
There will come a time when he won't be able to stand up forever!
Silence!
There will be no commotion.
I will make a restraining order against Ashoka Ghatak.
This man will be permitted to use his rickshaw without let or hindrance.
These men have clear and legal right to strike.
I haven't finished these proceedings.
For his part in this disturbance I fine the defendant fifty rupees.
But ma'am
Pay at this time or spend seven days in jail.
But madam, I, I can't afford fifty
Next.
Madam, fifty rupees is
I have not done anything wrong.
MOFISOOH, monsoon
What does your father do?
He owns the workshop.
Are you studying?
I just finished my school.
So I must visit your father.
Go home, doctor.
Junior!
What's wrong?
Ashoka ordered me to go home.
So here I am.
Oh, who's that?
Who's the little girl?
Patient.
She died.
I couldn't save her.
Proverbial last straw.
You know.
There was a man in the town when I grew up.
Thirteen years his wife was dead and he still laid a place for her at
One day he burned his house to the ground.
And he left the town for good.
We assumed he was a free man.
Welcome home, junior.
Thanks.
Hey goodnight.
Goodnight.
So, you want your daughter to marry my son.
You're a rickshaw puller.
Am I correct?
Yes, sir.
But I own my rickshaw
He is the owner of his rickshaw.
I'm a partner of the workshop where your daughter is employed.
Are you aware of that?
Yes, my daughter had told me that.
So tell me how could I permit my son to marry your daughter, huh?
Just a moment, please.
Ah, he's an oldfashioned man Don't worry, huh?
Um, brother are you saying that, er in no way you can consider this marriage, huh?
It is a love match, you see.
Perhaps some inducement would that help you anyway.
- Inducement?
- Yeah.
What could he possibly offer?
Possibly nothing.
But in fairness we should find out, huh?
D-BY
Hey Ram daddah how is the business?
Hey, Hasari!
Good business.
Are you feeling better today?
Doctor Max magic.
Isn't it a joy to watch this disaster?
We shall by grace of God make fortunes today.
Eight rupees.
It's too much, the rate is fixed.
Who needs a ride?
Come on, come on.
And two rupees for the packet.
Change.
No change.
Change!
Daylight robbery!
Come back, come back!
God bless Kali, he has heard your prayer.
Yes.
If it keeps on like this.
You'll make Amrita's dowry and I will return to my village.
God willing.
What can he possibly offer?
Hey, babu!
Oh no, no, no
Well I know why I stayed.
You can get water front property cheap.
They're coming from the clinic, they're coming!
- Hang on, they're coming.
- Oh look look who's coming.
Max daddah.
Thank God he's coming.
Come on, come on, quick, the whole thing is getting lost.

Max daddah.
Thanks.
You're cold.
He's in bed when he should be working.
You dring this and it'll warm you up.
Sorry, it's a bit full.
You know, er that time at the godfather's when you, er... wanted to know about the candy and the bribes.
When I was a kid, er I walked in on my father with another woman.
That's when the bribes started.
He'd tell my mum we were gonna go play golf.
I loved driving that golf cart for him and and, re just being with him, you know.
Then we stopped going to the golf course and and, er we'd go see her instead.
He kept a stock of candy bars in the glove compartment.
He said don't tell, don't tell mum.
This is just between us men, Okey?
I'd sit at the dinner table and I couldn't even look at my mother.
After a while I couldn't even eat the candy bars.
I just stuck'em in a drawer
So at nine I was an alibi and a traitor.
At twelve she died and -- and I never told her.
After that, you know, I, I just shut down.
You, you shut the vvorkd out maybe.
I, I worshipped the ground that man walked on.
Lonely, lonely Max.
Lonely Joan.
Sometime.
You know what this is?
It's the world's smallest record player playing "My Heart Bleeds For You."
Why don't you sell him some ornaments of gold...
Please, let me speak.
How much gold do you have?
Please don't embarrass me, sir, I have no gold.
The only ornament I have is my daughter.
She's a good girl and she's a working girl.
She has been a jewel of my house.
Now she'll be a jewel of your house.
Are they still at it?
It's only the beginning.
I'll see you.
Okay.
Hello, Doctor Max.
Hi, you guys.
So Ram, how's it going?
They 're very upset.
They're saying that Hasari has sent his daughter to trap their son.
- Trap their son?
- Hello, Mr.Max.
All that really separates them is an ounce of gold.
That's all, an ounce of gold?
How much is that?
About this much.
See that?
So is your daddy tearing 'em up?
Oh yes. my daddy is better than Rambo.
Rambo -- what happened to Anil Kapur, huh?
Have you some cash?
What is it?
What's happening?
!
Listen!
Listen, this is my rickshaw!
Babu -- babu, what is this?
Thank you for dropping by.
My father is dead.
So now I'm in charge.
Is this your rickshaw?
Yes.
You made this?
Yes, babu.
That's beautiful.
Blue!
Beautiful.
Ashoda, please don't do this.
I'll do whatever I like.
I'm in charge.
You will get off my street.
You will leave my country.
And the clinic and school --closed.
Why, we're not doing you any harm.
Because I hate interfering foreigners who think they are better than me.
But you hurt your own people
Exactly -- my P9OPle-
Loyal.
No!
She's beautiful.
Beautiful.
Some day she is going to give somebody a lot of joy.
Leave my child alone!
What did he say?
He said don't touch her.
Now, doctor what concern is it of yours -- who I touch?
They're my family.
Your family.
My people
Babu!
No!
You put your dirty hands on my child!
Salim.
No, Salim
I want you to stop!
Let him settle this himself.
Salim!
I won't leave here!
Baba!
Baba!
No baba, don't.
No baba!
No more!
No more feet on our necks, babu!
Come on.
We've taught him a good lesson.
Max daddah.
Sit down, sit down. sit down.
Pressure, push, push.
I think I'll give him a break.
Well you can try but he won't leave him.
Shall I stay?
No, I thing you should go home.
I'll look after him.
It's okay, I can stay.
No, you've got an early day tomorrow.
Okay.
We make a good team.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
You see that picture up there?
The guys on the front looking off into the distance.
Like you and your baba their full of hope.
You see that guy on the back of the raft with his ohih on his hand...
Huh?
...like old magic Max he spends all his time being afraid.
Scared of all the bad things that could happen.
But the guys on the front somehow they stay full of hope.
And they never ever, ever give up.
Right?
And you know what?
What makes it possible to make it through all the rough stuff is our love for each other.
Huh?
Baba baba!
Oh, Max daddah.
For a long time I wanted you to leave.
You made me feel things I never felt before.
I'm glad you came to my country.
I'll ask the God's to bless each day of your absence.
What's that?
I'm dreaming now?
Baba!
Must look.
Easy, easy. easy...
That's it, real slow real slow.
When I came to this city I had no-one.
Well my friend - it was you who got Ashoka off their backs.
No, no, no, lay down.
The journey isn't what you expect.
Don't be surprised.
My father said that before I left the village.
Get his pills.
What?
Is my father going to be dead?
Get serious.
Your father's gonna be fine.
Does he need gold?
Yeah, he needs gold.
Is this a gold?
Yeah, that's gold.
Now my sister can get married?
Yeah -- yeah, now your sister can get married.
All because of you.
You should be resting.
God bless you, my child.
Sit.
See -- this grew out of a tiny seed.
You never did belong to me.
You were only lent to me by God.
Until you marry.
And continue the wheel of life.
But you don't like the city --no.
Chomotkar daddah.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.
I would be honoured if you'd come and sit next to my father.
To bless the daughter.
What are they doing?
You have to pour the water in the hand.
That's how the marriage is solemnised.
Well now, junior.
I bet you never thought you'd be giving away a daughter in a Calcutta slum.
Well now, Sister Joan...
I bet you never expected me to say that I'm glad to be here.
I never felt more alive.
So now you're free to go.
No -- now I'm free to stay.
Well now, I just might be able to find something for you to do.
I'm, I'm not promising mind because...
I've a beautiful Frenchman coming in next week and I'm very partial to Frenchmen.
I'm glad you stuck it out.
Max daddah.
Max daddah.
See that group of people, if they need anything... just see, I'll be there.
Go.
Look, your daughter, it's her first night.
You can't --
Oh Jesus!
Please, please this is the time of their happiness.
Please.
Let's go.
No, he's had enough.
You should have had five more daughters.
Your son Manooj -- is a genius.
Okay, remind me that I'll tell you what he told me.
Yeah.
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on...
I want to walk on my own.
Max daddah
Max da.
Is it bad?
Fatal, you mean?
No, it's not fatal, if I can keep you in bed for more than five minutes.
You've done enough, Hasari.
Now you've got to get your strength back.
You know Max baddah...
What?
The Gods haven't made it easy to be a human being.
They sure as hell haven't.
But I guess that's why it feels so
- Yeah!
- All right!
Give me a Jack and a beer back.
All right, out of here.
Come on.
You know the rules.
The elf bar's right down the street by the cop bar.
You Santas stink.
Next Santa that talks down to me is gonna be "Ho, ho, ho-ing" in soprano.
Hey, who left the ornament on the floor?
He's a high little kicker, huh?
- Hey, Bundy.
- Hey, Bundy.
Iskowitz.
Gates.
Braunstein.
- How's it going over at your mall?
- Well, I've been peed on spit on, snotted on drooled on and thrown up on, and now it's Miller time.
Give me a beer.
Here's to the death of Christmas forever.
Who are they?
Street-corner charity Santas.
They think they're better than us.
They're doing it out of goodness.
If you do good for others, you are repaid tenfold.
- Why, you son of a...
- Hey.
Easy, big guy.
It's not your fault.
He goaded you.
It's just this damn Christmas has got me down.
Nobody cares what we want.
Anybody want me?
Well, I was gonna go see Aladdin, but...
Now, there's a guy with Christmas spirit.
You know, nothing makes you feel like a kid again at Christmas like opening a two-pack of hooters.
I'm gonna have a great time with the extra money.
I gotta buy gifts for the family.
I used to have a foolproof system for Christmas.
I invented it in 1974.
Hey, look, is that Daddy?
No.
He won't be anybody's daddy.
Okay, kids, Daddy will be home any second with our Christmas gifts.
He said if we were good, we'd get gifts.
And we've been good.
As far as he knows.
Now, little Bud, what would you like for Christmas?
Playboys, hooters.
Playboys, hooters.
His first words.
How about you, Kelly?
Well, I want peroxide and high heels and a "Dy-no-mite Jimmie JJ Walker" doll.
Playboys.
Hooters.
Munchkin.
Bed wetter.
Oh, now, now...
Honey, it's okay.
Those are the only words he knows.
Like hell.
Now, how about you, little Buck?
What would you like for Christmas?
I want that little chuck wagon to run through the house and put food in my bowl.
I sure hope Daddy hasn't spent all our Christmas money on new brakes for the car.
- Look out.
No brakes.
No brakes.
- Daddy's home.
- Presents.
- Presents.
- Hooters.
- Presents.
Presents.
- Hooters.
Hooters.
Oh, good.
Marriage has yet shrunk me another inch.
There's not much left to spare, honey.
This is the last year I'm working in a shoe store.
A fat woman came into the store today.
Wanted some shoes for a Christmas party.
Told her to stand on her hands, put a star on her butt and go as the world's largest, ugliest tree.
Then she has the nerve to get mad at me because she's fat.
- Daddy?
- What?
I forgot.
Oh, yeah.
Daddy?
What?
I forgot again.
Don't say "what" next time.
- Okay, pumpkin.
- Okay.
Daddy?
Daddy?
Daddy?
What?
Now you made me forget again.
Al, do you wanna see our Christmas lists?
Oh, yeah...
Christmas.
Well, you know, I don't have much money.
What with all that damn dog eats.
But it is Christmas, so have you been good?
- Oh, yes, very good.
Yes.
Well, that's too bad because my present money situation...
Well, I could probably get some, you know, crummy gifts or one of you could get one really nice gift.
You know, the kids really don't like you anymore.
You know, the kids hate you.
It seems like none of you have been very good.
Hooters?
Playboys.
- Playboys?
- Hooters.
Nah, not this year.
Maybe next year.
- If you're good.
- Daddy?
What good is this gonna do, you're just gonna forget.
No, I won't.
Daddy?
What?
It was perfect.
It worked every year, until two weeks ago.
So every year that Daddy has any money at all he gets us to turn on each other.
Then we don't get any presents.
What are we gonna say this year when he tries to get us to snitch on each other?
- Bud was bad.
- Kelly was bad.
- Let's tell on Mom.
- Kids, please.
Come on.
Now, kids...
Now it's happening again.
We're turning on each other already.
That's why this year I have a plan.
For the two weeks before Christmas, we are family.
And who's the enemy?
Daddy!
That's right.
Now, what do we want for Christmas?
- A CD player.
- Toys.
A new watch.
Playboys, hooters.
Playboys, hooters.
Look out.
No brakes.
No brakes.
Daddy's home.
This is the last year I work at the shoe store.
A fat woman came in the store today said she wanted some shoes for a Christmas party.
Told her to stand on her hands, put a star on her butt and go as the world's largest, ugliest tree.
Daddy, you told us that one already.
It happened 18 years ago.
No, it didn't, it happened today.
I think.
Oh, my God.
I'm telling the same stories over and over again like...
Like Shelley Winters on The Tonight Show.
I've gotta get out of the shoe business.
Yeah, Dad.
Senile around with someone who cares.
We got our Christmas lists ready.
Oh, Christmas.
Well, you know, I don't have too much money.
Well, I could probably get a bunch of crummy gifts for you or one of you could have one really nice gift.
Oh, a united Bundy front, eh?
Well, I've got bad news for you.
You can't outsmart Daddy because I'm broke.
Rather than see your disappointed faces on Christmas morning Daddy will be at the nudie bar.
Now who wants to get old Dad a beer?
Honey, you'll have plenty of money for gifts this Christmas.
We're gonna help you out.
We all got jobs.
You all got jobs?
Oh, man, you guys are the greatest.
You got jobs?
Well, what kind of jobs did you get for yourselves?
No.
Not for us.
For you.
- Let's tell him, kids.
- Okay.
With twelve days till Christmas Your family got for you
- Twelve days fruit picking
- Eleven, off-ramp selling
- Ten, toilets cleaning
- Nine, digging graves
- Eight, snaking sewers
- Seven, spearing rats
- Six, training guard dogs
- Five, giving blood
- Four, crash-test dummying
- Three jobs roach killing
- Two jobs dog catching
- And one job Santa-ing at the mall
Merry Christmas, Daddy.
No, no, no.
Get him off of me.
Get him off of me.
What's he want a pony for anyway, to put between two slices of bread?
Next.
What do you want for Christmas, little boy?
Well, I want an end to pollution.
Let's start here.
Always remember that Santa hates you.
Yeah?
What's he gonna do?
Make me a shoe salesman?
Next.
What would you like for Christmas, little girl?
A husband to yell at and torture.
Well, I'm sure you'll get one.
What would you like for Christmas?
A cure for the measles.
Next.
Hi, Santa.
Did one of your reindeer make a no-no?
I'm sorry.
That must be the Ghost of Foot Fungus Past.
You don't have to tell Santa what you want for Christmas.
You want a pair of breasts.
Just like a grown-up woman.
But Santa says, "Be happy with what you've got.
The body of a young boy."
Here, little girl, have a candy cane.
You giving out replicas now, Al?
Well, in that case...
Marcie?
I'm sorry, young fella.
Marcie?
Sorry.
Thought you were my wife.
Excuse me, son.
Hey, Marcie.
Good, I've been looking all over for you.
I found a store that carries that pump-up bra you wanted.
Now you can pump them up to be any size you want and you won't have to take Al's insults any more.
And the only one who will know they're not real is you.
And me.
And me.
Look, Marcie, it's Al.
Oh, God.
I'm glad I didn't say anything that would embarrass me.
Oh, hey.
I won't say nothing.
But I'd build her arms up first.
From what I can see she needs to do a lot of pumping.
Hey, move the little boy.
Yeah, we're waiting.
Hey, kids.
Santa gives us so much what say we give him something back?
Yeah!
And a-one, and a-two, and:
Bundy the no man
He's as bald as he can be
With hair in his nose And rot on his toes
He's as bald as he can be
Just the boys.
Bundy the no man
- Just the girls.
- He's as bald as he can be
- Everyone.
- He's entered old age
Making minimum wage
He's as bald as he can be
And around.
Bundy the
- No man
- Bundy the
- No man
- Bundy the
- No man
- Bundy the
- No man
- Bundy the
Bundy...
So I did the 12 jobs in 12 days.
The worst was the crummy Santa gig.
I had so many knees in my groin, I thought I was in bed with the wife.
You better give me one more for the road and then I'm...
I'm off to buy presents.
I'd get you for my son, Bud but he wouldn't know what to do with you.
"Bud."
"Peg."
"Seven."
"Kelly."
Ah, now, Buck, boy...
I forgot all about you.
Ah, but you're just a dumb little dog.
You probably don't even know it's Christmas.
That's okay.
I have a little something for you.
It's called pee, and it'll be waiting in your slippers.
Yes, sirree, boy.
It's gonna be one fine Christmas.
I told you I smelled Daddy.
- Presents, you guys, we got presents.
- Presents!
- Presents!
- Look.
Look.
Look.
It's me.
Kelly.
It's me.
Oh, Al.
You got me the watch I always wanted.
Daddy, a CD player, and my first CD.
"Herman's Hermits."
"I Am Henry the V-I-I-I One Am."
Kel, that's, "I'm Henry VIII, I Am."
Now, how could you possibly get that from that bunch of letters?
Oh, Dad...
A "Build Your Own Hooters" kit.
With the lifelike plastic.
"Build them, look at them feel them, trade them with your friends.
Or put them on and just scare your mother."
God, did I need these.
Look, Mom.
Hooters!
Hooters!
Yes, they're very cute, dear.
Here.
All right.
Now, who's the best daddy in the world?
Daddy!
Then it was all worth it.
It was all worth it.
It was all worth it.
Wake up, buddy.
It's closing time.
I was dreaming.
I gave my son breasts.
That's a very cool dream, sir.
Well how much I owe you?
- Nothing.
You already paid.
For everybody.
You were unconscious, but I felt you wanted to pay.
You being Santa and all.
And now, "Ray" can we talk?
Where's Daddy with our presents?
Look out.
No brakes.
No brakes.
You know, he hit pretty hard.
I hope nothing happened to our presents.
- Oh, presents.
- Presents?
Presents.
Here's Santa with your presents.
Let's see, now.
What do we got here?
Bud.
Son.
This is for you.
- "Ray's Bar"?
- Just take it and go away.
Now, let's see.
Seven.
Here.
Your very first beer steins.
Wow, much cooler than a bike.
- All right.
Now, pumpkin.
- Is this for me?
Is this for me?
What do we have in here for you?
Here you are, sweetie pie.
Now, there you go.
Now, sweetheart, you never have to learn how to read.
Even comes with its own wall.
Cool.
Best of all, it's a Ray's.
Ah, now, Buck, boy, I forgot about you.
But you're just a dumb dog.
You probably don't even know it's Christmas.
And you don't know about the dead bird I left in your jacket.
Peg.
Try as I might, I couldn't forget about you.
Oh, Al...
I can't believe it.
But, honey, it says "Ray."
Well, sure, honey.
That's because you're my little ray of sunshine.
Oh, Al.
Oh, Ray.
- Yeah!
- All right!
Give me a Jack and a beer back.
All right, out of here.
Come on.
You know the rules.

It happened 18 years ago.
No, it didn't, it happened today.
I think.
Oh, my God.
I'm telling the same stories over and over again like-
Like Shelley Winters on The Tonight Show.
I've gotta get out of the shoe business.
Yeah, Dad.
Senile around with someone who cares.
We got our Christmas lists ready.
Oh, Christmas.
Well, you know, I don't have too much money.
Well, I could probably get a bunch of crummy gifts for you or one of you could have one really nice gift.
Oh, a united Bundy front, eh?
Well, I've got bad news for you.
You can't outsmart Daddy because I'm broke.
Rather than see your disappointed faces on Christmas morning Daddy will be at the nudie bar.
Now who wants to get old Dad a beer?
Honey, you'll have plenty of money for gifts this Christmas.
We're gonna help you out.
We all got jobs.
You all got jobs?
Oh, man, you guys are the greatest.
You got jobs?
Well, what kind of jobs did you get for yourselves?
No.
Not for us.
For you.
- Let's tell him, kids.
- Okay.
With twelve days till Christmas Your family got for you
- Twelve days fruit picking
- Eleven, off-ramp selling
- Ten, toilets cleaning
- Nine, digging graves
- Eight, snaking sewers
- Seven, spearing rats
- Six, training guard dogs
- Five, giving blood
- Four, crash-test dummying
- Three jobs roach killing
- Two jobs dog catching
- And one job Santa-ing at the mall
Merry Christmas, Daddy.
No, no, no.
Get him off of me.
Get him off of me.
What's he want a pony for anyway, to put between two slices of bread?
Next.
What do you want for Christmas, little boy?
Well, I want an end to pollution.
Let's start here.
Always remember that Santa hates you.
Yeah?
What's he gonna do?
Make me a shoe salesman?
Next.
What would you like for Christmas, little girl?
A husband to yell at and torture.
Well, I'm sure you'll get one.
What would you like for Christmas?
A cure for the measles.
Next.
Hi, Santa.
Did one of your reindeer make a no-no?
I'm sorry.
That must be the Ghost of Foot Fungus Past.
You don't have to tell Santa what you want for Christmas.
You want a pair of breasts.
Just like a grown-up woman.
But Santa says, " Be happy with what you've got.
The body of a young boy. "
Here, little girl, have a candy cane.
You giving out replicas now, Al?
Well, in that case...
Marcie?
I'm sorry, young fella.
Marcie?
Sorry.
Thought you were my wife.
Excuse me, son.
Hey, Marcie.
Good, I've been looking all over for you.
I found a store that carries that pump-up bra you wanted.
Now you can pump them up to be any size you want and you won't have to take Al's insults any more.
And the only one who will know they're not real is you.
And me.
And me.
Look, Marcie, it's Al.
Oh, God.
I'm glad I didn't say anything that would embarrass me.
Oh, hey.
I won't say nothing.
But I'd build her arms up first.
From what I can see she needs to do a lot of pumping.
Hey, move the little boy.
Yeah, we're waiting.
Hey, kids.
Santa gives us so much what say we give him something back?
Yeah!
And a-one, and a-two, and:
Bundy the no man
He's as bald as he can be
With hair in his nose And rot on his toes
He's as bald as he can be
Just the boys.
Bundy the no man
- Just the girls.
- He's as bald as he can be
- Everyone.
- He's entered old age
Making minimum wage
He's as bald as he can be
And around.
Bundy the
- No man
- Bundy the
- No man
- Bundy the
- No man
- Bundy the
- No man
- Bundy the
Bundy...
So I did the 12 jobs in 12 days.
The worst was the crummy Santa gig.
I had so many knees in my groin, I thought I was in bed with the wife.
You better give me one more for the road and then I'm...
I'm off to buy presents.
I'd get you for my son, Bud but he wouldn't know what to do with you.
" Bud. "
" Peg. "
"Seven. "
" Kelly. "
Ah, now, Buck, boy...
I forgot all about you.
Ah, but you're just a dumb little dog.
You probably don't even know it's Christmas.
That's okay.
I have a little something for you.
It's called pee, and it'll be waiting in your slippers.
Yes, sirree, boy.
It's gonna be one fine Christmas.
I told you I smelled Daddy.
- Presents, you guys, we got presents.
- Presents!
- Presents!
- Look.
Look.
Look.
It's me.
Kelly.
It's me.
Oh, Al.
You got me the watch I always wanted.
Daddy, a CD player, and my first CD.
" Herman's Hermits. "
" I Am Henry the V-I-I-I One Am. "
Kel, that's, " I'm Henry Vlll, I Am. "
Now, how could you possibly get that from that bunch of letters?
Oh, Dad...
A " Build Your Own Hooters" kit.
With the lifelike plastic.
" Build them, look at them feel them, trade them with your friends.
Or put them on and just scare your mother. "
God, did I need these.
Look, Mom.
Hooters!
Hooters!
Yes, they're very cute, dear.
Here.
All right.
Now, who's the best daddy in the world?
Daddy!
Then it was all worth it.
It was all worth it.
It was all worth it.
Wake up, buddy.
It's closing time.
I was dreaming.
I gave my son breasts.
That's a very cool dream, sir.
Well...
- ... how much I owe you?
- Nothing.
You already paid.
For everybody.
You were unconscious, but I felt you wanted to pay.
You being Santa and all.
And now, " Ray" can we talk?
Where's Daddy with our presents?
Look out.
No brakes.
No brakes.
You know, he hit pretty hard.
I hope nothing happened to our presents.
- Oh, presents.
- Presents?
Presents.
Here's Santa with your presents.
Let's see, now.
What do we got here?
Bud.
Son.
This is for you.
- " Ray's Bar"?
- Just take it and go away.
Now, let's see.
Seven.
Here.
Your very first beer steins.
Wow, much cooler than a bike.
- All right.
Now, pumpkin.
- Is this for me?
Is this for me?
What do we have in here for you?
Here you are, sweetie pie.
Now, there you go.
Now, sweetheart, you never have to learn how to read.
Even comes with its own wall.
Cool.
Best of all, it's a Ray's.
Ah, now, Buck, boy, I forgot about you.
But you're just a dumb dog.
You probably don't even know it's Christmas.
And you don't know about the dead bird I left in your jack et.
Peg.
Try as I might, I couldn't forget about you.
Oh, Al...
I can't believe it.
But, honey, it says " Ray. "
Well, sure, honey.
That's because you're my little ray of sunshine.
Oh, Al.
Oh, Ray.

APRIL:
This is April O'Neil, your Channel 6 News European correspondent, coming to you from the famous Gare de Lyon in Paris, France.
Today we take you back to an era of elegance on a special run of the original Orient Express.
Behind a real steam locomotive, we will ride in old-fashioned luxury from Paris to Istanbul.
What's the big deal about a train?
She could fly there faster.
The point of a journey is not only the destination, my student.
As in, "Getting there is half the fun."
Well, maybe so, Master Splinter, but this is one turtle who likes speed.
Hi, guys.
Taking the train?
No, thanks.
I've got one at home.
Watch yourself, April.
In every old flick I've ever seen, the Orient Express is full of spies and intrigue.
[♪♪♪]
IRMA:
Ooh, look at him.
I'm intrigued already.
Rocksteady.
Bebop.
Where are you?
ROCKSTEADY:
In here, boss.
BEBOP:
Ugh.
Can we get out now?
It's stuffy.
All right.
The coast is clear.
My achin' back.
Mm.
You gotta buy larger luggage if we're gonna do much of this traveling, boss.
The only reason I brought you two lunkheads along was to carry this.
[BEEPING]
Ooh, pretty.
Is it a VCR?
No, you jerk.
It's a cellular phone.
This is Krang's fusion supercharger.
It will make this train go faster than any jet.
We will get off the train when I activate the supercharger here, in Bucharest, Romania.
From there, the train will accelerate to escape velocity, launch itself over the Straits of Bosphorus, and crash into Earth's biggest oil fields, causing incredible chaos and destruction.
[SNORTS] Ooh, can we watch?
The explosion will release enough energy to open a dimensional warp.
Krang will then bring the Technodrome to Earth.
What do we do, boss?
You will make sure there is no one on this train to stand in our way.
Are we all set, Bela?
All set, Fritz.
Well, let's go.
CONDUCTOR 1:
All aboard!
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
All except you.
[CONDUCTORS EXCLAIMING]
But first we need to borrow your uniforms.
[BOTH GRUNT]
What is going on?
You are going off.
[ENGINEER EXCLAIMING]
I've always loved playing with trains.
Oh, finally I get a relaxing assignment.
Of course, it's only what I deserve.
[ENGINE CHUGS] Oh!
[ENGINE CHUGGING]
[TSKING]
Oh, such a sloppy commoner.
[WHIMPERS]
Why me?
Turtles, look.
That's the engineer and the conductors.
I sense Shredder's hand in this.
Oh, no.
If Shredder's on the train--
Then April and Irma are in trouble.
Come on, turtles.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
Now what?
[PANTS] There's our ride.
A sidecar?
[♪♪♪]
The train...
[PANTS] ...is getting further away.
This looks like a good time to test my new long-range magnet.
It's working.
Can't we get any closer?
Uh, no.
It's a long-range magnet.
Do not worry.
We will board the train in Munich.
[♪♪♪]
Here's the supercharger, boss.
How fast will it make the train go?
About 800 miles an hour.
Well, gee, is it legal to go that fast?
If it were legal, we wouldn't be doing it.
Now, get back to the passenger section and collect tickets.
Ooh, look.
We're coming to a city.
SHREDDER:
That's Munich.
If I don't stop, it will arouse suspicion.
[BRAKES SCREECHING]
Oh.
Oh, I hate pea soup.
I could spill some chicken soup.
I feel ridiculous in these outfits.
You should see how you look.
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]
[PLAYING LIVELY FOLK MELODY]
Well, it's got a good beat, and you can dance to it.
Please, stop.
Do you have a request?
Ja.
Do not play ever again.
Hmm.
Not a bad gig.
We're supposed to be looking for Shredder, remember?
Yeah, but if we don't find him, we've got great careers as musicians.
[PLAYING LIVELY FOLK MELODY]
Ew, I hate oompah bands.
[GRUNTS]
There.
Music calms the savage beast, you know.
Uh, these guys ain't musicians.
I know.
I heard 'em play.
The turtles.
Turtles, fight with honor.
[GRUNTS]
Okay.
Fight with honor.
But watch your elbow, huh?
[GRUNTS]
Whoa.
[SCREAMS]
A green monster.
Well, uh, actually, I'm very nice, once you get to know me.
Ooh.
Try this tune, shellback.
Yeah.
Whoa.
I can tell you're no music lover.
[EXCLAIMS]
[GRUNTS]
I knew I should have taken up the piccolo.
[INSTRUMENT CLATTERS] Oh!
[BODY THUDS]
Is it too late to move this fight outdoors?
BEBOP:
Anything you say.
TURTLES:
Whoa!
TURTLES:
Ah!
I knew we should have taken the plane.
MICHELANGELO:
Well, we're flying now, dude.
[TURTLES YELLING]
Climb aboard, dudes.
Everybody, hang 10.
Or however many you've got.
We're heading for the autobahn.
Do we have a license for this sousaphone?
Hang on, my students.
[HORNS HONKING]
Don't be a road hog, dude.
Sousaphones have the right of way.
[GROANS]
My ears are popping.
Chewing gum always helps.
Look, below us.
The river Danube.
Oh, good.
I always like to know where I'm about to drown.
♪ La-dum, da-dum, da-dum ♪
Irma, I've been looking all over the train for you.
I love Austria.
I was just thinking how lovely it would be to go drifting down the beautiful blue Danube.
[GAGGING]
Michelangelo.
[GAGGING]
Blow your bubblegum into the horn.
It's working.
The bubble is keeping us afloat.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
We'll catch up.
The train stops in Vienna.
Yeah, but does the sousaphone?
Totally bogus, dudes.
The train isn't stopping.
Next stop on the Orient Express is Budapest, Hungary.
We've gotta get there as fast as possible.
Fast, huh?
Oh, I think I still have my air-propulsion unit in here.
Let's see if it works.
[TURTLES EXCLAIMING]
We got them turtles good, boss.
Uh, yeah.
We tossed 'em right off the train.
For once, you did something right.
Uh-uh.
That was the second time we did something right.
No, you dummy.
That was the third time.
IRMA:
April, is this trip necessary?
Shut up.
Someone is coming.
Steady, Irma.
We're almost there.
Hide under here, next to the supercharger.
I'm April O'Neil,
Channel 6 News from the United States.
Do you mind if we interview you?
Uh, some other time.
Go away.
We'd like to know why you didn't stop in Vienna.
[WHISPERS] I'd recognize those ugly legs anywhere.
Bebop and Rocksteady?
Ha, ha.
That's all right.
I-I can see you're busy.
Come on, Irma.
Oh, let me just get a nice shot of the two of you.
BEBOP:
Ow.
That was my stomach.
[SCREAMS]
Mutants.
Seize them.
[SNORTS]
Gotcha.
Ugh.
Let go of me, you big, ugly, bug-ridden, half-witted creep.
Aw, I ain't no creep.
Welcome, Miss O'Neil.
You and your friend are just in time to see me turn the Orient Express into the first intercontinental ballistic train.
Tie them up.
We'll put 'em in this mailbag.
Do you girls like going first class?
What does a no-class like you care?
Put them in the baggage car.
That way, you'll be able to watch the front of the train crash an instant before you do.
[LAUGHING]
[GRUNTING]
[LAUGHS, SNORTS]
Like they say, the chick's in the mail.
[♪♪♪]
[SIGHS] We have reached Budapest ahead of the train.
It will not come through for another hour.
We need a way to force the train to stop.
[SNIFFING]
Ah.
I smell food.
And I've got major munchies.
[PLAYING GYPSY TUNE]
[SNIFFS]
It smells like Hungarian goulash.
Bodacious.
A new pizza topping.
Hey, gypsy dudes, how'd you like to go halfsies on a goulash pizza?
I'll make the dough.
[ALL SCREAMING]
Wait.
We're the famous Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Guess they don't watch much television.
So much for fame.
Hmm.
Maybe we can borrow this wagon.
[TRAIN APPROACHING]
[♪♪♪]
I can't sleep, conductor.
Give me one of those pillows, would you?
I'll put you to sleep, chum.
Oh!
That's a great cure for insomnia you got there, Rocksteady.
Maybe I ought to patent it.
Does the man have no shame?
[SUPERCHARGER BEEPING]
There.
We'll get off the train in Bucharest, and this train will blast off.
[LAUGHING]
Those passengers flying to the Middle East won't have to worry about missing their plane.
[APRIL IRMA GRUNTING]
Try to get free, Irma.
We've got to warn everyone.
Oh.
I'd love to get out of this.
The style just doesn't suit me.
[CHUCKLES]
I knew you wouldn't mind my joining you.
Isn't it nice to find members of one's own class?
I wouldn't know.
We have not found any yet.
[CHUCKLES] Boy, Hungary sure makes me hungry.
[LAUGHING]
Boss, look.
SHREDDER:
Get that wagon off the tracks.
[BRAKES SCREECHING]
Well, at least you won't have to buy breakfast.
[LAUGHING]
Now, who'd be dumb enough to park on railroad tracks?
We would.
Well, I mean, besides us.
Those gypsies may have boarded the train.
Find them.
Right, boss.
[PASSENGERS EXCLAIMING]
Hey, let's see your ticket.
[ROMANY ACCENT] Let Madame Zora read your palm and tell your future, my son.
Uh, gee.
What do you see?
I see two women in your future.
[LAUGHS, SNORTS]
O'Neil and that Irma dame.
They ain't in my future.
They're in the baggage car.
That's all we wanted to know.
Ooh, the turtles.
Get 'em.
[♪♪♪]
I will see to Shredder, my students.
Huh.
Look at that big chicken.
They're running away from us.
I told you that assertiveness training would pay off.
[BEBOP ROCKSTEADY EXCLAIMING]
SPLINTER:
You have only engineered your own defeat, Shredder.
Trust you to have a corny line like that, Splinter.
Besides, you're too late.
[SHREDDER EXCLAIMS]
No.
[GRUNTS]
Too slippery.
Can't hold on.
[♪♪♪]
[FEET POUNDING]
There you are.
Oh, thank goodness.
Shredder has attached a device to the locomotive that'll turn this train into a missile.
Master Splinter is taking care of Shredder.
Uh-huh.
But who's taking care of Master Splinter?
Master Splinter's in trouble.
Come on, dudes.
[GASPS]
It is slipping.
Must hold on.
N-no use.
[GRUNTS] Hang on, sensei.
We've got you.
[GROANS]
[PANTS] Thank you, my students.
BEBOP:
Uh, we would have thrown the turtles off the train, boss.
ROCKSTEADY:
Yeah, but they beat us to it and threw us off.
We must catch the train before they wreck the supercharger.
Find transportation.
You expect me to ride a bicycle?
Aw, gee, boss.
It was all we could find.
This is so humiliating.
Don't catch your cape in the spokes, boss.
[SUPERCHARGER WHIRRING]
Ah, this is a piece of cake.
I'll just attach the power cable, and-
- Yah!
[BODY THUDS] Ooh.
On the other hand, maybe this won't be so easy.
What happens if you can't disconnect it?
Well, when we pass through Bucharest, Romania, this train becomes airborne.
Huh.
We didn't need to take the plane after all.
We had better warn the passengers.
I'll tell April and Irma.
And that means we'll have to jump off the train before it speeds up.
Jump off the train?
You're out of your mind.
Don't listen to her.
She just wants a big news item to report.
I'm going to relax on this trip if it kills me.
I've got it.
Shredder forgot one important thing about trains.
They also go backwards.
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]
When the train comes by, we jump.
Uh, jump where?
Onto the train, you dim bulb.
Ready?
Now.
[ALL EXCLAIMING]
You're too slow, turtle.
LEONARDO:
Let's see how Donatello is doing.
It's those darn mutants again.
Can't they take a hint?
Bummer.
Shred-Head's got Donatello.
Huh.
We got them turtles now.
Uh-oh.
I got a feeling we're passing through Bucharest.
[BEEPS]
[ALL EXCLAIMING]
[WHEELS SCREECHING]
[PASSENGERS EXCLAIMING]
[GRUNTS]
[GRUNTS]
Master Splinter.
I will try to reach the locomotive from under here.
Keep Shredder busy.
All right.
[GRUNTS]
Whoa.
Strike one.
Try again.
Oh, yeah?
Well, strike two and you're out, shellback.
Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.
Come and get us.
Don't you ever learn?
You fell for that last time.
Well, yeah.
Right off the train.
Just keep the turtles from reaching the locomotive before it reaches liftoff velocity.
Right, boss.
They'll never get out of that door now.
[♪♪♪]
True, but we don't need a door.
Get them.
You turtles have already lost.
Well, then how come you're trying so hard to stop us?
Where is Splinter?
He's going for the supercharger.
[BEEPING]
Yee-haw.
Get along, little dogie.
[GRUNTS]
Oh, yeah?
Gee, I wish I'd said that.
Oh, we're speeding up.
We're already in Bulgaria.
In a minute, you'll be in space.
[CACKLES, SNORTS]
Oh!
[ALL GRUNT]
[YELPING]
Oh, well.
I can always catch a later train.
[ALL EXCLAIMING]
This is not my idea of luxury.
Ha, ha.
On the other hand, my dear baron, you look stunning in ham gravy.
[BEEPS] [TRAIN CHUGS]
[BEEPING]
[GRUNTS]
[YELLING]
[ALL GRUNT]
[WHEELS SCREECHING]
I will finish you once and for all, old man.
[YELLS]
We have about 10 seconds before this thing takes off.
Sensei, put it in reverse.
LEONARDO:
He can't hear you.
Aw, we must have broken the sound barrier.
Watch out for the sonic boom!
Reverse, master!
Ah, I see.
Reverse.
[PULSING]
Well, without the train for ballast, that supercharger was thrown into space.
It's gone.
Did you enjoy the train trip, Master Splinter?
Indeed.
Although I think that the idea of train travel as relaxing is a bit old-fashioned.
[♪♪♪]
Ah, great.
While we were out saving your lives, you guys were having a food fight.
Come back here.
Food fight?
You are hamburger.
I was just kidding.

In autumn that year, a research trip for my novel... took me to Shiretoko Peninsula, the easternmost tip of Hokkaido.
Can you see...
That's Kunashiri Island.
- Oh, that's it.
The media's making a fuss over its occupation... but it's quiet here.
- Yes.
I don't know this area, so I appreciate your guiding me.
Not at all.
I've been a fan of your novels for some time.
I've always wanted to meet you.
- Thank you.
This is a great opportunity.
- Thank you.
Where are we going today?
We'll go to Point Pekin, to see the luninous moss.
Luminous moss?
So, this road was built after the last war?
That's right.
Only small boats could go this far.
This is a National Treasure.
Until the last war, the sea came up to here.
Is that so?
Until 5,000 years ago, in the mid-Jomon Period... many people lived here.
The luninous moss... grows inside this cave... but I can't see any.
Can you?
- No...
I can't.
That's strange.
There I see it...
I see it.
Where is it?
You can see it from this angle.
Yes, only from a certain angle.
I can see the illumination... if I don't look straight at it.
Thank you.
It really is quiet here.
Perhaps it's the season.
Now is the quietest time of the year.
But winter's very severe here...
The drift ice used to cut off access to that cave.
There was a strange atmosphere in that cave.
It's not that the moss emits light... but rather, the moss itself becomes the light.
Instead of emitting light... it's as if it drew the light into itself.
I've never seen a cave like that.
As a matter of fact...
I always wanted to take you there.
Why was that?
This... is a history of Rausu.
It includes a summary of an incident...
I'd like you to look it over.
It occurred on the morning of December 3rd, 1943.
A fleet of six ships from the Merchant Marine... left Nemuro for the port of Otaru.
But then...
while the fleet was passing Rausu... they ran into a blizzard.
But, determined to accomplish their mission... they decided to continue their journey to Cape Shiretoko.
But as it happened...
one ship, the Seishin Maru V... suddenly experienced engine trouble... and so... off Point Pekin...
was wrecked on the rocks.
One of the crewmen, tying a rope around himself... jumped into the sea and swam to Tengu Rock.
And so... the Captain and the rest of the crew also made it to shore.
Of course, I have no idea... how they managed to survive in that cave for the next three months.
The only crewman who made it back to Rausu... was the Captain of the ship.
He left the cave and crossed over the drift ice.
He said he gambled his life on it.
Amazing guy, eh?
Really was!
And so...
21 kilometres north of Rausu... he struggled into the village of Rusha.
As it was during the war... the Captain was considered a hero... so the whole village was told about it.
Our heroic Captain!
You had a courageous and narrow escape... from the freezing battlefield of the northern sea.
We, the pupils of Rausu National School... praise your heroic deed, and are inspired... to work harder for our country... and for the sake of His Majesty the Emperor.
The Merchant Marine sent out a search party.
But the bad weather... made it very difficult, no?
They only managed to recover three bodies from the sea, and then... they had to call off the search.
But then... in the summer that year...
The Captain openly admitted... that they were the bones of a crewman called Nishikawa.
So, of the seven men, only you and Nishikawa got to the cave.
Is that correct?
And... how did you survive...
once you made it to the cave?
I suspect... that the Captain lied to the police.
Ah... why's that?
- There's one thing... although he said they survived by catching seals for food... from December to February, there are no seals in this area.
One more thing...
I suspect that the Captain killed Nishikawa to eat him.
Unless one sees it that way...
it doesn't make sense.
I can see that.
By the way, what made you decide to tell me this story?
Actually, I wrote this history of the Rausu incident... on my return from a P.O.W camp in Siberia.
As my research into the incident continued...
I became rather perplexed.
- Perplexed?
Because of my experience in Siberia...
I began to empathise with the Captain.
Where were you in Siberia?
I felled trees for three years near Talshet.
Please.
I'm sorry.
I became... facinated by the headmaster's pursuit of the story... over so many years.
It seemed as if... the Captain's spirit from over 40 years ago... had possessed the headmaster.
And now that same spirit... was speaking to me through the headmaster.
What did happen to the crew that drifted ashore... in the cave on Point Pekin?
What were the Captain's thoughts in that cave... and what did he do?
I pondered these questions as the night slipped away.
Hey!
Take off all your clothes, or you'll freeze to death.
Hurry up!
Courage, Gosuke!
Gosuke!
Keep up your spirit!
We're... here near point Pekin.
Rausu...
is 40 kilometres away.
We can't possibly walk all the way there.
I wonder... if we're the only ones suffering this fate.
After all, there were six ships...
Ours couldn't have been the only one wrecked.
If we're the only ones who ended up like this... that'd be too unfair, eh?
Perhaps... we are the only ones.
In that case... it's hopeless.
It's hopeless in any case.
- Right.
We're hungry in any case.
Yes.
We're hungry in any case.
Nishikawa... you're working hard.
Hey, Nishikawa.
- Nishikawa...
Making a harpoon head with seal bones is a very clever idea.
But... what do you mean to catch with that?
Seals and fish don't come anywhere near the beach.
I'm dizzy from hunger without doing anything.
How can you do such fine work, knowing it's all useless?
Nishikawa!
Hurry up and finish the harpoon... and feed me a whale!
- Leave him alone.
Whatever we do, there's no way we can survive.
- Right.
Without food... people die.
It's always like that.
- Stop that!
It's no use complaining.
Look at our Captain... he never complains.
Don't forget...
we're on a military mission.
Listen...
Don't forget our... sworn duty.
Yeah... duty to the army...
Why don't you live up to it?
!
See how you can fulfil your duty?
!
- Hey, Nishikawa...
You sound gallant for someone wobbly on his legs.
I want to persevere in the sacred war.
I would always persevere...
if only I could.
Yeah... you talk like our fleet Commander.
All the same, Nishikawa...
Even if the Commander were here... or even the General, what could they do?
We don't belong to the Commander... we belong to the Emperor himself!
The Emperor... what about him?
Wouldn't he feel hunger when he's starving?
Bring the Emperor to this cave, if you can.
Gosuke...
Don't be so cruel.
What would you do with him?
Bring him here...
and keep him here 10 or 20 days.
Bastard!
Hey, stop that.
If you don't stop, you'll both die.
I don't think Gosuke or I... did anything to upset Nishikawa so much.
We're only saying...
we'll get hungry if we don't eat.
That upset him.
- Then what can I say?
Even if there's nothing to eat...
you have to say we won't starve or die,
I don't like lying.
It's painful to lie all the time.
Well... what can I talk about?
Have you eaten a dish that the ainu cook?
It's called fuibe.
Fuibe...
They cut open a seal... remove the guts... stomach...
liver...
lungs... everything.
Then chop them up very fine...
- Idiot!
and then... put them in a pot.
The whiskers... the brains too... and stir the pot.
Eat this, Gosuke.
Eat it.
It's yummy.
Eat!
There's nothing in the world so tastey.
That's right.
There's nothing so yummy.
- Nishikawa, eat up.
Nishikawa, stop sulking and eat.
It's good!
Gosuke...
What's wrong?
Your stomach hurting?
- Be strong!
Is the pain really bad?
Hey... you can't die on us... no way!
Something's wrong with him.
Is he all right?
- Don't worry...
Serves him right for drinking sea water.
He won't die.
I won't die yet.
That's what I just said.
You won't die yet.
Then, when am I going to die?
How would I know that?
But... you won't die yet.
Not today.
Will I die tomorrow?
- Gosuke... when you die, we'll all die.
Be strong and endure the pain.
Nishikawa's right...
You're... not the only one...
who's going to die.
I don't want to die!
Right.
If we die in a place like this...
it'd be a waste.
I don't want to die in war, either!
Don't worry, Gosuke... in this place...
we're safe from the war.
There's no enemy around here to kill us... is there?
I don't... want to die with you, either.
Then... we don't have to die together.
We'll die separately.
We'll die one by one.
Perhaps you're right...
Who's going to die first?
You...
Why don't you speak?
I know why!
I'll be the first!
I... don't want to be the first to die.
I don't want to die first.
- Do you know why?
- Gosuke!
I don't want to hear about your reasons.
Nishikawa.
Let's try the shack again.
We might find something else.
They found a fisherman's shack the night they got ashore.
The fishermen stayed in the shack... and collected sea-urchins in spring and kelp in the summer.
But in winter the shack was left empty.
If there hadn't been a box of matches on the altar... they'd have frozen to death at once.
There's something here.
Wait.
Good.
Kelp!
Nishikawa...
What're you doing?
Nothing else?
Hachizo?
Hachizo, are you there?
I'm here, Gosuke.
Calm down and sleep.
If you sleep... you'll feel better.
Hachizo...
The reason...
why I don't want to die... is because...
I don't want my body to be eaten.
What?
Eat you?
!
You mean me... eat you?
Damn it!
We aren't bears or wolves.
Stop thinking such revolting things.
Will you... promise you won't eat me when I die?
I promise.
We're from the same village... and we were on the same boat.
How could I eat you?
Would you eat... someone who wasn't from the same village or boat?
Stop that talk.
I don't want to hear about such things.
Gosuke...
I'm... just going to the beach.
Wait there.
You won't do anything rash... will you?
Hachizo!
Wait for me...
Take me to the beach, too.
This is it... the drift ice has come.
Until the ice disappears, we're stuck here.
If we try to move...
we'll die.
What shall we do?
Do you still refuse?
If you refuse, you'll be... branded a coward.
No...
I'm not a coward.
But...
I won't eat human flesh.
To eat human flesh... is shameful.
- Why?
Why is it shameful?
Well, if you refuse that's fine.
I don't intend to order you to eat it.
I'm only... saying this to you because I don't want you to die.
Captain...
I don't mind dying.
- I understand you perfectly well.
But... if we just let time pass, we'll die for nothing.
Nishikawa... don't you want to die...
a hero at war... and be decorated for bravery?
You haven't forgotten our duty as mariners?
I haven't forgotten.
Then how could you starve to death... without ever going aboard and working for the nation again?
Even a lazy man or a coward could do that.
Once you eat human flesh, you won't be a normal man.
That's what you're afraid of.
You're scared of people saying you survived on human flesh.
So you're talking about that.
We should hurry and put his body into the sea.
Hachizo, aren't you shocked to hear such talk?
I'd like to be shocked...
but I can't be.
I can't understand why I'm not shocked... but I'm not.
- Then... were you thinking of eating him too?
It's not that I was thinking about it...
It's just...
the thought came into my mind.
I'm ashamed the thought came into my mind.
Once it did come, it wouldn't go away.
Let's put his body into the sea.
I won't allow that.
Shouldn't we perform a service for him?
We can perform a service anytime.
I wonder if I've heard of... a service where they eat the body.
Let us all think hard about it... before committing him to the sea.
If we think about it... we can't help going back to it.
All we think about is food... yet the only food we have is Gosuke.
Are you... really against eating Gosuke's flesh?
I really... don't want to eat Gosuke.
But...
I sometimes feel like... eating all the flesh over there.
Captain, let's put him in the sea.
I can't allow that.
I'm your Captain...
I'm saying this for your sake.
We're not cannibals.
We are decent Japanese men.
Of course... it's natural that we don't want to eat the flesh of our own kind.
So why don't we try...
just try and see... how long we can keep our human feelings?
Let's wait and see how long we can stick to it.
No.
It won't help to wait.
All right...
let's wait two days.
After two days, we'll put Gosuke in the sea.
If we wait for two days... we won't be able to move.
Then let's just wait one day... until tomorrow night.
Hey, I remembered something... we should bring the timber we pulled down in the shack.
We won't be able to move ourselves pretty soon.
Let's go.
Nishikawa.
Come here.
Strip off his clothes.
Are we having a feast tonight?
Dad's going to Otaru tomorrow.
Otaru... dad's going.
We're carrying army supplies to Otaru.
The sea'll be rough tomorrow.
Don't worry, Grandpa.
Yasutaka.
Stop crying.
Your daddy will come back soon.
Come here and eat your meal.
Hey... give me some light.
It's very tough...
Here.
Eat this.
I understand...
Eating human flesh is a painful thing to do.
But... you didn't eat it.
Well...
Before Gosuke died...
I promised him I wouldn't.
If I hadn't made that promise...
I too would have eaten him.
Why...
Why did I eat him?
You did it out of loyalty to the Emperor.
I did it for my own sake.
Listen.... it wasn't your fault.
You had to do it because you were hungry.
It's not a crime... if you do it because you're starving.
Hachizo.
Do you think the Captain is a bad man?
In both a good sense and a bad sense... he's a resourceful man.
Even now perhaps...
he's calculating when I'll die.
And... when I'm dead... you'll both survive on me.
He's probably calculating how long I'll last.
Is that what he's...
That's not all...
He'll be thinking... about what'll happen... after I've been eaten.
Nishikawa, will you... just stand up?
Stand up.
Here I am.
Stand a little further back.
Further back.
Well?
Move further inside the cave.
It's terrifying!
What's terrifying?
Behind your head...
I can see a ring of light.
I can't see it.
I can see it clearly.
It's an illusion.
It's not.
There's an old saying... that if one eats human flesh... a ring of light appears behind one's head.
And that the light... is similar to the glow... of luninous moss.
It's an illusion.
An illusion!
Can you still see it?
Can you see it?
!
No... not anymore.
See?
It was an illusion.
No, it wasn't.
The ring of light... is not something that can be easily seen.
One can see it... only from a certain angle, and for a short time.
And only when one tries to see it.
I don't like this!
Nishikawa.
There's no need to worry.
Nobody can see it except me.
Only I can see it... and I am going to die very soon.
No, please don't die.
You mustn't die.
Hachizo, I beg you.
Please don't die, Hachizo.
Captain!
Hachizo's dying.
If we don't do something, he'll die.
He won't eat Gosuke's flesh... so we can't help him.
One of us is dying!
Don't you feel anything?
Even if I did... that wouldn't save his life.
You... you're waiting... for Hachizo to die, so you can eat him.
He'll die soon, whether I wait for him to die or not.
Those who are going to die will die anyway, and those who'll survive have to survive at any cost.
As long as you can eat...
- What?
As long as you can eat and survive... you don't mind who dies.
I'm not a devil.
Nobody wants to eat human flesh.
If it wasn't for Gosuke dying... you and I might have been dead by now.
No one asked him to die.
Gosuke died of his own accord.
He died... so you and I ate the flesh of his body.
Whatever way you look at it... that's all there is to it.
I won't hide the fact... that if Hachizo dies...
I may eat his flesh as well.
You'll probably eat it, too.
I don't like it.
- Neither do I.
Neither of us like it... but we don't have a choice.
I don't like it...
I just don't like it!
Hey, Nishikawa... today's New Year's Eve.
Hang on until the drift ice breaks up.
Nishikawa!
Where are you going?
The bell...
Me, too...
I'm going to toll the bell, too.
Thus... a month passed.
The flesh from Hachizo's body had all gone... and the cold intensified.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You know...
I'm scared of living... and of dying.
That's because you think of being scared.
Aren't you scared?
I only want to get out of here.
I don't think of anything else.
We'll never get out of here.
Even if we did... we're damned.
Nishikawa...
You resent me, don't you?
You're forced to eat human flesh.
And there's more...
You're afraid that I'll kill you... and eat your body so that I can survive.
You're right.
- I see.
So you can't sleep, even if you want to, right?
Why... don't you kill me?
You should kill me, eat my flesh and live.
I won't kill you.
I don't need to kill you... you'll die anyway.
It won't be long now.
Nishikawa!
Drink this.
Captain...
Aren't you... scared of yourself?
I want... to know how you feel...
in yourself?
I'm enduring.
You see... you may not know why you have to endure... but still you endure.
If I don't know why...
I can't endure.
Same here.
I've no idea what I'm enduring... but I'm still enduring.
I know... that you know exactly what you're enduring.
That's enough.
You endure this... and go to sleep.
You... you won't eat me!
Are you... going to kill me?
I don't...
want you... to eat me!
Even if I die... you won't eat me!
If you die...
I'm going to eat you anyway.
Do you... really mean to get out of here?
I'd rather the sharks got me... than have you eat me.
- Why?
Why would you say such a terrible thing?
You...
I thought you were a good man.
Nishikawa!
Just... wait.
It would be such a waste.
Here... drink this.
But, Nishikawa... do you know why you're suffering so much?
Is it because you're cold?
Or... because you ate the flesh of your own kind?
Or is it because we can't escape from here?
No...
You don't know yourself.
You're suffering... from all those things at once.
You don't really know... why you're suffering.
And I'm the same.
Remove him from the court.
Order!
According to the Defence, necessity drove the accused to eat human flesh.
I dispute that claim.
Under the same circumstances,
Gosuke and Hachizo chose death rather than eat human flesh.
As for Nishikawa, although he ate with the Captain... he was attempting suicide out of shame when the Captain killed him.
Each of the three victims, though to different degrees, expressed human emotion and human suffering.
Yet the accused survived... without any remorse or suffering.
Even after the crime was exposed, he has shown no sense of remorse.
His abnormal behaviour and arrogance in court... is clear evidence of his criminal character.
Only after severe interrogation... did he confess the full extent of his crime.
Further, he has yet to say a single word about his own feelings... regarding this atrocious crime.
This is either because...
he dare not disclose his base thoughts, or because he's cunningly decided to keep silent... in the hope of getting a favourable verdict.
The Defence seems worried about the accused's feelings... but those of the families of Gosuke, Hachizo and Nishikawa... are surely more important.
Their fathers, their sons, their husbands have been eaten.
Understanding their feelings is the best basis for judgement.
If we can feel the families' grief and anger... we have no need to ask such a low character... about his base reasoning.
- That's right!
Order!
Your Honour, please let the accused speak.
The accused has been given many chances to speak... but he hasn't spoken.
Please give him another chance.
If the accused candidly speaks his mind...
I too would like to hear him.
If the accused wishes to speak, he may do so now.
Whatever he may say, his guilt is clear... and will not alter the verdict.
But the nature of his crime is so bizarre... that I'd be interested to know his state of mind.
Since the Defence requests it, stand up and speak.
Tell us now... exactly how you feel.
Do you feel sorrow... or remorse?
Do you feel any human emotions?
Do I have to answer that?
Answer.
Remember where you are.
I am... enduring.
- Enduring what?
I'm enduring many things.
"Many things" isn't good enough.
Give us an example.
Go ahead.
Feel free.
For example...
I'm enduring this trial.
Do you object to this trial?
No...
I don't, sir.
In that case, there's nothing to "endure".
I'm not objecting to it, sir, I'm just enduring it.
Can't you make it clearer?
It sounds like you're trying to confuse the court.
I'm not complaining about the trial... but a trial seems irrelevant to me.
"Irrelevant"?
You've committed a grave crime.
Are you aware of that?
- I am.
So you admit your guilt.
Then it's not a matter of endurance.
You must face justice.
But you see, sir...
That's why I'm saying:
I've no choice but to endure it.
I know you think we can't understand you.
But that's just you're arrogance.
Can't you be more humble?
I can't be more humble than I am now.
I'm just enduring a lot of things within myself.
You seem to endure a great deal... but that can also mean you're without shame.
I'm not trying to argue my way out of things.
In the cave...
I just endured, as I thought I had to.
Even now, I feel the same way.
I'm enduring.
Never before have I met a villain as glib as you!
Is that all you want to say?
Excuse me...
May I ask a question?
What's your question?
Ask it.
Allow me to ask you, then...
Mr. Prosecutor, what kind of food did you eat... between December last year and January this year?
Order!
Is that what you want to know?
I ate many different things... but never human flesh.
Well then...
may I also ask Sir... if you've ever had your flesh eaten by someone else?
Fortunately, I haven't.
My colleagues are not as dangerous as you.
I see...
They were the only things I wanted to ask.
I understand now.
- About what?
You may understand something, but I don't.
Answer me.
- Do I have to, sir?
Just answer me.
I feel... if Mr. Prosecutor judges me, I won't have been judged.
So you don't want me to judge you?
Tell us why not.
Who would you accept?
Gosuke... or Hachizo... or Nishikawa...
All three men you named are now dead.
Besides, you killed one of them and ate his whole body.
Do you want dead men to judge you?
I'm only saying that, if it's you who judges me,
I won't feel as if I've been judged.
Perhaps you should state your reason.
My reason, sir?
It's because Mr. Prosecutor has never eaten human flesh.
Nor has he...
- Very well!
What you're saying is that one can't be a Prosecutor... unless he's dead, or a criminal like you.
No, sir.
That's not it.
That's not what I'm saying, sir.
Yes, it is...
You're trying to blame the nation or society for what you did.
Listen...
We're trying you now as a society and a nation.
You're denying our justice, right?
You want to spit at justice.
- Not at all, sir.
I'm only saying...
I wish to be judged by someone... who has either eaten human flesh, or had his flesh eaten by others.
Order!
Let him speak.
Order!
Did you hear him, your Honour?
Those words show his character.
The accused is a hopeless fiend.
Does the accused believe he committed a crime?
Is he prepared to accept punishment?
I won't... object, if I'm sentenced to death.
Then why do you disobey the Prosecutor?
I didn't disobey him, sir.
I only spoke because the Prosecutor forced me to...
That's a lie.
You're lying.
You want to challenge the court's authority.
I've no such intention, sir.
I'm only enduring.
- You see?
You want to say that none of us here can judge your crime.
You want to evade punishment because we're all human.
But you can't do that.
Now...
I'll remind you of the crime you committed.
Did you start eating Gosuke and Hachizo from their fingers, or from their ears?
Did you start skinning Nishikawa from the front or from the back?
How did ripping out the nails sound?
What was the texture of the flesh?
Mr. Prosecutor!
Isn't it indecent to imagine such details... of something you've never done?
Have you no shame?
I'm just... trying to endure.
What you did disgraced the Japanese people!
You besmirched out national honour!
How will you apologise... to his Imperial Majesty for what you did?
I think... his Majesty and I are not so different.
What are you saying?
I think His Majesty... is also enduring.
I forbid the accused to speak.
Clear the court!
Court adjourned.
Court adjourned.
Everybody out!
Take shelter, everyone!
Air-raid alert!
To the shelter!
I can't see any way I can defend you.
- That's okay, sir.
I've known that right from the start.
There's really no one... who can do anything for me.
You seem resigned to your fate.
I'm not, sir.
Actually, the opposite's true.
I've just remembered something.
There was one thing I wanted you to do... but...
I don't think you'll be able to do it.
Well then... what is it?
I'd like you... to eat me.
But I don't think you can do that, sir.
You couldn't possibly do that.
No one would want...
to do such a thing.
I wish... at least that gentleman could eat me.
Why are you pointing your finger at me?
Are you trying to say I'm different?
No, sir.
I was just...
Are you saying I'd eat human flesh?
No, sir!
You wouldn't eat human flesh.
You're the Prosecutor, aren't you?
You're a respectable person.
All the people here are respectable people.
There's a clear difference between us.
I mean, see the ring of light around my head?
Look closely.
You can see it, if you try.
That's the stigma I bear.
Are you still talking nonsense?
What's this about a "ring of light"?
I can't see anything.
Can the Defence counsel see anything?
I can't.
A ring of light surrounds me.
It's the sign of my guilt.
If such a sign exists, there's no need for a trial.
That's right, sir...
So you must look hard.
Your Honour, can you see anything?
How could I see anything?
You must be able to.
Are you saying you can see it yourself?
I can't see it myself... but you should be able to.
Please look.
Why are you the only one who can't see it?
The one with the ring can't see it.
Those who've eaten human flesh can't see it.
But I can't see anything.
Neither can I.
Can't you see it either, sir?
I can't believe that.
Neither the Prosecutor nor the Judge can.
That's impossible.
If that's the case... it's terrifying.
It's not possible.
Please... come closer.
You must come closer and look at me.
Please look.
Look very closely at me, please!
Please look at me.
Look hard.
I'm sure... you will see it.
You must take this seriously.
It's really important.
It's really important.
Look closely at me.
Your Honour...
Please look at me, sir.
Look closely at me.
Can you see anything, your Honour?
Please look.
Can't you see it?
Look hard, please.
Please...
Look hard at me!
Look at me, please!
Headmaster!
Well...
I'm obliged.
Thank you very much for everything.
Not at all.
I didn't do much.
Well...
I suppose I can't die yet.

THE END
Sorry, we can't come to the phone right now.
If you'll leave a message we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
Thanks.
Hi, Mamie.
It's Jack.
We're going to leave London as planned, but we'll take a cab from the airport, so nobody has to bother to drive in and pick us up.
Ah!
Eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
Ohh!
You already own that.
You own everything.
I'll put another hotel on it.
...and listen, we completely forgot about Sally's goldfish.
If by some miracle they're still alive will you feed them and change the water, and...
Your turn, Dad.
Uh, Mom will make my move, honey.
And if they're not, will you go to the store and see if you can find a couple that are sort of the same size?
Okay, we'll see you soon.
Bye.
One, two, three...
What's happening?
...five, six!
Yes!
Oh, no.
Yay!
Another hotel?
What does... what does he owe you?
You owe me 1,000 and 100 pounds.
I haven't got it.
You win.
I'm out.
This girl is rich.
I want to go to sleep.
Good evening, sir.
Uh, yes?
Will these do?
Uh... yeah.
Bring them in.
My wife, I guess.
Ahh... candles, champagne...
Oh, honey.
I'm sorry I didn't think of this.
That's all right.
Only one of us had to.
Is she asleep?
Mm-hmm.
What about your speech?
I'll wing it.
You sure?
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
We have all watched, I think, with a sense of awe, the protean events which have taken place in Moscow and the Republics and the enormous changes resulting from these events.
In this volatile climate, then
I must conclude that we can only speculate on the future of Soviet fleet development and deployment.
I would like to thank the trustees of the Royal Naval Academy for their very kind invitation to be here with you today.
He's impressed, Sally.
He just can't show it.
He's a professional soldier.
It's his job not to be distracted.
Come on.
We got to go meet Daddy.
I'm impressed.
Find it on the map there?
Uh-huh.
We're right here, and when we get to the street there, we turn left...
No, right.
Yeah, right.
You sure?
Turn right, yes.
Okay, we're going to turn right.
I'm following your map.
Okay, okay, all right.
You mind your bottom, Paddy-boy.
Move sure and fast.
You told me that, didn't you?
So I'm telling you again.
This won't be like anything you've ever done before, little brother.
Target leaving the palace now.
Right.
Stay awake, lads.
Here they come.
Up!
Okay right here?
That good?
Any more?
Little more?
Okay.
There's daddy.
Go!
Down!
Get down!
Ready!
Get down!
Come on!
Oh!
Get down.
Keep her down!
Get out of the car!
Come on!
Get out!
Open the fucking door!
Open it!
Jack!
Open it, or I'll blow it off!
Come on, let's go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Paddy?
Stop!
Army!
Drop it!
Grab his arms!
Help the boy.
No, he's had it.
It's all right, sweetie.
I want you to stay here.
Everything's going to be okay.
Stand back, please.
Stand back, ma'am.
That's my husband.
I'm a doctor.
I'm going to treat him.
Oh, Jesus, Jack!
What were you thinking of?
I'm going to set you down, okay?
Stay with me, Jack.
You hear me?
Stay with me.
Jack?
Jack, stay with me.
The feeling here today is one of outrage over this unprecedented terrorist attack on the Royal Family.
And while no group has yet claimed credit, there is, among many here, speculation already of Irish Republican Army involvement.
According to eyewitness accounts,
Lord William Holmes, the Queen Mother's cousin and Minister of State for Northern Ireland, along with his wife and son, would have most certainly been killed were it not for the heroic efforts of this man--
John Patrick Ryan, the American tourist who broke up the assassination attempt.
An author and professor at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland,
Ryan is a former Marine lieutenant.
Wounded in the exchange of gunfire, he is listed in guarded condition at an undisclosed London hospital.
This is Deborah Weston, CNN news, London.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
You're alive.
I forgive you.
Otherwise...
Hey, pumpkin.
I love you.
I love you, too.
You dignify their cowardice with your silence.
They left you.
They drove off without you.
I'm curious as to what it is you think you owe them.
If any of my mates ever drove off and left me in your hands,
I'd not only feel no great sense of loyalty,
I'd make sure to remind meself to kill them.
Who are they, Sean?
Where are they?
The trip was unscheduled.
How'd you know Lord Holmes would be there?
I can't help you if you don't talk to me, you know.
I'd tear your heart out and serve it up to you with chips if I didn't know you'd enjoy it, you Fenian bastard.
No.
Not in all eternity.
He'll not chirp a word.
Not Sean Miller... and not while his brother is lying on a slab.
What's the matter, Jimmy?
Don't you believe it?
It's the entire thing I don't believe.
The royal family, Kevin?
You know that only turns people against us.
Look, this was totally unauthorized, and the other brigade commanders, they know that you were behind it.
Fuck the bloody IRA.
All these years of war, and they've got us nowhere.
In its heart and soul,
England is still a monarchy, and that is where we must strike-- at the royals and the ruling class.
You're either with us or you're against us, Jimmy-boy.
Make up your mind.
Oh, I'm with you.
Good.
That's all I wanted to hear.
I'll leave you to it.
Kevin...
Charlie's going to drop by tonight to try to straighten things out.
Be smart.
Talk to him.
And hold your temper.
I promise.
Thanks, Jimmy.
Kevin.
Kevin, lad... it's me, Charlie.
That's me holding my temper, Jimmy-boy.
Oh, God.
Oh, yeah.
All right.
All right.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, damn!
What?
I forgot.
What?
Where's my bag?
You're not going to make me wear a rubber, are you?
You know, the Church says wearing one of them's a sin, darlin'.
So is this... darlin'.
So what can you tell me about, uh... about this guy?
Sean?
Oh, he's a nice boy, Sean Miller.
Shot a parish priest in Derry... during confession, if you can imagine.
He thought the Father was informing for the British.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
I don't think it's in Mr. Ryan's best interests or the prosecution's to discuss matters not directly related to the events at hand.
If you can confirm for me that the man in that photograph is the same man you disarmed in the square,
I think we'll be through.
I can.
Do you have anything to add, Mr. Ryan?
Yes.
Uh... the man I killed was Miller's...
Brother.
Brother.
Patrick.
Not even 17, Paddy-boy.
Recruited by Sean into the IRA...
Again, I think we'd all be better served if we could preserve the clarity of your eventual testimony.
I read it in the newspaper.
I can hardly see...
I'd appreciate you refraining from reading the newspapers.
Not even Doonesbury?
Well... do you have anything to add?
No.
Mr. Ryan?
Yes.
My name's Jeffrey Watkins, principal private secretary to Lord Holmes.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
This is my wife, Catherine.
How do you do?
Hello.
So, Dr. Ryan, how is your patient healing?
Just fine.
We're looking forward to going home, though.
I can imagine.
May I introduce his Lordship?
Oh, hello.
It's my great honor to finally meet you, Dr. Ryan.
Thank you.
I owe you a debt of gratitude that I shall never be able to repay.
Not at all.
Thank you for your kind note.
I'm delighted that you're here to share in the good news, Mrs. Ryan.
Her Majesty's decided to invest your husband KCVO--
Knight Commander of the Victorian Order.
My congratulations, Sir.
Thank you.
Good luck today.
Sir Jack?
Lady Catherine.
Perhaps if I'd had more time to think about it,
I would've preferred to do something else.
So you're saying you didn't have time, is that it?
That's correct.
So you didn't.
Didn't what?
Think, sir.
You didn't think, is the point I believe you're trying to make.
No.
Instead you raced into a situation of which, by your own admission, you had no understanding, attacked my client, who was, in fact, another pedestrian hurrying to help.
Wearing a ski mask.
Shot a second man in the chest, this one taking you-- can it be...?
After they shot me.
...three shots at point-blank range in order to fell the second victim.
I used that force I deemed necessary.
I should say so.
I doubt very much whether anyone in this courtroom would disagree.
Excuse me.
I didn't make this happen, sir.
No further questions.
He did.
Oh, My Lord, there is one more question.
Are you still, Dr. Ryan, in the paid service of the Central Intelligence Agency?
I should remind you that you're under oath.
No.
I beg your pardon?
No.
That's all.
Thank you.
The witness may stand down.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, I think this might be an appropriate moment...
Bloody proud of yourself, aren't you?
You stuck your nose in where it didn't belong, and now you've killed my baby brother.
Hey, Daddy!
Hey, pumpkin.
Hey.
Wow!
You guys have really grown.
How are you feeling?
Not so good.
Tired?
No.
I have no idea what time it is.
Feels like morning to me.
You're telling me.
Did I miss something?
No... but I did.
I'm pregnant.
Honey!
Can I watch some TV?
I'm not at all tired.
What?
Plates.
I don't have any say in this, do I?
Sure, you do, honey.
This is a family.
Everybody's got a say.
But my say's after the fact.
Or am I wrong?
No... you're right.
Michaela really despises her little sister.
Yeah?
Well...
Are you ready for this?
It could be even worse.
It could be a baby brother.
Oh, no.
Boys.
I mean, do you refer to these fighting men as terrorists?
No.
You call them patriots.
Jack.
Boys are...
Do you, in fact, deny that the Provisional Wing of the IRA was behind this assassination attempt?
When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it.
Thank you.
That's the policy.
They'll proudly say they did it.
Have the IRA admitted to this?
I mean, common sense, logic, some form of reason...
May I at least suggest some names?
Some think your efforts in America raising money for the Irish cause will be affected...
Sure, you can, honey.
Good morning, Mr. Cooley.
And to you, madam.
How is business?
Fine, thank you.
I came upon this first edition at an estate auction.
Can your man restore it?
And when would you want this by, madam?
Soon.
As you can see, it's very pressing.
I'm not sure.
The binder may have some trouble with this.
Is that so?
I'll see what I can do.
He's not a miracle worker, you know.
No, obviously he's not, Mr. Cooley.
The best you can arrange, then.
Good day, Mr. Cooley.
Good day, madam.
Hello, Sean.
Don't mind if I come along with you, do you?
Although I disapprove of the things you've done, Sean,
I can't quite bring meself to condemn ya.
I can't... because I understand where the hatred comes from.
I more than understand it.
But the present fact is that we're very near now the darkest hole in all of Great Britain, and you still won't speak to me.
They're raising the bridge.
We'll be here about five minutes.
Understood.
Mobile Three, Lymington.
Hello, Lymington!
They jammed the radio.
Open the door!
Open it, or I'll kill him.
They've got the bridge keeper.
What do we do?
We open the door.
Open it!
But for Christ's sake...!
But what?
Wait until they kill him, then open the door?
Your guns!
We are unarmed.
Just who the hell are you?
Get them out!
Get your heads down!
Lay down on the bloody ground!
Don't you fucking move!
Didn't think we'd forget about you, did you?
Inspector Robert Highland, this is a friend of mine.
We meet at last, Mr. Highland.
Tell me, what do they pay you to turn against your own people, eh?
Get on with it and be on your way.
Very well, if that's the way you feel about it.
Come on, Cath!
Have I got the tickets, or what?
I don't have them.
I don't have them.
They're on the fridge.
Dad...
Honey, there's plenty of time.
Hello, Admiral.
Good morning, Jack.
You know Marty Cantor.
Marty.
How's the shoulder?
Not too bad.
Something's come up.
Can we sit down and have a chat?
They were moving him to Albany Prison on the Isle of Wight when it happened.
We think he's left the country.
Marty, excuse me.
Let's deal in what we know, and not what we don't.
We know he's escaped.
We know it happened in Kent near the Channel.
If he's left the country--
Jack, you listening?
-- the chances he'd come here, that he'd try that he could come here are so remote,
I have trouble even saying it.
And yet your first instinct was to come all the way out here and tell me.
Marty, want to excuse us a few minutes?
I've got a few more weeks before school starts, but I've got to... dig in and prepare a few lectures.
Want to come down and look over what we got?
You might turn up something we haven't.
You're asking me if I want to come back.
Yup.
We'll try and go next week, honey.
All right.
Sorry.
Sean Miller escaped.
Well, what does that mean?
They just wanted me to know.
They thought I might be concerned.
I'm not.
The IRA's not stupid.
They're not going to follow me all the way over here.
We talked about it.
They agreed.
They're gone.
That's it.
They didn't ask you to come back to CIA?
I said no.
Just like that.
I don't want to go back, honey.
I saw them coming, and I just...
I know.
I can't go back to that life again... you know?
Sally!
Wait up, honey.
I bet your cell was even better than this-- the bloody Ritz in comparison.
At least you always had your own toilet bowl, eh, Sean?
Come on, Sean, cheer up.
You've just been spared a lifetime of hell on earth.
A word of gratitude might even be in order.
I don't feel like resting, laying around in the sun like some complacent tourist.
If we're to build an army, we've got to train like soldiers, and we can't do that in Ireland.
Not now.
Bleeding waste of time.
There's laying about, and there's laying low.
There's a difference.
Is there?
It's Lord Holmes who should be worried about complacency.
Next time he won't be so lucky.
Post him back to Whitehall in little pieces if that's what it takes to free every Irish political prisoner.
That's not who I'm thinking of.
I know that, Sean, but what Ryan done can't be undone, so you should stop thinking about him.
I can't.
How in the world could something like this have happened?
Inspector Highland picked the day, picked the decoy routes, picked the men, and still they knew.
He had two children, apparently.
It's tragic, tragic.
SO-13 have narrowed it down to 31 people who had prior knowledge of your itinerary on the day of the attack and of Miller's transfer, five of whom are now dead.
Sir, I think it might be best if we limit your appointments for the time being.
I will not have my itinerary dictated to me by terrorists.
Whoever this traitor is, they better pray to God I never find him.
We know you'll do your best, Sergeant.
...You got to backstroke, sidestroke to get to shore,
You got to backstroke, sidestroke to get to shore,
And we don't know if we're ever coming home,
And we don't know if we're ever coming home,
Stand up, buckle up, shuffle through the door,
Stand up, buckle up, shuffle through the door,
Jump on out and shout Marine Corps...
Egesta appealed to Athens on what basis?
On what grounds?
Mr. Viederman?
Bad time for you?
Well, uh, they...
said they'd be grateful didn't they?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Um...
Mm-hmm.
"Fight our battle, and the rest of the world will fear and respect you."
Yeah, but didn't the rest of the world fear and respect Athens already?
It didn't matter.
It didn't matter.
Why not?
Pride, sir?
That's the battle they lost.
The real battle.
Attention on deck!
Attention to orders.
I have a presentation to make.
For service above and beyond the call of duty of a tourist, even a Marine... we recognize Professor John Patrick Ryan with the Order of the Purple Target and hope that he will duck next time, lest he become part of history
rather than a teacher of it.
How old is he?
Ten.
Plate glass window?
Mm-hmm.
Here we go.
Hi, guys.
Good morning, Cathy.
Hmm.
I've got a retina at 1:00.
We might have to bump it.
This could take some time.
Yep, let's bump it.
We're all set to go.
Okay, let's do it.
So you just waded on in like John Wayne.
Why did you do it?
What were you thinking, man?
I don't know.
I wasn't thinking.
That's it?
You sound like some of my students.
Just pissed me off.
I couldn't just stand there and watch them shoot those people right in front of me.
It was... rage.
Pure rage.
It just made me mad.
Here's hoping you never get mad at me, man.
Oh...
Okay, now it's my turn.
She's late, Sean.
Yeah, and then what?
And she was at this dance,
Yeah?
and then this guy, at the end, he...
Eww!
Kind of cute, isn't she?
Is she?
Bye.
See ya.
Hi, Mommy.
Hi, sweetie.
How are you?
Let's do it.
Goddamn!
Whoa!
Not here.
Highway 50.
West.
Good night, Doc.
Good night.
Dr. Ryan!
Clear the way!
Where's Sean Miller?
Where's Sean Miller?
Dr. Ryan, get out of the way, please!
Dr. Ryan!
This is surgery.
Yeah, Dr. Catherine Ryan, please.
Dr. Ryan, Dr. Ryan, are you all right?
She's left for the day.
How long?
Dr. Ryan.
Come on!
Come on!
Surgery.
Yes.
This is Dr. Ryan.
I'd like the results on the Thompson boy's retinal scan.
Hold, please.
Come on, Cathy, get off the phone.
Look, Mom.
Ooh, it's beautiful.
Are you still holding?
Yes, I'm still holding.
Look, I'd like to speak with Dr. Sutton.
Operator, I want to make an emergency breakthrough.
The number is 555-3464.
Yeah, it's a mobile phone, yeah.
What do you mean I can't?
Faster, damn it!
Come on, Cath.
Watch it, buddy!
Dr. Ryan, we have the results of that retinal scan, and everything is fine.
That's great.
Thank you.
Jesus!
Hello.
Cathy.
Jack?
Cath, something's happened, honey.
Is Sally with you?
Yeah.
Hi, Dad!
Is everything all right?
Yeah, everything's fine.
There she is.
Right.
Honey, I want you to get off the highway and get to the nearest police station as quick as you can, all right?
The police station?
Cathy, just get off the highway right now.
Steady, mate.
Steady.
Where are you now?
I'm at Rowe Boulevard.
There's a State Police barracks at Houston Street.
I'll meet you there.
Okay.
Is something wrong, Mom?
No.
Everything's fine.
It's okay.
They're gone.
I got it!
Coming in!
Mr. Ryan?
Yeah.
Your wife's okay.
She sustained a concussion, but we ran a complete skull...
She's pregnant.
I know.
The baby's okay.
You don't have to worry...
What about my daughter?
Let's sit down for a moment.
No.
Talk to me.
It's going to be a little while before we know, maybe in the morning.
She, uh...
Where's Sally?
She's in the recovery room, honey.
They're watching her.
We'll know in seven or eight hours.
They had to remove her spleen.
She's in pretty bad shape.
I'm sorry.
Harry Johnson is standing by.
In a few moments, he expects to have a statement from Mr. Paddy O'Neil.
Mr. O'Neil is the Sinn Fein representative...
Jack.
Here you go.
You okay?
And now we go to Harry Johnson ready to speak with Mr. Paddy O'Neil.
I've come to stand vigil and to pray for the recovery of the victims of this senseless attack.
Sinn Fein are outraged, as indeed are most Irish Catholics this morning at this heinous crime.
Look, I want to share with Dr. Ryan, personally, our empathy and anguish, but I will wait as I feel it proper for the most appropriate time.
Can you confirm or deny that funding for the IRA...?
The IRA are not responsible for this attack.
What you're saying is the IRA had nothing to do with this incident?
Uh, no more questions.
Thank you, Mr. O'Neil.
She's going to be okay.
Thank you.
She's all right.
She's all right.
Ryan.
Mr. Ryan.
Mr. Ryan, I'd like to share with you our deep regret about...
No bullet wounds.
Mr. Ryan.
Cathy Ryan's concussion is mild, however.
We expect her to be released within two to three days.
You know the deal, Jack.
Come on, you are involved.
Marty, don't tell me about the deal.
I know the deal.
That is not good process.
You are the victim of a crime,
I... and that does not make for the best analysis even if you knew something about terrorism, which you do not.
I have guys on it guys who know something about the IRA.
Marty, I am not standing here...
This is not Naval intelligence.
Marty, I am not standing here with my hat in my hand.
I am telling you, I want back in.
Jack.
Sir.
Thank God about Sally.
Thank you.
Alice and I are relieved beyond words.
You manage any sleep?
Not much, sir.
I'm interrupting something.
You were explaining to Jack about how we'd be better off without him around here... or something along those lines.
Marc Spiva, Jack Ryan.
Nice to meet you.
Tony Ferro.
Hi.
Alex Winter.
Jack.
Nice to meet you, Alex.
Well.
Rose.
I have to say you're looking better than I expected.
It's an illusion, I'm afraid.
Of course it would have to be, wouldn't it?
Well, it's good to see you again regardless.
You, too.
Look, we've carved a niche for you, and here's your night-table reading.
Oh, my.
"Father killed by RUC."
"Belfast. 1979."
This way.
Over here.
Good morning, sir.
Cut the engine, please.
Can I see some form of identification, please?
Did you see the game, then?
Yeah.
It was all right.
That penalty...
What the hell?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Nobody move!
Get them up!
Morning.
Kevin O'Donnell, longtime IRA strategist, friend of the Miller family.
He was there when Timothy Miller was killed, '79.
Looked after his boys, Sean and Patrick.
This photo's not a year old.
I think if we could find O'Donnell, we'll find Miller still standing at his side.
Are you with me?
Jack?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm just thinking.
What about the gun?
What about it?
Think it's going to turn up registered?
Son of a bitch.
What?
Um...
Look, um...
SO-13 gets an anonymous tip about some bomb-like stuff on a table in an apartment.
They go in, and they get some IRA bad guys, they look around, and they see there's no way anybody could have seen through the window like the tipster said.
We got three IRA hit men at a farmhouse hit by somebody else.
That's British soldiers getting out of hand, Jack.
They're not above it, not after a hit on the royal family.
No, no, no, no, look.
We got Brigade Commander of the IRA, Jimmy O'Reardon who checks into a cheap hotel room, ends up dead.
Double tap to the head-- very professional.
And that was... how long after the farmhouse?
Same day.
Same day.
What are you coming to, Jack?
Jack!
Where are you going?
I'm just going to go throw some water on my face.
Jack!
Excuse me.
I, uh, think one of us is in the wrong room.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
Jack!
Get down!
When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it.
Get down!
I mean, common sense, logic...
Get down!
Get down!
We didn't get any prints or anything like that.
Listen, who are we looking for here, huh?
IRA terrorists or some ultraviolent faction of the IRA fighting the cause their way?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jimmy O'Reardon checked into a hotel with a woman with long hair, long red hair.
This is who we should be looking for.
We find her, we'll find him.
I saw his wife and daughter die, but she and Neddie blew it.
Ryan's still alive.
They're not dead, Sean.
What?
They survived it.
I can't say it any plainer than that.
It doesn't matter.
The trip served its purpose.
It does matter.
Sean, Americans hold their breath every time a little girl falls down a pipe in a backyard, but you've shot at one with a submachine gun on her way back from school.
Well, we've started the bleeding war.
The Brits are tearing apart Belfast for the IRA, and their American money are denying the hits so loud, it only makes them look more guilty.
The war is raging, and when it's over, we'll be the only ones left standing.
Sean, I let you go for Paddy-boy, but that's it.
We've got work to do, and it's not in Maryland.
Hello.
Yeah.
How's the family, Ryan?
You nearly lost them, didn't you?
It's easy to get at them.
You should look after your family better, you know.
Are you there?
Yeah.
I understand your little girl's feeling better, eh?
Lost her spleen, though, yeah?
Pity that.
Make it mighty tough on her to fight off infection, eh, Jackie?
You sick son of a bitch.
It was him, wasn't it?
He's never going to leave us alone.
He'll never get that close to us again, honey.
That's why he's making calls in the middle of the night.
That's all he can do.
You get him, Jack.
I don't care what you have to do.
Just get him.
♪ Here's to you
♪ My brave Irish laddies
♪ We'll not be broken, downhearted, and sad ♪
♪ So let us drink a toast to all our comrades ♪
♪ That stand for the honor
♪ And pride of our land...
Can I buy you a drink?
No.
Let me buy you one.
Barney, two whiskeys.
The IRA's not responsible for all this.
I know that.
Are you waiting for me to agree with you?
I've been saying this to the press till I'm blue in the face.
Well, that's the point, isn't it?
You claim responsibility for one thing, deny it for another.
Nobody believes you anymore.
I want to know where Sean Miller and Kevin O'Donnell are.
Let me try and understand this.
You want me to sell out my fellow Irishmen to you?
Is that why you came down here?
You don't understand me at all.
Oh, I think I do.
Look, I don't give a damn what they've done, but the day that I sell out my countrymen will be the day that I put a bullet through my own head.
That's it, then, huh?
That's it.
You know, on second thought, maybe I won't have a drink with you.
Okay, then I'll go home.
Have a safe trip.
I'll go home and call the TV stations, give them what they want-- let them take their cameras into my daughter's hospital room.
Put it on the evening news.
I don't give a shit whether you did it or not, and neither will anyone else, but I will put such a stranglehold on your gun money, you'll be out in the street throwing rocks.
I will fucking destroy you.
I will make it my mission in life.
Excuse me.
Well, lads, did you hear that?
Stand sideways-- you're less of a target.
Yes!
Satellite's coming!
Celts, let's go!
Come on.
Get inside!
So...
SO-13 traced the weapons used in the Lord Holmes incident to an arms dealer that supplies Kaddafi.
Now, when Sean Miller escaped, he was last seen in a zodiac heading out into the Channel in a gale, which didn't make sense until I checked on the freighters that were out there that day.
Syrian registry.
Known to carry arms from the Middle East to client states in the Mediterranean including Kaddafi.
So Miller takes a slow boat to North Africa.
Exactly.
Now, we send our birds up over the desert, photographing, what, how many camps?
182.
182 camps a day in North Africa.
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade,
Action-Directe, West German Red Army Faction.
But on the day that this particular ship docked in Benghazi, there's activity in only nine camps with people arriving.
Now, this one we know for sure is PLO.
This one's Shining Path.
These seven we're not so sure about.
Why?
Well, we got satellites...
Well, because the people in those camps know probably better than we do exactly what time the satellite's going to pass overhead.
And, Marty... unless you authorize us to retask those satellites so we can get a look before they're overhead from the side, we are never going to know which camp they're at.
Jack, do you have any idea how big a deal it is to retask those satellites?
Yeah.
Bring up camp 18 again.
Tighten on the camp here.
Let's look up in here... see what we can see.
Show me this grouping here.
Hmm.
Hmm.
No, that's nothing.
Go back to the, uh, bigger picture.
Let me see down here.
What's that?
Tighten up on that, will you?
Hmm...
Can you enhance that, sharpen it up?
Tits.
I don't know.
SAS could take out any one of these camps in under two minutes, kill everybody there, and be gone before the echo fades.
Are you sure this is the same woman?
Keep at it, then.
Son of a bitch.
Hi.
Read it again, Daddy.
"The sun did not shine.
"It was too wet to play, so we sat in the house all that cold, cold, wet day."
"I sat there with Sally.
"We sat there, we two,
"and I said, how I wish we had something to do.
"Too wet to go out, too cold to play ball,
"so we sat in the house.
"We did nothing at all.
"So all we could do was just sit, sit, sit, sit.
And we did not like it, not one little bit."
"And then something went... boom."
Dr. Hamani, please report to the second floor nurses' station.
Dr. Hamani.
Paddy O'Neil can sleep at night.
In fact, he probably enjoys the irony.
She's not Irish.
She's English.
And this is the girl you saw... in the blink of an eye in a jeep as it passed you doing 40?
Yeah.
What am I supposed to do here?
Tell SO-13 you know who she is.
Tell them her name.
Give them her picture.
Tell them that she poses as a rare book dealer and ask them to look for her.
What do you mean what do you do?
What am I supposed to do with you, Jack?
You walk into a bar, half of whose customers want you dead.
You walk up to the IRA's bagman, and in front of his guys, you threaten him?
You're not a field man, Jack.
You never were.
You are an analyst.
Analyze that.
I am not after your job, Marty.
I'm after the man who tried to kill my family.
Then will you think?
You tell O'Neil that you're looking for a girl.
He gives you the pictures of a girl.
He obliges you to get you off his back, and you believe him?
I didn't tell him I was looking for a girl, Marty.
What's going on?
Sarge?
Hmm?
Come and look at this.
Bit of a bookworm meself, not that you'd know it to look at me.
What's your passion, then, mysteries?
Spy novels?
Familiar with Ian Fleming, are you?
This is a rare book shop.
Rare books?
Yeah, so they are.
Can you locate the problem, or do I have to call someone else?
Already have.
The wiring in this whole place dates from before the war.
The first war.
It's what we call in the electrical business "rare."
Yes.
Can you fix it?
Oh, sure.
I can fix it.
Can you afford it?
That's the question.
Just fix it.
Hello.
He's seen it, hasn't he?
I don't know.
He's got it.
Look.
Hey, what do you make of this?
I, uh...
I...
I have no idea.
Damn!
Um...
I have to go out now for a few minutes... to deliver some books.
Please keep about your repairs.
I'll be here all week, guv.
Don't worry.
He's mine!
Damn!
Dinner at the White House is no problem.
What is the problem?
No problem, we're just running out of dates.
Yes.
We could do that.
Move that to there, which would leave us... the 14th?
The 14th.
Geoffrey let's check with John Ryan about scheduling a presentation dinner at our embassy in Washington on the, uh... 14th.
The 14th.
So let's go over this again so I can get it clear.
Geoffrey Watkins.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I'm trying to reach Mr. Titus.
Is that extension 2691?
No, this is 2619.
I'm terribly sorry.
What are you doing up?
Go back to bed.
I wanted to be there when she wakes up.
I'll go with you, and then I'll take a cab back.
Okay.
Hello.
Yes.
Just a minute.
It's for you...
Sir John.
Hello.
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Ryan has a special celebration that evening that he can't change.
He wondered if you might care to join them.
Where, at his house?
Yes, sir.
Why not?
We shot this eight days ago in Berlin.
Mm-hmm.
One... two... three, four Brits traveling with him.
Light arms.
The heavy stuff's in the cars.
He's German...
he's German.
This boring you, Sean?
Four, six altogether.
Should be the same security when Holmes flies to Washington.
We've got to find the moment when he's unprotected.
Four days in Washington, one day in New York.
Shopping.
Yeah.
Two Caucasians.
Take a look at the one with the hat.
His arms look a little pink.
Sunburn.
New arrival.
What do you think, same guy?
That rare book dealer, Dennis Cooley... he's bald.
Now, it's possible there could be a woman in some of these camps, but with her and Cooley in the same place--
if that is Cooley-- the odds of coincidence are dropping fast.
Still, I...
I don't know.
There's no way I can be... absolutely certain.
Excuse me, Jack.
Tell me one thing in life that is absolutely for certain.
My daughter's love.
What I need to hear from you is your best guess, and I think I've heard it.
Haven't I?
The bastards took away my book shop.
They took away my books!
I'm sorry, Dennis.
You can't come.
You haven't got the training, and this mission's going to be very messy.
I can fire a gun.
Sorry, Dennis.
Where are you taking me, Marty?
It's you who've taken us, Jack.
Satellite now entering target area.
Into battle.
Sir.
Enlargement sector four.
Airborne support approaching target area-- ETA, 35 seconds.
SAS team on ground.
Enlarge camp 18.
Enlarging.
Enlarge primary target.
Enlarging.
That is a kill.
Roger, roger.
It's go, go, go.
Targets have been neutralized.
Airborne support approaching.
Enlarge sector five.
Angle on sector nine.
Sector nine.
Angle sector two.
Sector two.
SAS team withdrawing.
Keyhole is passing out of visual.
It's over.
Come on, honey.
Jump.
See?
Appreciate it.
Thanks.
Surveillance team one, all clear.
Roger that.
You sure your men outside wouldn't like some coffee?
No, thank you, Mrs. Ryan.
They'll be just fine.
Okay.
And I'd to thank you, Miss Ryan, for allowing us to impose upon your homecoming.
You're wel...
You're a beautiful and gracious young lady,
You're wel... and it's my distinct pleasure to make your acquaintance.
You're welcome.
I thought I might make the presentation after dinner if you agree.
Oh, sure.
Would you like to see it now?
Uh, Geoffrey...
Oh, my.
That's very nice.
Didn't I already give you one of those?
Help yourselves.
Is that your second piece of cake, my little sweetie?
Where's the bathroom, Jack?
Um, second door on the left.
Thank you.
More coffee, anyone?
I'd love some.
Uh, excuse me.
Here it comes.
Bathroom?
Someone in there.
No, that's not it.
That's... the basement.
Hello.
Jack?
Marty.
Hey, Marty.
What's going on?
I'm sorry to interrupt your party, but I thought you'd like to know right away.
SAS just made positive ID on Dennis Cooley.
What about the others?
Well, it was pretty messy as it turns out.
It's going to take 48 hours to verify the dental records, but they're keeping right on it.
Oh, great.
What?
The storm just knocked out the power here to the house.
I got to light some candles.
I'll light one for you, too.
Okay, Marty.
Thanks.
What, forget to pay your bill, Cath?
Oh, Robert... very funny.
Everyone all right?
We're fine, Jack.
This doesn't happen very often.
Only when we have royalty over for dinner.
I knew you'd understand.
Something wrong?
Come with me, will you?
If the storm had knocked out the lights, they'd be out in the boathouse, too.
So?
Power comes in from the street, and then branches off to here.
Jesus.
This is Ryan.
Any DSS agent?
Any DSS agent, this is Ryan.
Maryland troopers?
Anyone?
Is anyone reading me?
Anybody?
Can I come back down when the lights are on?
No, sweetie.
You got to get some sleep.
It's very late.
Goddamn.
Don't tell me.
Quite a storm.
Take your hands off me.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Jack!
Gun.
Jack.
Uh-uh.
Stay right there.
Shit.
Rob, over here.
What's the plan?
How many are coming?
Where's Sean Miller?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give me the gun.
Five, six...
I don't know.
Maybe more.
I'll get the others.
Don't turn on the lights.
Take this.
Get down in the basement quick.
Where's Cathy and Sally?
They're upstairs.
She's putting Sally to bed.
Go.
What's wrong?
Come on, Ryan.
Show yourself.
Annette, upstairs.
Right.
Come on, sweetie, come on.
What's wrong, Mommy?
Shh, Shh.
Now, you've got to help me.
Climb up on the stool.
There's a shotgun there.
Oh, God, Jack, what did you do with the shells?
Go.
Go, go, go, go.
Get down.
Mommy!
Go on.
Get back.
You all right?
Where's Sally?
Daddy...
Sally?
It's okay, honey.
Come on, come on.
Honey, you just got to be real quiet.
Real quiet.
Gotcha.
Christ.
Hold on.
Come on, come on.
What are you talking about?
Who is off the air?
DSS, state troopers, everyone.
The security company rep...
Get me Hostage Rescue at Quantico now.
Robby!
Open up.
Robby, it's us.
Jack?
They're outside.
Sean, cool it.
It's the royal we want.
We can't ransom a dead body.
They're all over the place, man.
Stay close to me.
How were you going to get away, huh?
Want to go for the other knee?
Come on.
Boats.
Bottom of the cliff.
There are ropes.
Kevin!
You killed him!
No, Sean, no!
We need Holmes alive!
We're past that!
Alive!
Come on!
Any contact?
Still off the air.
There he is!
Stay down there.
Come on, you bastards.
Come on!
Come on!
He's alone!
He's leading us away from the royal!
Turn around, Sean.
No.
Turn it round, Sean!
-Turn it round, Sean!
-No!
Sean!
Turn it round!
Turn it round!
Forget about Ryan!
Don't blow the mission now, boy!
That's not my mission!
You crazy bastard!
Damn!
Had enough to eat, honey, or do you want something else?
Want some toast or...?
Pancakes.
There's no time for pancakes, honey.
Do you want toast or toast?
Toast.
Is somebody going to get that?
I'm getting it.
Sally?
Hello.
It is.
Yeah, hold on a second.
Where's your backpack?
It's Dr. Zaillian.
The amnio.
Yeah.
Hello.
Is it going to be okay?
It's going to be fine, honey.
We're just waiting to find out.
Great.
What do you want on your toast, honey?
Strawberry?
Strawberry.
Hold on a second.
Do you want to know what it is?
Did he tell you?
He's asking.
I'm asking you.
I don't know.
Do you want to know?
I don't know.
Do you?
Well, I thought I wanted to know, but now I'm not so sure.
Hold on a second.
We're discussing it.
Me, neither.
I mean, I do and I don't.
Um...
He's waiting.
Okay.
Tell us.
Okay, tell us.
Thank you.

We can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave a message.
Thanks.
Mamie, it's Jack.
We're leaving London as planned.
We'll take a cab from the airport.
No need to pick us up.
Eight...
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
You already own that!
You own everything.
We forgot about Sally's goldfish.
If they're alive, can you feed them?
Mom will make my move.
And if they're not, will you go to the store and buy similar ones?
See you soon.
Bye.
What's happening?
- Yes!
- Oh, no!
Another hotel!
- What does he owe you?
- You owe me L1,100.
I don't have it.
You win!
- This girl is rich!
- Time to go to sleep.
- Good evening, sir.
- Yes?
Will these do?
Yeah, bring them in...
My wife, I guess.
Candles, champagne...
Sorry I didn't think of this.
That's all right.
Only one of us had to.
- Is she asleep?
- Yep.
- What about your speech?
- I'll wing it.
- You're sure?
- Yep.
We've viewed with awe the protean events occurring in the former USSR.
Enormous changes have resulted from these events.
We can now only speculate on the future of Soviet fleet deployment.
Thanks to the Royal Naval Academy for inviting me to speak here today.
He's impressed, Sally.
It's just he's a professional soldier.
It's his job not to be distracted.
Come on, we gotta go meet Daddy.
I'm impressed.
- Find it on the map?
- Yeah, we turn left... no, right.
- You're sure?
- Turn right, yes.
We're gonna turn right.
I'm following your map.
You mind your bottom, Paddy Boy.
Move sure and fast.
- You told me that, didn't ya?
- I'm telling you again...
This is like nothing you've done before, little brother.
- Target leaving the Palace now.
- Right.
Stay awake, lads.
Here they come.
Is that good?
A little more?
There's Daddy!
Go!
Down!
Get down!
Move in!
Get down!
Come!
Get down!
Keep her down!
Get out of the car!
Come on!
Get out!
Open the fucking door!
British!
Open it or I'll blow you up.
Come on, let's go!
Go, go, go!
Paddy?
Stop!
Army!
Drop it!
Help the boy.
No, he's had it.
It's all right, sweetie.
Everything's going to be OK.
- Stand back, ma'am.
- That's my husband.
I'm a doctor.
I will treat him.
Jesus, Jack.
What were you thinking of?
I'm going to set you down, OK?
Stay with me, Jack.
You hear me?
Jack, stay with me.
The feeling here is outrage at the terrorist attack on the Royal Family.
While no group has yet claimed credit, there is speculation of IRA involvement.
Lord Holmes, the Queen Mother's cousin and Northern Ireland Minister would have died were it not for the heroism of-
- John Patrick Ryan, an American tourist who thwarted the terrorist attack.
A professor at the US Naval Academy, Ryan is a former marine lieutenant.
Wounded in the attack, Ryan is being treated at an undisclosed hospital.
Debora Weston, CNN News, London.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
You're alive.
I forgive you.
Otherwise...
Hey, pumpkin.
I love you.
I love you too.
You dignify their cowardice with your silence.
They left you.
They drove off without you.
I wonder why you think you owe them.
If my mates drove off and left me in your hands, I'd not only feel no loyalty -
- I'd make sure to kill them.
Who are they, Sean?
Where are they?
The trip was unscheduled.
How'd you know Lord Holmes would be there?
I can't help you if you won't talk.
I'd tear your heart out and serve it to you with chips, you Fenian bastard!
Not in all eternity will Sean chirp a word.
Not while his brother lies on a slab.
What's the matter, Jimmy?
Don't you believe it?
It's the entire thing, I don't believe.
The Royal Family, Kevin...
You know that only turns people against us.
This was totally unauthorised.
- We all know you were behind it.
- Fuck the bloody IRA!
All these years of war have got us nowhere.
In its heart England is still a monarchy.
That is where we must strike.
At the royals and the ruling class.
You're either with us or against us, Jimmy Boy.
Make up your mind!
I'm with you.
Good.
That's all I wanted to hear.
I'll leave you to it.
Kevin, Charlie's dropping by tonight to try and straighten things out.
Be smart.
Talk to him.
And hold your temper.
I promise.
Thanks, Jimmy.
Kevin!
Kevin, lad!
It's me, Charlie.
That's me holding my temper, Jimmy Boy.
- Oh, damn.
I forgot.
- What?
Where's my bag?
Please don't make me wear a rubber.
The Church says it's a sin, darling.
So is this!
Darling!
So, what can you tell me about...
this guy?
Sean?
He's a nice boy...
Sean Miller.
Shot a parish priest in Derry.
During confession.
He thought the Father was informing.
Excuse me, it's not in Mr. Ryan's best interests or the prosecution's to discuss matters not related to the events at hand.
If you confirm that the man in the photo is the one you disarmed in the square -
- I think we'll be through.
I can.
You have anything to add, Mr. Ryan?
Yes, the man I killed was Miller's brother.
- Brother.
Patrick.
Not even 17, "Paddy Boy".
Recruited by Sean into the IRA.
The idea is to preserve the clarity of your eventual testimony.
I read it in the newspaper.
- Please don't read the newspapers.
- Not even Doonesbury?
Do you have anything to add?
No.
Mr. Ryan, I'm Geoffrey Watkins.
Private Secretary to Lord Holmes.
- Pleasure.
My wife Catherine.
- How do you do?
- So, Doctor, is your patient healing?
- We're looking forward to going home.
I can imagine.
May I introduce His Lordship?
- Hello.
- It's my great honour to meet you.
- Thank you.
- I am eternally indebted to you.
Thanks for the kind note.
I'm delighted you're here to share the good news, Mrs. Ryan.
Her Majesty's decided to invest your husband K.C.V. O -
- Knight Commander of the Victorian Order.
My congratulations, sir.
Good luck today.
- "Sir Jack"?
- Lady Catherine.
If I'd had more time to think, I might have done something else.
- You're saying you didn't have time.
- That's correct.
- So, you didn't...
- Didn't what?
Think so.
You didn't think is the point you're trying to make.
No, instead you raced into a situation of which by your own admission, you had no understanding attacked my client, who was, in fact, another pedestrian hurrying to help...
In a ski mask?
...shot a 2nd man in the chest this one taking you...
After they shot me!
...three shots point blank to kill the 2nd victim.
I used that force I deemed necessary.
I should say so.
I doubt whether anyone in this court would disagree.
- Excuse me, I didn't cause this, sir.
- No further questions.
- He did!
- My Lord, there is one more question.
Are you still, Dr. Ryan, in the paid service of the CIA?
I should remind you that you're under oath.
- No.
- I beg your pardon.
- No.
- That's all.
Thank you.
The witness may stand down.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, this is an appropriate moment...
Bloody proud of yourself, aren't you?
Stuck your nose where it didn't belong.
Now you've killed my baby brother.
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, pumpkin.
Wow, you guys have really grown!
- How are you feeling?
- Not so good.
- Tired?
- No.
I've no idea what time it is.
Feels like morning.
You're telling me!
- Did I miss something?
- No.
But I did!
I'm pregnant.
Honey!
Can I watch some TV?
I'm not at all tired.
What?
- Plates.
- I don't have any say in this, do I?
This is a family.
Everybody's got a say.
But my say is after the fact.
Or am I wrong?
- No, you're right.
- Michaela despises her little sister.
Ready for this?
It could be even worse... a baby brother.
Oh, no.
Boys!
- Jack!
- True.
Boys are...
You deny the IRA was behind the assassination attempt?
When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it.
That's the policy.
They proudly say they did it.
Have the IRA admitted to this?
Common sense, logic, reason...
Can I suggest some names?
You don't think raising money in America for the IRA will be affected?
- Morning, Mr. Cooley.
- And to you, madam.
How's business?
I came upon this first edition at an estate auction.
Can your man restore it?
- When do you want this by?
- Soon.
It's very pressing.
I'm not sure...
The binder may have some trouble with this.
- Is that so?
- I'll see what I can do.
- He's not a miracle worker, you know.
- Obviously, he's not, Mr. Cooley.
The best you can arrange then.
- Thanks, Mr. Cooley.
- Good day, madam.
Hello, Sean.
Don't mind if I ride with you, do you?
I disapprove of your deeds, Sean, but I can't bring myself to condemn you.
I can't because I understand where the hatred comes from.
I more than understand it.
But we're now very near the darkest hole in Great Britain and you still won't speak to me.
They're raising the bridge.
We'll be here five minutes.
Understood.
Mobile Three, Lymington.
Open the door!
- Open it or I'll kill him.
- What do we do?
- We open the door.
- Open it!
- For Christ's sake...
- But what?
Wait until they kill him, then open the door?
- Your guns.
- We are unarmed.
Just who the hell are you?
Get them out!
Get your head down.
- Get down on the bloody ground!
- Don't you fucking move!
- You'd think we'd forget about you?
- Unlock the cuffs.
Inspector Robert Highland.
This is a friend of mine.
We meet at last.
What's the pay for selling out your own people?
Get on with it and be on your way.
Very well.
If that's how you feel about it...
Come on, Cath!
- Have I got the tickets or what?
- I don't have them.
- I don't have them!
- They're on the fridge.
- Dad?
- Honey, there's plenty of time.
- Hello, Admiral.
- Morning, Jack.
- You know Marty Cantor.
- How's the shoulder?
Not too bad.
Something's come up.
Can we sit down and have a chat?
He escaped while they were moving him.
We think he's left the country.
Excuse me.
Let's deal in what we know and not what we don't.
We know he's escaped in Kent near the Channel.
If he's left the country...
Jack, listening?
The chances he'd come here are so remote I have trouble saying it.
Your first instinct was to come all the way here and tell me.
Marty, want to excuse us a few minutes?
I've got a few more weeks before school starts, but I gotta dig in and prepare a few lectures.
Wanna come look over what we got?
You might turn up something new.
You're asking me if I want to come back.
Yep.
- We'll go next week, honey.
- All right.
Sorry, Sean Miller escaped.
What does that mean?
They wanted me to know... thought I might be concerned.
I'm not!
The IRA's not stupid.
They won't follow me over here.
They agree.
They're gone.
That's it.
They didn't ask you to come back to CIA?
I said no.
Just like that.
I don't wanna go back, honey.
- I saw them coming and I just...
- I know.
I can't go back to that life again, you know.
Sally, wait up, honey.
I bet your cell was better than this.
Bloody Ritz in comparison.
At least you had your own toilet.
Cheer up.
You've just been spared from hell on earth.
- A word of gratitude might be in order.
- I don't feel like resting.
Laying about like a complacent tourist.
To build an army, we've got to train like soldiers.
We can't do that in Ireland.
- Bleedin' waste of time.
- There's laying about and laying low.
- There's a difference.
- Is there?
Lord Holmes should worry about complacency.
Next time he won't be so lucky.
Post him back to Whitehall in bits if that's what frees Irish prisoners.
That's not what I'm thinking of.
What Ryan has done can't be undone.
Stop thinking about it.
I can't.
How could this have happened?
Highland picked the day, the decoy routes, his men, and still they knew.
- He had two children, apparently.
- Tragic!
31 people knew your itinerary the day of your attack and of Miller's transfer five of whom are now dead.
I suggest limiting your appointments.
I will not have my itinerary dictated to me by terrorists.
The traitor had better pray to God I never find him.
We know you'll do your best, Sergeant.
- We don't know if we're coming home.
- We don't know if we're coming home.
- Stand, buckle up, shuffle to the door.
- Stand, buckle up, shuffle to the door.
Jump right out and shout Marine Corps!
Egesta appealed to Athens on what basis?
On what grounds?
Mr. Viederman...
Bad time for you?
Well... they said they'd be grateful.
Didn't they?
"Fight our battle.
The world will fear and respect you."
- Didn't the world fear Athens already?
- Didn't matter.
- Why not?
- Pride, sir.
That's the real battle they lost.
Attention on deck!
Attention to orders.
I've a presentation to make for service above and beyond the call of duty of a tourist.
Even a marine.
We recognise Professor John Ryan with the Order of the Purple Target.
And hope that he will duck next time lest he become part of history rather than a teacher of it.
- How old is he?
- Ten.
- Plate glass window?
- Yes.
- Here we go...
Hi, guys!
- Morning, Catherine.
I've got a retina at 1:00.
We might have to bump it.
This could take some time.
- Yep, let's bump it.
- We're all set.
OK, let's do it.
So, you just waded on in like John Wayne.
Why'd you do it?
What were you thinking, man?
- I don't know.
I wasn't thinking.
- That's it?
You sound like my students.
It just pissed me off.
I couldn't just watch him shoot those people in front of me.
It was... rage.
Pure rage...
Just made me mad.
Here's hoping you never get mad at me, man.
She's late, Sean.
And she was at this dance.
This guy, at the end, he...
- Kind of cute, isn't she?
- Is she?
Bye.
See ya.
- Hi, Mommy.
- Sweetie, how are you?
Let's do it.
Damn!
Highway 50.
West.
- Good night, Doc.
- Good night.
- Dr. Ryan...
- He's getting away.
Where's Sean Miller?
Where's Sean Miller?
- Dr. Catherine Ryan, please.
- Dr. Ryan, are you all right?
- How long?
- Dr. Ryan...
Come on!
Come on!
- Surgery.
- Yes, this is Dr. Ryan.
- Thomson retinal scan results, please.
- Hold, please.
Come on, get off the phone.
- Look, Mom!
- It's beautiful.
- Are you still holding?
- Yes, I'm still holding.
I'd like to speak with Dr. Sutton.
Operator, I want to cut into a phone call.
The number is 555-3464.
Yeah, it's a mobile phone.
What do you mean I can't?
Faster, damn it.
- Dr. Ryan?
The retinal scan is fine.
- That's great.
Thank you.
Jesus!
- Hello!
- Cathy...
Something's happened.
Is Sally with you?
- Yeah.
- Hi, Dad!
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.
- There she is!
- Right!
I want you to get off the highway and go to the nearest police station.
- The police station?
- Just get off the highway right now.
Steady, mate.
Steady.
- Where are you now?
- I'm at Rowe Blvd.
There's a state police barracks on Houston St. Meet you there.
- Is something wrong, Mom?
- No, everything's fine.
They're gone!
Coming in.
- Mr. Ryan?
- Yeah.
Your wife's OK.
She has a concussion.
- She's pregnant.
- The baby's OK.
Don't worry.
- What about my daughter?
- Let's sit down for a moment.
- No, talk to me.
It will be a while till we know.
Maybe in the morning.
Where's Sally?
She's in the Recovery Room.
They're watching her.
We'll know in 7 or 8 hours.
They removed her spleen.
She's in pretty bad shape.
I'm sorry.
In a moment, we expect a statement from Paddy O'Neill of Sinn Fein.
- Jack, here you go.
- O'Neill is in the US for fundraising.
You OK?
Here's Cary Johnson ready to speak with Paddy O'Neill.
I'm praying for the recovery of the victims of this senseless attack.
Sinn Fein and most Irish Catholics are outraged at this heinous crime.
I want to share with Dr. Ryan our empathy and anguish but I'll wait for a more appropriate time.
- Can you confirm that the IRA...?
- The IRA are not behind this attack.
- No more questions.
- Thank you, Mr. O'Neill.
- She's going to be OK.
- Thank you.
It's all right.
She's all right.
Mr. Ryan...
Mr. Ryan, I'd like to share with you our deep regret about...
Mr. Ryan!
Jack, you're involved!
It's not good process.
You're a crime victim.
That doesn't make for good analysis.
Even if you knew something about terrorism which you don't!
I have guys on it!
Guys who know all about the IRA...
I'm not standing here hat in hand!
I'm telling you I want back in.
- Jack...
- Sir...
Thank God about Sally.
Alice and I are relieved beyond words.
- You manage any sleep?
- Not much, sir.
I'm interrupting.
You were explaining how we're better off without Jack or something on those lines.
Marc Spiva, Jack Ryan, Tony Ferro.
- Hi.
- Alex Winter.
Nice to meet you, Alex.
- Well...
- Rose!
- You're looking better than I expected.
- It's an illusion.
It would have to be.
Good to see you, regardless.
We've carved a niche for you.
Here's your night table reading.
Oh, my!
"Father killed by RUC, Belfast, 1979."
Good morning.
Cut the engine, please.
Your I.D.?
- Did you see the game?
- It was all right.
- What the hell!
- Nobody move!
- Keep your hands off him.
- Get 'em up!
Mornin'.
Kevin O'Donnell, IRA strategist, friend of the Millers.
After Tim Miller was killed in '79, he looked after Sean and Patrick.
This photo's recent.
I think if we find O'Donnell, Miller will be at his side.
- Are you with me, Jack?
- Yeah, just thinking.
- What about the gun?
- Think it's registered?
- Son of a bitch!
- What?
SO-13 gets an anonymous tip about a bomb factory in a flat.
They get some IRA bad guys, but realise the tip was a set-up.
We got three IRA hitmen at a farm hit by somebody else.
That's British soldiers getting out of hand.
They're not above it.
No, look.
We got IRA brigade commander Jimmy O'Reardon.
He checks into a cheap hotel and ends up shot in the head.
- That's how long after the farmhouse?
- Same day.
- Same day!
- What are you coming to, Jack?
Jack!
Where are you going?
I'm going to throw some water on my face.
Jack!
Excuse me.
- One of us is in the wrong room.
- I'm sorry.
That's OK.
Jack!
When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it.
Common sense, logic...
Listen!
Who are we looking for?
IRA terrorists or some ultra-violent faction of the IRA?
Jimmy O'Reardon checked into a hotel with a woman with long red hair!
This is who we should be looking for!
We find her... we'll find him.
I saw his wife and daughter die, but she and Neddie blew it.
Ryan's still alive.
- They're not dead, Sean.
- What?
They survived it.
I can't say it plainer than that.
- It doesn't matter.
It served its purpose.
- It does matter!
America holds its breath whenever a little girl falls down a well.
You used a sub-machine gun on one returning from school.
We've started a war.
The Brits are tearing apart Belfast for the IRA.
Their American money deny the hits so loud, the IRA looks only more guilty.
The war is raging.
When it's over, we'll be the only ones left standing.
Sean, I let you go for Paddy Boy, but that's it!
We've got work to do and it's not in Maryland.
Hello.
- Yeah?
- How's the family, Ryan?
Nearly lost them, didn't you?
It's easy to get at them.
You should look after your family better.
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
Your little girl's feeling better, eh?
Lost her spleen.
Pity that.
Makes it tough on her to fight off infection, eh, Jacky?
You sick son of a bitch!
It was him, wasn't it?
He's never going to leave us alone.
He'll never get close to us again.
That's why he calls.
It's all he can do.
You get him, Jack.
I don't care what you do.
Just get him.
Can I buy you a drink?
No...
Let me buy you one.
Barney, two whiskies.
- The IRA's not responsible for all this.
- You waiting for me to agree?
- I've said this 'til I'm blue in the face.
- That's the point, isn't it?
You take credit for one thing, deny it for another.
Nobody believes you anymore.
I want to know where Sean Miller and Kevin O'Donnell are.
Let me understand this.
You want me to sell out my fellow Irishman to you.
Is that why you came here?
You don't know me at all.
I think I do!
I don't give a damn what they've done.
The day I sell out my countrymen is the day I put a bullet through my own head.
- That's it, then.
- That's it.
On second thought I won't have a drink with you.
- OK, then I'll go home.
- Have a safe trip.
I'll call the TV stations.
Let them film my daughter's hospital room.
Put it on the evening news.
I don't give a shit whether you did it or not.
Nor will anyone else.
I'll put such a stranglehold on your gun money you'll be back to throwing rocks.
I'll fucking destroy you!
It will be my mission in life!
Excuse me.
Lads, did you hear that?
Stand sideways, you're less of a target.
Yes!
Satellite's coming!
Celts, let's go!
Get inside!
So...
SO-13 traced the weapons in the Lord Holmes incident to an arms dealer that supplies Qaddafi.
When Sean escaped, he was last seen in the Channel in a gale which didn't figure until I checked the freighters out there that day.
Syrian registry, carrying arms to client states including Qaddafi.
- Sean takes a slow boat to Libya.
- Exactly!
Our satellites photograph how many camps?
- 182.
- 182 camps a day in North Africa.
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade, Action Directe, German Red Army...
The day this ship docked, there are only 9 camps with people arriving.
This one we know for sure is PLO.
This one Shining Path.
These seven we're not so sure about.
Why?
We've got satellites in...
Because those camps know exactly when the satellites pass over.
Unless you retask those satellites so we can get a real look we'll never know which camp they're at.
Do you know how big a deal it is to retask those satellites?
Yeah.
Bring up Camp 18 again.
Tighten on the camp here.
Let's look up in here.
See what we can see.
Show me this grouping here.
No, there's nothing.
Go back to the bigger picture.
Let me see down here.
What's that?
Tighten up on that, will you?
Can you enhance that?
Sharpen it up?
Tits.
SAS could take out this camp in under two minutes.
Kill everybody there and be gone before the echo fades.
Are you sure it's the same woman?
Keep at it, then.
Son of a bitch.
Hi.
Read it again, Daddy.
"The sun did not shine.
It was too wet to play.
"So we sat in the house all that cold, cold, wet day."
"I sat there with Sally, we sat there, we two.
"And I said:
How I wish we had something to do!
"Too wet to go out, too cold to play ball.
"So we sat in the house, we did nothing at all.
"So all we could do was just sit, sit, sit, sit.
"And we did not like it, not one little bit.
"And then, something went boom."
Paddy O'Neill can sleep at night.
In fact, he probably enjoys the irony.
She's not Irish.
She's English.
This is the girl you saw in the blink of an eye in a jeep doing 40mph?
- Yeah.
- What am I supposed to do here?
Tell SO-13 her name.
Give them her picture.
Tell them about the rare books.
- What do you mean "what do you do?"
- What about you, Jack?
You walk into an IRA bar.
You approach the IRA's bagman and in front of his guys, you threaten him?
You never were a field man.
You are an analyst.
Analyse that!
I'm not after your job, Marty.
- I'm after Sean Miller.
- Then, think!
You tell O'Neill you're looking for a girl.
He obliges you with some pictures.
And you believe him?
I didn't tell him I was looking for a girl.
Sergeant...
Come and look at this.
A bit of a bookworm myself.
Not that I look it.
What's your passion?
Mysteries?
Spy novels?
Lan Fleming?
- This is a rare bookshop.
- Rare books?
So they are.
- Will you locate the problem?
- I already have.
Your wiring dates from before World War I.
It's what we call in the electrical business: "rare".
- Can you fix it?
- Sure.
- Fix it!
- Can you afford it?
Just fix it!
Hello!
- He's seen it?
- I don't know.
He's got it.
Look.
What do you make of this?
I have no idea!
Damn!
I have to go out now for a few minutes to deliver some books.
- Please, keep about your repairs.
- I'll be here all week.
Don't worry.
He's mine!
Damn!
- The White House dinner's no problem.
- What is the problem?
No problem.
Just running out of dates.
We could do that.
Move that to there which would leave us... the 14th?
- The 14th.
- Geoffrey...
Let's schedule a presentation dinner at our embassy in Washington on the... - ...14th.
- The 14th!
Let's cover this again so I can get it clear.
We start in Washington...
- Geoffrey Watkins.
- I'm trying to reach Mr. Titus.
- Is that Ext. 2691?
- No, it's 2619.
I'm terribly sorry.
- Why are you up?
Go back to bed.
- I want to be there when she wakes up.
- I'll go with you, then take a cab back.
- OK.
- Hello.
- Sir John Ryan, please.
Just a minute.
It's for you, Sir John.
Mr. Ryan has a special celebration that evening.
- He invited you to join them.
- Where?
At his house?
Yes, sir.
Why not?
We shot this eight days ago in Berlin.
One...
Two...
Three...
Four Brits travelling with him.
- Light arms.
- The heavy stuff's in the cars.
He's German...
He's German.
This boring you, Sean?
Six altogether.
Should be the same security when Holmes's in Washington.
You got to find the moment when he's unprotected.
Four days, Washington.
One day, New York... shopping.
Yeah...
Two Caucasians.
Take a look at the one with the hat.
- His arms look a little pink.
- Sunburn.
New arrival.
What do you think?
Same guy?
That rare book dealer, Dennis Cooley, is bald.
It's possible there could be a woman in some of these camps but with her and Cooley in the same place.
If that is Cooley...
The odds of coincidence are dropping fast.
Still, there's no way I can be...
absolutely certain.
Excuse me, Jack.
Tell me one thing in life that is absolutely for certain.
My daughter's love.
What I need to hear is your best guess and I think I've heard it.
Haven't I?
The bastards took away my book shop.
And my books!
I'm sorry, you can't come.
You haven't got the training.
This mission is messy.
I can fire a gun.
Sorry, Dennis.
- Where are you taking me, Marty?
- You've taken us, Jack...
- Satellite now entering target area.
...into battle.
Enlargement Sector Four.
Airborne Support approaching target.
E. T.A. 35 seconds.
SAS team on ground.
- Enlarge Camp 18.
- Enlarging it.
- Enlarge primary target.
- Enlarging.
That is a kill!
Targets have been neutralised.
Keyhole is passing out of vision.
It's over.
- Roger that.
- Would your men outside like coffee?
No thank you.
They're fine.
Thank you, Sally, for inviting us to your homecoming.
You're a lovely young lady.
My pleasure to finally met you.
You're welcome.
- Can I do the presentation after dinner?
- Sure.
Would you like to see it now...?
Geoffrey!
- That's very nice.
- Didn't I already give you one of those?
Is that your second piece of cake, my little sweetie?
- Where's the bathroom, Jack?
- Second door on the left.
- More coffee anyone?
- I'd love some.
- Excuse me.
- Here it comes.
Bathroom?
Someone in there?
That's not it.
That's the basement.
- Jack...?
Marty.
- Hey, what's going on?
Sorry to interrupt the party, but you need to know right away.
- SAS made positive I.D. On Cooley.
- What about the others?
It's pretty messy.
We need to verify the dental records.
But they're on top of it.
- Oh, great.
- What?
The storm caused a black-out.
I've got to light candles.
- I'll light one for you too.
- OK, Marty, thanks.
- Here we go!
- What?
Forget to pay your bill?
- Robert...!
Funny.
- Is everyone all right?
Fine, Jack.
This doesn't happen often, Lord Holmes.
Only when royalty visit.
- Is something wrong?
- Come with me.
If the storm had cut the lights, they'd be out in the boathouse too.
Power comes in from the street, branching off to here.
Jesus...
This is Ryan.
Any DSS agent?
Any DSS agent?
This is Ryan.
Federal Troopers.
Anyone?
Is anyone reading me?
Anybody?
- Can I play when the lights go on?
- Sweetie pie, you need some sleep.
Goddamnit!
- Don't tell me.
- Quite a storm.
Take your hands off me.
What do you think you're doing?
- Gun!
- Jack!
Stay right there!
Rob, over here.
How many are coming?
Where's Sean Miller?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Give me the gun.
Five, six... maybe more.
I'll get the others.
Don't turn on the lights.
- Take this.
In the basement, quick!
- Cathy's upstairs putting Sally to bed.
What's wrong?
Come on, Ryan.
Show yourself.
- Annette, upstairs.
- Right.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
What's wrong, Mommy?
Now, you've got to help.
Hide behind the suits.
Oh, God, Jack.
What did you do with the shells?
Go, go, go!
Get down!
Get back!
You all right?
- Daddy.
- Sally!
It's OK, honey.
Come on, come on!
Honey, you just got to be real quiet.
Gotcha!
Christ!
Come on.
- Who is off the air?
- DSS, state troopers, the security rep.
Give me Hostage Rescue, now!
Robby...!
Open up!
Robby, it's us.
Jack!
- They're outside.
- Cool it.
Can't ransom a dead Royal.
- They're all over the place.
- Stay close to me.
How were you going to get away?
Want to go for the other knee?
Boats.
At the bottom of the cliff.
There are ropes.
Kevin!
You've killed him!
No, Sean.
No!
We need Holmes alive.
- We're past that.
- Alive!
Come on!
- Any contact?
- Still off the air.
There he is!
Stay down!
Come on, you bastards!
Come on!
Come on!
He's alone.
He's leading us away from the Royal.
Turn around, Sean.
- No!
- Turn it around, Sean.
- No!
- Sean!
Turn around!
- Forget about Ryan.
- Don't blow the mission now, boy!
That's not my mission.
You crazy bastard!
- Had enough to eat?
Some toast?
- Pancakes.
- No time for pancakes.
Want toast?
- Toast.
- Somebody going to get that?
- Getting it.
- Sally.
- Hello.
Yes, it is.
Hold on a second.
- It's Dr. Zaillian.
- The amnio.
- Hello.
- Is it gonna be OK?
It's gonna be fine, honey.
We're just waiting to find out.
- Great!
- Want strawberry on your toast?
Hold on...
Want to know what it is?
- Did he tell you?
- He's asking.
I'm asking you.
- I don't know.
Do you want to know?
- I don't know.
Do you?
I wanted to know, but now I'm not sure.
- Hold on.
We're discussing it.
- Neither.
I do and I don't.
He's waiting.
OK...!
Tell us.
OK, tell us.
Thank you!
(ENGLISH)
We can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave a message.
Thanks.
Mamie, it's Jack.
We're leaving London as planned.
We'll take a cab from the airport.
No need to pick us up.
Eight...
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
You already own that!
You own everything.
We forgot about Sally's goldfish.
If they're alive, can you feed them?
Mom will make my move.
And if they're not, will you go to the store and buy similar ones?
See you soon.
Bye.
What's happening?
- Yes!
- Oh, no!
Another hotel!
- What does he owe you?
- You owe me £1,1 OO.
I don't have it.
You win!
- This girl is rich!
- Time to go to sleep.
- Good evening, sir.
- Yes?
Will these do?
Yeah, bring them in...
My wife, I guess.
Candles, champagne...
Sorry I didn't think of this.
That's all right.
Only one of us had to.
- Is she asleep?
- Yep.
- What about your speech?
- I'll wing it.
- You're sure?
- Yep.
We've viewed with awe the protean events occurring in the former USSR.
Enormous changes have resulted from these events.
We can now only speculate on the future of Soviet fleet deployment.
Thanks to the Royal Naval Academy for inviting me to speak here today.
He's impressed, Sally.
It's just he's a professional soldier.
It's his job not to be distracted.
Come on, we gotta go meet Daddy.
I'm impressed.
- Find it on the map?
- Yeah, we turn left... no, right.
- You're sure?
- Turn right, yes.
We're gonna turn right.
I'm following your map.
You mind your bottom, Paddy Boy.
Move sure and fast.
- You told me that, didn't ya?
- I'm telling you again...
This is like nothing you've done before, little brother.
- Target leaving the Palace now.
- Right.
Stay awake, lads.
Here they come.
Is that good?
A little more?
There's Daddy!
Go!
Down!
Get down!
Move in!
Get down!
Come!
Get down!
Keep her down!
Get out of the car!
Come on!
Get out!
Open the fucking door!
British!
Open it or I'll blow you up.
Come on, let's go!
Go, go, go!
Paddy?
Stop!
Army!
Drop it!
Help the boy.
No, he's had it.
It's all right, sweetie.
Everything's going to be OK.
- Stand back, ma'am.
- That's my husband.
I'm a doctor.
I will treat him.
Jesus, Jack.
What were you thinking of?
I'm going to set you down, OK?
Stay with me, Jack.
You hear me?
Jack, stay with me.
The feeling here is outrage at the terrorist attack on the Royal Family.
While no group has yet claimed credit, there is speculation of IRA involvement.
Lord Holmes, the Queen Mother's cousin and Northern Ireland Minister would have died were it not for the heroism of-
- John Patrick Ryan, an American tourist who thwarted the terrorist attack.
A professor at the US Naval Academy, Ryan is a former marine lieutenant.
Wounded in the attack, Ryan is being treated at an undisclosed hospital.
Debora Weston, CNN News, London.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
You're alive.
I forgive you.
Otherwise...
Hey, pumpkin.
I love you.
I love you too.
You dignify their cowardice with your silence.
They left you.
They drove off without you.
I wonder why you think you owe them.
If my mates drove off and left me in your hands, I'd not only feel no loyalty -
- I'd make sure to kill them.
Who are they, Sean?
Where are they?
The trip was unscheduled.
How'd you know Lord Holmes would be there?
I can't help you if you won't talk.
I'd tear your heart out and serve it to you with chips, you Fenian bastard!
Not in all eternity will Sean chirp a word.
Not while his brother lies on a slab.
What's the matter, Jimmy?
Don't you believe it?
It's the entire thing, I don't believe.
The Royal Family, Kevin...
You know that only turns people against us.
This was totally unauthorised.
- We all know you were behind it.
- Fuck the bloody IRA!
All these years of war have got us nowhere.
In its heart England is still a monarchy.
That is where we must strike.
At the royals and the ruling class.
You're either with us or against us, Jimmy Boy.
Make up your mind!
I'm with you.
Good.
That's all I wanted to hear.
I'll leave you to it.
Kevin, Charlie's dropping by tonight to try and straighten things out.
Be smart.
Talk to him.
And hold your temper.
I promise.
Thanks, Jimmy.
Kevin!
Kevin, lad!
It's me, Charlie.
That's me holding my temper, Jimmy Boy.
- Oh, damn.
I forgot.
- What?
Where's my bag?
Please don't make me wear a rubber.
The Church says it's a sin, darling.
So is this!
Darling!
So, what can you tell me about...
this guy?
Sean?
He's a nice boy...
Sean Miller.
Shot a parish priest in Derry.
During confession.
He thought the Father was informing.
Excuse me, it's not in Mr. Ryan's best interests or the prosecution's to discuss matters not related to the events at hand.
If you confirm that the man in the photo is the one you disarmed in the square -
- I think we'll be through.
I can.
You have anything to add, Mr. Ryan?
Yes, the man I killed was Miller's brother.
- Brother.
Patrick.
Not even 17, "Paddy Boy".
Recruited by Sean into the IRA.
The idea is to preserve the clarity of your eventual testimony.
I read it in the newspaper.
- Please don't read the newspapers.
- Not even Doonesbury?
Do you have anything to add?
No.
Mr. Ryan, I'm Geoffrey Watkins.
Private Secretary to Lord Holmes.
- Pleasure.
My wife Catherine.
- How do you do?
- So, Doctor, is your patient healing?
- We're looking forward to going home.
I can imagine.
May I introduce His Lordship?
- Hello.
- It's my great honour to meet you.
- Thank you.
- I am eternally indebted to you.
Thanks for the kind note.
I'm delighted you're here to share the good news, Mrs. Ryan.
Her Majesty's decided to invest your husband K.C.V. O -
- Knight Commander of the Victorian Order.
My congratulations, sir.
Good luck today.
- "Sir Jack"?
- Lady Catherine.
If I'd had more time to think, I might have done something else.
- You're saying you didn't have time.
- That's correct.
- So, you didn't...
- Didn't what?
Think so.
You didn't think is the point you're trying to make.
No, instead you raced into a situation of which by your own admission, you had no understanding attacked my client, who was, in fact, another pedestrian hurrying to help...
In a ski mask?
...shot a 2nd man in the chest this one taking you...
After they shot me!
...three shots point blank to kill the 2nd victim.
I used that force I deemed necessary.
I should say so.
I doubt whether anyone in this court would disagree.
- Excuse me, I didn't cause this, sir.
- No further questions.
- He did!
- My Lord, there is one more question.
Are you still, Dr. Ryan, in the paid service of the CIA?
I should remind you that you're under oath.
- No.
- I beg your pardon.
- No.
- That's all.
Thank you.
The witness may stand down.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, this is an appropriate moment...
Bloody proud of yourself, aren't you?
Stuck your nose where it didn't belong.
Now you've killed my baby brother.
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, pumpkin.
Wow, you guys have really grown!
- How are you feeling?
- Not so good.
- Tired?
- No.
I've no idea what time it is.
Feels like morning.
You're telling me!
- Did I miss something?
- No.
But I did!
I'm pregnant.
Honey!
Can I watch some TV?
I'm not at all tired.
What?
- Plates.
- I don't have any say in this, do I?
This is a family.
Everybody's got a say.
But my say is after the fact.
Or am I wrong?
- No, you're right.
- Michaela despises her little sister.
Ready for this?
It could be even worse... a baby brother.
Oh, no.
Boys!
- Jack!
- True.
Boys are...
You deny the IRA was behind the assassination attempt?
When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it.
That's the policy.
They proudly say they did it.
Have the IRA admitted to this?
Common sense, logic, reason...
Can I suggest some names?
You don't think raising money in America for the IRA will be affected?
- Morning, Mr. Cooley.
- And to you, madam.
How's business?
I came upon this first edition at an estate auction.
Can your man restore it?
- When do you want this by?
- Soon.
It's very pressing.
I'm not sure...
The binder may have some trouble with this.
- Is that so?
- I'll see what I can do.
- He's not a miracle worker, you know.
- Obviously, he's not, Mr. Cooley.
The best you can arrange then.
- Thanks, Mr. Cooley.
- Good day, madam.
Hello, Sean.
Don't mind if I ride with you, do you?
I disapprove of your deeds, Sean, but I can't bring myself to condemn you.
I can't because I understand where the hatred comes from.
I more than understand it.
But we're now very near the darkest hole in Great Britain and you still won't speak to me.
They're raising the bridge.
We'll be here five minutes.
Understood.
Mobile Three, Lymington.
Open the door!
- Open it or I'll kill him.
- What do we do?
- We open the door.
- Open it!
- For Christ's sake...
- But what?
Wait until they kill him, then open the door?
- Your guns.
- We are unarmed.
Just who the hell are you?
Get them out!
Get your head down.
- Get down on the bloody ground!
- Don't you fucking move!
- You'd think we'd forget about you?
- Unlock the cuffs.
Inspector Robert Highland.
This is a friend of mine.
We meet at last.
What's the pay for selling out your own people?
Get on with it and be on your way.
Very well.
If that's how you feel about it...
Come on, Cath!
- Have I got the tickets or what?
- I don't have them.
- I don't have them!
- They're on the fridge.
- Dad?
- Honey, there's plenty of time.
- Hello, Admiral.
- Morning, Jack.
- You know Marty Cantor.
- How's the shoulder?
Not too bad.
Something's come up.
Can we sit down and have a chat?
He escaped while they were moving him.
We think he's left the country.
Excuse me.
Let's deal in what we know and not what we don't.
We know he's escaped in Kent near the Channel.
If he's left the country...
Jack, listening?
The chances he'd come here are so remote I have trouble saying it.
Your first instinct was to come all the way here and tell me.
Marty, want to excuse us a few minutes?
I've got a few more weeks before school starts, but I gotta dig in and prepare a few lectures.
Wanna come look over what we got?
You might turn up something new.
You're asking me if I want to come back.
Yep.
- We'll go next week, honey.
- All right.
Sorry, Sean Miller escaped.
What does that mean?
They wanted me to know... thought I might be concerned.
I'm not!
The IRA's not stupid.
They won't follow me over here.
They agree.
They're gone.
That's it.
They didn't ask you to come back to CIA?
I said no.
Just like that.
I don't wanna go back, honey.
- I saw them coming and I just...
- I know.
I can't go back to that life again, you know.
Sally, wait up, honey.
I bet your cell was better than this.
Bloody Ritz in comparison.
At least you had your own toilet.
Cheer up.
You've just been spared from hell on earth.
- A word of gratitude might be in order.
- I don't feel like resting.
Laying about like a complacent tourist.
To build an army, we've got to train like soldiers.
We can't do that in Ireland.
- Bleedin' waste of time.
- There's laying about and laying low.
- There's a difference.
- Is there?
Lord Holmes should worry about complacency.
Next time he won't be so lucky.
Post him back to Whitehall in bits if that's what frees Irish prisoners.
That's not what I'm thinking of.
What Ryan has done can't be undone.
Stop thinking about it.
I can't.
How could this have happened?
Highland picked the day, the decoy routes, his men, and still they knew.
- He had two children, apparently.
- Tragic!
31 people knew your itinerary the day of your attack and of Miller's transfer five of whom are now dead.
I suggest limiting your appointments.
I will not have my itinerary dictated to me by terrorists.
The traitor had better pray to God I never find him.
We know you'll do your best, Sergeant.
- We don't know if we're coming home.
- We don't know if we're coming home.
- Stand, buckle up, shuffle to the door.
- Stand, buckle up, shuffle to the door.
Jump right out and shout Marine Corps!
Egesta appealed to Athens on what basis?
On what grounds?
Mr. Viederman...
Bad time for you?
Well... they said they'd be grateful.
Didn't they?
"Fight our battle.
The world will fear and respect you."
- Didn't the world fear Athens already?
- Didn't matter.
- Why not?
- Pride, sir.
That's the real battle they lost.
Attention on deck!
Attention to orders.
I've a presentation to make for service above and beyond the call of duty of a tourist.
Even a marine.
We recognise Professor John Ryan with the Order of the Purple Target.
And hope that he will duck next time lest he become part of history rather than a teacher of it.
- How old is he?
- Ten.
- Plate glass window?
- Yes.
- Here we go...
Hi, guys!
- Morning, Catherine.
I've got a retina at 1:
OO.
We might have to bump it.
This could take some time.
- Yep, let's bump it.
- We're all set.
OK, let's do it.
So, you just waded on in like John Wayne.
Why'd you do it?
What were you thinking, man?
- I don't know.
I wasn't thinking.
- That's it?
You sound like my students.
It just pissed me off.
I couldn't just watch him shoot those people in front of me.
It was... rage.
Pure rage...
Just made me mad.
Here's hoping you never get mad at me, man.
She's late, Sean.
And she was at this dance.
This guy, at the end, he...
- Kind of cute, isn't she?
- Is she?
Bye.
See ya.
- Hi, Mommy.
- Sweetie, how are you?
Let's do it.
Damn!
Highway 5O.
West.
- Good night, Doc.
- Good night.
- Dr. Ryan...
- He's getting away.
Where's Sean Miller?
Where's Sean Miller?
- Dr. Catherine Ryan, please.
- Dr. Ryan, are you all right?
- How long?
- Dr. Ryan...
Come on!
Come on!
- Surgery.
- Yes, this is Dr. Ryan.
- Thomson retinal scan results, please.
- Hold, please.
Come on, get off the phone.
- Look, Mom!
- It's beautiful.
- Are you still holding?
- Yes, I'm still holding.
I'd like to speak with Dr. Sutton.
Operator, I want to cut into a phone call.
The number is 555-3464.
Yeah, it's a mobile phone.
What do you mean I can't?
Faster, damn it.
- Dr. Ryan?
The retinal scan is fine.
- That's great.
Thank you.
Jesus!
- Hello!
- Cathy...
Something's happened.
Is Sally with you?
- Yeah.
- Hi, Dad!
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.
- There she is!
- Right!
I want you to get off the highway and go to the nearest police station.
- The police station?
- Just get off the highway right now.
Steady, mate.
Steady.
- Where are you now?
- I'm at Rowe Blvd.
There's a state police barracks on Houston St. Meet you there.
- Is something wrong, Mom?
- No, everything's fine.
They're gone!
Coming in.
- Mr. Ryan?
- Yeah.
Your wife's OK.
She has a concussion.
- She's pregnant.
- The baby's OK.
Don't worry.
- What about my daughter?
- Let's sit down for a moment.
- No, talk to me.
It will be a while till we know.
Maybe in the morning.
Where's Sally?
She's in the Recovery Room.
They're watching her.
We'll know in 7 or 8 hours.
They removed her spleen.
She's in pretty bad shape.
I'm sorry.
In a moment, we expect a statement from Paddy O'Neill of Sinn Fein.
- Jack, here you go.
- O'Neill is in the US for fundraising.
You OK?
Here's Cary Johnson ready to speak with Paddy O'Neill.
I'm praying for the recovery of the victims of this senseless attack.
Sinn Fein and most Irish Catholics are outraged at this heinous crime.
I want to share with Dr. Ryan our empathy and anguish but I'll wait for a more appropriate time.
- Can you confirm that the IRA?
- The IRA are not behind this attack.
- No more questions.
- Thank you, Mr. O'Neill.
- She's going to be OK.
- Thank you.
It's all right.
She's all right.
Mr. Ryan...
Mr. Ryan, I'd like to share with you our deep regret about...
Mr. Ryan!
Jack, you're involved!
It's not good process.
You're a crime victim.
That doesn't make for good analysis.
Even if you knew something about terrorism which you don't!
I have guys on it!
Guys who know all about the IRA...
I'm not standing here hat in hand!
I'm telling you I want back in.
- Jack...
- Sir...
Thank God about Sally.
Alice and I are relieved beyond words.
- You manage any sleep?
- Not much, sir.
I'm interrupting.
You were explaining how we're better off without Jack or something on those lines.
Marc Spiva, Jack Ryan, Tony Ferro.
- Hi.
- Alex Winter.
Nice to meet you, Alex.
- Well...
- Rose!
- You're looking better than I expected.
- It's an illusion.
It would have to be.
Good to see you, regardless.
We've carved a niche for you.
Here's your night table reading.
Oh, my!
"Father killed by RUC, Belfast, 1979."
Good morning.
Cut the engine, please.
Your I. D?
- Did you see the game?
- It was all right.
- What the hell!
- Nobody move!
- Keep your hands off him.
- Get 'em up!
Mornin'.
Kevin O'Donnell, IRA strategist, friend of the Millers.
After Tim Miller was killed in '79, he looked after Sean and Patrick.
This photo's recent.
I think if we find O'Donnell, Miller will be at his side.
- Are you with me, Jack?
- Yeah, just thinking.
- What about the gun?
- Think it's registered?
- Son of a bitch!
- What?
SO-13 gets an anonymous tip about a bomb factory in a flat.
They get some IRA bad guys, but realise the tip was a set-up.
We got three IRA hitmen at a farm hit by somebody else.
That's British soldiers getting out of hand.
They're not above it.
No, look.
We got IRA brigade commander Jimmy O'Reardon.
He checks into a cheap hotel and ends up shot in the head.
- That's how long after the farmhouse?
- Same day.
- Same day!
- What are you coming to, Jack?
Jack!
Where are you going?
I'm going to throw some water on my face.
Jack!
Excuse me.
- One of us is in the wrong room.
- I'm sorry.
That's OK.
Jack!
When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it.
Common sense, logic...
Listen!
Who are we looking for?
IRA terrorists or some ultra-violent faction of the IRA?
Jimmy O'Reardon checked into a hotel with a woman with long red hair!
This is who we should be looking for!
We find her... we'll find him.
I saw his wife and daughter die, but she and Neddie blew it.
Ryan's still alive.
- They're not dead, Sean.
- What?
They survived it.
I can't say it plainer than that.
- It doesn't matter.
It served its purpose.
- It does matter!
America holds its breath whenever a little girl falls down a well.
You used a sub-machine gun on one returning from school.
We've started a war.
The Brits are tearing apart Belfast for the IRA.
Their American money deny the hits so loud, the IRA looks only more guilty.
The war is raging.
When it's over, we'll be the only ones left standing.
Sean, I let you go for Paddy Boy, but that's it!
We've got work to do and it's not in Maryland.
Hello.
- Yeah?
- How's the family, Ryan?
Nearly lost them, didn't you?
It's easy to get at them.
You should look after your family better.
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
Your little girl's feeling better, eh?
Lost her spleen.
Pity that.
Makes it tough on her to fight off infection, eh, Jacky?
You sick son of a bitch!
It was him, wasn't it?
He's never going to leave us alone.
He'll never get close to us again.
That's why he calls.
It's all he can do.
You get him, Jack.
I don't care what you do.
Just get him.
Can I buy you a drink?
No...
Let me buy you one.
Barney, two whiskies.
- The IRA's not responsible for all this.
- You waiting for me to agree?
- I've said this 'til I'm blue in the face.
- That's the point, isn't it?
You take credit for one thing, deny it for another.
Nobody believes you anymore.
I want to know where Sean Miller and Kevin O'Donnell are.
Let me understand this.
You want me to sell out my fellow Irishman to you.
Is that why you came here?
You don't know me at all.
I think I do!
I don't give a damn what they've done.
The day I sell out my countrymen is the day I put a bullet through my own head.
- That's it, then.
- That's it.
On second thought I won't have a drink with you.
- OK, then I'll go home.
- Have a safe trip.
I'll call the TV stations.
Let them film my daughter's hospital room.
Put it on the evening news.
I don't give a shit whether you did it or not.
Nor will anyone else.
I'll put such a stranglehold on your gun money you'll be back to throwing rocks.
I'll fucking destroy you!
It will be my mission in life!
Excuse me.
Lads, did you hear that?
Stand sideways, you're less of a target.
Yes!
Satellite's coming!
Celts, let's go!
Get inside!
So...
SO-13 traced the weapons in the Lord Holmes incident to an arms dealer that supplies Qaddafi.
When Sean escaped, he was last seen in the Channel in a gale which didn't figure until I checked the freighters out there that day.
Syrian registry, carrying arms to client states including Qaddafi.
- Sean takes a slow boat to Libya.
- Exactly!
Our satellites photograph how many camps?
- 182.
- 182 camps a day in North Africa.
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade, Action Directe, German Red Army...
The day this ship docked, there are only 9 camps with people arriving.
This one we know for sure is PLO.
This one Shining Path.
These seven we're not so sure about.
Why?
We've got satellites in...
Because those camps know exactly when the satellites pass over.
Unless you retask those satellites so we can get a real look we'll never know which camp they're at.
Do you know how big a deal it is to retask those satellites?
Yeah.
Bring up Camp 18 again.
Tighten on the camp here.
Let's look up in here.
See what we can see.
Show me this grouping here.
No, there's nothing.
Go back to the bigger picture.
Let me see down here.
What's that?
Tighten up on that, will you?
Can you enhance that?
Sharpen it up?
Tits.
SAS could take out this camp in under two minutes.
Kill everybody there and be gone before the echo fades.
Are you sure it's the same woman?
Keep at it, then.
Son of a bitch.
Hi.
Read it again, Daddy.
"The sun did not shine.
It was too wet to play.
"So we sat in the house all that cold, cold, wet day."
"I sat there with Sally, we sat there, we two.
"And I said:
How I wish we had something to do!
"Too wet to go out, too cold to play ball.
"So we sat in the house, we did nothing at all.
"So all we could do was just sit, sit, sit, sit.
"And we did not like it, not one little bit.
"And then, something went boom."
Paddy O'Neill can sleep at night.
In fact, he probably enjoys the irony.
She's not Irish.
She's English.
This is the girl you saw in the blink of an eye in a jeep doing 4Omph?
- Yeah.
- What am I supposed to do here?
Tell SO-13 her name.
Give them her picture.
Tell them about the rare books.
- What do you mean "what do you do?"
- What about you, Jack?
You walk into an IRA bar.
You approach the IRA's bagman and in front of his guys, you threaten him?
You never were a field man.
You are an analyst.
Analyse that!
I'm not after your job, Marty.
- I'm after Sean Miller.
- Then, think!
You tell O'Neill you're looking for a girl.
He obliges you with some pictures.
And you believe him?
I didn't tell him I was looking for a girl.
Sergeant...
Come and look at this.
A bit of a bookworm myself.
Not that I look it.
What's your passion?
Mysteries?
Spy novels?
Ian Fleming?
- This is a rare bookshop.
- Rare books?
So they are.
- Will you locate the problem?
- I already have.
Your wiring dates from before World War I.
It's what we call in the electrical business: "rare".
- Can you fix it?
- Sure.
- Fix it!
- Can you afford it?
Just fix it!
Hello!
- He's seen it?
- I don't know.
He's got it.
Look.
What do you make of this?
I have no idea!
Damn!
I have to go out now for a few minutes to deliver some books.
- Please, keep about your repairs.
- I'll be here all week.
Don't worry.
He's mine!
Damn!
- The White House dinner's no problem.
- What is the problem?
No problem.
Just running out of dates.
We could do that.
Move that to there which would leave us... the 14th?
- The 14th.
- Geoffrey...
Let's schedule a presentation dinner at our embassy in Washington on the... - ...14th.
- The 14th!
Let's cover this again so I can get it clear.
We start in Washington...
- Geoffrey Watkins.
- I'm trying to reach Mr. Titus.
- Is that Ext. 2691?
- No, it's 2619.
I'm terribly sorry.
- Why are you up?
Go back to bed.
- I want to be there when she wakes up.
- I'll go with you, then take a cab back.
- OK.
- Hello.
- Sir John Ryan, please.
Just a minute.
It's for you, Sir John.
Mr. Ryan has a special celebration that evening.
- He invited you to join them.
- Where?
At his house?
Yes, sir.
Why not?
We shot this eight days ago in Berlin.
One...
Two...
Three...
Four Brits travelling with him.
- Light arms.
- The heavy stuff's in the cars.
He's German...
He's German.
This boring you, Sean?
Six altogether.
Should be the same security when Holmes's in Washington.
You got to find the moment when he's unprotected.
Four days, Washington.
One day, New York... shopping.
Yeah...
Two Caucasians.
Take a look at the one with the hat.
- His arms look a little pink.
- Sunburn.
New arrival.
What do you think?
Same guy?
That rare book dealer, Dennis Cooley, is bald.
It's possible there could be a woman in some of these camps but with her and Cooley in the same place.
If that is Cooley...
The odds of coincidence are dropping fast.
Still, there's no way I can be...
absolutely certain.
Excuse me, Jack.
Tell me one thing in life that is absolutely for certain.
My daughter's love.
What I need to hear is your best guess and I think I've heard it.
Haven't I?
The bastards took away my book shop.
And my books!
I'm sorry, you can't come.
You haven't got the training.
This mission is messy.
I can fire a gun.
Sorry, Dennis.
- Where are you taking me, Marty?
- You've taken us, Jack...
- Satellite now entering target area.
...into battle.
Enlargement Sector Four.
Airborne Support approaching target.
E. T.A. 35 seconds.
SAS team on ground.
- Enlarge Camp 18.
- Enlarging it.
- Enlarge primary target.
- Enlarging.
That is a kill!
Targets have been neutralised.
Keyhole is passing out of vision.
It's over.
- Roger that.
- Would your men outside like coffee?
No thank you.
They're fine.
Thank you, Sally, for inviting us to your homecoming.
You're a lovely young lady.
My pleasure to finally met you.
You're welcome.
- Can I do the presentation after dinner?
- Sure.
Would you like to see it now?
Geoffrey!
- That's very nice.
- Didn't I already give you one of those?
Is that your second piece of cake, my little sweetie?
- Where's the bathroom, Jack?
- Second door on the left.
- More coffee anyone?
- I'd love some.
- Excuse me.
- Here it comes.
Bathroom?
Someone in there?
That's not it.
That's the basement.
- Jack...?
Marty.
- Hey, what's going on?
Sorry to interrupt the party, but you need to know right away.
- SAS made positive I.D. On Cooley.
- What about the others?
It's pretty messy.
We need to verify the dental records.
But they're on top of it.
- Oh, great.
- What?
The storm caused a black-out.
I've got to light candles.
- I'll light one for you too.
- OK, Marty, thanks.
- Here we go!
- What?
Forget to pay your bill?
- Robert...!
Funny.
- Is everyone all right?
Fine, Jack.
This doesn't happen often, Lord Holmes.
Only when royalty visit.
- Is something wrong?
- Come with me.
If the storm had cut the lights, they'd be out in the boathouse too.
Power comes in from the street, branching off to here.
Jesus...
This is Ryan.
Any DSS agent?
Any DSS agent?
This is Ryan.
Federal Troopers.
Anyone?
Is anyone reading me?
Anybody?
- Can I play when the lights go on?
- Sweetie pie, you need some sleep.
Goddamnit!
- Don't tell me.
- Quite a storm.
Take your hands off me.
What do you think you're doing?
- Gun!
- Jack!
Stay right there!
Rob, over here.
How many are coming?
Where's Sean Miller?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Give me the gun.
Five, six... maybe more.
I'll get the others.
Don't turn on the lights.
- Take this.
In the basement, quick!
- Cathy's upstairs putting Sally to bed.
What's wrong?
Come on, Ryan.
Show yourself.
- Annette, upstairs.
- Right.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
What's wrong, Mommy?
Now, you've got to help.
Hide behind the suits.
Oh, God, Jack.
What did you do with the shells?
Go, go, go!
Get down!
Get back!
You all right?
- Daddy.
- Sally!
It's OK, honey.
Come on, come on!
Honey, you just got to be real quiet.
Gotcha!
Christ!
Come on.
- Who is off the air?
- DSS, state troopers, the security rep.
Give me Hostage Rescue, now!
Robby...!
Open up!
Robby, it's us.
Jack!
- They're outside.
- Cool it.
Can't ransom a dead Royal.
- They're all over the place.
- Stay close to me.
How were you going to get away?
Want to go for the other knee?
Boats.
At the bottom of the cliff.
There are ropes.
Kevin!
You've killed him!
No, Sean.
No!
We need Holmes alive.
- We're past that.
- Alive!
Come on!
- Any contact?
- Still off the air.
There he is!
Stay down!
Come on, you bastards!
Come on!
Come on!
He's alone.
He's leading us away from the Royal.
Turn around, Sean.
- No!
- Turn it around, Sean.
- No!
- Sean!
Turn around!
- Forget about Ryan.
- Don't blow the mission now, boy!
That's not my mission.
You crazy bastard!
- Had enough to eat?
Some toast?
- Pancakes.
- No time for pancakes.
Want toast?
- Toast.
- Somebody going to get that?
- Getting it.
- Sally.
- Hello.
Yes, it is.
Hold on a second.
- It's Dr. Zaillian.
- The amnio.
- Hello.
- Is it gonna be OK?
It's gonna be fine, honey.
We're just waiting to find out.
- Great!
- Want strawberry on your toast?
Hold on...
Want to know what it is?
- Did he tell you?
- He's asking.
I'm asking you.
- I don't know.
Do you want to know?
- I don't know.
Do you?
I wanted to know, but now I'm not sure.
- Hold on.
We're discussing it.
- Neither.
I do and I don't.
He's waiting.
OK...!
Tell us.
OK, tell us.
Thank you!
We can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave a message.
Thanks.
Mamie, it's Jack.
We're leaving London as planned.
We'll take a cab from the airport.
No need to pick us up.
Eight...
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
You already own that!
You own everything.
We forgot about Sally's goldfish.
If they're alive, can you feed them?
Mom will make my move.
And if they're not, will you go to the store and buy similar ones?
See you soon.
Bye.
What's happening?
- Yes!
- Oh, no!
Another hotel!
- What does he owe you?
- You owe me £1,100.
I don't have it.
You win!
- This girl is rich!
- Time to go to sleep.
- Good evening, sir.
- Yes?
Will these do?
Yeah, bring them in...
My wife, I guess.
Candles, champagne...
Sorry I didn't think of this.
That's all right.
Only one of us had to.
- Is she asleep?
- Yep.
- What about your speech?
- I'll wing it.
- You're sure?
- Yep.
We've viewed with awe the protean events occurring in the former USSR.
Enormous changes have resulted from these events.
We can now only speculate on the future of Soviet fleet deployment.
Thanks to the Royal Naval Academy for inviting me to speak here today.
He's impressed, Sally.
It's just he's a professional soldier.
It's his job not to be distracted.
Come on, we gotta go meet Daddy.
I'm impressed.
- Find it on the map?
- Yeah, we turn left... no, right.
- You're sure?
- Turn right, yes.
We're gonna turn right.
I'm following your map.
You mind your bottom, Paddy Boy.
Move sure and fast.
- You told me that, didn't ya?
- I'm telling you again...
This is like nothing you've done before, little brother.
- Target leaving the Palace now.
- Right.
Stay awake, lads.
Here they come.
Is that good?
A little more?
There's Daddy!
Go!
Down!
Get down!
Move in!
Get down!
Come!
Get down!
Keep her down!
Get out of the car!
Come on!
Get out!
Open the fucking door!
British!
Open it or I'll blow you up.
Come on, let's go!
Go, go, go!
Paddy?
Stop!
Army!
Drop it!
Help the boy.
No, he's had it.
It's all right, sweetie.
Everything's going to be OK.
- Stand back, ma'am.
- That's my husband.
I'm a doctor.
I will treat him.
Jesus, Jack.
What were you thinking of?
I'm going to set you down, OK?
Stay with me, Jack.
You hear me?
Jack, stay with me.
The feeling here is outrage at the terrorist attack on the Royal Family.
While no group has yet claimed credit, there is speculation of IRA involvement.
Lord Holmes, the Queen Mother's cousin and Northern Ireland Minister would have died were it not for the heroism of-
- John Patrick Ryan, an American tourist who thwarted the terrorist attack.
A professor at the US Naval Academy, Ryan is a former marine lieutenant.
Wounded in the attack, Ryan is being treated at an undisclosed hospital.
Debora Weston, CNN News, London.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
You're alive.
I forgive you.
Otherwise...
Hey, pumpkin.
I love you.
I love you too.
You dignify their cowardice with your silence.
They left you.
They drove off without you.
I wonder why you think you owe them.
If my mates drove off and left me in your hands, I'd not only feel no loyalty -
I'd make sure to kill them.
Who are they, Sean?
Where are they?
The trip was unscheduled.
How'd you know Lord Holmes would be there?
I can't help you if you won't talk.
I'd tear your heart out and serve it to you with chips, you Fenian bastard!
Not in all eternity will Sean chirp a word.
Not while his brother lies on a slab.
What's the matter, Jimmy?
Don't you believe it?
It's the entire thing, I don't believe.
The Royal Family, Kevin...
You know that only turns people against us.
This was totally unauthorized.
- We all know you were behind it.
- Fuck the bloody IRA!
All these years of war have got us nowhere.
In its heart England is still a monarchy.
That is where we must strike.
At the royals and the ruling class.
You're either with us or against us, Jimmy Boy.
Make up your mind!
I'm with you.
Good.
That's all I wanted to hear.
I'll leave you to it.
Kevin, Charlie's dropping by tonight to try and straighten things out.
Be smart.
Talk to him.
And hold your temper.
I promise.
Thanks, Jimmy.
Kevin!
Kevin, lad!
It's me, Charlie.
That's me holding my temper, Jimmy Boy.
- Oh, damn.
I forgot.
- What?
Where's my bag?
Please don't make me wear a rubber.
The Church says it's a sin, darling.
So is this!
Darling!
So, what can you tell me about...
this guy?
Sean?
He's a nice boy...
Sean Miller.
Shot a parish priest in Derry.
During confession.
He thought the Father was informing.
Excuse me, it's not in Mr. Ryan's best interests or the prosecution's - to discuss matters not related to the events at hand.
If you confirm that the man in the photo is the one you disarmed in the square -
I think we'll be through.
I can't.
You have anything to add, Mr. Ryan?
Yes, the man I killed was Miller's...
- ... brother.
- Brother.
Patrick.
Not even 17, "Paddy Boy".
Recruited by Sean into the IRA.
The idea is to preserve the clarity of your eventual testimony.
I read it in the newspaper.
- Please don't read the newspapers.
- Not even Doonesbury?
Do you have anything to add?
No.
Mr. Ryan, I'm Geoffrey Watkins.
Private Secretary to Lord Holmes.
- Pleasure.
My wife Catherine.
- How do you do?
- So, Doctor, is your patient healing?
- We're looking forward to going home.
I can imagine.
May I introduce His Lordship?
- Hello.
- It's my great honor to meet you.
- Thank you.
- I am eternally indebted to you.
Thanks for the kind note.
I'm delighted you're here to share the good news, Mrs. Ryan.
Her Majesty's decided to invest your husband K.C.V.O -
- Knight Commander of the Victorian Order.
My congratulations, sir.
Good luck today.
- "Sir Jack"?
- Lady Catherine.
If I'd had more time to think, I might have done something else.
- You're saying you didn't have time.
- That's correct.
- So, you didn't...
- Didn't what?
Think so.
You didn't think is the point you're trying to make.
No, instead you raced into a situation of which by your own admission, you had no understanding attacked my client, who was, in fact, another pedestrian hurrying to help...
In a ski mask?
...shot a 2nd man in the chest this one taking you?
After they shot me!
Three shots point blank to kill the 2nd victim.
I used that force I deemed necessary.
I should say so.
I doubt whether anyone in this court would disagree.
- Excuse me, I didn't cause this, sir.
- No further questions.
- He did!
- My Lord, there is one more question.
Are you still, Dr. Ryan, in the paid service of the CIA?
I should remind you that you're under oath.
- No.
- I beg your pardon.
- No.
- That's all.
Thank you.
The witness may stand down.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, this is an appropriate moment...
Bloody proud of yourself, aren't you?
Stuck your nose where it didn't belong.
Now you've killed my baby brother.
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, pumpkin.
Wow, you guys have really grown!
- How are you feeling?
- Not so good.
- Tired?
- No.
I've no idea what time it is.
Feels like morning.
You're telling me!
- Did I miss something?
- No.
But I did!
I'm pregnant.
Honey!
Can I watch some TV?
I'm not at all tired.
What?
- Plates.
- I don't have any say in this, do I?
This is a family.
Everybody's got a say.
But my say is after the fact.
Or am I wrong?
- No, you're right.
- Michaela despises her little sister.
Ready for this?
It could be even worse... a baby brother.
Oh, no.
Boys!
- Jack!
- True.
Boys are...
You deny the IRA was behind the assassination attempt?
When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it.
That's the policy.
They proudly say they did it.
Have the IRA admitted to this?
Common sense, logic, reason...
Can I suggest some names?
You don't think raising money in America for the IRA will be affected?
- Morning, Mr. Cooley.
- And to you, madam.
How's business?
I came upon this first edition at an estate auction.
Can your man restore it?
- When do you want this by?
- Soon.
It's very pressing.
I'm not sure...
The binder may have some trouble with this.
- Is that so?
- I'll see what I can do.
- He's not a miracle worker, you know.
- Obviously, he's not, Mr. Cooley.
The best you can arrange then.
- Thanks, Mr. Cooley.
- Good day, madam.
Hello, Sean.
Don't mind if I ride with you, do you?
I disapprove of your deeds, Sean, but I can't bring myself to condemn you.
I can't because I understand where the hatred comes from.
I more than understand it.
But we're now very near the darkest hole in Great Britain - and you still won't speak to me.
They're raising the bridge.
We'll be here five minutes.
Understood.
Mobile Three, Lymington.
Open the door!
- Open it or I'll kill him.
- What do we do?
- We open the door.
- Open it!
- For Christ's sake...
- But what?
Wait until they kill him, then open the door?
- Your guns.
- We are unarmed.
Just who the hell are you?
Get them out!
Get your head down.
- Get down on the bloody ground!
- Don't you fucking move!
- You'd think we'd forget about you?
- Unlock the cuffs.
Inspector Robert Highland.
This is a friend of mine.
We meet at last.
What's the pay for selling out your own people?
Get on with it and be on your way.
Very well.
If that's how you feel about it...
Come on, Cath!
- Have I got the tickets or what?
- I don't have them.
- I don't have them!
- They're on the fridge.
- Dad?
- Honey, there's plenty of time.
- Hello, Admiral.
- Morning, Jack.
- You know Marty Cantor.
- How's the shoulder?
Not too bad.
Something's come up.
Can we sit down and have a chat?
He escaped while they were moving him.
We think he's left the country.
Excuse me.
Let's deal in what we know and not what we don't.
We know he's escaped in Kent near the Channel.
If he's left the country...
Jack, listening?
The chances he'd come here are so remote I have trouble saying it.
Your first instinct was to come all the way here and tell me.
Marty, want to excuse us a few minutes?
I've got a few more weeks before school starts, but I'll get her.
Dig in and prepare a few lectures.
Wanna come look over what we got?
You might turn up something new.
You're asking me if I want to come back.
Yep.
- We'll go next week, honey.
- All right.
Sorry, Sean Miller escaped.
What does that mean?
They wanted me to know... thought I might be concerned.
I'm not!
The IRA's not stupid.
They won't follow me over here.
They agree.
They're gone.
That's it.
They didn't ask you to come back to CIA?
I said no.
Just like that.
I don't wanna go back, honey.
- I saw them coming and I just...
- I know.
I can't go back to that life again, you know.
Sally, wait up, honey.
I bet your cell was better than this.
Bloody Ritz in comparison.
At least you had your own toilet.
Cheer up.
You've just been spared from hell on earth.
- A word of gratitude might be in order.
- I don't feel like resting.
Laying about like a complacent tourist.
To build an army, we've got to train like soldiers.
We can't do that in Ireland.
- Bleedin' waste of time.
- There's laying about and laying low.
- There's a difference.
- Is there?
Lord Holmes should worry about complacency.
Next time he won't be so lucky.
Post him back to Whitehall in bits - if that's what frees Irish prisoners.
That's not what I'm thinking of.
What Ryan has done can't be undone.
Stop thinking about it.
I can't.
How could this have happened?
Highland picked the day, the decoy routes, his men, and still they knew.
- He had two children, apparently.
- Tragic!
31 people knew your itinerary the day of your attack and of Miller's transfer - five of whom are now dead.
I suggest limiting your appointments.
I will not have my itinerary dictated to me by terrorists.
The traitor had better pray to God I never find him.
We know you'll do your best, Sergeant.
- We don't know if we're coming home.
- We don't know if we're coming home.
- Stand, buckle up, shuffle to the door.
- Stand, buckle up, shuffle to the door.
Jump right out and shout Marine Corps!
Egesta appealed to Athens on what basis?
On what grounds?
Mr. Biederman...
Bad time for you?
Well... they said they'd be grateful.
Didn't they?
"Fight our battle.
The world will fear and respect you. "
- Didn't the world fear Athens already?
- Didn't matter.
- Why not?
- Pride, sir.
That's the real battle they lost.
Attention on deck!
Attention to orders.
I've a presentation to make for service above and beyond the call of duty of a tourist.
Even a marine.
We recognize Professor John Ryan with the Order of the Purple Target.
And hope that he will duck next time lest he become part of history - rather than a teacher of it.
- How old is he?
- Ten.
- Plate glass window?
- Yes.
- Here we go...
Hi, guys!
- Morning, Catherine.
I've got a retina at 1:00.
We might have to bump it.
This could take some time.
- Yep, let's bump it.
- We're all set.
OK, let's do it.
So, you just waded on in like John Wayne.
Why'd you do it?
What were you thinking, man?
- I don't know.
I wasn't thinking.
- That's it?
You sound like my students.
It just pissed me off.
I couldn't just watch him shoot those people in front of me.
It was... rage.
Pure rage...
Just made me mad.
Here's hoping you never get mad at me, man.
She's late, Sean.
And she was at this dance.
This guy, at the end, he...
- Kind of cute, isn't she?
- Is she?
Bye.
See ya.
- Hi, Mommy.
- Sweetie, how are you?
Let's do it.
Damn!
Highway 50.
West.
- Good night, Doc.
- Good night.
- Dr. Ryan...
- He's getting away.
Where's Sean Miller?
Where's Sean Miller?
- Dr. Catherine Ryan, please.
- Dr. Ryan, are you all right?
- How long?
- Dr. Ryan...
Come on!
Come on!
- Surgery.
- Yes, this is Dr. Ryan.
- Thomson retinal scan results, please.
- Hold, please.
Come on, get off the phone.
- Look, Mom!
- It's beautiful.
- Are you still holding?
- Yes, I'm still holding.
I'd like to speak with Dr. Sutton.
Operator, I want to cut into a phone call.
The number is 555-3464.
Yeah, it's a mobile phone.
What do you mean I can't?
Faster, damn it.
- Dr. Ryan?
The retinal scan is fine.
- That's great.
Thank you.
Jesus!
- Hello!
- Cathy...
Something's happened.
Is Sally with you?
- Yeah.
- Hi, Dad!
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.
- There she is!
- Right!
I want you to get off the highway and go to the nearest police station.
- The police station?
- Just get off the highway right now.
Steady, mate.
Steady.
- Where are you now?
- I'm at Rowe Blvd.
There's a state police barracks on Houston St. Meet you there.
- Is something wrong, Mom?
- No, everything's fine.
They're gone!
Coming in.
- Mr. Ryan?
- Yeah.
Your wife's OK.
She has a concussion.
- She's pregnant.
- The baby's OK.
Don't worry.
What about my daughter?
- Let's sit down for a moment.
- No, talk to me.
It will be a while till we know.
Maybe in the morning.
Where's Sally?
She's in the Recovery Room.
They're watching her.
We'll know in 7 or 8 hours.
They removed her spleen.
She's in pretty bad shape.
I'm sorry.
In a moment, we expect a statement from Paddy O'Neill of Sinn Fein.
- Jack, here you go.
- O'Neill is in the US for fundraising.
You OK?
Here's Cary Johnson ready to speak with Paddy O'Neill.
I'm praying for the recovery of the victims of this senseless attack.
Sinn Fein and most Irish Catholics are outraged at this heinous crime.
I want to share with Dr. Ryan our empathy and anguish but I'll wait for a more appropriate time.
- Can you confirm that the IRA..?
- The IRA are not behind this attack.
- No more questions.
- Thank you, Mr. O'Neill.
- She's going to be OK.
- Thank you.
It's all right.
She's all right.
Mr. Ryan...
Mr. Ryan, I'd like to share with you our deep regret about...
Mr. Ryan!
Jack, you're involved!
It's not good process.
You're a crime victim.
That doesn't make for good analysis.
Even if you knew something about terrorism which you don't!
I have guys on it!
Guys who know all about the IRA...
I'm not standing here hat in hand!
I'm telling you I want back in.
- Jack...
- Sir...
Thank God about Sally.
Alice and I are relieved beyond words.
- You manage any sleep?
- Not much, sir.
I'm interrupting.
You were explaining how we're better off without Jack or something on those lines.
Marc Spiva, Jack Ryan, Tony Ferro.
- Hi.
- Alex Winter.
Nice to meet you, Alex.
- Well...
- Rose!
- You're looking better than I expected.
- It's an illusion.
It would have to be.
Good to see you, regardless.
We've carved a niche for you.
Here's your night table reading.
Oh, my!
"Father killed by RUC, Belfast, 1979."
Good morning.
Cut the engine, please.
Your I.D.?
- Did you see the game?
- It was all right.
- What the hell!
- Nobody move!
- Keep your hands off him.
- Get 'em up!
Mornin'.
Kevin O'Donnell, IRA strategist, friend of the Millers.
After Tim Miller was killed in '79, he looked after Sean and Patrick.
This photo's recent.
I think if we find O'Donnell, Miller will be at his side.
- Are you with me, Jack?
- Yeah, just thinking.
- What about the gun?
- Think it's registered?
- Son of a bitch!
- What?
SO-13 gets an anonymous tip about a bomb factory in a flat.
They get some IRA bad guys, but realize the tip was a set-up.
We got three IRA hitmen at a farm hit by somebody else.
That's British soldiers getting out of hand.
They're not above it.
No, look.
We got IRA brigade commander Jimmy O'Reardon.
He checks into a cheap hotel and ends up shot in the head.
- That's how long after the farmhouse?
- Same day.
- Same day!
- What are you coming to, Jack?
Jack!
Where are you going?
I'm going to throw some water on my face.
Jack!
Excuse me.
- One of us is in the wrong room.
- I'm sorry.
That's OK.
Jack!
When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it.
Common sense, logic...
Listen!
Who are we looking for?
IRA terrorists or some ultra-violent faction of the IRA?
Jimmy O'Reardon checked into a hotel with a woman with long red hair!
This is who we should be looking for!
We find her... we'll find him.
I saw his wife and daughter die, but she and Neddie blew it.
Ryan's still alive.
- They're not dead, Sean.
- What?
They survived it.
I can't say it plainer than that.
- It doesn't matter.
It served its purpose.
- It does matter!
America holds its breath whenever a little girl falls down a well.
You used a sub-machine gun on one returning from school.
We've started a war.
The Brits are tearing apart Belfast for the IRA.
Their American money deny the hits so loud, the IRA looks only more guilty.
The war is raging.
When it's over, we'll be the only ones left standing.
Sean, I let you go for Paddy Boy, but that's it!
We've got work to do and it's not in Maryland.
Hello.
- Yeah?
- How's the family, Ryan?
Nearly lost them, didn't you?
It's easy to get at them.
You should look after your family better.
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
Your little girl's feeling better, eh?
Lost her spleen.
Pity that.
Makes it tough on her to fight off infection, eh, Jacky?
You sick son of a bitch!
It was him, wasn't it?
He's never going to leave us alone.
He'll never get close to us again.
That's why he calls.
It's all he can do.
You get him, Jack.
I don't care what you do.
Just get him.
Can I buy you a drink?
No...
Let me buy you one.
Barney, two whiskies.
- The IRA's not responsible for all this.
- You waiting for me to agree?
- I've said this 'til I'm blue in the face.
- That's the point, isn't it?
You take credit for one thing, deny it for another.
Nobody believes you anymore.
I want to know where Sean Miller and Kevin O'Donnell are.
Let me understand this.
You want me to sell out my fellow Irishman to you.
Is that why you came here?
You don't know me at all.
I think I do!
I don't give a damn what they've done.
The day I sell out my countrymen is the day I put a bullet through my own head.
- That's it, then.
- That's it.
On second thought I won't have a drink with you.
- OK, then I'll go home.
- Have a safe trip.
I'll call the TV stations.
Let them film my daughter's hospital room.
Put it on the evening news.
I don't give a shit whether you did it or not.
Nor will anyone else.
I'll put such a stranglehold on your gun money you'll be back to throwing rocks.
I'll fucking destroy you!
It will be my mission in life!
Excuse me.
Lads, did you hear that?
Stand sideways, you're less of a target.
Yes!
Satellite's coming!
Celts, let's go!
Get inside!
So...
SO-13 traced the weapons in the Lord Holmes incident to an arms dealer that supplies Qaddafi.
When Sean escaped, he was last seen in the Channel in a gale which didn't figure until I checked the freighters out there that day.
Syrian registry, carrying arms to client states including Qaddafi.
- Sean takes a slow boat to Libya.
- Exactly!
Our satellites photograph how many camps?
- 182.
- 182 camps a day in North Africa.
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade, Action Directe, German Red Army...
The day this ship docked, there are only 9 camps with people arriving.
This one we know for sure is PLO.
This one Shining Path.
These seven we're not so sure about.
Why?
We've got satellites in...
Because those camps know exactly when the satellites pass over.
Unless you retask those satellites so we can get a real look we'll never know which camp they're at.
Do you know how big a deal it is to retask those satellites?
Yeah.
Bring up Camp 18 again.
Tighten on the camp here.
Let's look up in here.
See what we can see.
Show me this grouping here.
No, there's nothing.
Go back to the bigger picture.
Let me see down here.
What's that?
Tighten up on that, will you?
Can you enhance that?
Sharpen it up?
Tits.
SAS could take out this camp in under two minutes.
Kill everybody there and be gone before the echo fades.
Are you sure it's the same woman?
Keep at it, then.
Son of a bitch.
Hi.
Read it again, Daddy.
"The sun did not shine.
It was too wet to play.
"So we sat in the house all that cold, cold, wet day. "
"I sat there with Sally, we sat there, we two.
"And I said:
How I wish we had something to do!
"Too wet to go out, too cold to play ball.
"So we sat in the house, we did nothing at all.
"So all we could do was just sit, sit, sit, sit.
"And we did not like it, not one little bit.
"And then, something went boom. "
Paddy O'Neill can sleep at night.
In fact, he probably enjoys the irony.
She's not Irish.
She's English.
This is the girl you saw in the blink of an eye in a jeep doing 40mph?
- Yeah.
- What am I supposed to do here?
Tell SO-13 her name.
Give them her picture.
Tell them about the rare books.
- What do you mean "what do you do?"
- What about you, Jack?
You walk into an IRA bar.
You approach the IRA's bagman and in front of his guys, you threaten him?
You never were a field man.
You are an analyst.
Analyze that!
I'm not after your job, Marty.
- I'm after Sean Miller.
- Then, think!
You tell O'Neill you're looking for a girl.
He obliges you with some pictures.
And you believe him?
I didn't tell him I was looking for a girl.
Sergeant...
Come and look at this.
A bit of a bookworm myself.
Not that I look it.
What's your passion?
Mysteries?
Spy novels?
Ian Fleming?
- This is a rare bookshop.
- Rare books?
So they are.
- Will you locate the problem?
- I already have.
Your wiring dates from before World War I.
It's what we call in the electrical business: "rare".
- Can you fix it?
- Sure.
- Fix it!
- Can you afford it?
Just fix it!
Hello!
- He's seen it?
- I don't know.
He's got it.
Look.
What do you make of this?
I have no idea!
Damn!
I have to go out now for a few minutes to deliver some books.
- Please, keep about your repairs.
- I'll be here all week.
Don't worry.
He's mine!
Damn!
- The White House dinner's no problem.
- What is the problem?
No problem.
Just running out of dates.
We could do that.
Move that to there which would leave us... the 14th?
- The 14th.
- Geoffrey...
Let's schedule a presentation dinner at our embassy in Washington on the... ... 14th.
- The 14th!
Let's cover this again so I can get it clear.
We start in Washington...
- Geoffrey Watkins.
- I'm trying to reach Mr. Titus.
- Is that Ext. 2691?
- No, It's 2619.
I'm terribly sorry.
- Why are you up?
Go back to bed.
- I want to be there when she wakes up.
- I'll go with you, then take a cab back.
- OK.
- Hello.
- Sir John Ryan, please.
Just a minute.
It's for you, Sir John.
Mr. Ryan has a special celebration that evening.
- He invited you to join them.
- Where?
At his house?
Yes, sir.
Why not?
We shot this eight days ago in Berlin.
One...
Two...
Three...
Four Brits traveling with him.
- Light arms.
- The heavy stuff's in the cars.
He's German...
He's German.
This boring you, Sean?
Six altogether.
Should be the same security when Holmes's in Washington.
You got to find the moment when he's unprotected.
Four days, Washington.
One day, New York... shopping.
Yeah...
Two Caucasians.
Take a look at the one with the hat.
- His arms look a little pink.
- Sunburn.
New arrival.
What do you think?
Same guy?
That rare book dealer, Dennis Cooley, is bald.
It's possible there could be a woman in some of these camps but with her and Cooley in the same place.
If that is Cooley...
The odds of coincidence are dropping fast.
Still, there's no way I can be...
absolutely certain.
Excuse me, Jack.
Tell me one thing in life that is absolutely for certain.
My daughter's love.
What I need to hear is your best guess and I think I've heard it.
Haven't I?
The bastards took away my book shop.
And my books!
I'm sorry, you can't come.
You haven't got the training.
This mission is messy.
I can fire a gun.
Sorry, Dennis.
- Where are you taking me, Marty?
- You've taken us, Jack...
- Satelite now entering target area.
- ... into battle.
Enlargement Sector Four.
Airborne Support approaching target.
E.T.A. 35 seconds.
SAS team on ground.
- Enlarge Camp 18.
- Enlarging it.
- Enlarge primary target.
- Enlarging.
That is a kill!
Targets have been neutralized.
Keyhole is passing out of vision.
It's over.
- Roger that.
- Would your men outside like coffee?
No thank you.
They're fine.
Thank you, Sally, for inviting us to your homecoming.
You're a lovely young lady.
My pleasure to finally met you.
You're welcome.
- Can I do the presentation after dinner?
- Sure.
Would you like to see it now...?
Geoffrey!
- That's very nice.
- Didn't I already give you one of those?
Is that your second piece of cake, my little sweetie?
- Where's the bathroom, Jack?
- Second door on the left.
- More coffee anyone?
- I'd love some.
- Excuse me.
- Here it comes.
Bathroom?
Someone in there?
That's not it.
That's the basement.
- Jack...?
Marty.
- Hey, what's going on?
Sorry to interrupt the party, but you need to know right away.
- SAS made positive I.D. on Cooley.
- What about the others?
It's pretty messy.
We need to verify the dental records.
But they're on top of it.
- Oh, great.
- What?
The storm caused a black-out.
I've got to light candles.
- I'll light one for you too.
- OK, Marty, thanks.
- Here we go!
- What?
Forget to pay your bill?
- Robert...!
Funny.
- Is everyone all right?
Fine, Jack.
This doesn't happen often, Lord Holmes.
Only when royalty visit.
- Is something wrong?
- Come with me.
If the storm had cut the lights, they'd be out in the boathouse too.
Power comes in from the street, branching off to here.
Jesus...
This is Ryan.
Any DSS agent?
Any DSS agent?
This is Ryan.
Federal Troopers.
Anyone?
Is anyone reading me?
Anybody?
- Can I play when the lights go on?
- Sweetie pie, you need some sleep.
Goddamnit!
- Don't tell me.
- Quite a storm.
Take your hands off me.
What do you think you're doing?
- Gun!
- Jack!
Stay right there!
Rob, over here.
How many are coming?
Where's Sean Miller?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Give me the gun.
Five, six... maybe more.
I'll get the others.
Don't turn on the lights.
- Take this.
In the basement, quick!
- Cathy's upstairs putting Sally to bed.
What's wrong?
Come on, Ryan.
Show yourself.
- Annette, upstairs.
- Right.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
What's wrong, Mommy?
Now, you've got to help.
Hide behind the suits.
Oh, God, Jack.
What did you do with the shells?
Go, go, go!
Get down!
Get backl
You all right?
- Daddy.
- Sally!
It's OK, honey.
Come on, come on!
Honey, you just got to be real quiet.
Gotcha!
Christ!
Come on.
- Who is off the air?
- DSS, state troopers, the security rep.
Give me Hostage Rescue, now!
Robby...!
Open up!
Robby, it's us.
Jack!
- They're outside.
- Cool it.
Can't ransom a dead Royal.
- They're all over the place.
- Stay close to me.
How were you going to get away?
Want to go for the other knee?
Boats.
At the bottom of the cliff.
There are ropes.
Kevin!
You've killed him!
No, Sean.
No!
We need Holmes alive.
- We're past that.
- Alive!
Come on!
- Any contact?
- Still off the air.
There he is!
Stay down!
Come on, you bastards!
Come on!
Come on!
He's alone.
He's leading us away from the Royal.
Turn around, Sean.
- No!
- Turn it around, Sean.
- No!
- Sean!
Turn around!
- Forget about Ryan.
- Don't blow the mission now, boy!
That's not my mission.
You crazy bastard!
- Had enough to eat?
Some toast?
- Pancakes.
- No time for pancakes.
Want toast?
- Toast.
- Somebody going to get that?
- Getting it.
- Sally.
- Hello.
Yes, it is.
Hold on a second.
- It's Dr. Zaillian.
- The amnio.
- Hello.
- Is it gonna be OK?
It's gonna be fine, honey.
We're just waiting to find out.
- Great!
- Want strawberry on your toast?
Hold on...
Want to know what it is?
- Did he tell you?
- He's asking.
I'm asking you.
- I don't know.
Do you want to know?
- I don't know.
Do you?
I wanted to know, but now I'm not sure.
- Hold on.
We're discussing it.
- Neither.
I do and I don't.
He's waiting.
OK...!
Tell us.
OK, tell us.
Thank you!
We can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave a message.
Thanks.
Mamie, it's Jack.
We're leaving London as planned.
We'll take a cab from the airport.
No need to pick us up.
Eight...
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
You already own that!
You own everything.
We forgot about Sally's goldfish.
If they're alive, can you feed them?
Mom will make my move.
And if they're not, will you go to the store and buy similar ones?
See you soon.
Bye.
What's happening?
- Yes!
- Oh, no!
Another hotel!
- What does he owe you?
- You owe me £1,1 OO.
I don't have it.
You win!
- This girl is rich!
- Time to go to sleep.
- Good evening, sir.
- Yes?
Will these do?
Yeah, bring them in...
My wife, I guess.
Candles, champagne...
Sorry I didn't think of this.
That's all right.
Only one of us had to.
- Is she asleep?
- Yep.
- What about your speech?
- I'll wing it.
- You're sure?
- Yep.
We've viewed with awe the protean events occurring in the former USSR.
Enormous changes have resulted from these events.
We can now only speculate on the future of Soviet fleet deployment.
Thanks to the Royal Naval Academy for inviting me to speak here today.
He's impressed, Sally.
It's just he's a professional soldier.
It's his job not to be distracted.
Come on, we gotta go meet Daddy.
I'm impressed.
- Find it on the map?
- Yeah, we turn left... no, right.
- You're sure?
- Turn right, yes.
We're gonna turn right.
I'm following your map.
You mind your bottom, Paddy Boy.
Move sure and fast.
- You told me that, didn't ya?
- I'm telling you again...
This is like nothing you've done before, little brother.
- Target leaving the Palace now.
- Right.
Stay awake, lads.
Here they come.
Is that good?
A little more?
There's Daddy!
Go!
Down!
Get down!
Move in!
Get down!
Come!
Get down!
Keep her down!
Get out of the car!
Come on!
Get out!
Open the fucking door!
British!
Open it or I'll blow you up.
Come on, let's go!
Go, go, go!
Paddy?
Stop!
Army!
Drop it!
Help the boy.
No, he's had it.
It's all right, sweetie.
Everything's going to be OK.
- Stand back, ma'am.
- That's my husband.
I'm a doctor.
I will treat him.
Jesus, Jack.
What were you thinking of?
I'm going to set you down, OK?
Stay with me, Jack.
You hear me?
Jack, stay with me.
The feeling here is outrage at the terrorist attack on the Royal Family.
While no group has yet claimed credit, there is speculation of IRA involvement.
Lord Holmes, the Queen Mother's cousin and Northern Ireland Minister would have died were it not for the heroism of-
- John Patrick Ryan, an American tourist who thwarted the terrorist attack.
A professor at the US Naval Academy, Ryan is a former marine lieutenant.
Wounded in the attack, Ryan is being treated at an undisclosed hospital.
Debora Weston, CNN News, London.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
You're alive.
I forgive you.
Otherwise...
Hey, pumpkin.
I love you.
I love you too.
You dignify their cowardice with your silence.
They left you.
They drove off without you.
I wonder why you think you owe them.
If my mates drove off and left me in your hands, I'd not only feel no loyalty -
- I'd make sure to kill them.
Who are they, Sean?
Where are they?
The trip was unscheduled.
How'd you know Lord Holmes would be there?
I can't help you if you won't talk.
I'd tear your heart out and serve it to you with chips, you Fenian bastard!
Not in all eternity will Sean chirp a word.
Not while his brother lies on a slab.
What's the matter, Jimmy?
Don't you believe it?
It's the entire thing, I don't believe.
The Royal Family, Kevin...
You know that only turns people against us.
This was totally unauthorised.
- We all know you were behind it.
- Fuck the bloody IRA!
All these years of war have got us nowhere.
In its heart England is still a monarchy.
That is where we must strike.
At the royals and the ruling class.
You're either with us or against us, Jimmy Boy.
Make up your mind!
I'm with you.
Good.
That's all I wanted to hear.
I'll leave you to it.
Kevin, Charlie's dropping by tonight to try and straighten things out.
Be smart.
Talk to him.
And hold your temper.
I promise.
Thanks, Jimmy.
Kevin!
Kevin, lad!
It's me, Charlie.
That's me holding my temper, Jimmy Boy.
- Oh, damn.
I forgot.
- What?
Where's my bag?
Please don't make me wear a rubber.
The Church says it's a sin, darling.
So is this!
Darling!
So, what can you tell me about...
this guy?
Sean?
He's a nice boy...
Sean Miller.
Shot a parish priest in Derry.
During confession.
He thought the Father was informing.
Excuse me, it's not in Mr. Ryan's best interests or the prosecution's to discuss matters not related to the events at hand.
If you confirm that the man in the photo is the one you disarmed in the square -
- I think we'll be through.
I can.
You have anything to add, Mr. Ryan?
Yes, the man I killed was Miller's brother.
- Brother.
Patrick.
Not even 17, "Paddy Boy".
Recruited by Sean into the IRA.
The idea is to preserve the clarity of your eventual testimony.
I read it in the newspaper.
- Please don't read the newspapers.
- Not even Doonesbury?
Do you have anything to add?
No.
Mr. Ryan, I'm Geoffrey Watkins.
Private Secretary to Lord Holmes.
- Pleasure.
My wife Catherine.
- How do you do?
- So, Doctor, is your patient healing?
- We're looking forward to going home.
I can imagine.
May I introduce His Lordship?
- Hello.
- It's my great honour to meet you.
- Thank you.
- I am eternally indebted to you.
Thanks for the kind note.
I'm delighted you're here to share the good news, Mrs. Ryan.
Her Majesty's decided to invest your husband K.C.V. O -
- Knight Commander of the Victorian Order.
My congratulations, sir.
Good luck today.
- "Sir Jack"?
- Lady Catherine.
If I'd had more time to think, I might have done something else.
- You're saying you didn't have time.
- That's correct.
- So, you didn't...
- Didn't what?
Think so.
You didn't think is the point you're trying to make.
No, instead you raced into a situation of which by your own admission, you had no understanding attacked my client, who was, in fact, another pedestrian hurrying to help...
In a ski mask?
...shot a 2nd man in the chest this one taking you...
After they shot me!
...three shots point blank to kill the 2nd victim.
I used that force I deemed necessary.
I should say so.
I doubt whether anyone in this court would disagree.
- Excuse me, I didn't cause this, sir.
- No further questions.
- He did!
- My Lord, there is one more question.
Are you still, Dr. Ryan, in the paid service of the CIA?
I should remind you that you're under oath.
- No.
- I beg your pardon.
- No.
- That's all.
Thank you.
The witness may stand down.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, this is an appropriate moment...
Bloody proud of yourself, aren't you?
Stuck your nose where it didn't belong.
Now you've killed my baby brother.
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, pumpkin.
Wow, you guys have really grown!
- How are you feeling?
- Not so good.
- Tired?
- No.
I've no idea what time it is.
Feels like morning.
You're telling me!
- Did I miss something?
- No.
But I did!
I'm pregnant.
Honey!
Can I watch some TV?
I'm not at all tired.
What?
- Plates.
- I don't have any say in this, do I?
This is a family.
Everybody's got a say.
But my say is after the fact.
Or am I wrong?
- No, you're right.
- Michaela despises her little sister.
Ready for this?
It could be even worse... a baby brother.
Oh, no.
Boys!
- Jack!
- True.
Boys are...
You deny the IRA was behind the assassination attempt?
When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it.
That's the policy.
They proudly say they did it.
Have the IRA admitted to this?
Common sense, logic, reason...
Can I suggest some names?
You don't think raising money in America for the IRA will be affected?
- Morning, Mr. Cooley.
- And to you, madam.
How's business?
I came upon this first edition at an estate auction.
Can your man restore it?
- When do you want this by?
- Soon.
It's very pressing.
I'm not sure...
The binder may have some trouble with this.
- Is that so?
- I'll see what I can do.
- He's not a miracle worker, you know.
- Obviously, he's not, Mr. Cooley.
The best you can arrange then.
- Thanks, Mr. Cooley.
- Good day, madam.
Hello, Sean.
Don't mind if I ride with you, do you?
I disapprove of your deeds, Sean, but I can't bring myself to condemn you.
I can't because I understand where the hatred comes from.
I more than understand it.
But we're now very near the darkest hole in Great Britain and you still won't speak to me.
They're raising the bridge.
We'll be here five minutes.
Understood.
Mobile Three, Lymington.
Open the door!
- Open it or I'll kill him.
- What do we do?
- We open the door.
- Open it!
- For Christ's sake...
- But what?
Wait until they kill him, then open the door?
- Your guns.
- We are unarmed.
Just who the hell are you?
Get them out!
Get your head down.
- Get down on the bloody ground!
- Don't you fucking move!
- You'd think we'd forget about you?
- Unlock the cuffs.
Inspector Robert Highland.
This is a friend of mine.
We meet at last.
What's the pay for selling out your own people?
Get on with it and be on your way.
Very well.
If that's how you feel about it...
Come on, Cath!
- Have I got the tickets or what?
- I don't have them.
- I don't have them!
- They're on the fridge.
- Dad?
- Honey, there's plenty of time.
- Hello, Admiral.
- Morning, Jack.
- You know Marty Cantor.
- How's the shoulder?
Not too bad.
Something's come up.
Can we sit down and have a chat?
He escaped while they were moving him.
We think he's left the country.
Excuse me.
Let's deal in what we know and not what we don't.
We know he's escaped in Kent near the Channel.
If he's left the country...
Jack, listening?
The chances he'd come here are so remote I have trouble saying it.
Your first instinct was to come all the way here and tell me.
Marty, want to excuse us a few minutes?
I've got a few more weeks before school starts, but I gotta dig in and prepare a few lectures.
Wanna come look over what we got?
You might turn up something new.
You're asking me if I want to come back.
Yep.
- We'll go next week, honey.
- All right.
Sorry, Sean Miller escaped.
What does that mean?
They wanted me to know... thought I might be concerned.
I'm not!
The IRA's not stupid.
They won't follow me over here.
They agree.
They're gone.
That's it.
They didn't ask you to come back to CIA?
I said no.
Just like that.
I don't wanna go back, honey.
- I saw them coming and I just...
- I know.
I can't go back to that life again, you know.
Sally, wait up, honey.
I bet your cell was better than this.
Bloody Ritz in comparison.
At least you had your own toilet.
Cheer up.
You've just been spared from hell on earth.
- A word of gratitude might be in order.
- I don't feel like resting.
Laying about like a complacent tourist.
To build an army, we've got to train like soldiers.
We can't do that in Ireland.
- Bleedin' waste of time.
- There's laying about and laying low.
- There's a difference.
- Is there?
Lord Holmes should worry about complacency.
Next time he won't be so lucky.
Post him back to Whitehall in bits if that's what frees Irish prisoners.
That's not what I'm thinking of.
What Ryan has done can't be undone.
Stop thinking about it.
I can't.
How could this have happened?
Highland picked the day, the decoy routes, his men, and still they knew.
- He had two children, apparently.
- Tragic!
31 people knew your itinerary the day of your attack and of Miller's transfer five of whom are now dead.
I suggest limiting your appointments.
I will not have my itinerary dictated to me by terrorists.
The traitor had better pray to God I never find him.
We know you'll do your best, Sergeant.
- We don't know if we're coming home.
- We don't know if we're coming home.
- Stand, buckle up, shuffle to the door.
- Stand, buckle up, shuffle to the door.
Jump right out and shout Marine Corps!
Egesta appealed to Athens on what basis?
On what grounds?
Mr. Viederman...
Bad time for you?
Well... they said they'd be grateful.
Didn't they?
"Fight our battle.
The world will fear and respect you."
- Didn't the world fear Athens already?
- Didn't matter.
- Why not?
- Pride, sir.
That's the real battle they lost.
Attention on deck!
Attention to orders.
I've a presentation to make for service above and beyond the call of duty of a tourist.
Even a marine.
We recognise Professor John Ryan with the Order of the Purple Target.
And hope that he will duck next time lest he become part of history rather than a teacher of it.
- How old is he?
- Ten.
- Plate glass window?
- Yes.
- Here we go...
Hi, guys!
- Morning, Catherine.
I've got a retina at 1:
OO.
We might have to bump it.
This could take some time.
- Yep, let's bump it.
- We're all set.
OK, let's do it.
So, you just waded on in like John Wayne.
Why'd you do it?
What were you thinking, man?
- I don't know.
I wasn't thinking.
- That's it?
You sound like my students.
It just pissed me off.
I couldn't just watch him shoot those people in front of me.
It was... rage.
Pure rage...
Just made me mad.
Here's hoping you never get mad at me, man.
She's late, Sean.
And she was at this dance.
This guy, at the end, he...
- Kind of cute, isn't she?
- Is she?
Bye.
See ya.
- Hi, Mommy.
- Sweetie, how are you?
Let's do it.
Damn!
Highway 5O.
West.
- Good night, Doc.
- Good night.
- Dr. Ryan...
- He's getting away.
Where's Sean Miller?
Where's Sean Miller?
- Dr. Catherine Ryan, please.
- Dr. Ryan, are you all right?
- How long?
- Dr. Ryan...
Come on!
Come on!
- Surgery.
- Yes, this is Dr. Ryan.
- Thomson retinal scan results, please.
- Hold, please.
Come on, get off the phone.
- Look, Mom!
- It's beautiful.
- Are you still holding?
- Yes, I'm still holding.
I'd like to speak with Dr. Sutton.
Operator, I want to cut into a phone call.
The number is 555-3464.
Yeah, it's a mobile phone.
What do you mean I can't?
Faster, damn it.
- Dr. Ryan?
The retinal scan is fine.
- That's great.
Thank you.
Jesus!
- Hello!
- Cathy...
Something's happened.
Is Sally with you?
- Yeah.
- Hi, Dad!
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.
- There she is!
- Right!
I want you to get off the highway and go to the nearest police station.
- The police station?
- Just get off the highway right now.
Steady, mate.
Steady.
- Where are you now?
- I'm at Rowe Blvd.
There's a state police barracks on Houston St. Meet you there.
- Is something wrong, Mom?
- No, everything's fine.
They're gone!
Coming in.
- Mr. Ryan?
- Yeah.
Your wife's OK.
She has a concussion.
- She's pregnant.
- The baby's OK.
Don't worry.
- What about my daughter?
- Let's sit down for a moment.
- No, talk to me.
It will be a while till we know.
Maybe in the morning.
Where's Sally?
She's in the Recovery Room.
They're watching her.
We'll know in 7 or 8 hours.
They removed her spleen.
She's in pretty bad shape.
I'm sorry.
In a moment, we expect a statement from Paddy O'Neill of Sinn Fein.
- Jack, here you go.
- O'Neill is in the US for fundraising.
You OK?
Here's Cary Johnson ready to speak with Paddy O'Neill.
I'm praying for the recovery of the victims of this senseless attack.
Sinn Fein and most Irish Catholics are outraged at this heinous crime.
I want to share with Dr. Ryan our empathy and anguish but I'll wait for a more appropriate time.
- Can you confirm that the IRA?
- The IRA are not behind this attack.
- No more questions.
- Thank you, Mr. O'Neill.
- She's going to be OK.
- Thank you.
It's all right.
She's all right.
Mr. Ryan...
Mr. Ryan, I'd like to share with you our deep regret about...
Mr. Ryan!
Jack, you're involved!
It's not good process.
You're a crime victim.
That doesn't make for good analysis.
Even if you knew something about terrorism which you don't!
I have guys on it!
Guys who know all about the IRA...
I'm not standing here hat in hand!
I'm telling you I want back in.
- Jack...
- Sir...
Thank God about Sally.
Alice and I are relieved beyond words.
- You manage any sleep?
- Not much, sir.
I'm interrupting.
You were explaining how we're better off without Jack or something on those lines.
Marc Spiva, Jack Ryan, Tony Ferro.
- Hi.
- Alex Winter.
Nice to meet you, Alex.
- Well...
- Rose!
- You're looking better than I expected.
- It's an illusion.
It would have to be.
Good to see you, regardless.
We've carved a niche for you.
Here's your night table reading.
Oh, my!
"Father killed by RUC, Belfast, 1979."
Good morning.
Cut the engine, please.
Your I. D?
- Did you see the game?
- It was all right.
- What the hell!
- Nobody move!
- Keep your hands off him.
- Get 'em up!
Mornin'.
Kevin O'Donnell, IRA strategist, friend of the Millers.
After Tim Miller was killed in '79, he looked after Sean and Patrick.
This photo's recent.
I think if we find O'Donnell, Miller will be at his side.
- Are you with me, Jack?
- Yeah, just thinking.
- What about the gun?
- Think it's registered?
- Son of a bitch!
- What?
SO-13 gets an anonymous tip about a bomb factory in a flat.
They get some IRA bad guys, but realise the tip was a set-up.
We got three IRA hitmen at a farm hit by somebody else.
That's British soldiers getting out of hand.
They're not above it.
No, look.
We got IRA brigade commander Jimmy O'Reardon.
He checks into a cheap hotel and ends up shot in the head.
- That's how long after the farmhouse?
- Same day.
- Same day!
- What are you coming to, Jack?
Jack!
Where are you going?
I'm going to throw some water on my face.
Jack!
Excuse me.
- One of us is in the wrong room.
- I'm sorry.
That's OK.
Jack!
When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it.
Common sense, logic...
Listen!
Who are we looking for?
IRA terrorists or some ultra-violent faction of the IRA?
Jimmy O'Reardon checked into a hotel with a woman with long red hair!
This is who we should be looking for!
We find her... we'll find him.
I saw his wife and daughter die, but she and Neddie blew it.
Ryan's still alive.
- They're not dead, Sean.
- What?
They survived it.
I can't say it plainer than that.
- It doesn't matter.
It served its purpose.
- It does matter!
America holds its breath whenever a little girl falls down a well.
You used a sub-machine gun on one returning from school.
We've started a war.
The Brits are tearing apart Belfast for the IRA.
Their American money deny the hits so loud, the IRA looks only more guilty.
The war is raging.
When it's over, we'll be the only ones left standing.
Sean, I let you go for Paddy Boy, but that's it!
We've got work to do and it's not in Maryland.
Hello.
- Yeah?
- How's the family, Ryan?
Nearly lost them, didn't you?
It's easy to get at them.
You should look after your family better.
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
Your little girl's feeling better, eh?
Lost her spleen.
Pity that.
Makes it tough on her to fight off infection, eh, Jacky?
You sick son of a bitch!
It was him, wasn't it?
He's never going to leave us alone.
He'll never get close to us again.
That's why he calls.
It's all he can do.
You get him, Jack.
I don't care what you do.
Just get him.
Can I buy you a drink?
No...
Let me buy you one.
Barney, two whiskies.
- The IRA's not responsible for all this.
- You waiting for me to agree?
- I've said this 'til I'm blue in the face.
- That's the point, isn't it?
You take credit for one thing, deny it for another.
Nobody believes you anymore.
I want to know where Sean Miller and Kevin O'Donnell are.
Let me understand this.
You want me to sell out my fellow Irishman to you.
Is that why you came here?
You don't know me at all.
I think I do!
I don't give a damn what they've done.
The day I sell out my countrymen is the day I put a bullet through my own head.
- That's it, then.
- That's it.
On second thought I won't have a drink with you.
- OK, then I'll go home.
- Have a safe trip.
I'll call the TV stations.
Let them film my daughter's hospital room.
Put it on the evening news.
I don't give a shit whether you did it or not.
Nor will anyone else.
I'll put such a stranglehold on your gun money you'll be back to throwing rocks.
I'll fucking destroy you!
It will be my mission in life!
Excuse me.
Lads, did you hear that?
Stand sideways, you're less of a target.
Yes!
Satellite's coming!
Celts, let's go!
Get inside!
So...
SO-13 traced the weapons in the Lord Holmes incident to an arms dealer that supplies Qaddafi.
When Sean escaped, he was last seen in the Channel in a gale which didn't figure until I checked the freighters out there that day.
Syrian registry, carrying arms to client states including Qaddafi.
- Sean takes a slow boat to Libya.
- Exactly!
Our satellites photograph how many camps?
- 182.
- 182 camps a day in North Africa.
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade, Action Directe, German Red Army...
The day this ship docked, there are only 9 camps with people arriving.
This one we know for sure is PLO.
This one Shining Path.
These seven we're not so sure about.
Why?
We've got satellites in...
Because those camps know exactly when the satellites pass over.
Unless you retask those satellites so we can get a real look we'll never know which camp they're at.
Do you know how big a deal it is to retask those satellites?
Yeah.
Bring up Camp 18 again.
Tighten on the camp here.
Let's look up in here.
See what we can see.
Show me this grouping here.
No, there's nothing.
Go back to the bigger picture.
Let me see down here.
What's that?
Tighten up on that, will you?
Can you enhance that?
Sharpen it up?
Tits.
SAS could take out this camp in under two minutes.
Kill everybody there and be gone before the echo fades.
Are you sure it's the same woman?
Keep at it, then.
Son of a bitch.
Hi.
Read it again, Daddy.
"The sun did not shine.
It was too wet to play.
"So we sat in the house all that cold, cold, wet day."
"I sat there with Sally, we sat there, we two.
"And I said:
How I wish we had something to do!
"Too wet to go out, too cold to play ball.
"So we sat in the house, we did nothing at all.
"So all we could do was just sit, sit, sit, sit.
"And we did not like it, not one little bit.
"And then, something went boom."
Paddy O'Neill can sleep at night.
In fact, he probably enjoys the irony.
She's not Irish.
She's English.
This is the girl you saw in the blink of an eye in a jeep doing 4Omph?
- Yeah.
- What am I supposed to do here?
Tell SO-13 her name.
Give them her picture.
Tell them about the rare books.
- What do you mean "what do you do?"
- What about you, Jack?
You walk into an IRA bar.
You approach the IRA's bagman and in front of his guys, you threaten him?
You never were a field man.
You are an analyst.
Analyse that!
I'm not after your job, Marty.
- I'm after Sean Miller.
- Then, think!
You tell O'Neill you're looking for a girl.
He obliges you with some pictures.
And you believe him?
I didn't tell him I was looking for a girl.
Sergeant...
Come and look at this.
A bit of a bookworm myself.
Not that I look it.
What's your passion?
Mysteries?
Spy novels?
Ian Fleming?
- This is a rare bookshop.
- Rare books?
So they are.
- Will you locate the problem?
- I already have.
Your wiring dates from before World War I.
It's what we call in the electrical business: "rare".
- Can you fix it?
- Sure.
- Fix it!
- Can you afford it?
Just fix it!
Hello!
- He's seen it?
- I don't know.
He's got it.
Look.
What do you make of this?
I have no idea!
Damn!
I have to go out now for a few minutes to deliver some books.
- Please, keep about your repairs.
- I'll be here all week.
Don't worry.
He's mine!
Damn!
- The White House dinner's no problem.
- What is the problem?
No problem.
Just running out of dates.
We could do that.
Move that to there which would leave us... the 14th?
- The 14th.
- Geoffrey...
Let's schedule a presentation dinner at our embassy in Washington on the... - ...14th.
- The 14th!
Let's cover this again so I can get it clear.
We start in Washington...
- Geoffrey Watkins.
- I'm trying to reach Mr. Titus.
- Is that Ext. 2691?
- No, it's 2619.
I'm terribly sorry.
- Why are you up?
Go back to bed.
- I want to be there when she wakes up.
- I'll go with you, then take a cab back.
- OK.
- Hello.
- Sir John Ryan, please.
Just a minute.
It's for you, Sir John.
Mr. Ryan has a special celebration that evening.
- He invited you to join them.
- Where?
At his house?
Yes, sir.
Why not?
We shot this eight days ago in Berlin.
One...
Two...
Three...
Four Brits travelling with him.
- Light arms.
- The heavy stuff's in the cars.
He's German...
He's German.
This boring you, Sean?
Six altogether.
Should be the same security when Holmes's in Washington.
You got to find the moment when he's unprotected.
Four days, Washington.
One day, New York... shopping.
Yeah...
Two Caucasians.
Take a look at the one with the hat.
- His arms look a little pink.
- Sunburn.
New arrival.
What do you think?
Same guy?
That rare book dealer, Dennis Cooley, is bald.
It's possible there could be a woman in some of these camps but with her and Cooley in the same place.
If that is Cooley...
The odds of coincidence are dropping fast.
Still, there's no way I can be...
absolutely certain.
Excuse me, Jack.
Tell me one thing in life that is absolutely for certain.
My daughter's love.
What I need to hear is your best guess and I think I've heard it.
Haven't I?
The bastards took away my book shop.
And my books!
I'm sorry, you can't come.
You haven't got the training.
This mission is messy.
I can fire a gun.
Sorry, Dennis.
- Where are you taking me, Marty?
- You've taken us, Jack...
- Satellite now entering target area.
...into battle.
Enlargement Sector Four.
Airborne Support approaching target.
E. T.A. 35 seconds.
SAS team on ground.
- Enlarge Camp 18.
- Enlarging it.
- Enlarge primary target.
- Enlarging.
That is a kill!
Targets have been neutralised.
Keyhole is passing out of vision.
It's over.
- Roger that.
- Would your men outside like coffee?
No thank you.
They're fine.
Thank you, Sally, for inviting us to your homecoming.
You're a lovely young lady.
My pleasure to finally met you.
You're welcome.
- Can I do the presentation after dinner?
- Sure.
Would you like to see it now?
Geoffrey!
- That's very nice.
- Didn't I already give you one of those?
Is that your second piece of cake, my little sweetie?
- Where's the bathroom, Jack?
- Second door on the left.
- More coffee anyone?
- I'd love some.
- Excuse me.
- Here it comes.
Bathroom?
Someone in there?
That's not it.
That's the basement.
- Jack...?
Marty.
- Hey, what's going on?
Sorry to interrupt the party, but you need to know right away.
- SAS made positive I.D. On Cooley.
- What about the others?
It's pretty messy.
We need to verify the dental records.
But they're on top of it.
- Oh, great.
- What?
The storm caused a black-out.
I've got to light candles.
- I'll light one for you too.
- OK, Marty, thanks.
- Here we go!
- What?
Forget to pay your bill?
- Robert...!
Funny.
- Is everyone all right?
Fine, Jack.
This doesn't happen often, Lord Holmes.
Only when royalty visit.
- Is something wrong?
- Come with me.
If the storm had cut the lights, they'd be out in the boathouse too.
Power comes in from the street, branching off to here.
Jesus...
This is Ryan.
Any DSS agent?
Any DSS agent?
This is Ryan.
Federal Troopers.
Anyone?
Is anyone reading me?
Anybody?
- Can I play when the lights go on?
- Sweetie pie, you need some sleep.
Goddamnit!
- Don't tell me.
- Quite a storm.
Take your hands off me.
What do you think you're doing?
- Gun!
- Jack!
Stay right there!
Rob, over here.
How many are coming?
Where's Sean Miller?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Give me the gun.
Five, six... maybe more.
I'll get the others.
Don't turn on the lights.
- Take this.
In the basement, quick!
- Cathy's upstairs putting Sally to bed.
What's wrong?
Come on, Ryan.
Show yourself.
- Annette, upstairs.
- Right.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
What's wrong, Mommy?
Now, you've got to help.
Hide behind the suits.
Oh, God, Jack.
What did you do with the shells?
Go, go, go!
Get down!
Get back!
You all right?
- Daddy.
- Sally!
It's OK, honey.
Come on, come on!
Honey, you just got to be real quiet.
Gotcha!
Christ!
Come on.
- Who is off the air?
- DSS, state troopers, the security rep.
Give me Hostage Rescue, now!
Robby...!
Open up!
Robby, it's us.
Jack!
- They're outside.
- Cool it.
Can't ransom a dead Royal.
- They're all over the place.
- Stay close to me.
How were you going to get away?
Want to go for the other knee?
Boats.
At the bottom of the cliff.
There are ropes.
Kevin!
You've killed him!
No, Sean.
No!
We need Holmes alive.
- We're past that.
- Alive!
Come on!
- Any contact?
- Still off the air.
There he is!
Stay down!
Come on, you bastards!
Come on!
Come on!
He's alone.
He's leading us away from the Royal.
Turn around, Sean.
- No!
- Turn it around, Sean.
- No!
- Sean!
Turn around!
- Forget about Ryan.
- Don't blow the mission now, boy!
That's not my mission.
You crazy bastard!
- Had enough to eat?
Some toast?
- Pancakes.
- No time for pancakes.
Want toast?
- Toast.
- Somebody going to get that?
- Getting it.
- Sally.
- Hello.
Yes, it is.
Hold on a second.
- It's Dr. Zaillian.
- The amnio.
- Hello.
- Is it gonna be OK?
It's gonna be fine, honey.
We're just waiting to find out.
- Great!
- Want strawberry on your toast?
Hold on...
Want to know what it is?
- Did he tell you?
- He's asking.
I'm asking you.
- I don't know.
Do you want to know?
- I don't know.
Do you?
I wanted to know, but now I'm not sure.
- Hold on.
We're discussing it.
- Neither.
I do and I don't.
He's waiting.
OK...!
Tell us.
OK, tell us.
Thank you!
Sorry, we can't come to the phone right now.
If you leave a message we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
Thanks.
Hi, Mamie.
It's Jack.
We're going to leave London as planned, but we'll take a cab from the airport, so nobody has to bother to drive in and pick us up.
- We need a light shop done.
- Eight.
A few things to have in the house, milk, eggs, bread.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
Catherine wants to know if you can pick up the dry cleaning.
You already own that.
You own everything.
We didn't get that before we left.
And listen, we completely forgot about Sally's goldfish.
If by some miracle they're still alive, will you feed them and change the water, and...
Mom will make my move, honey.
And if they're not, will you go to the store and see if you can find a couple that are sort of the same size?
Okay, we'll see you soon.
Bye.
- One, two, three, four...
- What's happening?
...five, six!
Yes!
Oh, no.
Yay!
Another hotel?
What does...
What does he owe you?
You owe me?
1,100.
I haven't got it.
You win.
- I'm out.
- This girl is rich.
I want to go to sleep.
Good evening, sir.
Yes?
Will these do?
Yeah.
Bring them in.
My wife, I guess.
Candles, champagne...
Oh, honey.
I'm sorry, I didn't think of this.
That's all right.
Only one of us had to.
Is she asleep?
What about your speech?
I'll wing it.
You sure?
We have all watched, I think, with a sense of awe, the protean events which have taken place in Moscow and the Republics and the enormous changes resulting from these events.
In this volatile climate, then,
I must conclude that we can only speculate on the future of Soviet fleet development and deployment.
I would like to thank the trustees of the Royal Naval Academy for their very kind invitation to be here with you today.
He's impressed, Sally.
He just can't show it.
He's a professional soldier.
It's his job not to be distracted.
Come on.
We've got to go meet Daddy.
I'm impressed.
- Find it on the map there?
- Uh-huh.
- Good.
- We're right here.
And when we get to the street there, we turn left...
No, right.
Yeah, right.
- You sure?
- Turn right, yes.
Okay, we're going to turn right.
I'm following your map.
Okay, okay, all right.
You mind your bottom, Paddy-boy.
Move sure and fast.
You told me that, didn't you?
So I'm telling you again.
This won't be like anything you've ever done before, little brother.
Target leaving the palace now.
Right.
Stay awake, lads.
Here they come.
Okay right here?
That good?
Any more?
Little more?
Okay.
There's Daddy.
Go!
Down!
Get down!
Ready!
Get down!
Come on!
Get down.
Keep her down!
Get out of the car!
Come on!
Get out!
Open the fucking door!
Open it!
Jack!
Open it, or I'll blow it off!
Come on, let's go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Paddy?
Stop!
Army!
Drop it!
Help the boy.
No, he's had it.
It's all right, sweetie.
I want you to stay here.
Everything's going to be okay.
- Stand back, please.
- Stand back, ma'am.
That's my husband.
I'm a doctor.
I'm going to treat him.
Oh, Jesus, Jack!
What were you thinking of?
I'm going to set you down, okay?
Stay with me, Jack.
You hear me?
Stay with me.
Jack?
Jack, stay with me.
The feeling here today is one of outrage over this unprecedented terrorist attack on the royal family.
And while no group has yet claimed credit, there is, among many here, speculation already of Irish Republican Army involvement.
According to eyewitness accounts,
Lord William Holmes, the Queen Mother's cousin and Minister of State for Northern Ireland, along with his wife and son, would have most certainly been killed were it not for the heroic efforts of this man, John Patrick Ryan,
the American tourist who broke up the assassination attempt.
An author and professor at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland,
Ryan is a former Marine lieutenant.
Wounded in the exchange of gunfire, he is listed in guarded condition at an undisclosed London hospital.
This is Deborah Weston, CNN news, London.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
You're alive.
I forgive you.
Otherwise...
Hey, pumpkin.
I love you.
I love you, too.
You dignify their cowardice with your silence.
They left you.
They drove off without you.
I'm curious as to what it is you think you owe them.
If any of my mates ever drove off and left me in your hands,
I'd not only feel no great sense of loyalty,
I'd make sure to remind meself to kill them.
Who are they, Sean?
Where are they?
The trip was unscheduled.
How did you know Lord Holmes would be there?
I can't help you if you don't talk to me, you know.
I'd tear your heart out and serve it up to you with chips if I didn't know you'd enjoy it, you Fenian bastard.
No.
Not in all eternity.
He'll not chirp a word.
Not Sean Miller.
And not while his brother is lying on a slab.
What's the matter, Jimmy?
Don't you believe it?
It's the entire thing I don't believe.
The royal family, Kevin?
You know that only turns people against us.
Look, this was totally unauthorized, and the other brigade commanders, they know that you were behind it.
Fuck the bloody IRA.
All these years of war, and they've got us nowhere.
In its heart and soul, England is still a monarchy, and that is where we must strike, at the royals and the ruling class.
You're either with us or you're against us, Jimmy-boy.
Make up your mind.
Oh, I'm with you.
Good.
That's all I wanted to hear.
I'll leave you to it.
Kevin...
Charlie's going to drop by tonight to try to straighten things out.
Be smart.
Talk to him.
And hold your temper.
I promise.
Thanks, Jimmy.
Kevin.
Kevin, lad, it's me, Charlie.
That's me holding my temper, Jimmy-boy.
Oh, God.
Oh, yeah.
All right.
All right.
Oh, yeah.
- Oh, damn!
- What?
- I forgot.
- What?
Where's my bag?
You're not going to make me wear a rubber, are you?
You know, the church says wearing one of them's a sin, darlin'.
So is this, darlin'.
So, what can you tell me about...
About this guy?
Sean?
Oh, he's a nice boy, Sean Miller.
Shot a parish priest in Derry, during confession, if you can imagine.
He thought the Father was informing for the British...
Excuse me, Sergeant.
I don't think it's in Mr. Ryan's best interests or the prosecution's to discuss matters not directly related to the events at hand.
If you can confirm for me that the man in that photograph is the same man you disarmed in the square,
I think we'll be through.
I can.
Do you have anything to add, Mr. Ryan?
Yes.
- The man I killed was Miller's...
- Brother.
- Brother.
- Patrick.
Not even 17, Paddy-boy.
Recruited by Sean into the IRA...
Again, I think we'd all be better served if we could preserve the clarity of your eventual testimony.
I read it in the newspaper.
I can hardly see...
I'd appreciate you refraining from reading the newspapers.
Not even Doonesbury?
Do you have anything to add?
No.
- Mr. Ryan?
- Yes.
My name's Jeffrey Watkins, principal private secretary to Lord Holmes.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- This is my wife, Catherine.
- How do you do?
Hello.
So, Dr. Ryan, how is your patient healing?
Just fine.
We're looking forward to going home, though.
I can imagine.
May I introduce His Lordship?
Oh, hello.
It's my great honor to finally meet you, Dr. Ryan.
Thank you.
I owe you a debt of gratitude that I shall never be able to repay.
Not at all.
Thank you for your kind note.
I'm delighted that you're here to share in the good news, Mrs. Ryan.
Her Majesty's decided to invest your husband KCVO,
Knight Commander of the Victorian Order.
My congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.
- Good luck today.
Sir Jack?
Lady Catherine.
Perhaps if I'd had more time to think about it,
I would've preferred to do something else.
So you're saying you didn't have time, is that it?
That's correct.
So you didn't.
Didn't what?
Think, sir.
You didn't think is the point I believe you're trying to make.
No, instead, you raced into a situation of which, by your own admission, you had no understanding, attacked my client, who was, in fact, another pedestrian hurrying to help.
Wearing a ski mask.
Shot a second man in the chest, this one taking you, can it be...
After they shot me.
...three shots at point-blank range in order to fell the second victim.
I used that force I deemed necessary.
I should say so, and doubt very much whether anyone in this courtroom would disagree.
Excuse me.
I didn't make this happen, sir.
No further questions.
He did.
Oh, My Lord, there is one more question.
Are you still, Dr. Ryan, in the paid service of the Central Intelligence Agency?
I should remind you that you're under oath.
- No.
- I beg your pardon?
No.
That's all.
Thank you.
The witness may stand down.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, I think this might be an appropriate moment...
Bloody proud of yourself, aren't you?
You stuck your nose in where it didn't belong.
And now you've killed my baby brother.
- Hey, Daddy!
- Hey, pumpkin.
Hey.
Wow!
You guys have really grown.
How are you feeling?
Not so good.
- Tired?
- No.
I have no idea what time it is.
Feels like morning to me.
You're telling me.
Did I miss something?
No.
But I did.
I'm pregnant.
Honey!
Can I watch some TV?
I'm not at all tired.
What?
Plates.
I don't have any say in this, do I?
Sure, you do, honey.
This is a family.
Everybody's got a say.
But my say's after the fact.
Or am I wrong?
No.
You're right.
Michaela really despises her little sister.
Yeah?
Well...
Are you ready for this?
It could be even worse.
It could be a baby brother.
Oh, no.
Boys.
I mean, do you refer to these fighting men as terrorists?
No.
We call them patriots.
Jack.
Boys are...
Do you, in fact, deny that the Provisional Wing of the IRA was behind this assassination attempt?
When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it.
Thank you.
That's the policy.
They'll proudly say they did it.
Have the IRA admitted to this?
I mean, common sense, logic, some form of reason...
May I at least suggest some names?
Some think your efforts in America raising money for the Irish cause will be affected...
Sure you can, honey.
Good morning, Mr. Cooley.
And to you, madam.
- How is business?
- Fine, thank you.
I came upon this first edition at an estate auction.
Can your man restore it?
And when would you want this by, madam?
Soon.
As you can see, it's very pressing.
I'm not sure.
The binder may have some trouble with this.
Is that so?
I'll see what I can do.
He's not a miracle worker, you know.
No, obviously he's not, Mr. Cooley.
The best you can arrange, then.
- Good day, Mr. Cooley.
- Good day, madam.
Hello, Sean.
Don't mind if I come along with you, do you?
Although I disapprove of the things you've done, Sean,
I can't quite bring meself to condemn you.
I can't, because I understand where the hatred comes from.
I more than understand it.
But the present fact is that we're very near now the darkest hole in all of Great Britain,
and you still won't speak to me.
They're raising the bridge.
We'll be here about five minutes.
Understood.
Mobile Three, Lymington.
Open the door!
Open it, or I'll kill him.
- They've got the bridge keeper.
- What do we do?
- We open the door.
- Open it!
- But for Christ's sake!
- But what?
Wait until they kill him, then open the door?
Your guns!
We are unarmed.
Just who the hell are you?
Get them out!
Get your heads down!
Lay down on the bloody ground!
Don't you fucking move!
Didn't think we'd forget about you, did you?
Honest to God.
Inspector Robert Highland, this is a friend of mine.
We meet at last, Mr. Highland.
Tell me, what did they pay you to turn against your own people, eh?
Get on with it and be on your way.
Very well, if that's the way you feel about it.
Come on, Cath!
Have I got the tickets, or what?
- I don't have them.
- I don't have them.
They're on the fridge.
Dad...
Honey, there's plenty of time.
- Hello, Admiral.
- Good morning, Jack.
- You know Marty Cantor.
- Marty.
- How's the shoulder?
- Not too bad.
Something's come up.
Can we sit down and have a chat?
They were moving him to Albany Prison on the Isle of Wight when it happened.
We think he's left the country.
Marty, excuse me.
Let's deal in what we know, and not what we don't.
We know he's escaped.
We know it happened in Kent, near the Channel.
If he's left the country...
Jack, you listening?
The chances he'd come here, that he'd try, that he could come here are so remote,
I have trouble even saying it.
And yet your first instinct was to come all the way out here and tell me.
Marty, want to excuse us a few minutes?
I've got a few more weeks before school starts, but I've got to dig in and prepare a few lectures.
Want to come down and look over what we got?
You might turn up something we haven't.
You're asking me if I want to come back.
Yup.
- We'll try and go next week, honey.
- All right.
Sorry.
Sean Miller escaped.
Well, what does that mean?
They just wanted me to know.
They thought I might be concerned.
I'm not.
The IRA's not stupid.
They're not going to follow me all the way over here.
We talked about it.
They agreed.
They're gone.
That's it.
They didn't ask you to come back to CIA?
I said no.
Just like that?
I don't want to go back, honey.
I saw them coming, and I just...
I know.
I can't go back to that life again, you know?
Sally!
Wait up, honey.
I bet your cell was even better than this, the bloody Ritz in comparison.
At least you always had your own toilet bowl, eh, Sean?
Come on, Sean, cheer up.
You've just been spared a lifetime of hell on earth.
A word of gratitude might even be in order.
I don't feel like resting, laying around in the sun like some complacent tourist.
If we're to build an army, we've got to train like soldiers.
We can't do that in Ireland.
Not now.
Bleeding waste of time.
There's laying about, and there's laying low.
There's a difference.
Is there?
It's Lord Holmes who should be worried about complacency.
Next time, he won't be so lucky.
Post him back to Whitehall in little pieces, if that's what it takes to free every Irish political prisoner.
That's not who I'm thinking of.
I know that, Sean, but what Ryan done can't be undone, so you should stop thinking about him.
I can't.
How in the world could something like this have happened?
Inspector Highland picked the day, picked the decoy routes, picked the men, and still they knew.
He had two children, apparently.
It's tragic, tragic.
SO13 have narrowed it down to 31 people who had prior knowledge of your itinerary on the day of the attack, and of Miller's transfer, five of whom are now dead.
Sir, I think it might be best if we limit your appointments for the time being.
I will not have my itinerary dictated to me by terrorists.
Whoever this traitor is, they'd better pray to God I never find him.
We know you'll do your best, Sergeant.
And we don't know if we're ever coming home
And we don't know if we're ever coming home
Stand up, buckle up shuffle through the door
Stand up, buckle up shuffle through the door
Jump on out and shout Marine Corps
Egesta appealed to Athens on what basis?
On what grounds?
Mr. Viederman?
Bad time for you?
Well, they said they'd be grateful, didn't they?
Yeah.
Fight our battle, and the rest of the world will fear and respect you.
Yeah, but didn't the rest of the world fear and respect Athens already?
It didn't matter.
It didn't matter?
Why not?
Pride, sir?
That's the battle they lost, the real battle.
Attention on deck!
Attention to orders.
I have a presentation to make.
For service above and beyond the call of duty of a tourist, even a Marine, we recognize Professor John Patrick Ryan with the Order of the Purple Target, and hope that he will duck next time, lest he become part of history rather than a teacher of it.
- How old is he?
- Ten.
Plate glass window?
Here we go.
- Hi, guys.
- Good morning, Cathy.
I've got a retina at 1:00.
We might have to bump it.
This could take some time.
Yep, let's bump it.
We're all set to go.
Okay, let's do it.
So you just waded on in like John Wayne.
Why did you do it?
What were you thinking, man?
I don't know.
I wasn't thinking.
That's it?
You sound like some of my students.
It just pissed me off.
I couldn't just stand there and watch them shoot those people right in front of me.
It was rage.
Pure rage.
It just made me mad.
Here's hoping you never get mad at me, man.
Okay, now it's my turn.
She's late, Sean.
- Yeah, and then what?
- And then she was at our dance.
Yeah?
And then this guy, at the end, he...
Kind of cute, isn't she?
Is she?
- Bye.
- See ya.
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, sweetie.
How are you?
Let's do it.
Goddamn!
Highway 50.
West.
- Good night, Doc.
- Good night.
Dr. Ryan!
Clear the way!
Where's Sean Miller?
Where's Sean Miller?
This is Surgery.
Yeah, Dr. Catherine Ryan, please.
- Dr. Ryan, are you all right?
- She's left for the day.
How long?
Dr. Ryan?
Come on!
Come on!
Surgery.
Yes.
This is Dr. Ryan.
I'd like the results on the Thompson boy's retinal scan.
Hold, please.
Come on, Cathy, get off the phone.
- Look, Mom.
- It's beautiful.
Are you still holding?
Yes, I'm still holding.
Look, I'd like to speak with Dr. Sutton.
Operator, I want to make an emergency breakthrough.
The number is 555-3464.
Yeah, it's a mobile phone.
What do you mean, I can't?
Faster, damn it!
Come on, Cath.
Dr. Ryan, we have the results of that retinal scan, and everything is fine.
That's great.
Thank you.
Jesus!
Hello?
- Cathy.
- Jack?
Cath, something's happened, honey.
- Is Sally with you?
- Yeah.
Hi, Dad!
Is everything all right?
Yeah, everything's fine.
There she is.
Right.
Honey, I want you to get off the highway and get to the nearest police station as quick as you can, all right?
The police station?
Cathy, just get off the highway right now.
Steady, mate.
Steady.
Where are you now?
I'm at Rowe Boulevard.
There's a State Police barracks at Houston Street.
- I'll meet you there.
- Okay.
Is something wrong, Mom?
No.
Everything's fine.
It's okay.
They're gone.
I got it!
Coming in!
- Mr. Ryan?
- Yeah.
Your wife's okay.
She sustained a concussion, but we ran a complete skull...
- She's pregnant.
- I know.
The baby's okay.
You don't have to worry...
What about my daughter?
Let's sit down for a moment.
No.
Talk to me.
It's going to be a little while before we know.
Maybe in the morning.
Where's Sally?
She's in the recovery room, honey.
They're watching her.
We'll know in seven or eight hours.
They had to remove her spleen.
She's in pretty bad shape.
I'm sorry.
Harry Johnson is standing by.
In a few moments, he expects to have a statement from Mr. Paddy O'Neil.
Mr. O'Neil is the Sinn Fein representative...
Jack.
Here you go.
You okay?
And now we go to Harry Johnson, ready to speak with Mr. Paddy O'Neil.
I've come to stand vigil and to pray for the recovery of the victims of this senseless attack.
Sinn Fein are outraged, as indeed are most Irish Catholics this morning at this heinous crime.
Look, I want to share with Dr. Ryan, personally, our empathy and anguish, but I will wait as I feel it proper for the most appropriate time.
Can you confirm or deny that funding for the IRA is...
The IRA are not responsible for this attack.
What you're saying is the IRA had nothing to do with this incident?
No more questions.
Thank you, Mr. O'Neil.
She's going to be okay.
Thank you.
She's all right.
She's all right.
Ryan.
Mr. Ryan.
Mr. Ryan, I'd like to share with you our deep regret about...
Mr. Ryan.
You know the deal, Jack.
Come on, you are involved.
- Marty, don't tell me about the deal.
- That is not good process.
- I know the deal.
- You are the victim of a crime.
And that does not make for the best analysis even if you knew something about terrorism, which you do not.
I have guys on it, guys who know something about the IRA.
- Marty, I am not standing here...
- This is not naval intelligence.
Marty, I am not standing here with my hat in my hand!
I am telling you, I want back in.
Jack?
Sir.
- Thank God about Sally.
- Thank you.
Alice and I are relieved beyond words.
- You manage any sleep?
- Not much, sir.
I'm interrupting something.
You were explaining to Jack about how we'd be better off without him around here,
or something along those lines.
Marc Spiva, Jack Ryan.
- Nice to meet you.
- Tony Ferro.
Hi.
Alex Winter.
- Jack.
- Nice to meet you, Alex.
Well.
Rose.
I have to say, you're looking better than I expected.
It's an illusion, I'm afraid.
Of course, it would have to be, wouldn't it?
Well, it's good to see you again regardless.
You, too.
Look, we've carved a niche for you, and here's your night-table reading.
Oh, my.
"Father killed by RUC.
"Belfast. 1979."
This way.
Over here.
Good morning, sir.
Cut the engine, please.
Can I see some form of identification, please?
- Did you see the game, then?
- Yeah.
It was all right.
What the hell?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Nobody move!
Get them up!
Morning.
Kevin O'Donnell, longtime IRA strategist, friend of the Miller family.
He was there when Timothy Miller was killed, '79.
Looked after his boys, Sean and Patrick.
This photo's not a year old.
I think if we could find O'Donnell, we'll find Miller still standing at his side.
Are you with me?
Jack?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm just thinking.
- What about the gun?
- What about it?
Think it's going to turn up registered?
I'm asking a question.
- Son of a bitch.
- What?
Look...
SO13 gets an anonymous tip about some bomb-like stuff on a table in an apartment.
They go in, and they get some IRA bad guys, they look around, and they see there's no way anybody could have seen through the window, like the tipster said.
We've got three IRA hit men at a farmhouse hit by somebody else.
That's British soldiers getting out of hand, Jack.
They're not above it, not after a hit on the royal family.
No, no, no, no, look.
We've got Brigade Commander of the IRA, Jimmy O'Reardon, checks into a cheap hotel room, ends up dead, double tap to the head.
Very professional.
And that was...
How long after the farmhouse?
Same day.
Same day.
What are you coming to, Jack?
Jack!
Where are you going?
I'm just going to go throw some water on my face.
Jack!
Excuse me.
I think one of us is in the wrong room.
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.
Jack!
Get down!
When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it.
Get down!
I mean, common sense, logic...
Get down!
Get down!
We didn't get any prints or anything like that.
Listen, who are we looking for here, huh?
IRA terrorists, or some ultraviolent faction of the IRA fighting the cause their way?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jimmy O'Reardon checked into a hotel with a woman with long hair, long red hair.
This is who we should be looking for.
We find her, we'll find him.
I saw his wife and daughter die.
But she and Neddie blew it.
Ryan's still alive.
They're not dead, Sean!
What?
They survived it.
I can't say it any plainer than that!
It doesn't matter.
The trip served its purpose.
It does matter!
Sean, Americans hold their breath every time a little girl falls down a pipe in the backyard, but you've shot at one with a submachine gun on her way back from school.
Well, we've started the bleeding war.
The Brits are tearing apart Belfast for the IRA, and their American money are denying the hits so loud, it only makes them look more guilty.
The war is raging, and when it's over, we'll be the only ones left standing.
Sean, I let you go for Paddy-boy, but that's it.
We've got work to do, and it's not in Maryland.
Hello.
Yeah?
How's the family, Ryan?
You nearly lost them, didn't you?
It's easy to get at them.
You should look after your family better, you know.
Are you there?
Yeah.
I understand your little girl's feeling better, eh?
Lost her spleen, though, yeah?
Pity, that.
Make it mighty tough on her to fight off infection, eh, Jackie?
You sick son of a bitch.
It was him, wasn't it?
He's never going to leave us alone.
He'll never get that close to us again, honey.
That's why he's making calls in the middle of the night.
That's all he can do.
You get him, Jack.
I don't care what you have to do.
Just get him.
Here's to you
My brave Irish laddies
We'll not be broken downhearted and sad
So let us drink a toast to all of our comrades
Who stand for the honor and pride of our land
Can I buy you a drink?
No.
Let me buy you one.
Barney, two whiskeys.
The IRA's not responsible for all this.
I know that.
Are you waiting for me to agree with you?
I've been saying this to the press till I'm blue in the face.
That's the point, isn't it?
You claim responsibility for one thing, deny it for another.
Nobody believes you anymore.
I want to know where Sean Miller and Kevin O'Donnell are.
Let me try and understand this.
You want me to sell out my fellow Irishmen to you?
Is that why you came down here?
You don't understand me at all.
Oh, I think I do.
Look, I don't give a damn what they've done, but the day that I sell out my countrymen will be the day that I put a bullet through my own head.
That's it, then, huh?
That's it.
You know, on second thought, maybe I won't have a drink with you.
Okay, then I'll go home.
Have a safe trip.
I'll go home and call the TV stations, give them what they want.
Let them take their cameras into my daughter's hospital room.
Put it on the evening news.
I don't give a shit whether you did it or not, and neither will anyone else, but I will put such a stranglehold on your gun money, you'll be out in the street throwing rocks.
I will fucking destroy you.
I will make it my mission in life.
Excuse me.
Well, lads, did you hear that?
Stand sideways, you're less of a target.
Yes!
Satellite's coming!
Celts, let's go!
Come on.
Get inside!
So...
SO13 traced the weapons used in the Lord Holmes incident to an arms dealer that supplies Qaddafi.
Now, when Sean Miller escaped, he was last seen in a Zodiac heading out into the Channel in a gale, which didn't make much sense until I checked on the freighters that were out there that day.
Syrian registry.
Known to carry arms from the Middle East to client states in the Mediterranean, including Qaddafi.
So, Miller takes a slow boat to North Africa.
Exactly.
Now, we send our birds up over the desert, photographing, what, how many camps?
One hundred and eighty-two.
One hundred and eighty-two camps a day in North Africa.
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade,
Action-Directe, West German Red Army Faction.
But on the day that this particular ship docked in Benghazi, there's activity in only nine camps with people arriving.
Now, this one we know for sure is PLO.
This one's Shining Path.
These seven we're not so sure about.
Why?
Well, we got satellites...
Well, because the people in those camps know probably better than we do exactly what time the satellite's going to pass overhead.
And, Marty, unless you authorize us to retask those satellites so we can get a look before they're overhead from the side, we're never going to know which camp they're at.
Jack, do you have any idea how big a deal it is to retask those satellites?
Yeah.
Bring up camp 18 again.
Tighten on the camp here.
Let's look up in here.
See what we can see.
Show me this grouping here.
No, that's nothing.
Go back to the bigger picture.
Let me see down here.
What's that?
Tighten up on that, will you?
Can you enhance that, sharpen it up?
Tits.
I don't know.
SAS could take on any one of these camps in under two minutes, kill everybody there, and be gone before the echo fades.
Are you sure this is the same woman?
Keep at it, then.
Son of a bitch.
Hi.
Read it again, Daddy.
"The sun did not shine.
"It was too wet to play,
"so we sat in the house all that cold, cold, wet day.
"I sat there with Sally.
We sat there, we two.
"And I said, 'How I wish we had something to do. '
"Too wet to go out, too cold to play ball.
"So we sat in the house.
"We did nothing at all.
"So all we could do was just sit, sit, sit, sit.
"And we did not like it, not one little bit.
"And then something went bump. "
Paddy O'Neil can sleep at night.
In fact, he probably enjoys the irony.
She's not Irish.
She's English.
And this is the girl you saw in the blink of an eye in a jeep as it passed you doing 40?
Yeah.
What am I supposed to do here?
Tell SO13 you know who she is.
Tell them her name.
Give them her picture.
Tell them that she poses as a rare book dealer and ask them to look for her.
What do you mean, what do you do?
What am I supposed to do with you, Jack?
You walk into a bar, half of whose customers want you dead.
You walk up to the IRA's bagman, and in front of his guys, you threaten him?
You're not a field man, Jack.
You never were.
You are an analyst.
Analyze that.
I am not after your job, Marty.
I'm after the man who tried to kill my family.
Then will you think?
You tell O'Neil that you're looking for a girl.
He gives you the pictures of a girl.
He obliges you to get you off his back, and you believe him?
I didn't tell him I was looking for a girl, Marty.
Sarge?
Come and look at this.
Bit of a bookworm meself, not that you'd know it to look at me.
What's your passion, then?
Mysteries?
Spy novels?
Familiar with Ian Fleming, are you?
This is a rare book shop.
Rare books?
Yeah, so they are.
Can you locate the problem, or do I have to call someone else?
Already have.
The wiring in this whole place dates from before the war.
The first war.
It's what we call, in the electrical business, rare.
Yes.
Can you fix it?
Oh, sure.
I can fix it.
Can you afford it?
That's the question.
Just fix it.
Hello.
He's seen it, hasn't he?
I don't know.
He's got it.
Look.
Here, what do you make of this?
I...
I have no idea.
Damn!
I have to go out now for a few minutes to deliver some books.
Please keep about your repairs.
I'll be here all week, guv.
Don't worry.
He's mine!
Damn!
Dinner at the White House is no problem.
What is the problem?
No problem, we're just running out of dates.
Yes.
We could do that.
Move that to there, which would leave us the 14th?
The 14th.
Geoffrey, let's check with John Ryan about scheduling a presentation dinner at our embassy in Washington on the... 14th.
The 14th.
So, let's go over this again so I can get it clear.
We start in Washington with the White House...
Geoffrey Watkins.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I'm trying to reach Mr. Titus.
Is that extension 2691?
No, this is 2619.
I'm terribly sorry.
What are you doing up?
Go back to bed.
I wanted to be there when she wakes up.
I'll go with you, and then I'll take a cab back.
Okay.
Hello?
Yes.
Just a minute.
It's for you,
Sir John.
Hello?
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Ryan has a special celebration that evening that he can't change.
He wondered if you might care to join them.
Where, at his house?
Yes, sir.
Why not?
We shot this eight days ago in Berlin.
One, two, three, four Brits traveling with him.
Light arms.
The heavy stuff's in the cars.
He's German, he's German.
This boring you, Sean?
Four, six altogether.
Should be the same security when Holmes flies to Washington.
We've got to find the moment when he's unprotected.
Four days in Washington, one day in New York.
Shopping.
Yeah.
Two Caucasians.
Take a look at the one with the hat.
His arms look a little pink.
Sunburn.
New arrival.
What do you think?
Same guy?
That rare book dealer, Dennis Cooley, he's bald.
Now, it's possible there could be a woman in some of these camps, but with her and Cooley in the same place,
if that is Cooley, the odds of coincidence are dropping fast.
Still, I don't know.
There's no way I can be absolutely certain.
Excuse me, Jack.
Tell me one thing in life that is absolutely for certain.
My daughter's love.
What I need to hear from you is your best guess, and I think I've heard it.
Haven't I?
The bastards took away my book shop.
They took away my books!
I'm sorry, Dennis.
You can't come.
You haven't got the training, and this mission's going to be very messy.
I can fire a gun.
Sorry, Dennis.
Where are you taking me, Marty?
It's you who've taken us, Jack...
Satellite now entering target area.
...into battle.
Sir.
Enlargement sector four.
Airborne support approaching target area.
ETA, 35 seconds.
SAS team on ground.
- Enlarge camp 18.
- Enlarging.
- Enlarge primary target.
- Enlarging.
That is a kill.
Roger, roger.
It's go, go, go.
Targets have been neutralized.
Airborne support approaching.
Enlarge sector five.
Angle sector two.
Sector two.
SAS team withdrawing.
Keyhole is passing out of visual.
It's over.
Come on, honey.
Jump.
See?
Appreciate it.
Thanks.
Surveillance team one, all clear.
Roger that.
You sure your men outside wouldn't like some coffee?
No, thank you, Mrs. Ryan.
They'll be just fine.
Okay.
And I'd to thank you, Miss Ryan, for allowing us to impose upon your homecoming.
- You're...
- You're a beautiful and gracious young lady.
And it's my distinct pleasure to make your acquaintance.
You're welcome.
I thought I might make the presentation after dinner, if you agree.
Oh, sure.
Would you like to see it now?
Geoffrey...
- Oh, my.
That's very nice.
- It's lovely.
Didn't I already give you one of those?
Help yourselves.
Is that your second piece of cake, my little sweetie?
Where's the bathroom, Jack?
- Second door on the left.
- Thank you.
More coffee, anyone?
I'd love some.
Excuse me.
Here it comes.
Bathroom?
- Someone in there.
- No, that's not it.
That's the basement.
Hello?
Jack?
Marty.
Hey, Marty.
What's going on?
I'm sorry to interrupt your party, but I thought you'd like to know right away.
SAS just made positive ID on Dennis Cooley.
What about the others?
Well, it was pretty messy, as it turns out.
It's going to take 48 hours to verify the dental records, but they're keeping right on it.
Oh, great.
What?
The storm just knocked out the power here to the house.
I've got to light some candles.
I'll light one for you, too.
Okay, Marty.
Thanks.
Here we go.
What, forget to pay your bill, Cath?
Oh, Robert.
Very funny.
Everyone all right?
- We're fine, Jack.
- We like it better this way.
This doesn't happen very often, Lord Holmes.
Only when we have royalty over for dinner.
I knew you'd understand.
Something wrong?
- Come with me, will you?
- Oh, Mom, do I have to?
If the storm had knocked out the lights, they'd be out in the boathouse, too.
So?
Power comes in from the street, and then branches off to here.
Jesus.
This is Ryan.
Any DSS agent?
Any DSS agent, this is Ryan.
Maryland troopers?
Anyone?
Is anyone reading me?
Anybody?
Can I come back down when the lights are on?
No, sweetie-pie.
You've got to get some sleep.
It's very late.
Goddamn.
Don't tell me.
Quite a storm.
Take your hands off me.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Jack.
Gun.
Jack.
Stay right there.
Shit.
Rob, over here.
What's the plan?
How many are coming?
Where's Sean Miller?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give me the gun.
Five?
Six?
I don't know.
Maybe more.
I'll get the others.
Don't turn on the lights.
Take this.
Get down in the basement quick.
- Where's Cathy and Sally?
- They're upstairs.
- She's putting Sally to bed.
- Go.
What's wrong?
Come on, Ryan.
Show yourself.
Annette, upstairs.
Right.
Come on, sweetie, come on.
What's wrong, Mommy?
Now, you've got to help me.
Climb up on the stool.
There's a shotgun there.
Oh, God, Jack, what did you do with the shells?
Go, go, go.
- Get down.
- Mommy!
Go on.
Get back.
You all right?
Where's Sally?
- Daddy.
- Sally.
It's okay, honey.
Come on.
Honey, you've just got to be real quiet.
Real quiet.
Gotcha.
Christ.
Hold on.
Come on, come on.
What are you talking about?
Who is off the air?
DSS, state troopers, everyone.
The security company...
Get me Hostage Rescue at Quantico now.
Robby!
Open up.
- Robby, it's us.
- Jack?
- They're outside.
- Sean, cool it.
It's the royal we want.
We can't ransom a dead body.
They're all over the place, man.
Stay close to me.
How were you going to get away, huh?
Want to go for the other knee?
Come on!
Come on.
Boats.
Bottom of the cliff.
There are ropes.
Kevin!
You killed him!
No, Sean, no!
We need Holmes alive!
We're past that!
Alive!
Come on!
Any contact?
Still off the air.
There he is!
Stay down there.
Come on, you bastards.
Come on!
Come on!
He's alone!
He's leading us away from the royal!
- Turn around, Sean.
- No.
Turn it round, Sean!
- Turn it round, Sean!
- No!
Sean!
Turn it round!
Turn it round!
Forget about Ryan!
Don't blow the mission now, boy!
That's not my mission!
You crazy bastard!
Damn!
Had enough to eat, honey, or do you want something else?
- Some toast or...
- Pancakes.
There's no time for pancakes, honey.
Do you want toast or toast?
Toast.
- Is somebody going to get that?
- I'm getting it.
Sally?
Hello?
It is.
Yeah, hold on a second.
- Where's your backpack?
- It's Dr. Zaillian.
- The amnio.
- Yeah.
Hello?
Is it going to be okay?
It's going to be fine, honey.
We're just waiting to find out.
Great.
What do you want on your toast, honey?
- Strawberry?
- Strawberry.
Hold on a second.
Do you want to know what it is?
Did he tell you?
He's asking.
I'm asking you.
I don't know.
Do you want to know?
I don't know.
Do you?
Well, I thought I wanted to know, but now I'm not so sure.
Hold on a second.
We're discussing it.
Me, neither.
I mean, I do and I don't.
He's waiting.
Okay.
Tell us.
Okay, tell us.
Thank you.
We can't come to the phone rightnow.
Please leave a message.
Hi, it's Jack.
We're going to leave London as planned.
We'll take a cab from the airport so don'tpick us up.
Eight!
One, two, three ...
You already own that.
You own everything.
We forgot about Sally's goldfish.
Feed them if they're still alive.
Mom can make my move.
If they're not, go to the store and find a couple the same size.
We'll see you soon.
Bye.
What's happening?
- Yes!
- No!
Another hotel?
- What does he owe you?
- You owe me £1 ,100.
I haven't got it. I'm out.
I want to go to sleep.
- Good evening, sir.
- Yes?
Will these do?
Yeah, bring them in.
My wife ...
I guess.
Candles, champagne ...
- l'm sor´ry l didn't think of this.
- lt's okay, only one of us had to.
is she asleep?
- What about your speech?
- l'll wing it.
Are you sure?
We have all watched in awe at the events taking place in Moscow.
And at the enormous changes resulting from these events.
In this volatile climate, we can only speculate on the future of Soviet Fleet development.
I would like to thank the Royal Navy for inviting me here today.
He's impressed, but he can't show it.
He's a professional soldier.
Come on, we've got to meet Daddy.
I'm impressed.
- Can you find it?
- Yeah, we're here.
When we get to this street, we turn left ... no, right.
Are you sure?
Okay, we're going to turn right.
Mind yourself, Paddyboy.
Move sure and fast.
- You've told me that.
- l'm telling you again.
This won't be like anything you've done before, little brother.
Targetleaving the palace now.
Stay awake, lads.
Here they come.
There's Daddy.
Go!
Get down!
Get down!
Get down.
Keep her down.
Get out of the car!
Get out!
Open the fucking door!
Open it or I'll blow you up.
Come on, let's go.
Go!
Go!
Paddy?
.
Stop!
Army!
Drop it!
What about the boy?
.
He's had it.
It's all right, sweetie.
Stay here.
- Stand back, ma'am.
- That's my husband. I'm a doctor.
Jesus!
What were you thinking of?
I'm going to set you down.
Stay with me, Jack.
You hear me?
Jack ...
Stay with me.
There's a feeling of outrage over this attack on the Royal Family.
No group has yet claimed credit, but one is under strong scrutiny.
The Ira.
According to eyewitness accounts, Lord William Holmes, the MinisterforNorthern Ireland, along with his wife and son, were saved by an American tourist, John Patrick Ryan.
An author andprofessor at the NavalAcademy in Maryland, -
- Ryan is a former Marine Lieutenant.
He was wounded and is underguard at an undisclosed London hospital.
Deborah Weston, CNN News, London.
- l'm sor´ry.
- lt's all right.
You're alive. I forgive you.
otherwise ...
Hey, pumpkin.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Can you dignify their cowardice with your silence?
They left you.
They drove off without you.
What is it you think you owe them?
If any of my mates left me in your hands, l'd feel no great sense of loyalty. I'd kill them.
Who are they, Sean?
Where are they?
.
The trip was unscheduled, but you knew Lord Holmes would be there.
I can't help you if you don't talk to me.
I'd tear your heart out if I didn't know you'd enjoy it.
You Fenian bastard.
No, not in all eternity.
He'll not chirp a word.
Not Sean Miller.
Not while his brother's lying on a slab.
- Don't you believe it, Jimmy?
.
- l don't believe the entire thing.
The Royal Family, that only turns people against us.
This was totally unauthorised.
The brigade know you were behind it.
Fuck the Ira!
All these years of war and they've got us nowhere.
England is still a monarchy, and that is where we must strike.
The Royals and the ruling class.
You're either with us or you're against us.
- Make up your mind.
- l'm with you.
Good, that's all I wanted to hear.
I'll leave you to it.
Kevin.
Charlie's going to drop by to straighten things out.
Be smart.
Talk to him and hold your temper.
I promise.
Thanks, Jimmy.
Kevin!
Kevin, it's Charlie.
That's me holding my temper.
- Damn!
I forgot.
- What?
Where's my bag?
You're not going to make me wear a rubber?
.
- The church says it's a sin, darling.
- So's this, darling.
What can you tell me about this guy?
.
He's a nice boy.
Sean Miller.
He shot a priest in Der´ry.
It was during confession.
He thought he was informing for the British.
It's not in Mr Ryan's best interests, nor the prosecution's, to discuss matters not directly at hand.
If you can confirm for me that you disarmed that man in the square, we'll be through.
- l can.
- Do you have anything to add?
Yes.
The man I killed was Miller's ... brother.
Patrick ... not even 1 7.
He was recruited by Sean into the Ira.
T´ry to preserve the clarity of your eventual testimony.
- l read it in a newspaper.
- Refrain from reading newspapers.
Not even Doonesbury?
.
Do you have anything to add?
No.
My name's Geoffrey Watkins.
Private secreta´ry to Lord Holmes.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
This is my wife, Catherine.
Dr Ryan, how is your patient?
Just fine, we're looking forward to going home, though.
- May I introduce his lordship?
- Hello.
It's my great honour to finally meet you.
I owe you a debt of gratitude that I shall never be able to repay.
I'm delighted you're here to share in the good news, Mrs Ryan.
Her Majesty has decided to invest your husband with a knighthood.
My congratulations ...
Sir.
Good luck today.
Sir Jack!
Lady Catherine!
If I'd had time to think, I'd have preferred to do something else.
You're saying you didn't have time, so you didn't?
- Didn't what?
- You didn't think. lsn't that it?
No, you raced into a situation of which you had no understanding and attacked my client, who was a pedestrian also hur´rying to help.
- Wearing a ski mask?
.
- You shot another man in the chest.
- After they shot me.
- And felled a second victim.
I used that force I deemed necessa´ry.
I should say so. I doubt ve´ry much if anyone would disagree.
I didn't make this happen ...
He did.
There is one more question.
Are you still in the paid service of the ClA?
Remember you're under oath.
- No.
- l beg your pardon?
No!
That's all, thank you.
The witness may stand down.
Thank you.
Bloody proud of yourself, aren't you?
You stuck your nose in, and now you've killed my baby brother.
Hey, Daddy.
Wow, you guys have really grown.
- How are you feeling?
- Not so good.
- Are you tired?
- No.
- l have no idea what time it is.
- You're telling me.
- Did I miss something?
- No ... but I did.
I'm pregnant.
Honey!
Can I watch some TV?
I'm not at all tired.
What?
Plates.
- Do I have any say in this?
- Sure, this is a family.
- Eve´ryone has a say.
- But my say is after the fact.
- Or am I wrong?
- No, you're right.
Michaela despises her little sister.
Well, it could be even worse.
It could be a baby brother.
Oh no!
Boys!
Jack.
Are you denying that the Ira was behind this action?
When the Ira carry out a campaign, they admit to it.
That's theirpolicy.
They'llproudlysay they did it.
Have the Ira admitted to this?
I mean, common sense, logic ...
Can I at least suggest some names?
Sure you can.
Good morning, Mr Cooley.
And to you.
How's business?
Fine, thank you. I came upon this first edition at an estate auction.
Can your man restore it?
- When would you want this by?
.
- Soon.
The binder may have some trouble with this.
is that so?
I'll see what I can do.
He's not a miracle worker.
No, obviously he's not, Mr Cooley.
The best you can arrange then.
- Good day, Mr Cooley.
- Good day, madam.
Hello, Sean, do you mind if I come along with you?
Although I disapprove of the things you've done, l can't quite bring myself to condemn you.
I can't, because I understand where the hatred comes from.
I more than understand it.
But the fact is, we're ve´ry near the darkest hole in all of Great Britain, and you still won't speak to me.
The bridge is up.
We'llbe here forfive minutes.
Understood.
Mobile three to Lymington ...
Open the door.
Open it or I'll kill him.
- They've got the bridge keeper.
- Open the door.
Should we wait until they kill him and then open the door?
.
- Your guns.
- We are unarmed.
Get them out.
Lie down.
Don't you fucking move.
Did you think we'd forget about you?
Inspector Robert Highland, this is a friend of mine.
Tell me, what do they pay you to turn against your own people?
Get on with it and be on your way.
Ve´ry well, if that's the way you feel about it.
Come on, Cath.
- Have I got the tickets?
- They're on the fridge!
- Dad ...
- Honey, there's plenty of time.
- Hello, Admiral.
- Jack, you know Marty Cantor.
- How's the shoulder?
.
- Not too bad.
Something's come up.
Can we sit down and have a chat?
They were moving him to Albany Prison on the Isle of Wight.
- We think he's left the count´ry.
- Let's deal in what we know.
We know he escaped in Kent, near the Channel.
If he's left the count´ry ...
Jack, are you listening?
The chances that he'd come here, or would t´ry to, are so remote I have trouble even saying it.
Yet your first instinct was to come out here and tell me.
Marty, excuse us a few minutes.
I've got a few more weeks before school starts, but I've got to prepare a few lectures.
Come and look at what we've got.
You might turn up something.
You're asking me if I want to come back.
Yep.
We'll t´ry and go next week.
Sor´ry.
Sean Miller escaped.
What does that mean?
They thought I might be concerned, but I'm not.
The Ira's not going to follow me over here.
We talked about that.
They're gone, that's it.
They didn't ask you to come back to cla?
- l said no.
- Just like that.
I don't want to go back.
- l saw them coming and I just ...
- l know.
I can't go back to that life again, you know?
.
I bet your cell was better than this.
At least you had your own toilet bowl.
Cheer up, you've just been spared a lifetime of hell on earth.
I don't feel like resting, laying in the sun like a complacent tourist.
We've got to train like soldiers and we can't do that in Ireland.
It's a waste of time.
There's a difference between laying about and laying low.
Next time we'll post Lord Holmes back to Whitehall in pieces, if that's what it takes to free eve´ry Irish political prisoner.
- That's not what I'm thinking of.
- l know that.
What Ryan did can't be undone.
Stop thinking about it.
I can't.
How could something like this have happened?
Inspector Highland picked the day and the route, and still they knew.
- He had two children.
- Tragic.
SO-13 have narrowed it down to 31 people who had this knowledge.
Five of whom are now dead.
You should limit your appointments.
I will not have my itinera´ry dictated to me by terrorists.
Whoever this traitor is, they'd better pray I never find him.
We know you'll do your best, sir.
We don't know ifwe're ever coming home stand up, buckle up, shuffle through the door jump out and shout Marine Corps!
Egesta appealed to Athens on what basis, on what grounds?
Mr Viederman?
A bad time for you?
They said they'd be grateful.
- Didn't they?
.
- Yeah.
"Fight our battle and the world will fear and respect you."
- Athens already had respect.
- lt didn't matter.
- Pride, sir.
- That's the real battle.
- Attention on deck.
- Attention to orders.
I have a presentation to make.
For service above and beyond the call of duty of a tourist, we recognise John Patrick Ryan with the order of the Purple Target.
We hope that he will duck next time, lest he become part of histo´ry rather than a teacher of it.
- How old is he?
- Ten.
Plate-glass window?
.
Here goes.
Hi, guys.
We may have to bump my next appointment.
This might take time.
Yes, let's bump it.
Okay, let's do it.
You just waded on in like John Wayne.
Why did you do it?
What were you thinking?
- l don't know. I wasn't thinking.
- You sound like my students.
It pissed me off.
I couldn't just stand there and watch them shoot those people.
It was ... rage.
Pure rage.
- lt just made me mad.
- l hope you never get mad at me.
She's late, Sean.
She was at this dance, and then this guy at the end ...
She's kind of cute, isn't she?
is she?
Bye.
- Hi, Mommy.
- How are you?
Let's do it.
Damn!
Highway 50.
West.
Goodbye, Doctor.
Dr Ryan!
He's getting away.
Where's Sean Miller?
.
Dr Catherine Ryan, please.
How long?
Come on!
This is Dr Ryan. I want the results on the Thompson boy's retinal scan.
Cathy, get off the phone.
- Look, Mom.
- lt's beautiful.
I'm still holding.
I'd like to speak with Dr Sutton.
Operator, emergency breakthrough.
The number is 555-3464.
It's a mobile phone, I know.
What do you mean I can't?
Faster!
- Dr Ryan, the scan is fine.
- Great, thank you.
Jesus!
Hello?
Jack?
.
Cath, something's happened.
is Sally with you?
- ls everything all right?
- Fine.
There she is.
Get to the nearest police station as quick as you can.
- The police station?
- Get offthe highway.
Steady, mate.
- Where are you now?
- Rowe Boulevard.
There's a police station at Houston Street.
- ls something wrong?
- No, everything's fine.
They're gone.
- Mr Ryan?
- Yeah.
Your wife's okay.
She sustained a concussion.
- She's pregnant.
- The baby's okay.
- And my daughter?
.
- Let's sit down.
No, talk to me.
It's going to be a while before we know.
- Where's Sally?
.
- She's in the recove´ry room.
They're watching her.
We'll know in a few hours.
They had to remove her spleen.
She's in pretty bad shape.
I'm sor´ry.
Here you go.
Are you okay?
.
We go over to our reporter with Paddy O'Neil.
I'm praying for the recovery ofthe victims ofthis senseless attack.
Sinn Féin are outraged, as are most Irishmen, at this heinous crime.
I want to share with Dr Ryan our empathy and anguish, at an appropriate time.
- Was funding for the Ira ...
- The Ira are notresponsible here.
- Theyhad nothing to do with it?
- No more questions.
- She's going to be okay.
- Thank you.
It's all right.
She's fine.
Mr Ryan?
I'd like to share with you our deep regret ...
Mr Ryan ...
You know the deal.
You are involved.
It's not good process.
The victim of a crime does not make the best analysis, even if you knew something about terrorism.
I have guys on it who know about the Ira.
I'm not standing here with my hat in my hand. I want back in.
Jack ...
Thank God about Sally.
Alice and I are so relieved.
- Have you managed any sleep?
- Not much, sir.
I'm interrupting something.
You were telling Jack that we'd be better off without him around.
Or something along those lines.
Marc Spiva.
Jack Ryan.
Tony Ferro.
Alex Winter.
- Rose ...
- You look better than I expected.
- lt's an illusion.
- lt'd have to be.
Good to see you.
We've carved a niche for you.
Here's your night-table reading.
"Father killed by RUC ...
Belfast, 1979."
Good morning, sir.
Could I see some identification?
- Did you see the game?
- Yeah, it was all right.
For that penalty, he was outside the area.
- What the hell ..?
- Nobody move!
Get 'em up!
Good morning.
Kevin O'Donnell.
A long-time Ira strategist.
He saw Timothy Miller die in 1979.
He looked after Sean and Patrick.
It's a recent photo.
If we could find O'Donnell, we'd find Miller, too.
- Are you with me, Jack?
.
- l'm just thinking.
- What about the gun?
- lt wasn't registered.
- Son of a bitch.
- What?
Look ...
SO-13 gets an anonymous tip about some bomb-making setup.
They get the bad guys, but who tipped them off?
Three Ira hitmen found dead at a farmhouse.
That's British soldiers getting out of hand.
No, look ...
Brigade Commander Jimmy O'Reardon.
Ends up dead in a cheap hotel.
A professional hit.
- Was that after the farmhouse?
- Same day.
- Same day.
- What are you coming to?
Jack!
Where are you going?
I'm going to throw some water on my face.
Excuse me ... I think one of us is in the wrong room.
It's okay.
- Jack!
- Get down.
When the Ira carry out a campaign, they admit to it.
Get down!
Who are we looking for here, Ira terrorists?
Or some ultra-violent faction of the Ira, fighting their own way.
O'Reardon checked into an hotel with a woman with long hair.
Long red hair.
This is who we're looking for.
We find her, we'll find him.
I saw his wife and daughter die, but she and Neddie blew it.
Ryan's still alive.
- They're not dead.
- What?
They survived it.
I can't say it any plainer.
- lt doesn't matter now.
- lt does matter.
Americans hold their breath eve´ry time a little girl falls down.
You shot at one with a machine gun on her way back from school.
We've started the war.
The Brits are tearing apart Belfast for the Ira.
Their American money, by denying the hits, makes them look more guilty.
The war is raging.
When it's over, we'll be the ones left standing.
I let you go for Paddyboy, but that's it!
We've got work to do ...
and it's not in Ma´ryland.
Hello.
- Yeah?
- How's the family, Ryan?
You nearly lost them, didn't you?
It's easy to get at them.
You should look afteryour familybetter.
Are you there?
I understand your little girl's feeling better.
Losing herspleen willmake it tough on her to fight offinfection.
You sick son of a bitch.
It was him, wasn't it?
He's never going to leave us alone.
He'll never get close to us again.
All he can do is call up.
You get him, Jack.
I don't care what you have to do.
Just get him!
Can I buy you a drink?
.
No ...
Let me buy you one.
Two whiskeys.
The Ira's not responsible for all this, I know that.
Are you waiting for me to agree?
It's what I've said all along.
You claim responsibility for one thing, deny it for another.
Nobody believes you anymore.
I want to know where Sean Miller and Kevin O'Donnell are.
Let me t´ry and understand this ...
You want me to sell out my fellow Irishmen to you?
- You don't understand me at all.
- l think I do.
I don't care what they've done!
The day I sell out my own people, I'll put a bullet through my head.
- That's it then.
- Yes, I'm not drinking with you.
Okay, I'll go home.
I'll call the Press and let them film in my daughter's hospital room.
It'll be on the evening news.
I don't care if it wasn't you, and neither will anyone else.
You'll have so little gun money, you'll all be out throwing rocks.
I will fucking destroy you!
I'll make it my mission in life.
Excuse me.
Well, lads, did you hear that?
- The satellite's coming.
- Let's go.
Come on!
Get inside!
SO-13 traced the guns used in the Lord Holmes incident to an arms dealer that supplies Gaddafi.
Sean Miller was last seen in a Zodiac heading out into the Channel.
I checked on the freighters that were out there that day.
Syrian regist´ry. involved in the Middle East arms trade.
- Miller sailed to North Africa.
- Exactly.
Our planes photograph 182 camps a day in North Africa.
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade, Action Direct, Red Army Faction ...
But on the day this ship docked in Benghazi, there's activity in only nine of these camps.
One is PLO, one Shining Path, these seven we're not so sure about.
- Why?
.
- Our satellites ...
The people in those camps probably know our satellite schedules.
Marty, unless you authorise us to retask those satellites, so we can get a look in, we're never going to know which camp they're at.
Do you know how big a deal it is to retask those satellites?
Yeah.
Bring up camp 18 again.
Tighten on the camp here.
Let's look up here.
See what we can see.
Show me this grouping here.
That's nothing.
Go back to the bigger picture.
Let me see down here.
What's that?
Tighten up on that.
Can you enhance that?
Tits.
The SAS could take out any one of these camps.
Kill eve´rybody there, and be gone before the echo fades.
Are you sure this is the same woman?
Keep at it then.
Son of a bitch.
Hi.
Read it again, Daddy.
"The sun did not shine, it was too wet to play."
"So we sat in the house all that cold, wet day."
"l sat there with Sally.
We sat there, we two."
"l wish we had something to do."
"Too wet to go out.
Too cold to playball. "
"So we satin the house and did nothing at all. "
"All we could do was to sit, sit, sit. "
"We did notlike it, not one little bit. "
"And then something went... bump. "
Paddy O'Neil can sleep at night.
He probably enjoys the irony.
She's not Irish, she's English.
This is the girl you saw in the jeep, in the blink of an eye?
- Yeah.
- What am I supposed to do?
Tell SO-13 you know who she is.
Give them her picture.
Ask them to look for her.
What do you mean, what do you do?
You walk into a bar, half of whose customers want you dead.
You walk up to the Ira's bagman and publicly threaten him.
You're not a field man.
You are an analyst.
Analyse that!
I am not after yourjob. I'm after the man who tried to kill my family.
Well then, think. lf you tell O'Neil that you're looking for a girl, and he gives you pictures of a girl.
Do you believe him?
I didn't tell him I was looking for a girl.
Sarge, come and look at this.
I'm a bit of a bookworm, not that you'd know it to look at me.
What's your passion then?
Mysteries?
Spy novels?
- This is a rare book shop.
- Rare?
Yes, so they are.
- Can you locate the problem?
- l already have.
The wiring in this place dates from before the war.
It's what we call in the electrical business ... rare.
- l can fix it, but can you afford it?
- Just fix it.
- He's seen it, hasn't he?
- l don't know.
- He's got it.
- What do you make of this?
I ...
I have no idea!
Damn!
I have to go out for a few minutes to deliver some books.
- Keep about your repairs.
- l'll be here all week.
He gave me the hat.
He said, "This is for you, my dear."
Damn!
Dinner at the White House is no problem.
- What is the problem?
- We're running out of dates.
We could move that to there ...
Which would leave us the 14th.
Check with John Ryan about a presentation at our embassy in Washington on the 14th.
Let's go over this again.
We start in Washington ...
- Geoffrey Watkins.
- l'm trying to reach Mr Titus.
- ls that extension 2691?
- No, this is 2619.
I'm terribly sor´ry.
- What are you doing up?
- l want to be there when she wakes.
I'll go with you and take a cab back.
Hello ...
Yes, just a minute.
- lt's for you, Sir John.
- Hello?
Mr Ryan is holding a celebration.
Would you care to join them?
- Where?
At his house?
- Yes, sir.
Why not?
We shot this eight days ago in Berlin.
One, two, three ...
Four Brits travelling with him.
Light arms.
- The heavy stuff is in the cars.
- He's German.
- ls this boring you, Sean?
- Six altogether.
- lt'll be the same in Washington.
- Holmes will always be protected.
Four days in Washington and one day in New York shopping.
Yeah, two Caucasians.
Take a look at the one with the hat.
- His arms look a little pink.
- Sunburn.
A new arrival.
What do you think, same guy?
.
The rare-book dealer, Dennis Cooley.
He's bald.
It's possible there's a woman in some of these camps.
But with her and Cooley in the same place if that is Cooley, the odds of coincidence are dropping fast.
But still, there's no way I can be absolutely certain.
Jack, tell me one thing in life that is absolutely certain.
My daughter's love.
What I need is your best guess, and I think I've heard it.
Haven't I?
The bastards took away my book shop and my books.
I'm sor´ry, you can't come.
You haven't got the training.
- This mission will be ve´ry messy.
- l can fire a gun.
Sor´ry, Dennis.
- Where are you taking me, Marty?
.
- lt's you who have taken us, Jack.
into battle.
Airborne support in target area.
ETA, 35 seconds.
SAS team on the ground.
Enlarge camp 18.
Enlarge prima´ry target.
That is a kill.
Targets have been neutralised.
Airborne support approaching.
SAS team withdrawing.
We're passing out of visual.
It's over.
Come on, honey.
- Would your men like some coffee?
- No, thank you.
Thank you, Miss Ryan, for inviting us to your homecoming.
You're a gracious host, and it's my pleasure to make your acquaintance.
You're welcome.
I'll make the presentation after dinner.
Would you like to see it now?
.
- That's ve´ry nice.
- l already gave you one of those.
That's your second piece of cake.
- Where's the bathroom?
- Second door on the left.
- More coffee?
- l'd love some.
- Excuse me.
- Here it comes.
Bathroom.
- There's someone in there.
- No, that's the basement.
- Hello.
- Jack, it's Marty.
I thought you'd like to know right away.
- SAS just identified Cooley.
- What about the others?
Pretty messy. lt'll take 48 hours to verify the dental records.
They're keeping right on it.
The storm knocked the power.
I have to light some candles.
- l'll light one foryou, too.
- Thanks, Marty.
Forget to pay your bill, Cath?
- ls eve´ryone all right?
- Just fine.
This only happens when we have royalty over for dinner.
- ls something wrong?
- Come with me.
The storm would have knocked out the lights in the boathouse, too.
The power comes in from the street and branches off.
Jesus!
This is Ryan.
Any DSS agent?
Ma´ryland Troopers?
Anyone?
Anyone reading me?
Anybody?
- Can I come down later on?
- You've got to get some sleep.
Goddamn!
- Don't tell them.
- Quite a storm.
Take your hands off me!
What are you doing?
Gun.
Stay right there.
Rob, over here.
How many are coming?
Where's Sean Miller?
.
- What are you talking about?
- Give me the gun.
Five, six ... maybe more.
I'll get the others.
Don't turn on the lights.
- Go to the basement.
Where's Cathy?
.
- She's putting Sally to bed.
Come on, Ryan.
Show yourself.
Annette, upstairs.
- Come on, sweetie.
- What's wrong, Mommy?
.
Climb up on the stool.
Shine the light up there.
God, Jack, what did you do with the shells?
Go.
Get down.
Get back!
Are you all right?
Where's Sally?
.
It's okay, honey.
Come on.
You've got to be real quiet.
Got you!
Christ!
Hold on.
Come on.
- Who is off the air?
.
- DSS, State Troopers, everyone.
Get me Hostage Rescue, now!
Robby, open up.
- lt's us.
- Jack?
.
- They're outside.
- We want the Royal alive.
They're all over the place.
How were you going to get away?
.
Do I go for the other knee?
Boats at the bottom of the cliff.
There are ropes.
Kevin!
You've killed him!
No, Sean!
We need Holmes alive.
- We're past that.
- Alive!
Come on.
- Any contact?
- They're still off the air.
There he is!
Stay down.
Come on, you bastards.
Come on.
He's alone.
He's leading us away from the royal.
- Turn around.
- No.
Turn it round.
- Turn it round.
- Forget about Ryan.
- Don't blow the mission now.
- That's not my mission.
You crazy bastard!
- Do you want some toast?
- Pancakes.
There's no time for pancakes.
Toast or ... toast?
is somebody going to get that?
Hello?
Yes, she is.
Hold on a second.
- lt's Dr Zaillian.
- The amnio.
- ls it going to be okay?
.
- We're just waiting to find out.
- What do you want on your toast?
- Strawber´ry.
Do you want to know what it is?
He's asking.
I don't know.
Do you want to know?
.
- l don't know.
Do you?
- l'm not sure.
Hold on, we're discussing it.
I do and I don't.
He's waiting.
Okay, tell us.
Okay, tell us.
Thank you.

We can't come to the phone rightnow.
Please leave a message.
Hi, it's Jack.
We're going to leave London as planned.
We'll take a cab from the airport so don'tpick us up.
Eight!
One, two, three ...
You already own that.
You own everything.
We forgot about Sally's goldfish.
Feed them if they're still alive.
Mom can make my move.
If they're not, go to the store and find a couple the same size.
We'll see you soon.
Bye.
What's happening?
- Yes!
- No!
Another hotel?
- What does he owe you?
- You owe me £1 ,100.
I haven't got it. I'm out.
I want to go to sleep.
- Good evening, sir.
- Yes?
Will these do?
Yeah, bring them in.
My wife ...
I guess.
Candles, champagne ...
- l'm sor´ry l didn't think of this.
- lt's okay, only one of us had to.
is she asleep?
- What about your speech?
- l'll wing it.
Are you sure?
We have all watched in awe at the events taking place in Moscow.
And at the enormous changes resulting from these events.
In this volatile climate, we can only speculate on the future of Soviet Fleet development.
I would like to thank the Royal Navy for inviting me here today.
He's impressed, but he can't show it.
He's a professional soldier.
Come on, we've got to meet Daddy.
I'm impressed.
- Can you find it?
- Yeah, we're here.
When we get to this street, we turn left ... no, right.
Are you sure?
Okay, we're going to turn right.
Mind yourself, Paddyboy.
Move sure and fast.
- You've told me that.
- l'm telling you again.
This won't be like anything you've done before, little brother.
Targetleaving the palace now.
Stay awake, lads.
Here they come.
There's Daddy.
Go!
Get down!
Get down!
Get down.
Keep her down.
Get out of the car!
Get out!
Open the fucking door!
Open it or I'll blow you up.
Come on, let's go.
Go!
Go!
Paddy?
.
Stop!
Army!
Drop it!
What about the boy?
.
He's had it.
It's all right, sweetie.
Stay here.
- Stand back, ma'am.
- That's my husband. I'm a doctor.
Jesus!
What were you thinking of?
I'm going to set you down.
Stay with me, Jack.
You hear me?
Jack ...
Stay with me.
There's a feeling of outrage over this attack on the Royal Family.
No group has yet claimed credit, but one is under strong scrutiny.
The Ira.
According to eyewitness accounts, Lord William Holmes, the MinisterforNorthern Ireland, along with his wife and son, were saved by an American tourist, John Patrick Ryan.
An author andprofessor at the NavalAcademy in Maryland, -
- Ryan is a former Marine Lieutenant.
He was wounded and is underguard at an undisclosed London hospital.
Deborah Weston, CNN News, London.
- l'm sor´ry.
- lt's all right.
You're alive. I forgive you.
otherwise ...
Hey, pumpkin.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Can you dignify their cowardice with your silence?
They left you.
They drove off without you.
What is it you think you owe them?
If any of my mates left me in your hands, l'd feel no great sense of loyalty. I'd kill them.
Who are they, Sean?
Where are they?
.
The trip was unscheduled, but you knew Lord Holmes would be there.
I can't help you if you don't talk to me.
I'd tear your heart out if I didn't know you'd enjoy it.
You Fenian bastard.
No, not in all eternity.
He'll not chirp a word.
Not Sean Miller.
Not while his brother's lying on a slab.
- Don't you believe it, Jimmy?
.
- l don't believe the entire thing.
The Royal Family, that only turns people against us.
This was totally unauthorised.
The brigade know you were behind it.
Fuck the Ira!
All these years of war and they've got us nowhere.
England is still a monarchy, and that is where we must strike.
The Royals and the ruling class.
You're either with us or you're against us.
- Make up your mind.
- l'm with you.
Good, that's all I wanted to hear.
I'll leave you to it.
Kevin.
Charlie's going to drop by to straighten things out.
Be smart.
Talk to him and hold your temper.
I promise.
Thanks, Jimmy.
Kevin!
Kevin, it's Charlie.
That's me holding my temper.
- Damn!
I forgot.
- What?
Where's my bag?
You're not going to make me wear a rubber?
.
- The church says it's a sin, darling.
- So's this, darling.
What can you tell me about this guy?
.
He's a nice boy.
Sean Miller.
He shot a priest in Der´ry.
It was during confession.
He thought he was informing for the British.
It's not in Mr Ryan's best interests, nor the prosecution's, to discuss matters not directly at hand.
If you can confirm for me that you disarmed that man in the square, we'll be through.
- l can.
- Do you have anything to add?
Yes.
The man I killed was Miller's ... brother.
Patrick ... not even 1 7.
He was recruited by Sean into the Ira.
T´ry to preserve the clarity of your eventual testimony.
- l read it in a newspaper.
- Refrain from reading newspapers.
Not even Doonesbury?
.
Do you have anything to add?
No.
My name's Geoffrey Watkins.
Private secreta´ry to Lord Holmes.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
This is my wife, Catherine.
Dr Ryan, how is your patient?
Just fine, we're looking forward to going home, though.
- May I introduce his lordship?
- Hello.
It's my great honour to finally meet you.
I owe you a debt of gratitude that I shall never be able to repay.
I'm delighted you're here to share in the good news, Mrs Ryan.
Her Majesty has decided to invest your husband with a knighthood.
My congratulations ...
Sir.
Good luck today.
Sir Jack!
Lady Catherine!
If I'd had time to think, I'd have preferred to do something else.
You're saying you didn't have time, so you didn't?
- Didn't what?
- You didn't think. lsn't that it?
No, you raced into a situation of which you had no understanding and attacked my client, who was a pedestrian also hur´rying to help.
- Wearing a ski mask?
.
- You shot another man in the chest.
- After they shot me.
- And felled a second victim.
I used that force I deemed necessa´ry.
I should say so. I doubt ve´ry much if anyone would disagree.
I didn't make this happen ...
He did.
There is one more question.
Are you still in the paid service of the ClA?
Remember you're under oath.
- No.
- l beg your pardon?
No!
That's all, thank you.
The witness may stand down.
Thank you.
Bloody proud of yourself, aren't you?
You stuck your nose in, and now you've killed my baby brother.
Hey, Daddy.
Wow, you guys have really grown.
- How are you feeling?
- Not so good.
- Are you tired?
- No.
- l have no idea what time it is.
- You're telling me.
- Did I miss something?
- No ... but I did.
I'm pregnant.
Honey!
Can I watch some TV?
I'm not at all tired.
What?
Plates.
- Do I have any say in this?
- Sure, this is a family.
- Eve´ryone has a say.
- But my say is after the fact.
- Or am I wrong?
- No, you're right.
Michaela despises her little sister.
Well, it could be even worse.
It could be a baby brother.
Oh no!
Boys!
Jack.
Are you denying that the Ira was behind this action?
When the Ira carry out a campaign, they admit to it.
That's theirpolicy.
They'llproudlysay they did it.
Have the Ira admitted to this?
I mean, common sense, logic ...
Can I at least suggest some names?
Sure you can.
Good morning, Mr Cooley.
And to you.
How's business?
Fine, thank you. I came upon this first edition at an estate auction.
Can your man restore it?
- When would you want this by?
.
- Soon.
The binder may have some trouble with this.
is that so?
I'll see what I can do.
He's not a miracle worker.
No, obviously he's not, Mr Cooley.
The best you can arrange then.
- Good day, Mr Cooley.
- Good day, madam.
Hello, Sean, do you mind if I come along with you?
Although I disapprove of the things you've done, l can't quite bring myself to condemn you.
I can't, because I understand where the hatred comes from.
I more than understand it.
But the fact is, we're ve´ry near the darkest hole in all of Great Britain, and you still won't speak to me.
The bridge is up.
We'llbe here forfive minutes.
Understood.
Mobile three to Lymington ...
Open the door.
Open it or I'll kill him.
- They've got the bridge keeper.
- Open the door.
Should we wait until they kill him and then open the door?
.
- Your guns.
- We are unarmed.
Get them out.
Lie down.
Don't you fucking move.
Did you think we'd forget about you?
Inspector Robert Highland, this is a friend of mine.
Tell me, what do they pay you to turn against your own people?
Get on with it and be on your way.
Ve´ry well, if that's the way you feel about it.
Come on, Cath.
- Have I got the tickets?
- They're on the fridge!
- Dad ...
- Honey, there's plenty of time.
- Hello, Admiral.
- Jack, you know Marty Cantor.
- How's the shoulder?
.
- Not too bad.
Something's come up.
Can we sit down and have a chat?
They were moving him to Albany Prison on the Isle of Wight.
- We think he's left the count´ry.
- Let's deal in what we know.
We know he escaped in Kent, near the Channel.
If he's left the count´ry ...
Jack, are you listening?
The chances that he'd come here, or would t´ry to, are so remote I have trouble even saying it.
Yet your first instinct was to come out here and tell me.
Marty, excuse us a few minutes.
I've got a few more weeks before school starts, but I've got to prepare a few lectures.
Come and look at what we've got.
You might turn up something.
You're asking me if I want to come back.
Yep.
We'll t´ry and go next week.
Sor´ry.
Sean Miller escaped.
What does that mean?
They thought I might be concerned, but I'm not.
The Ira's not going to follow me over here.
We talked about that.
They're gone, that's it.
They didn't ask you to come back to cla?
- l said no.
- Just like that.
I don't want to go back.
- l saw them coming and I just ...
- l know.
I can't go back to that life again, you know?
.
I bet your cell was better than this.
At least you had your own toilet bowl.
Cheer up, you've just been spared a lifetime of hell on earth.
I don't feel like resting, laying in the sun like a complacent tourist.
We've got to train like soldiers and we can't do that in Ireland.
It's a waste of time.
There's a difference between laying about and laying low.
Next time we'll post Lord Holmes back to Whitehall in pieces, if that's what it takes to free eve´ry Irish political prisoner.
- That's not what I'm thinking of.
- l know that.
What Ryan did can't be undone.
Stop thinking about it.
I can't.
How could something like this have happened?
Inspector Highland picked the day and the route, and still they knew.
- He had two children.
- Tragic.
SO-13 have narrowed it down to 31 people who had this knowledge.
Five of whom are now dead.
You should limit your appointments.
I will not have my itinera´ry dictated to me by terrorists.
Whoever this traitor is, they'd better pray I never find him.
We know you'll do your best, sir.
We don't know ifwe're ever coming home stand up, buckle up, shuffle through the door jump out and shout Marine Corps!
Egesta appealed to Athens on what basis, on what grounds?
Mr Viederman?
A bad time for you?
They said they'd be grateful.
- Didn't they?
.
- Yeah.
"Fight our battle and the world will fear and respect you."
- Athens already had respect.
- lt didn't matter.
- Pride, sir.
- That's the real battle.
- Attention on deck.
- Attention to orders.
I have a presentation to make.
For service above and beyond the call of duty of a tourist, we recognise John Patrick Ryan with the order of the Purple Target.
We hope that he will duck next time, lest he become part of histo´ry rather than a teacher of it.
- How old is he?
- Ten.
Plate-glass window?
.
Here goes.
Hi, guys.
We may have to bump my next appointment.
This might take time.
Yes, let's bump it.
Okay, let's do it.
You just waded on in like John Wayne.
Why did you do it?
What were you thinking?
- l don't know. I wasn't thinking.
- You sound like my students.
It pissed me off.
I couldn't just stand there and watch them shoot those people.
It was ... rage.
Pure rage.
- lt just made me mad.
- l hope you never get mad at me.
She's late, Sean.
She was at this dance, and then this guy at the end ...
She's kind of cute, isn't she?
is she?
Bye.
- Hi, Mommy.
- How are you?
Let's do it.
Damn!
Highway 50.
West.
Goodbye, Doctor.
Dr Ryan!
He's getting away.
Where's Sean Miller?
.
Dr Catherine Ryan, please.
How long?
Come on!
This is Dr Ryan. I want the results on the Thompson boy's retinal scan.
Cathy, get off the phone.
- Look, Mom.
- lt's beautiful.
I'm still holding.
I'd like to speak with Dr Sutton.
Operator, emergency breakthrough.
The number is 555-3464.
It's a mobile phone, I know.
What do you mean I can't?
Faster!
- Dr Ryan, the scan is fine.
- Great, thank you.
Jesus!
Hello?
Jack?
.
Cath, something's happened.
is Sally with you?
- ls everything all right?
- Fine.
There she is.
Get to the nearest police station as quick as you can.
- The police station?
- Get offthe highway.
Steady, mate.
- Where are you now?
- Rowe Boulevard.
There's a police station at Houston Street.
- ls something wrong?
- No, everything's fine.
They're gone.
- Mr Ryan?
- Yeah.
Your wife's okay.
She sustained a concussion.
- She's pregnant.
- The baby's okay.
- And my daughter?
.
- Let's sit down.
No, talk to me.
It's going to be a while before we know.
- Where's Sally?
.
- She's in the recove´ry room.
They're watching her.
We'll know in a few hours.
They had to remove her spleen.
She's in pretty bad shape.
I'm sor´ry.
Here you go.
Are you okay?
.
We go over to our reporter with Paddy O'Neil.
I'm praying for the recovery ofthe victims ofthis senseless attack.
Sinn Féin are outraged, as are most Irishmen, at this heinous crime.
I want to share with Dr Ryan our empathy and anguish, at an appropriate time.
- Was funding for the Ira ...
- The Ira are notresponsible here.
- Theyhad nothing to do with it?
- No more questions.
- She's going to be okay.
- Thank you.
It's all right.
She's fine.
Mr Ryan?
I'd like to share with you our deep regret ...
Mr Ryan ...
You know the deal.
You are involved.
It's not good process.
The victim of a crime does not make the best analysis, even if you knew something about terrorism.
I have guys on it who know about the Ira.
I'm not standing here with my hat in my hand. I want back in.
Jack ...
Thank God about Sally.
Alice and I are so relieved.
- Have you managed any sleep?
- Not much, sir.
I'm interrupting something.
You were telling Jack that we'd be better off without him around.
Or something along those lines.
Marc Spiva.
Jack Ryan.
Tony Ferro.
Alex Winter.
- Rose ...
- You look better than I expected.
- lt's an illusion.
- lt'd have to be.
Good to see you.
We've carved a niche for you.
Here's your night-table reading.
"Father killed by RUC ...
Belfast, 1979."
Good morning, sir.
Could I see some identification?
- Did you see the game?
- Yeah, it was all right.
For that penalty, he was outside the area.
- What the hell ..?
- Nobody move!
Get 'em up!
Good morning.
Kevin O'Donnell.
A long-time Ira strategist.
He saw Timothy Miller die in 1979.
He looked after Sean and Patrick.
It's a recent photo.
If we could find O'Donnell, we'd find Miller, too.
- Are you with me, Jack?
.
- l'm just thinking.
- What about the gun?
- lt wasn't registered.
- Son of a bitch.
- What?
Look ...
SO-13 gets an anonymous tip about some bomb-making setup.
They get the bad guys, but who tipped them off?
Three Ira hitmen found dead at a farmhouse.
That's British soldiers getting out of hand.
No, look ...
Brigade Commander Jimmy O'Reardon.
Ends up dead in a cheap hotel.
A professional hit.
- Was that after the farmhouse?
- Same day.
- Same day.
- What are you coming to?
Jack!
Where are you going?
I'm going to throw some water on my face.
Excuse me ... I think one of us is in the wrong room.
It's okay.
- Jack!
- Get down.
When the Ira carry out a campaign, they admit to it.
Get down!
Who are we looking for here, Ira terrorists?
Or some ultra-violent faction of the Ira, fighting their own way.
O'Reardon checked into an hotel with a woman with long hair.
Long red hair.
This is who we're looking for.
We find her, we'll find him.
I saw his wife and daughter die, but she and Neddie blew it.
Ryan's still alive.
- They're not dead.
- What?
They survived it.
I can't say it any plainer.
- lt doesn't matter now.
- lt does matter.
Americans hold their breath eve´ry time a little girl falls down.
You shot at one with a machine gun on her way back from school.
We've started the war.
The Brits are tearing apart Belfast for the Ira.
Their American money, by denying the hits, makes them look more guilty.
The war is raging.
When it's over, we'll be the ones left standing.
I let you go for Paddyboy, but that's it!
We've got work to do ...
and it's not in Ma´ryland.
Hello.
- Yeah?
- How's the family, Ryan?
You nearly lost them, didn't you?
It's easy to get at them.
You should look afteryour familybetter.
Are you there?
I understand your little girl's feeling better.
Losing herspleen willmake it tough on her to fight offinfection.
You sick son of a bitch.
It was him, wasn't it?
He's never going to leave us alone.
He'll never get close to us again.
All he can do is call up.
You get him, Jack.
I don't care what you have to do.
Just get him!
Can I buy you a drink?
.
No ...
Let me buy you one.
Two whiskeys.
The Ira's not responsible for all this, I know that.
Are you waiting for me to agree?
It's what I've said all along.
You claim responsibility for one thing, deny it for another.
Nobody believes you anymore.
I want to know where Sean Miller and Kevin O'Donnell are.
Let me t´ry and understand this ...
You want me to sell out my fellow Irishmen to you?
- You don't understand me at all.
- l think I do.
I don't care what they've done!
The day I sell out my own people, I'll put a bullet through my head.
- That's it then.
- Yes, I'm not drinking with you.
Okay, I'll go home.
I'll call the Press and let them film in my daughter's hospital room.
It'll be on the evening news.
I don't care if it wasn't you, and neither will anyone else.
You'll have so little gun money, you'll all be out throwing rocks.
I will fucking destroy you!
I'll make it my mission in life.
Excuse me.
Well, lads, did you hear that?
- The satellite's coming.
- Let's go.
Come on!
Get inside!
SO-13 traced the guns used in the Lord Holmes incident to an arms dealer that supplies Gaddafi.
Sean Miller was last seen in a Zodiac heading out into the Channel.
I checked on the freighters that were out there that day.
Syrian regist´ry. involved in the Middle East arms trade.
- Miller sailed to North Africa.
- Exactly.
Our planes photograph 182 camps a day in North Africa.
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade, Action Direct, Red Army Faction ...
But on the day this ship docked in Benghazi, there's activity in only nine of these camps.
One is PLO, one Shining Path, these seven we're not so sure about.
- Why?
.
- Our satellites ...
The people in those camps probably know our satellite schedules.
Marty, unless you authorise us to retask those satellites, so we can get a look in, we're never going to know which camp they're at.
Do you know how big a deal it is to retask those satellites?
Yeah.
Bring up camp 18 again.
Tighten on the camp here.
Let's look up here.
See what we can see.
Show me this grouping here.
That's nothing.
Go back to the bigger picture.
Let me see down here.
What's that?
Tighten up on that.
Can you enhance that?
Tits.
The SAS could take out any one of these camps.
Kill eve´rybody there, and be gone before the echo fades.
Are you sure this is the same woman?
Keep at it then.
Son of a bitch.
Hi.
Read it again, Daddy.
"The sun did not shine, it was too wet to play."
"So we sat in the house all that cold, wet day."
"l sat there with Sally.
We sat there, we two."
"l wish we had something to do."
"Too wet to go out.
Too cold to playball. "
"So we satin the house and did nothing at all. "
"All we could do was to sit, sit, sit. "
"We did notlike it, not one little bit. "
"And then something went... bump. "
Paddy O'Neil can sleep at night.
He probably enjoys the irony.
She's not Irish, she's English.
This is the girl you saw in the jeep, in the blink of an eye?
- Yeah.
- What am I supposed to do?
Tell SO-13 you know who she is.
Give them her picture.
Ask them to look for her.
What do you mean, what do you do?
You walk into a bar, half of whose customers want you dead.
You walk up to the Ira's bagman and publicly threaten him.
You're not a field man.
You are an analyst.
Analyse that!
I am not after yourjob. I'm after the man who tried to kill my family.
Well then, think. lf you tell O'Neil that you're looking for a girl, and he gives you pictures of a girl.
Do you believe him?
I didn't tell him I was looking for a girl.
Sarge, come and look at this.
I'm a bit of a bookworm, not that you'd know it to look at me.
What's your passion then?
Mysteries?
Spy novels?
- This is a rare book shop.
- Rare?
Yes, so they are.
- Can you locate the problem?
- l already have.
The wiring in this place dates from before the war.
It's what we call in the electrical business ... rare.
- l can fix it, but can you afford it?
- Just fix it.
- He's seen it, hasn't he?
- l don't know.
- He's got it.
- What do you make of this?
I ...
I have no idea!
Damn!
I have to go out for a few minutes to deliver some books.
- Keep about your repairs.
- l'll be here all week.
He gave me the hat.
He said, "This is for you, my dear."
Damn!
Dinner at the White House is no problem.
- What is the problem?
- We're running out of dates.
We could move that to there ...
Which would leave us the 14th.
Check with John Ryan about a presentation at our embassy in Washington on the 14th.
Let's go over this again.
We start in Washington ...
- Geoffrey Watkins.
- l'm trying to reach Mr Titus.
- ls that extension 2691?
- No, this is 2619.
I'm terribly sor´ry.
- What are you doing up?
- l want to be there when she wakes.
I'll go with you and take a cab back.
Hello ...
Yes, just a minute.
- lt's for you, Sir John.
- Hello?
Mr Ryan is holding a celebration.
Would you care to join them?
- Where?
At his house?
- Yes, sir.
Why not?
We shot this eight days ago in Berlin.
One, two, three ...
Four Brits travelling with him.
Light arms.
- The heavy stuff is in the cars.
- He's German.
- ls this boring you, Sean?
- Six altogether.
- lt'll be the same in Washington.
- Holmes will always be protected.
Four days in Washington and one day in New York shopping.
Yeah, two Caucasians.
Take a look at the one with the hat.
- His arms look a little pink.
- Sunburn.
A new arrival.
What do you think, same guy?
.
The rare-book dealer, Dennis Cooley.
He's bald.
It's possible there's a woman in some of these camps.
But with her and Cooley in the same place if that is Cooley, the odds of coincidence are dropping fast.
But still, there's no way I can be absolutely certain.
Jack, tell me one thing in life that is absolutely certain.
My daughter's love.
What I need is your best guess, and I think I've heard it.
Haven't I?
The bastards took away my book shop and my books.
I'm sor´ry, you can't come.
You haven't got the training.
- This mission will be ve´ry messy.
- l can fire a gun.
Sor´ry, Dennis.
- Where are you taking me, Marty?
.
- lt's you who have taken us, Jack.
into battle.
Airborne support in target area.
ETA, 35 seconds.
SAS team on the ground.
Enlarge camp 18.
Enlarge prima´ry target.
That is a kill.
Targets have been neutralised.
Airborne support approaching.
SAS team withdrawing.
We're passing out of visual.
It's over.
Come on, honey.
- Would your men like some coffee?
- No, thank you.
Thank you, Miss Ryan, for inviting us to your homecoming.
You're a gracious host, and it's my pleasure to make your acquaintance.
You're welcome.
I'll make the presentation after dinner.
Would you like to see it now?
.
- That's ve´ry nice.
- l already gave you one of those.
That's your second piece of cake.
- Where's the bathroom?
- Second door on the left.
- More coffee?
- l'd love some.
- Excuse me.
- Here it comes.
Bathroom.
- There's someone in there.
- No, that's the basement.
- Hello.
- Jack, it's Marty.
I thought you'd like to know right away.
- SAS just identified Cooley.
- What about the others?
Pretty messy. lt'll take 48 hours to verify the dental records.
They're keeping right on it.
The storm knocked the power.
I have to light some candles.
- l'll light one foryou, too.
- Thanks, Marty.
Forget to pay your bill, Cath?
- ls eve´ryone all right?
- Just fine.
This only happens when we have royalty over for dinner.
- ls something wrong?
- Come with me.
The storm would have knocked out the lights in the boathouse, too.
The power comes in from the street and branches off.
Jesus!
This is Ryan.
Any DSS agent?
Ma´ryland Troopers?
Anyone?
Anyone reading me?
Anybody?
- Can I come down later on?
- You've got to get some sleep.
Goddamn!
- Don't tell them.
- Quite a storm.
Take your hands off me!
What are you doing?
Gun.
Stay right there.
Rob, over here.
How many are coming?
Where's Sean Miller?
.
- What are you talking about?
- Give me the gun.
Five, six ... maybe more.
I'll get the others.
Don't turn on the lights.
- Go to the basement.
Where's Cathy?
.
- She's putting Sally to bed.
Come on, Ryan.
Show yourself.
Annette, upstairs.
- Come on, sweetie.
- What's wrong, Mommy?
.
Climb up on the stool.
Shine the light up there.
God, Jack, what did you do with the shells?
Go.
Get down.
Get back!
Are you all right?
Where's Sally?
.
It's okay, honey.
Come on.
You've got to be real quiet.
Got you!
Christ!
Hold on.
Come on.
- Who is off the air?
.
- DSS, State Troopers, everyone.
Get me Hostage Rescue, now!
Robby, open up.
- lt's us.
- Jack?
.
- They're outside.
- We want the Royal alive.
They're all over the place.
How were you going to get away?
.
Do I go for the other knee?
Boats at the bottom of the cliff.
There are ropes.
Kevin!
You've killed him!
No, Sean!
We need Holmes alive.
- We're past that.
- Alive!
Come on.
- Any contact?
- They're still off the air.
There he is!
Stay down.
Come on, you bastards.
Come on.
He's alone.
He's leading us away from the royal.
- Turn around.
- No.
Turn it round.
- Turn it round.
- Forget about Ryan.
- Don't blow the mission now.
- That's not my mission.
You crazy bastard!
- Do you want some toast?
- Pancakes.
There's no time for pancakes.
Toast or ... toast?
is somebody going to get that?
Hello?
Yes, she is.
Hold on a second.
- lt's Dr Zaillian.
- The amnio.
- ls it going to be okay?
.
- We're just waiting to find out.
- What do you want on your toast?
- Strawber´ry.
Do you want to know what it is?
He's asking.
I don't know.
Do you want to know?
.
- l don't know.
Do you?
- l'm not sure.
Hold on, we're discussing it.
I do and I don't.
He's waiting.
Okay, tell us.
Okay, tell us.
Thank you.
English subtitles - lft
I never really understood the importance of the conductor.
Between you and me, what the hell is this guy doing?
Do you really need somebody waving a stick in your face to play the violin?
Does that really help you out?
I could see how we need him at the beginning, okay?
Tap, tap, tap.
"Start." Okay.
I could see how you need that.
But once we're going, okay.
Once it's all happening what do we need him for then?
I don't see the cellist looking up, "I'm confused.
I don't know what to do."
And the conductor goes, "Do this.
Like this..."
"Oh, okay, thank you.
Thank you very much."
Why try anymore?
There's no sense to it.
I'll never meet anybody.
I should accept it.
- Oh, yes, you will.
- No, I won't.
Yeah, maybe you won't.
It's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
- Are my nostrils getting bigger?
- No.
See, why must it be so difficult?
Why all this tension and hostility?
Why can't I just walk up to a woman and say, " Hi, I'm George.
How are you?" Is that so terrible?
H...
H...
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
- There's no men out there.
- I know.
The problem is that the good ones know they're good.
They know they're in demand.
They're not interested in confining themselves to one person.
I hate the good ones.
Is Jerry a good one?
That's a good question.
I think he thinks he is.
The mediocre ones are available but so insecure about not being a good one that they always go, "I'm not good enough for you.
What are you doing with me?" Eventually I just go, "You're right."
Maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing.
Somebody who just appreciates being with me because he's so desperate.
It's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone.
I almost made a date with one.
Oh, so there's still hope.
I don't want hope.
Hope is killing me.
My dream is to become hopeless.
The hopeless don't care.
When you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
- So hopelessness is the key.
- It's my only hope.
You see, I wouldn't really mind so much but I feel badly for my mother.
If my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad.
But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm 40, I'll have to kill her.
Because it's the only fair thing to do.
I just couldn't put her through that.
At least you're not bitter.
Who says I'm not bitter?
- Aren't you too young to be bitter?
- No, you can be young and bitter.
Just maybe not as bitter as I'll be 10 years from now.
But I'm bitter.
Anyway, don't tell anyone.
Don't worry.
Your bitterness is safe with me.
Okay.
Order me a piece of cake.
I'm gonna go throw up.
Look at my hands.
Look.
Filthy from the paper.
They should give you a Wet-Nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
- What did you do last night?
- Went out with George.
You?
Went out with Cynthia.
What did you talk about?
Oh, you know, the usual.
The Federal Reserve, the rain forest.
Cynthia felt we should nuke the rain forest.
Get rid of it in one fell swoop so we could eliminate it as a subject of conversation.
- What about you?
- We brushed on that.
Actually, George was in rare form.
He just can't find anybody.
I know.
Cynthia too.
- She's really given up.
- George too.
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, right.
- I've never fixed anybody up.
- Me neither.
And I am not about to start with George.
Well, why wouldn't you start with George?
You think she's too good for George?
I didn't say "too good," did I?
- You implied it.
- I didn't say it.
If you think she's too good for George you are dead wrong.
Dead wrong.
Who is she?
- Who is he?
- He's George.
- She's Cynthia.
- So what?
What, you don't think she's beautiful?
What's with the eyebrows?
You know what your problem is?
Your standards are too high.
I went out with you.
That's because my standards are too low.
And by the way, women kill for eyebrows like that.
Do you know that?
Women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head one by one until they're bald, Jerry, bald above the eyes.
And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
Well, let me tell you something about George.
He is fast.
He can run like the wind.
And he's strong.
I've seen him lift 100 pounds over his head without even knowing it.
You wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
- He can really do that?
- Come on, let's do it.
I think they'll really get along.
- What, are you into this?
- Yeah, come on, it's a good match.
Wait.
They'll be telling us how their dates went.
Are we gonna share that information?
Naturally.
We're going to tell each other everything?
Every secret?
Everything.
- What if it worked out?
- Yeah, right
Out of the question.
Out of the question.
- Why?
- No.
I'm not going to do that.
It's one step away from personal ads.
Then prostitutes.
No!
No!
I am not going down that road.
What does she look like?
- She's good-looking.
- How good-looking?
- Very good-looking.
- Really good-looking?
- Really very good-looking.
- Would you take her out?
- Yes, I would.
- You hesitated.
- What hesitate?
I didn't hesitate.
- Something's up.
You hesitated.
I'm telling you, she's good-looking.
- What about the body?
- Good body.
Nice body.
- How nice?
- Nice.
Pretty nice.
- Really good?
- Really very nice and good.
- What about personality?
- Good personality.
Funny.
Bright.
I don't want anyone smarter than me.
How could she be smarter than you?
All right, let's see.
Let's see.
What else?
What else?
What does she do?
First of all, what does he do?
He was in real estate.
He's not working right now.
Oh!
He's not working?
No.
No.
No.
How come he's not working?
Well, I mean, he got fired.
Why did he get fired?
Oh, right.
Well...
He tried to... poison his boss.
Excuse me?
It's such a long story.
Seriously, he just had some problems at work.
- Is he nuts?
- No, no, no.
He's a really, really funny guy.
What does he look like?
- Pardon?
- What does he look like?
Well, he's got a lot of character in his face.
He's short.
He's stocky.
He's fat.
Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?
Powerful.
He is so powerful.
He can lift 100 pounds right up over his head.
And, what else?
What else?
Oh, right, well...
He's, he's kind of...
Just kind of...
Losing his hair.
- He's bald?
- No.
No, no, no.
He's not bald.
He's balding.
- So he will be bald?
- Yeah.
- What kind of hair?
- You know, long, dark hair.
Flowing?
Flowing?
Is it flowing?
I like flowing, cascading hair.
Thick, lustrous hair is important to me.
"Thick, lustrous hair is important to me."
- Is that what you said?
- Right.
Just clarifying.
Let me ask you this.
If you stick your hand in the hair, is it easy to get it out?
Do you want to get it out?
Or do you want to not be able to get it out?
- I'd like to be able to get it out.
- I think you'll get it out.
What about the skin?
I need a good cheek.
I like a good cheek.
She's got a fine cheek.
Is there a pinkish hue?
- A pinkish hue?
- Yes, a rosy glow.
There's a hue.
She's got great eyebrows.
Women kill to have her eyebrows.
Who cares about eyebrows?
Is she sweet?
I like sweet.
But not too sweet.
You could throw up from that.
I don't think you'll throw up.
She likes to throw up.
- Has he ever been married?
- No.
Has he been close?
He once spent a weekend with a woman.
He didn't really try to poison his boss.
Yeah, he did.
We had an incredible phone conversation.
We talked for, like, 20 minutes.
I threw away my notes in the middle of the call.
I thought she had a great voice timbre.
Is it "timbre" or "tambre"?
- I think it's tambre.
- Why'd I think timbre?
She could do voice-overs.
You didn't tell me about her voice?
- I didn't notice the voice.
- It's mellifluous.
So, Saturday night.
She had to be impressed by that conversation.
It was a great performance.
I am unbelievable on the phone.
On the date, they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant.
- Hi.
- Hi!
- Out we go Saturday night.
- I know.
- So, what did she say?
- You're getting together Saturday night.
- That's it?
- Yeah.
- She didn't mention the conversation?
- No.
See?
I don't get that.
We had a relaxed, stimulating, great conversation.
She doesn't mention it?
- Why not mention it?
- What?
She could have mentioned it.
All right.
All right.
I'll go on the date, but that's that.
You know my friend Bob Sacamano?
- The guy from Jersey.
- He just got a job at a condom factory.
Look at this.
He gave me a gross.
- What will you do with all of them?
- Oh, well...
Take some, Jerry.
Grab them.
No, thanks.
They look like they came out of a cereal box.
Come on, Elaine, here.
Take half a bag.
Half a bag?
What am I, a hooker?
Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
I'll take one.
It's possible.
The problem with the condom is still buying them.
I think we should have, like, a secret signal with the druggist.
You walk into the store, go to the counter.
He looks at you.
And if you go like this:
He puts them in the bag for you.
That's it.
Show up there with your little shaving cream, your little toothpaste.
"How are you today?"
"Have a nice day." "You too."
So where are they?
It's 11:45.
They should be back by now.
- What did they do?
- I think they went out to dinner.
Oh, wait.
I got another call.
That must be him.
- Hello.
- It's me.
I just got home.
Hold on.
- It's George.
He just got home.
- Yeah.
I got Cynthia on the line.
- I'll call you back when I'm done.
- Remember our pact: full disclosure.
Of course.
Yeah, go ahead.
I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia.
We swore we wouldn't tell you and Elaine.
- You can tell.
I'll vault it.
- It's in the vault?
I'm locking the vault.
What?
Come on.
- We had sex.
- Oh, my God, you had sex?
- How did that happen?
- I don't know.
I closed my eyes and made a move.
- At your apartment?
- Yeah.
- She didn't stay over?
- No.
She left.
Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine.
Cynthia will kill me.
We made a deal.
Oh, my God.
He was uncomfortable because it was our first time.
So he felt he'd perform better if we did it in the kitchen.
- What?
- He says the kitchen is the most sociable room in the house.
And he was serious.
- So how was it?
- How good could it be?
My head was on a hot plate.
I got another call.
Must be Jerry.
- Oh, don't you tell him any of this.
- Yeah, okay.
- Hello?
- So, what did she say?
- What did he have to say?
- He said he had a good time.
- Her too.
- Oh, good.
- Anything else?
- No.
- You?
- No.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- You?
- Yeah.
All right, well...
I guess everything is under control.
Yeah.
Okay then.
Alrighty.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I left three messages.
I can't believe this woman.
We have sex, she leaves 10 minutes later, then I never hear from her again.
What kind of a person does this?
She used me.
I feel cheap and violated.
- I'm gonna do something about this.
- What are you gonna do?
Never mind.
Disgraceful.
Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap.
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.
Sir.
Whatever.
She's not gonna get away with this.
I keep racking my brain to try to figure out what I did.
I was smart.
I was funny.
I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners.
I'm a man of the people.
- I'm gonna call her.
- Don't call.
- No, I'm calling her.
- No, Jerry, I don't want you to.
- Get away from me.
- Give me the phone.
- You wanna fight me?
- Jerry, I'm gonna kill you.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, come on, Jerry, George.
Stop it.
I'll just call her when you leave.
It's none of your business!
- It is so my business.
- Give me that!
Stop it, boys!
I don't want another word from either of you.
- Tell him...
- Hey, hey, hey!
The next one of you that opens your mouth, you'll have to deal with me.
I bet I know what this is about.
It's about a woman, isn't it?
- Yeah, but...
- You see!
This is exactly what they want to do to you.
They play one against the other.
You can't let them manipulate you like that.
- But, Kramer...
- No, no, no!
I want you guys to shake hands.
Come on, there are plenty women out there for all of us.
Shake.
Yes!
You see?
Isn't that better than fighting?
Animosity?
You wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me.
By the way, those condoms I gave you?
They're defective.
Don't use them.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Defective?
- Defective.
How could you give me a defective condom?
I didn't even know they were defective.
- Didn't think you'd use them.
- What do you mean...?
!
Take it easy.
Just spread out!
Don't worry.
If anything was wrong, she'd have called you.
I missed my period.
Oh, my God!
I am very worried.
I am never late.
But he used a condom, right?
I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.
Oh, no.
What?
Was it blue?
Yeah.
How'd you know?
Just a hunch.
It says "twist-off." Twist off!
Twist!
Off!
Oh, hi.
Soda?
No, thanks.
So tell me.
What's the problem with your little flaky friend?
She doesn't return calls?
Who are you to talk about her like that?
She'll call him when she's good and ready.
- You don't even know her.
- Oh, I know her.
I know her type.
Her type?
What type?
The type that doesn't return calls.
I knew we shouldn't have done it.
It was a bad idea.
I told you.
You told me?
You pushed this whole thing on me.
It was your idea.
I was just helping your bitter, twisted friend.
She's not bitter.
Bitter's a judgment call.
She's twisted.
Twisted?
God, I did you a favour!
You said they had a good time.
What else are you keeping from me?
- Are you calling me a liar?
- I'm calling you one if you are.
- Are you?
- Get your finger out of my face.
- Get yours out.
- I don't care.
Get out!
Out!
Out!
Out!
Hey, hey, hey!
Come on, stop it!
Come on.
Break it up!
Hey, hey!
What's the matter with you?
Now, don't you two see that you're in love with each other?
I mean, why can't you face that already?
You're running around looking for something not even there when everything you dream of is right here in front of you.
Now why can't you admit that?
By the way, when you see George, give him these.
These'll work.
I knew those condoms were defective!
How did you know they were defective?
!
Because!
Because she missed her period!
She missed her period?
Oh, my God!
I can't believe it.
I'm a father!
I did it!
My boys can swim!
I can do it!
I can do it!
I'm a father!
So he shows up.
He's all out of breath.
He's dishevelled.
And tells me that whatever happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and I could depend on him and that he'd support me in whatever way I need.
Elaine, I was speechless.
Wow.
Wow.
You see?
You think you know somebody.
I said to him, " I really appreciate this, but I just got my period."
- Yeah.
- So I asked him to come in...
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
Sorry we're late.
We got so hung up in traffic.
I'm sorry.
- What happened?
- Acting.
- Very mature.
- Thank you.
- Hi, Cynthia.
- Hi.
This is a great place to sit you got here.
Best seat in the house.
Right next to the kitchen.
Oh, stop it.
Stop it.
- So, what are these?
- We ordered appetizers.
Start eating.
Oh, fabulous.
This is good.
Oh, this is good.
Is that salt on this?
Is there salt on this?
But have you ever fixed anybody up?
Why do we do it?
Why?
You thought they'd have a good time and a little power trip for you, isn't it?
Now you're playing God.
Of course, God was the first person to fix people up.
He fixed up Adam and Eve.
I'm sure he said to Adam, "No, she's nice.
She's...
Yes, she's very free about her body.
Doesn't really wear much.
She was going out with a snake.
I think that's over, though."

At the health club, people are working out and they're training, getting in shape but strangely, nobody's really getting in shape for anything.
The only reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the workout.
So we're working out so that we'll be in shape for when we have to do our exercise.
This is the whole thing.
The other thing I don't get is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and smelly jockstraps.
What exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes?
I'll give my car to any guy in front of a restaurant because he's got a short red jacket.
"He must be the valet guy."
But my stinking, putrefied gym clothes I got one of these locks you could put a bullet through it and it won't open.
That stuff is safe.
Wide open!
I was wide-open underneath.
I had three inches on that guy.
See, you two were hogging the ball.
Me?
It wasn't me.
I never even saw the ball.
All you do is dribble.
I have to dribble. lf I give it to you, you just shoot.
You're a chucker.
-Oh, I'm a chucker.
-That's right.
Every time you get the ball, you shoot.
I can't believe you called me a chucker.
No way I'm a chucker!
I do not chuck.
Never chuck!
Never have chucked!
Never will chuck!
No chuck!
You chuck.
-Kramer, am I a chucker?
-Oh, you're a chucker.
My God, I'm a chucker.
-All these years, you never told me?
-It's not an easy thing to bring up.
Hey, you know, this is the first time we ever saw each other naked?
Believe me, I didn't see anything.
Oh, you didn't sneak a peek?
-No.
Did you?
-Yeah, I snuck a peek.
-Why?
-Why not?
What about you, George?
Yeah, I snuck a peek.
But it was so fast, I didn't see anything.
It was just a blur.
I made a conscious effort not to look.
There's certain information I just don't wanna have.
Okay....
I gotta go meet Newman.
-I'll see you later.
Have a good one.
-All right.
Yeah.
Look at this guy.
Does he have to stretch in here?
-You know who that is?
-Who?
That's Keith Hernandez.
Keith Hernandez, the baseball player?
Yeah, that's him.
-Are you sure?
-Positive.
Wow!
Keith Hernandez!
-He's such a great player.
-Yeah.
He's a real smart guy too.
He's a Civil War buff.
Wow, I'd love to be a Civil War buff.
What do you have to do to become a buff?
So Biff wants to be a buff?
Well, sleeping less than 1 8 hours a day would be a start.
I only got two weeks left of unemployment.
I gotta prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension.
Hey, should we say something to him?
Oh, I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.
Well, he could say hello to me.
I wouldn't mind.
He's Keith Hernandez.
You're Jerry Seinfeld.
-So?
-What, you're comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez?
The guy's a baseball player, Jerry, baseball!
I know what he is.
I recognized him.
You didn't even notice him.
What, you're making some wisecracks in a nightclub?
The guy was in game six, two runs down, two outs, facing elimination!
Excuse me.
I don't want to disturb you.
I'm Keith Hernandez.
And I just want to tell you what a big fan I am.
I love your comedy.
-Really?
-I've always wanted to do what you do.
Do what I do?
!
You're one of my favorite ballplayers of all time!
Mine too.
-I love that bit about Jimmy Olsen.
-Really?
Thank you.
You know, Keith, what I've always wondered is with all these ball clubs flying around all season wouldn't you think there'd be a plane crash?
Are you performing in New York now?
At this club on the East Side.
You should come in.
But think about it:
26 teams, 1 62 games a season.
You'd think eventually, an entire team would just get wiped out.
I live on the East Side.
I'll give you my number and just tell me whenever you want to go.
-Or maybe just get together for coffee.
-Oh, that'd be great.
Well, it's only a matter of time.
Who's this chucker?
It's been three days, and he hasn't called.
Well, maybe you should call him.
I can't.
I can't.
-Why not?
-I just feel like he should call me.
What's the difference?
You don't understand, Elaine.
I don't want to be overanxious.
If he wants to see me, he has my number.
He should call.
God, look at this ashtray.
I hate cigarettes.
I can't stand these guys.
You give your number to them, and then they don't call.
Why do they do that?
I'm sorry, honey.
I mean, I really thought he liked me.
We were getting along.
He came over to me.
I didn't go over to him.
-I know.
-Why did he come over to me?
I mean, here I meet this great guy, this ballplayer...
-...best guy I ever met.
-Yeah.
I know.
Well, that's it.
I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
I've given my number out to guys, and it takes them a month to call.
Good.
Good.
Well, if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer.
You know, maybe he's been busy.
Maybe he's been out of town.
Oh, what, they don't have phones out of town?
I love how people say they're too busy. "Too busy."
Pick up a phone!
Takes two minutes.
How can you be too busy?
-Why don't you just go and call him?
-I can't call here.
It's a coffee shop.
-I mean, what am I gonna say to him?
-Just ask if he wants to get together.
For what, dinner?
Dinner's good.
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
Isn't that, like, a turnoff?
Jerry, he's a guy.
I know, but this is all very confusing.
When you're in your 30s, it's very hard to make a new friend.
Whatever the group is you've got now, that's who you're going with.
You're not interviewing, not looking at any new people.
You're not interested in seeing any applications.
They don't know the places.
They don't know the foods.
They don't know the activities.
If I meet a guy at a club or a gym:
"Hey, look, I'm sure you're very nice.
You seem to have a lot of potential.
We're just not hiring right now."
When you're a kid you can be friends with anybody.
Remember when you're a little kid what are the qualifications? "lf someone's in front of my house that's my friend.
They're my friend.
That's it.
Are you a grownup?
No?
Great.
Come on in!
Let's jump up and down on my bed!" And if you have anything in common:
"You like cherry soda?
I like cherry soda!
We'll be best friends!"
You only have two more weeks before your benefits run out.
Yes, and I was hoping, perhaps, to get a 1 3-week extension, if that's possible.
So where have you been looking for work?
You know what I've discovered, Mrs. Sokol?
It's not so much the looking as the listening.
I listen for work.
As I'm looking and listening-
- I'm also looking.
You cannot discount looking.
It's a combination.
It's looking.
And listening.
Listening.
And looking.
But you must look.
Can you be specific about any of these companies?
Specific.
Let's see....
I've walked in and out of so many buildings.
They all blend in together.
Just give me one name.
One name.
Absolutely.
Let's see, there's....
Vandalay Industries.
I just saw them.
I got very close there.
Very close.
What type of company is that?
Latex.
Latex manufacturing, Mrs. Sokol.
-And you interviewed there?
-Yes, for a sales position.
Latex salesman.
The selling of latex and latex-related products.
They just wouldn't give me a chance.
Damn it!
Now I'm going to need an address and a phone number for this Vandalay company.
You like gum?
Because I have a friend in the gum business.
I got a gum guy!
I make one phone call, have boxes of gum delivered right to your door.
The address?
The address is....
Jose Jimenez.
Do you recognize that?
-No.
-Jose Jimenez.
Very funny.
Really, he's very funny.
The address.
Vandalay is 1 29 West 81 st Street.
It's a very small industry, Vandalay.
It's why I wanted to work for them.
A phone number.
That's...
KL5 8383.
Are you planning on calling them soon?
Because they have very strange hours.
As soon as I'm done with you.
Sure.
Well....
You know, I'll check in with you next week.
I gotta run now because I got a full plate this afternoon.
-Okay.
-All right.
Really good to....
He'll call you back!
It's a par five.
So, you know, I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway.
-I mean, you know my hook, right?
-Elaine?
How about this shirt?
Is this okay?
Jerry, he's a guy.
Well, it's a dogleg left, so I play the hook.
Wait, hold on.
There's another call.
-Jerry!
Jerry!
-George?
-Kramer, put Jerry on!
-I'm in the middle of something.
-Call back.
-Kramer, no--!
So the ball takes off, and I'm waiting for it to turn.
Would you--!
All right.
Well, I'll talk to Jerry.
Yeah.
Hey, that was Michael and Carol.
She's wondering when we'll go see the baby.
-See the baby.
Again with the baby.
-Who are they?
A guy who used to live in the building keeps calling us to see the baby.
"You gotta see the baby.
When are you gonna see the baby?"
Can't they just send us a tape?
Maybe if you wait a few months, it won't be a baby anymore.
-Then you won't have to see it.
-Because he'll be all grown-up.
Yeah....
Hey, Kramer, what do you think of this shirt?
It's too busy.
You're trying too hard to make an impression on him.
-You're not being yourself.
-What guy?
I know he's just a guy, but I really like him.
Who are you talking about?
Keith...
Hernandez.
Keith Hernandez?
Keith Hernandez!
Do me a favor, would you?
Would you change lanes?
You gotta get out of this lane.
This lane stinks.
They're all double-parked.
Get out, I'm begging you.
Please.
Please!
You know what?
Bad mistake.
My mistake.
Go back.
Your lane was better.
Forget this lane.
This lane stinks.
Go back to your lane.
Go ahead.
Bad mistake.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Make this light!
Make this light!
Oh, man!
That's it!
Get out!
-What do you mean, get out?
-Get out of the cab!
What?
I'm not getting out of this cab.
No!
No!
You cannot throw me out!
No!
Get....
Hello, Newman.
I hate Keith Hernandez.
-Hate him!
-I despise him.
-Why?
-Why?
I'll tell you why.
-Let me tell her.
-No, you can't--
-You always tell.
-All right, tell it.
-Just tell it.
-All right.
June 14th, 1987, Mets-Phillies.
We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right-field stands when a crucial Hernandez error opens the door to a five-run Phillies ninth.
Cost the Mets the game!
Our day was ruined.
There was a lot of people waiting by the players' parking lot.
Now we're coming down the ramp.
Newman was in front of me.
Hernandez was coming toward us.
As he passes us, Newman turns and says, "Nice game, pretty boy."
Hernandez continued past us up the ramp.
Then, a second later, something happened that changed us in a very deep and profound way from that day forward.
-What was it?
-He spit on us!
And I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
Then I turned, and the spit ricocheted off him, and it hit me.
What a story.
Unfortunately, the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account.
Allow me to reconstruct this, if I may, for Ms. Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me.
According to your story Hernandez passes you and starts walking up the ramp.
Then you say you were struck on the right temple.
The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple, striking Newman between the third and the fourth rib.
The spit then came off the rib made a right turn, hitting Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap.
The spit then splashed off the wrist, pauses in midair, mind you makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh.
That is one magic loogie.
Well, that's the way it happened.
What happened to your head when you got hit?
Well, my head went back, to the left.
-Say that again.
-Back and to the left.
Back and to the left.
Back and to the left.
So, what are you saying?
I'm saying that the spit could not have come from behind.
That there had to have been a second spitter.
Behind the bushes, on the gravelly road.
If the spitter was behind you, as you claim that would've caused your head to pitch forward.
So the spit could've only come from the front and to the right.
But that's not what they would have you believe.
I'm leaving.
Jerry's a nut.
Wait, wait, wait.
The sad thing is, we may never know the real truth.
Did anybody call asking for Vandalay Industries?
-No, what happened to you?
-All right, listen closely:
I was at the unemployment office.
I told them I was very close to getting a job with Vandalay Industries and I gave them your phone number.
So when the phone rings you have to answer, "Vandalay Industries."
-I'm Vandalay Industries?
-Right.
-What is that?
-You're in latex.
-Latex?
-Right.
-What do I do with latex?
-I don't know!
You manufacture it!
-Right here in this little apartment?
-And what do I say about you?
You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
-I'll hire you as my latex salesman?
-Right.
I don't think so.
Why would I do that?
Because I asked you to.
If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit pushing papers around, you can forget it.
I've got enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
-Yeah?
-It's Keith.
All right, we're coming down.
Keith Hernandez?
-Yeah.
Come on, Elaine, let's go.
-Where are you going?
They're giving me a ride downtown.
You know, there had to have been a second spitter.
Who was it?
Who had the motive?
That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
What the hell are you two talking about?
-That was really fun.
Thanks.
-Yeah, it really was.
Should I shake his hand?
Well....
You want to catch a movie this weekend?
Have you seen JFK?
No, I haven't.
This weekend.
Wow!
Sure.
That would be great.
Damn.
I was too overanxious.
He must have noticed that.
I mean, if you want to.
-Well, how about this Friday?
-Yeah, Friday's okay.
Go ahead, shake his hand.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
I've been on The Tonight Show.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Oh, Jer, by the way the woman we gave a ride to earlier....
-Elaine.
-Yeah.
-What's her story?
-I don't know.
We used to go out.
Would you mind if I gave her a call?
-For a date?
-Yeah.
Oh, no....
Go ahead.
You got a pen?
You sure you don't mind?
So then we went to dinner.
-Who paid?
-We split it.
Split it.
Pretty good.
-Did you talk about game six?
-No.
I gotta wait until it's the right time.
-Yeah?
-It's Elaine.
Come on up.
So then what?
Nothing.
Then he took me home.
Shake his hand?
Yeah.
What kind of a shake does he have?
Good shake.
Perfect shake.
Single pump, not too hard.
Didn't have to prove anything, but firm enough to know he was there.
So you're gonna see him again?
He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.
The weekend!
So then, as I was getting out of the car--
-Hi!
-Oh, hi, Elaine.
Hi, Elaine.
So how was your date?
What date?
It's a guy.
So you know....
He called me.
-Already?
-Keith called you?
This guy really gets around.
-Do you mind?
-No, I don't mind.
Why should I mind?
What did he say?
He asked me out for Saturday night.
-You going?
-No.
-I told him I was busy.
-Oh, really?
So we're going out Friday.
-Friday?
-Yeah.
He's going out with you on Friday?
-Yeah?
-He's supposed to see me on Friday.
-I didn't know.
-We made plans!
-Well-- I'll cancel it.
-No, don't cancel it.
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
Well, frankly, it is.
I've never seen you jealous before.
Well, you're not even a fan.
I was at game six.
You didn't even watch it.
Wait a second.
Wait a minute.
Are you jealous of him or are you jealous of me?
Any Hennigan's around here?
Vandalay Industries.
Kell Varnsen speaking.
May we help you?
Oh, hi, Keith.
No, I was just joking around.
No, no, I don't mind at all.
-No, no, no.
I can cancel.
-Sure.
We'll do something next week.
No, it's no problem at all.
Okay.
Take it easy.
That was Keith.
We're gonna do something next week.
Hey, what are you doing Friday night?
Friday night?
Nothing.
Now.
Want to come to see the baby?
Oh, fasten your seat belts.
We're going to see the baby.
If you don't see the baby now, you're never gonna see her.
-All right, I'll go.
-All right.
All right.
I'll get it.
Yello.
What delay industries?
-No!
-Vandalay!
Say Vandalay!
No, you're way, way, way off!
Yeah, that's the right number, but this is an apartment.
-No, say--
-Vandalay!
Say--
Vandalay Industries!
Yeah, no problem, no problem.
How did you know who they wanted?
!
And you want to be my latex salesman.
Just sign here, please.
I know who it was too.
It was the guy that interviewed me.
He was very threatened by me.
Why else wouldn't he hire me?
-I could sell latex like that.
-Just sign that.
-Who is this?
-It's my daughter.
This is your daughter?
My God!
My God!
I hope you don't mind my saying, she is breathtaking.
You think so?
Would you take this picture away from me?
Just take it away.
Get it out of here.
Take it away, and put it away.
Let me just sign this and go.
You know she doesn't even have a boyfriend.
Okay.
Okay.
Who do you think you're talking to?
You trying to make a joke, Mrs. Sokol?
It's not funny.
I can tell you that.
I'm serious.
She doesn't.
You know, it's one thing to not give me the extension.
But to tease and to torture me like this there's no call for that.
Would you like her phone number?
Mrs. Sokol, I don't know what to say.
-Where should I sign this thing?
-No, no, no, no.
Don't worry about it.
Unemployment, it's a tough thing.
Even if you get a job after you've been unemployed they take unemployment out of your check every week and show it to you in that little box.
How good can it be for your confidence that every paycheck has the word "unemployment" on it?
Can't get it out of your mind!
You just got the job!
They're already getting ready for you to be laid off.
I have a friend who's unemployed.
He's collecting unemployment insurance.
This guy has never worked this hard in his life to keep this thing going.
He's down there every week waiting on the lines and getting interviewed and making up all these lies about looking for jobs.
If they had any idea the effort and energy that he is expending to avoid work, I'm sure they'd give him a raise.
I'm sure of it.
The guy is doing a tremendous job not working.
So tell me more about this game six.
Well, there was two outs, bottom of the tenth.
We're one out away from losing the series.
Hello.
How are you?
So, what do you think?
Do you love her?
Yes, I do love her.
You have a very nice place here.
So who do you think she looks like?
Lyndon Johnson.
What?
Lyndon Johnson?
He's joking.
No, I'm not joking.
She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
Jerry, I can't believe it took you so long to see the baby.
I kept saying to Michael, "When is Jerry going to see the baby?"
I was saying the same thing.
Take a picture.
Michael, get the camera.
-You don't have to take a picture.
-I don't know where it is.
It's in the bottom drawer of our dresser.
Hurry up!
He's such an idiot.
Jerry, you want to pick her up?
-I better not.
-I'll pick her up.
No!
Thank you for a wonderful time, George.
Glad you enjoyed it.
I haven't had a Big Mac in a long time.
Billions and billions.
Would you like to come up?
Would I like to come up?
I would love to come up.
I'm...
I'm fighting not to.
Fighting.
Unfortunately, I I have to get an early start tomorrow.
Gotta get up and hit that pavement.
But it's Saturday.
All the offices are closed.
I got me an appointment with a hardware store.
I'm not saying I want to do it for the rest of my life but hardware fascinates me.
Wouldn't you love to make a key?
Will you call me as soon as you get home?
-Tonight?
-Yes.
Will I call you when I get home?
What do you think?
You kill me.
You really kill me.
Well, good night.
It was an accident.
Right, Jerry?
It was an accident.
Oh, she's gonna be all right.
Here, baby.
Here.
Here, baby.
Baby, baby, baby.
Who's the baby?
I have a friend who's got a baby.
"Gotta see the baby.
You've got to come over and see the baby."
Nobody ever wants you to come over and see their grandfather, do they?
"You've got to see my grandfather.
You've got to see him.
He's so cute.
1 68 pounds, 4 ounces.
I love them when they're this age.
He's 1 000 months.
You know, the mid 80s is such a good time for the grand-people.
The mid 80s, you gotta see them.
He went to the bathroom by himself today."
You know what's tough about seeing people when they have a baby is that you have to match their level of enthusiasm.
You know what I mean?
They're always so excited.
"What do you think of him?"
I'd like to meet a couple that goes:
"You know, we're not that happy with him, frankly.
I think we really made a big mistake.
We should have got an aquarium.
You want him?
We don't even want him.
You want him?"
Thanks for a nice evening.
This was really fun.
Yeah, it was.
Gosh, should I kiss her good night?
Is he going to try and kiss me?
-I love Cajun cooking.
-Really?
You know, my mom's one-quarter Cajun.
Oh, my father's half-drunk.
Maybe they should get together.
Go ahead.
Kiss her.
I'm a baseball player, damn it.
What's he waiting for?
I thought he was a cool guy.
Come on.
I won the MVP in '7 9.
I can do whatever I want to.
Well, this is getting awkward.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Who does this guy think he is?
I'm Keith Hernandez.
Who else?
Mookie.
Mookie was there.
You know him?
Well, I don't know him.
I know who he is.
He's such a great guy.
You should meet him.
-He's the one who got that hit--
-I know.
He got the hit in game six!
So then what happened?
Nothing.
The he took me home.
So did you two have....
What?
You know.
Milk?
-No.
-Cookies?
Did he kiss you good night?
I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
All right.
He kissed me, okay?
Well, what kind of a kiss?
Was it a peck?
Was it a kiss?
Was it a long make-out thing?
Between a peck and a make-out.
So you like him.
I don't understand.
Before you were jealous of me.
Now you're jealous of him?
I'm jealous of everybody.
Hello.
Oh, hi.
What's happening?
What?
Sure.
Yeah, okay.
Then....
I'll see you then.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Bye.
-Who was that?
-That was Keith.
-What's going on?
-He wants me to help him move.
Help him move?
Move what?
You know, furniture.
So, what did you say?
I said, yes, but I don't feel right about it.
I mean, I hardly know the guy.
That's a big step in a male relationship.
The biggest.
That's like going all the way.
And you feel you're not really ready for--
Well, we went out one time.
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
Hey.
What's going on?
Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
What?
Well, you hardly know the guy.
What a nerve!
You see?
Wasn't I right about this guy?
Didn't I tell you?
Oh, you're not gonna do it, are you?
-I said, yes.
-You said yes?
!
Don't you have any pride or self-respect?
I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this?
Are you gonna start driving him to the airport?
I'm not driving him to the airport.
Oh, boy.
I don't know.
-Kramer, do me a favor, would you?
-What?
Don't mention it to anybody.
I wish you never mentioned it to me.
I had a great time tonight, Carrie.
And I will call you as soon as I get home.
Don't bother.
Bother?
What kind of bother?
I would prefer it if you didn't.
-Why?
Is anything wrong?
-It's over, buddy.
Done.
Finished.
So long.
Goodbye.
Adios.
Sayonara.
-Why?
-I've been thinking about it.
You got no job.
You got no prospects.
You're like Biff Loman.
I went to the hardware store interview.
You think I'm going to spend my life with somebody because he can get me a deal on a box of nails?
I thought we were a team.
If I ever need a drill bit, I'll call you.
Carrie, could you do me a favor?
Could you not mention this to your mother?
You know, I hate to brag but I did win 11 straight Gold Gloves.
I wouldn't have brought it up, but since you mentioned it.
I didn't mention it.
Well, I won them anyway.
Well, so what?
I mean you played first base.
I mean, they always put the worst player at first base.
That's where they put me, and I stunk.
Elaine, you don't know the first thing about first base.
Well, I know something about getting to first base and I know you'll never be there.
The way I figure it, I've already been there.
And I plan on rounding second tonight at around 11:00.
Well, I'd watch the third-base coach if I were you because I don't think he's waving you in.
You know, I hate to say this but I really think that we're hitting it off.
-Get it?
Get it?
-Clever.
-What are you doing?
-What's that?
-You smoke?
-Yeah.
I didn't know you smoked.
Is that a problem?
She likes him.
I mean, she really likes him.
-How do you know?
-Who wouldn't like him?
I like him, and I'm a guy.
I suppose he's an attractive man.
Forget that.
He's a ballplayer.
MVP, 1 9 79.
I'm making wisecracks in some nightclub.
This guy was in game six.
They're a perfect match.
They go together.
Like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
I hate those couples.
I could never be one of those couples.
There are no bald women around, you know.
I know this sounds a little arrogant, but I never thought she'd find someone she liked better than me.
But, you know I guess I had my chance.
And that's that.
You know what I'd like to do?
I'd really like to have sex with a tall woman.
I mean really tall, like a giant.
Like 6'5".
Really?
What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?
I don't know, 6'3".
Wow!
God!
See, this is all I think about:
Sleeping with a giant.
It's my life's ambition.
So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these type of people.
Magellan?
You like Magellan?
Oh, yeah.
My favorite explorer.
Around the world.
Come on.
-Who do you like?
-I like de Soto.
-De Soto?
What did he do?
-Discovered the Mississippi.
Oh, like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
All right.
I gotta go down to the unemployment office.
-You want to take a walk?
-No, I got some stuff to do.
I gotta meet Keith at my apartment at 3.
I'm helping him move.
What?
The guy asked you to help him move?
Wow!
-I know.
Isn't that something?
-Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
He's got some valuable antiques.
He's worried they'll break something.
Soon he'll have you driving him to the airport.
I'm not driving him to the airport!
I gave.
I gave everything I could, Mrs. Sokol.
-Nothing was good enough for her.
-Sign here, please.
I don't know who she's looking for.
I don't know.
I'll tell you, she's very particular, your daughter.
Very particular.
Is she looking for some big hotshot businessman?
Well, I've got my pride too.
I'm not gonna beg her.
All right.
Just sign it.
People are waiting.
You like baseball?
That was autographed by the '86 Mets.
I saw every inning that year.
It's funny, because I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.
You know Keith Hernandez.
Know him?
Would you...
like to meet him?
Oh, come on.
Come on.
I can produce Keith Hernandez, right here within the hour.
All right.
You got one hour.
All right, Mrs. S.
I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.
1 29 West 81 st Street, and hurry.
Or not.
You better bring your gloves.
It's freezing out there.
It shouldn't take too long.
I'd say maybe, oh, four hours.
Really, Jerry, there's not that much.
First, we got the bedroom.
We got two dressers and the bed.
-Is there a box spring?
-What's that?
-A box spring?
-Yeah, there's a box spring.
But it's attached to the headboard, and we'll have to take that apart.
Then we got the couch.
-Is that a sectional?
-Yeah, 1 2 pieces.
-A marble coffee table.
-Is that a thick marble?
Three inches thick.
Got it in Italy.
But the big problem is gonna be the convertible sofa.
When you move it, it tends to open up so it's going to be difficult getting it downstairs.
Stairs?
-There's no elevator?
-No, it's a brownstone.
Three floors.
-I'm sorry, I can't do this.
-What?
I can't do it!
I can't!
It's too soon.
I don't know you.
I can't help you move, I'm sorry.
I can't!
I just can't.
-Hello.
-Hello.
Oh, you don't remember me.
-No.
Should I?
-Yeah, yeah, you should because I certainly remember you.
Let me refresh your memory.
June 1 4th, 1 98 7.
Mets-Phillies.
You made a big error.
Cost the Mets the game.
Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
You said, "Nice game, pretty boy."
-You remember.
-And then you spit on us.
-Hey, I didn't spit at you.
-Yeah, right.
-No, no.
Then who was it?
-Look, the way I remember it I was walking up the ramp.
I was upset about the game.
That's when you called me "pretty boy. "
Hey, that ticked me off.
I was turning to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravelly road.
Anyway, he was talking to someone, and they were pointing at you.
I tried to scream out, but it was too late.
It was already on its way.
I told you.
-It was McDowell.
-But why?
Why McDowell?
Maybe because we were sitting in the right-field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
-It was McDowell.
-Oh, boy.
-Look, Keith, we're sorry.
-Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier.
Guys, don't worry about it.
-Well, I guess I better get going.
-What are you doing?
-I gotta move.
-You want any help?
-I'd love some.
You sure?
-I'd love to help you.
Yeah, me too!
Okay, guys.
We got to be careful of one thing.
Some of the stuff is very fragile We'll have to handle it like a baby.
Hey, no sweat.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
What's going on?
No, he just left.
You broke up with him?
Me too!
What happened?
Oh, smoking.
You know, you're like going out with C. Everett Koop.
Me?
No.
I couldn't go through with it.
I just didn't feel ready.
So, what are you doing now?
Oh, great idea.
Okay.
I'll meet you there in, like, 30 minutes.
Okay, bye.
Keith!
Keith!
-What happened?
Where's Keith?
-You just missed him.
He just left.
What do you need him for?
Keith!
Keith!
Up here!
Look, could you do me a favor?
I need you to go to the unemployment office with me!
l-
- I'm Jerry's friend!
The guy from the locker room!
I'm the chucker!
It'll take five minutes!
Wait!
Wait!
Well, Biff what's next?
I don't know.
Excuse me.
I was walking behind you, and you dropped your wallet.
When you're moving, your whole world becomes boxes.
That's all you think about, is boxes.
Where are there boxes?
You just wander down the street, going in and out of stores.
"Are there boxes here?
Have you seen any boxes?"
I mean, you can't even talk to people because you can't concentrate.
"Shut up!
I'm looking for boxes!"
So after a while, you become really into it.
You can smell them.
You walk into a store:
"There's boxes here.
Don't tell me you don't have boxes.
Damn it!
I can smell them!"
You become, like, obsessed.
''I love the smell of cardboard in the morning."
At a funeral, everyone's crying around.
You're looking at the casket:
"That's a nice box.
Does anybody know where that guy got that box?
When he's done with it, you think I could get that?
It's got some nice handles on it."
And that's what death is, really.
It's the last big move of your life.
The hearse is like the van.
The pallbearers are close friends.
The only ones you could really ask to help you with a big move like that.
And the casket is that great, perfect box you've been looking for your whole life.
The only problem is once you find it, you're in it.
[Shriek]
Aah ha ha ha ha ha!
It was another one of those hot L.A. days.
Things were about to get interesting.
When she walked in.
Her name was Samantha and she was beautiful.
A regular corpus delicti.
With a great kiss.
Cavity that is.
Something in her socket said beware.
Must've been the way they said hello to me.
So, sweetheart, you say your husband's been cheating on you with another ghoul?
That it?
Well, I'll be glad to hear your story, but first I've got a tawdry tale of my own to tell.
It's about a couple of scam artists who want to make a killing, provided they don't kill each other first.
I call itseance.
I call itseance.
I am eternal flame.
In fire, all things begin, and all things return.
But...
I am not death, as the uninitiated would have me.
I am point of transition.
I am breath that transforms.
I am life.
In this flame, let me witness thine image, Prescott chalmers, my departed servant.
In the expression of the sacred taoist square do I invoke your image.
[Chanting]
What do you wish to tell us this night?
Do you wish to tell us something, o spirit?
Jesus Christ in a cardigan sweater.
Benny, one lousy line!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"Give the money to my friends, Dorothy."
The line's not the problem.
The deac's the problem.
My nightmare is dying old and broke.
I got a name for it-- monkey island.
That's where loser cons go at the end, dead-eyed and desperate.
There ain't no life on monkey island.
There's nobody there to deac.
That's why you hate it.
This isn't Pittsburgh.
Remember Pittsburgh?
The first time you went soft.
The first time you choked.
Somebody got dead in Pittsburgh.
Listen to me.
You want out of this life?
Here it is.
After this score, you go your way, I'll go mine.
We'll walk away rich.
What we're doing, we don't deserve to walk away.
Madame leona, are you here?
You got spiders in your veins.
You're tangling up my web, sweetheart.
Will you quit pushing?
Can you see all right?
Yeah, yeah.
Madame?
Yes.
I am here.
I'll be right with you.
[Thud]
Benny you're going to blow the whole deal.
Sorry.
I slipped.
How do I look?
You look beautiful.
Come in, Mrs. chalmers.
Come in.
Madame leona, this is my new valet Gibson.
Pleasure to meet you.
You sound hoarse.
Are you sick?
Just a cold, my dear.
Please, sit down, and we'll get started.
You may put the briefcase on the table, please.
[Benny] Gee, that poor woman.
How did I ever get into this mess?
How do I look?
Come on, Benny.
Tell me you don't miss it with me and you just a little.
You want to know what I miss?
I miss the shower after.
[Knock on door]
Come in.
Mr. chalmers, how nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming.
Mr. polosky, I'm sorry I'm late.
But your elevator is broken.
Oh, perhaps I should have warned you, I'm sorry.
Mr. chalmers, this is miss Alison Peters, whom I told you about.
Mr. polosky told me there would be a young lady here.
He never told me she was beautiful.
Because he's an honest lawyer.
Mr. polosky's been negligent on both our behalfs.
He should've told me how handsome my cousin is.
Please.
Frankly, I'm a little confused about my relation to miss-- miss Peters here.
Of course.
As I explained over the phone,
I'm executor of the estate of your Uncle Albert Peters.
The only man I know by that name is my mother's brother, who died...
When she was a child.
Some sort of train accident, I believe.
I love trains.
Cigarette?
No, thank you.
Mr. chalmers, your Uncle didn't die in a train accident.
He was found guilty of masterminding the Wilmington bank robbery of 1901.
The Wilmington bank robbery?
$200,000.
In his day the largest payroll highest in state history.
He got 20 years.
Well, daddy was daddy.
I imagine your mother believed it best you thought him dead.
That happens in families.
Well, after serving his time, your Uncle began a new life in Chicago.
He started a business, married, and raised a family.
Now, last year, your Uncle, Alison's-- miss Peters'--father died.
Now, along with his public will,
I found a second document-- details of another investment account.
It was opened under an assumed name to be passed on to any or all of Albert Peters' heirs.
This is the account's net worth as of last month.
A little under $3 million.
My God.
Indeed.
However, there's a problem.
As you'll see on the first sheet, the account was opened before Peters went to prison.
The opening balance was $200,000.
Cash.
Oh.
The Wilmington bank money?
I'm sure that's how the D.A. will see it.
But as far as I can tell, as long as we can keep the authorities out of this, you could probably claim the money without trouble.
All you'd need would be the account number.
Which you have.
And what do you want, Mr. polosky?
Nothing.
The probate gives me 10% from the sale of the investments.
I don't want any more than that.
Albert was a friend.
Mr. polosky, would you mind if we have a word?
Of course not.
I'll be outside.
[Door opens and closes]
That was an interesting story, but I don't believe a word of it.
You and me both, cousin.
Although it does explain a few things about daddy.
Oh?
Such as?
Well, he claimed to be this big world war I hero.
The only mustard gas he saw was at a hot dog stand at wrigley field.
I was a world war I hero.
You have the cane to prove it.
I want to do some checking.
Why don't we meet later?
To talk.
I'm only in town for a few days.
I'm staying at the park Plaza.
Where could we meet?
Well, why don't we meet there?
For the privacy it will afford us, of course.
Of course.
How do I look?
This is nuts.
Why must I take pictures?
The deac's flowing.
If the deac stops flowing, we whip out the 8 x 10s.
I think you got hot pants.
Keep the pics to remember me by when I'm in tangiers and you're wherever you're going.
Milwaukee.
Zip me.
Blackmail got us into it in Pittsburgh.
Says you.
You going soft on me got us into this.
Get in the closet.
Cousin Prescott will be here any minute.
I don't want anything soft in this room.
[ Knocking at door ]
Coming.
Prescott, hi.
A rose for a rose.
Thank you.
How about an eye opener for an eye opener?
What ever you're having.
[Romantic music playing]
That's a lovely song.
I've never heard it before.
It's one of my favorites.
I play it all the time.
Did you find what you were looking for this afternoon?
It seems our Mr. polosky is on the level.
Ho ho!
Really?
It's a top-shelf portfolio.
The investment group guarantees a total buyout.
There's a chance it could triple in time.
It's a shame we'd have to sell out now.
So why sell it now?
Why don't we buy polosky out?
It's perfect.
Give him 300,000, and we hold on tight.
Well, that would be $150,000 each.
I don't think I can get my hands on that kind of money.
How much do you think you can get your hands on?
Kissing cousins, aren't we?
I shutter at the thought of how many family gatherings we've missed.
Shall I...
No, don't.
I want to see every inch of you.
[Kissing and moaning]
[Zip]
[Camera snaps]
[Humming same tune]
Ha ha ha!
Ah, you poor bastard.
My Uncle took some shrapnel in the war.
Good morning, Mr. polosky.
Good morning, miss Peters.
Morning.
Good morning, Mr. chalmers.
I've done all the paperwork, but as I told you over the phone, buying me out isn't a wise business move.
We appreciate your concern.
My cousin and I have made up our minds.
[Sniff]
Well, I'll just get you to sign the documents.
[Humming same tune]
♪♪ Adored one, I'll keep the future clear for you ♪♪♪♪
[Humming]
[Stops humming]
Is that one of your favorite songs, too, Mr. polosky?
I've been had.
A couple of two-bit hustlers.
Or am I giving you credit for one bit too many?
Mr. chalmers-- save it for the bunco squad!
Benny, show him the pictures.
O.K., Buster, feast your eyes on those.
All right.
Dear God.
I hope you have a very understanding wife.
Horrific.
Terrible.
Ha ha ha!
My wife will never see these.
Christ, Benny!
Damn.
Al.
Prescott.
Prescott!
Prescott, don't you think you should talk about this?
Prescott.
Prescott!
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Prescott.
Please...
Miss Peters.
You're capable of many things.
Murder isn't one of them.
Al!
Benny!
Aah!
[Thud]
Oh, no.
[Prescott] Please, help me.
Prescott?
Hold on!
I'm going to go get help.
The hell you are.
This is your fault.
$300,000, and you blow it!
Get down there, Benny.
You pointing the gun at me?
A man's lying down there!
You're pointing the damn gun at me?
Benny!
Benny!
[Prescott] Please...
Don't leave me here.
Aw, jeez.
We were close, Benny.
We were really close on this one.
Aw, no.
[Prescott] Aah!
[Smash]
[Elevator dings]
Next stop-- monkey island.
Best double clock ever, and the butter-and-egg man falls down an elevator shaft.
You ever hear of a guy dying like that?
Stupid mug.
Have a little respect for the dead.
I do.
Very little respect.
Hello, officers.
Ma'am.
This is a mistake, being here.
We gave them our statements.
We're John and Jane straight-up citizens.
I'm out of here tonight.
I'm on a bus.
See you next life.
[Door opens]
Thanks for coming down, Mrs. chalmers.
I know this is real difficult.
I appreciate your cooperation.
You can go.
Your statements checked out fine.
Officer castle will see you home.
Hold that bus, Benny.
Mrs. chalmers.
Yes.
We're Alison Peters and Benny polosky.
Yes.
You were with my...
Prescott.
We'd, uh...
We'd like to give you this.
Give me what?
I'm sorry, my dear.
I'm blind.
Oh, uh...
It's his cane.
Thank you, my dear.
Prescott mentioned you to me.
Something about a long-lost relative.
Yes.
I want you to know that I intend to fulfill my husband's obligations.
Now, that won't be necessary.
Let the lady finish.
As I was saying,
I'll have to talk to Prescott and get his approval.
How's that?
I want to make sure that the business has my husband's approval.
I've made an appointment for tomorrow evening with my spiritual adviser madame leona.
Madame leona, say your name again.
You're a wicked woman.
You wear your wickedness like a caul.
[Imitates madame leona] You wear your wickedness like a caul.
See if you can imitate a dame with scruples.
I pity you both.
Madame chalmers is sincere woman who has embarked on honorable quest.
What you are doing is disgusting.
Listen to the pot calling the kettle disrespectful.
Spiritual adviser-- now, there's a sure con if I ever heard one.
You do not appreciate the powers you are dealing with.
I appreciate that I'm getting tired of you.
You ain't got no heart.
I'll just shut her yap!
[Chanting]
I'm sensing a presence in the room.
My departed servant, Prescott chalmers,
I beseech contact.
In my flame, let me witness thine image.
In the expression of the sacred taoist square do I invoke your spirit!
What is it, Gibson?
It, uh, it looks like Mr. chalmers, ma'am.
Prescott, is that you?
Yes, of course it's him.
What about the money, Mr. chalmers?
What do you want Dorothy to do with it?
Well...
Ha ha ha!
Always faithful, I promised I'd be here for you.
Prescott...
Is that you?
We're waiting, Mr. chalmers.
Yes, Prescott.
What shall we do about Mr. polosky and miss Peters?
Give them the money?
Yes.
I want to give it to them personally.
Benny?
Guess again.
Benny.
You might call this bait and switch.
Ha ha ha!
Gibson, what's happening?
Mr. chalmers is looking a bit peaked, ma'am.
Your friend Benny was right.
Ha ha ha!
Oh, Jesus Christ in a cardigan sweater.
Aah!
You ain't got no heart.
Well, maybe al and Benny will finally get it together now.
After all, two deads are better than one.
As for Sam, it turned out she was right.
Her husband was cheating on her...
With a zombie he met on a business trip out to the ghost.
In the end, I decided to let Sam handle things her own way.
Go ahead...
Slay it again, Sam.
Ha ha ha!
Captioning made possible by Warner bros.
public performance of captions prohibited without permission of national captioning institute
AAH HA HA HA HA HA!
IT WAS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE HOT L. A. DAYS.
THINGS WERE ABOUT TO GET INTERESTING.
WHEN SHE WALKED IN.
HER NAME WAS SAMANTHA AND SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.
A REGULAR CORPUS DELICTI.
WITH A GREAT KISS.
CAVITY THAT IS.
SOMETHING IN HER SOCKET SAID BEWARE.
MUST'VE BEEN THE WAY THEY SAID HELLO TO ME.
SO, SWEETHEART,
YOU SAY YOUR HUSBAND'S BEEN CHEATING ON YOU
WITH ANOTHER GHOUL?
THAT IT?
WELL, I'LL BE GLAD TO HEAR YOUR STORY,
BUT FIRST I'VE GOT A TAWDRY TALE OF MY OWN TO TELL.
IT'S ABOUT A COUPLE OF SCAM ARTISTS
WHO WANT TO MAKE A KILLING,
PROVIDED THEY DON'T KILL EACH OTHER FIRST.
I CALL ITSEANCE.
I AM ETERNAL FLAME.
IN FIRE, ALL THINGS BEGIN, AND ALL THINGS RETURN.
BUT...
I AM NOT DEATH,
AS THE UNINITIATED WOULD HAVE ME.
I AM POINT OF TRANSITION.
I AM BREATH THAT TRANSFORMS.
I AM LIFE.
IN THIS FLAME,
LET ME WITNESS THINE IMAGE, PRESCOTT CHALMERS,
MY DEPARTED SERVANT.
IN THE EXPRESSION OF THE SACRED TAOIST SQUARE
DO I INVOKE YOUR IMAGE.
WHAT DO YOU WISH TO TELL US THIS NIGHT?
DO YOU WISH TO TELL US SOMETHING, O SPIRIT?
JESUS CHRIST IN A CARDIGAN SWEATER.
BENNY, ONE LOUSY LINE!
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
"GIVE THE MONEY TO MY FRIENDS, DOROTHY."
THE LINE'S NOT THE PROBLEM.
THE DEAC'S THE PROBLEM.
MY NIGHTMARE IS DYING OLD AND BROKE.
I GOT A NAME FOR IT- MONKEY ISLAND.
THAT'S WHERE LOSER CONS GO AT THE END,
DEAD-EYED AND DESPERATE.
THERE AIN'T NO LIFE ON MONKEY ISLAND.
THERE'S NOBODY THERE TO DEAC.
THAT'S WHY YOU HATE IT.
THIS ISN'T PITTSBURGH.
REMEMBER PITTSBURGH?
THE FIRST TIME YOU WENT SOFT.
THE FIRST TIME YOU CHOKED.
SOMEBODY GOT DEAD IN PITTSBURGH.
LISTEN TO ME.
YOU WANT OUT OF THIS LIFE?
HERE IT IS.
AFTER THIS SCORE, YOU GO YOUR WAY, I'LL GO MINE.
WE'LL WALK AWAY RICH.
WHAT WE'RE DOING, WE DON'T DESERVE TO WALK AWAY.
MADAME LEONA, ARE YOU HERE?
YOU GOT SPIDERS IN YOUR VEINS.
YOU'RE TANGLING UP MY WEB, SWEETHEART.
WILL YOU QUIT PUSHING?
CAN YOU SEE ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, YEAH.
MADAME?
YES.
I AM HERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.
BENNY YOU'RE GOING TO BLOW THE WHOLE DEAL.
SORRY.
I SLIPPED.
HOW DO I LOOK?
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
COME IN, MRS. CHALMERS.
COME IN.
MADAME LEONA, THIS IS MY NEW VALET GIBSON.
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
YOU SOUND HOARSE.
ARE YOU SICK?
JUST A COLD, MY DEAR.
PLEASE, SIT DOWN,
AND WE'LL GET STARTED.
YOU MAY PUT THE BRIEFCASE
ON THE TABLE, PLEASE.
GEE, THAT POOR WOMAN.
HOW DID I EVER GET INTO THIS MESS?
HOW DO I LOOK?
COME ON, BENNY.
TELL ME YOU DON'T MISS IT
WITH ME AND YOU JUST A LITTLE.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I MISS?
I MISS THE SHOWER AFTER.
COME IN.
COME IN.
MR. CHALMERS, HOW NICE TO MEET YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING.
MR. POLOSKY, I'M SORRY I'M LATE.
BUT YOUR ELEVATOR IS BROKEN.
OH, PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE WARNED YOU, I'M SORRY.
MR. CHALMERS,
THIS IS MISS ALISON PETERS, WHOM I TOLD YOU ABOUT.
THIS IS MISS ALISON PETERS, WHOM I TOLD YOU ABOUT.
MR. POLOSKY TOLD ME THERE WOULD BE A YOUNG LADY HERE.
HE NEVER TOLD ME SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.
BECAUSE HE'S AN HONEST LAWYER.
MR. POLOSKY'S BEEN NEGLIGENT ON BOTH OUR BEHALFS.
HE SHOULD'VE TOLD ME HOW HANDSOME MY COUSIN IS.
PLEASE.
FRANKLY, I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED
ABOUT MY RELATION TO MISS-
MISS PETERS HERE.
OF COURSE.
AS I EXPLAINED OVER THE PHONE,
I'M EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF YOUR UNCLE ALBERT PETERS.
THE ONLY MAN I KNOW BY THAT NAME
IS MY MOTHER'S BROTHER, WHO DIED...
WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD.
SOME SORT OF TRAIN ACCIDENT, I BELIEVE.
I LOVE TRAINS.
CIGARETTE?
NO, THANK YOU.
MR. CHALMERS,
YOUR UNCLE DIDN'T DIE IN A TRAIN ACCIDENT.
HE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF MASTERMINDING
THE WILMINGTON BANK ROBBERY OF 1901.
THE WILMINGTON BANK ROBBERY?
$200,000.
IN HIS DAY THE LARGEST PAYROLL HIGHEST IN STATE HISTORY.
HE GOT 20 YEARS.
WELL, DADDY WAS DADDY.
I IMAGINE YOUR MOTHER BELIEVED IT BEST YOU THOUGHT HIM DEAD.
THAT HAPPENS IN FAMILIES.
WELL, AFTER SERVING HIS TIME,
YOUR UNCLE BEGAN A NEW LIFE IN CHICAGO.
HE STARTED A BUSINESS, MARRIED,
AND RAISED A FAMILY.
NOW, LAST YEAR, YOUR UNCLE, ALISON'S-
MISS PETERS'
- FATHER DIED.
NOW, ALONG WITH HIS PUBLIC WILL,
I FOUND A SECOND DOCUMENT-
DETAILS OF ANOTHER INVESTMENT ACCOUNT.
IT WAS OPENED UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME
TO BE PASSED ON TO ANY OR ALL OF ALBERT PETERS' HEIRS.
THIS IS THE ACCOUNT'S NET WORTH
AS OF LAST MONTH.
A LITTLE UNDER $3 MILLION.
MY GOD.
INDEED.
HOWEVER, THERE'S A PROBLEM.
AS YOU'LL SEE ON THE FIRST SHEET,
THE ACCOUNT WAS OPENED BEFORE PETERS WENT TO PRISON.
THE OPENING BALANCE WAS $200,000.
CASH.
OH.
THE WILMINGTON BANK MONEY?
I'M SURE THAT'S HOW THE D. A. WILL SEE IT.
BUT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
AS LONG AS WE CAN KEEP THE AUTHORITIES OUT OF THIS,
YOU COULD PROBABLY CLAIM THE MONEY WITHOUT TROUBLE.
ALL YOU'D NEED WOULD BE THE ACCOUNT NUMBER.
WHICH YOU HAVE.
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT, MR. POLOSKY?
NOTHING.
THE PROBATE GIVES ME 10%
FROM THE SALE OF THE INVESTMENTS.
I DON'T WANT ANY MORE THAN THAT.
I DON'T WANT ANY MORE THAN THAT.
ALBERT WAS A FRIEND.
MR. POLOSKY, WOULD YOU MIND IF WE HAVE A WORD?
OF COURSE NOT.
I'LL BE OUTSIDE.
THAT WAS AN INTERESTING STORY,
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT.
YOU AND ME BOTH, COUSIN.
ALTHOUGH IT DOES EXPLAIN A FEW THINGS ABOUT DADDY.
OH?
SUCH AS?
WELL, HE CLAIMED TO BE
THIS BIG WORLD WAR I HERO.
THE ONLY MUSTARD GAS HE SAW
WAS AT A HOT DOG STAND AT WRIGLEY FIELD.
I WAS A WORLD WAR I HERO.
YOU HAVE THE CANE TO PROVE IT.
I WANT TO DO SOME CHECKING.
WHY DON'T WE MEET LATER?
TO TALK.
I'M ONLY IN TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS.
I'M STAYING AT THE PARK PLAZA.
WHERE COULD WE MEET?
WELL, WHY DON'T WE MEET THERE?
FOR THE PRIVACY IT WILL AFFORD US, OF COURSE.
OF COURSE.
HOW DO I LOOK?
THIS IS NUTS.
WHY MUST I TAKE PICTURES?
THE DEAC'S FLOWING.
IF THE DEAC STOPS FLOWING,
WE WHIP OUT THE 8 X 10S.
I THINK YOU GOT HOT PANTS.
KEEP THE PICS TO REMEMBER ME BY WHEN I'M IN TANGIERS
AND YOU'RE WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING.
MILWAUKEE.
ZIP ME.
BLACKMAIL GOT US INTO IT IN PITTSBURGH.
SAYS YOU.
YOU GOING SOFT ON ME GOT US INTO THIS.
GET IN THE CLOSET.
COUSIN PRESCOTT WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING SOFT IN THIS ROOM.
COMING.
PRESCOTT, HI.
PRESCOTT, HI.
A ROSE FOR A ROSE.
THANK YOU.
HOW ABOUT AN EYE OPENER FOR AN EYE OPENER?
WHAT EVER YOU'RE HAVING.
THAT'S A LOVELY SONG.
I'VE NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE.
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME.
DID YOU FIND WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR THIS AFTERNOON?
IT SEEMS OUR MR. POLOSKY IS ON THE LEVEL.
HO HO!
REALLY?
IT'S A TOP-SHELF PORTFOLIO.
THE INVESTMENT GROUP GUARANTEES
A TOTAL BUYOUT.
THERE'S A CHANCE IT COULD TRIPLE IN TIME.
IT'S A SHAME WE'D HAVE TO SELL OUT NOW.
SO WHY SELL IT NOW?
WHY DON'T WE BUY POLOSKY OUT?
IT'S PERFECT.
GIVE HIM 300,000, AND WE HOLD ON TIGHT.
WELL, THAT WOULD BE $150,000 EACH.
I DON'T THINK I CAN GET MY HANDS ON THAT KIND OF MONEY.
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON?
YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON?
KISSING COUSINS, AREN'T WE?
I SHUTTER AT THE THOUGHT OF HOW MANY FAMILY GATHERINGS WE'VE MISSED.
SHALL I...
NO, DON'T.
I WANT TO SEE EVERY INCH OF YOU.
HA HA HA!
AH, YOU POOR BASTARD.
MY UNCLE TOOK SOME SHRAPNEL IN THE WAR.
GOOD MORNING, MR. POLOSKY.
GOOD MORNING, MISS PETERS.
MORNING.
GOOD MORNING, MR. CHALMERS.
I'VE DONE ALL THE PAPERWORK,
BUT AS I TOLD YOU OVER THE PHONE,
BUYING ME OUT ISN'T A WISE BUSINESS MOVE.
WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN.
MY COUSIN AND I HAVE MADE UP OUR MINDS.
WELL, I'LL JUST GET YOU TO SIGN THE DOCUMENTS.
ADORED ONE, I'LL KEEP THE FUTURE CLEAR FOR YOU
IS THAT ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE SONGS, TOO, MR. POLOSKY?
I'VE BEEN HAD.
A COUPLE OF TWO-BIT HUSTLERS.
OR AM I GIVING YOU CREDIT FOR ONE BIT TOO MANY?
MR. CHALMERS-
SAVE IT FOR THE BUNCO SQUAD!
BENNY, SHOW HIM THE PICTURES.
O. K., BUSTER, FEAST YOUR EYES ON THOSE.
ALL RIGHT.
DEAR GOD.
I HOPE YOU HAVE A VERY UNDERSTANDING WIFE.
HORRIFIC.
TERRIBLE.
HA HA HA!
MY WIFE WILL NEVER SEE THESE.
CHRIST, BENNY!
DAMN.
AL.
AL.
PRESCOTT.
PRESCOTT!
PRESCOTT, DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS?
PRESCOTT.
PRESCOTT!
I WOULDN'T DO THAT IF I WERE YOU, PRESCOTT.
PLEASE...
MISS PETERS.
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF MANY THINGS.
MURDER ISN'T ONE OF THEM.
AL!
BENNY!
AAH!
OH, NO.
PLEASE, HELP ME.
PRESCOTT?
HOLD ON!
I'M GOING TO GO GET HELP.
THE HELL YOU ARE.
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.
$300,000, AND YOU BLOW IT!
GET DOWN THERE, BENNY.
YOU POINTING THE GUN AT ME?
A MAN'S LYING DOWN THERE!
YOU'RE POINTING THE DAMN GUN AT ME?
BENNY!
BENNY!
PLEASE...
DON'T LEAVE ME HERE.
AW, JEEZ.
WE WERE CLOSE, BENNY.
WE WERE REALLY CLOSE ON THIS ONE.
WE WERE REALLY CLOSE ON THIS ONE.
AW, NO.
AAH!
NEXT STOP- MONKEY ISLAND.
NEXT STOP- MONKEY ISLAND.
BEST DOUBLE CLOCK EVER,
AND THE BUTTER-AND-EGG MAN
FALLS DOWN AN ELEVATOR SHAFT.
YOU EVER HEAR OF A GUY DYING LIKE THAT?
STUPID MUG.
HAVE A LITTLE RESPECT FOR THE DEAD.
I DO.
VERY LITTLE RESPECT.
HELLO, OFFICERS.
MA'AM.
THIS IS A MISTAKE, BEING HERE.
WE GAVE THEM OUR STATEMENTS.
WE'RE JOHN AND JANE STRAIGHT-UP CITIZENS.
I'M OUT OF HERE TONIGHT.
I'M ON A BUS.
SEE YOU NEXT LIFE.
THANKS FOR COMING DOWN, MRS. CHALMERS.
I KNOW THIS IS REAL DIFFICULT.
I APPRECIATE YOUR COOPERATION.
YOU CAN GO.
YOUR STATEMENTS CHECKED OUT FINE.
OFFICER CASTLE WILL SEE YOU HOME.
HOLD THAT BUS, BENNY.
MRS. CHALMERS.
YES.
WE'RE ALISON PETERS AND BENNY POLOSKY.
YES.
YOU WERE WITH MY...
PRESCOTT.
WE'D, UH...
WE'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU THIS.
GIVE ME WHAT?
GIVE ME WHAT?
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR.
I'M BLIND.
OH, UH...
IT'S HIS CANE.
THANK YOU, MY DEAR.
PRESCOTT MENTIONED YOU TO ME.
SOMETHING ABOUT A LONG-LOST RELATIVE.
YES.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I INTEND TO FULFILL MY HUSBAND'S OBLIGATIONS.
NOW, THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.
LET THE LADY FINISH.
AS I WAS SAYING,
I'LL HAVE TO TALK TO PRESCOTT
AND GET HIS APPROVAL.
HOW'S THAT?
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BUSINESS
HAS MY HUSBAND'S APPROVAL.
I'VE MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR TOMORROW EVENING
WITH MY SPIRITUAL ADVISER MADAME LEONA.
MADAME LEONA, SAY YOUR NAME AGAIN.
YOU'RE A WICKED WOMAN.
YOU WEAR YOUR WICKEDNESS LIKE A CAUL.
YOU WEAR YOUR WICKEDNESS LIKE A CAUL.
SEE IF YOU CAN IMITATE A DAME WITH SCRUPLES.
I PITY YOU BOTH.
MADAME CHALMERS IS SINCERE WOMAN
WHO HAS EMBARKED ON HONORABLE QUEST.
WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS DISGUSTING.
LISTEN TO THE POT CALLING THE KETTLE DISRESPECTFUL.
SPIRITUAL ADVISER-
NOW, THERE'S A SURE CON IF I EVER HEARD ONE.
YOU DO NOT APPRECIATE THE POWERS YOU ARE DEALING WITH.
I APPRECIATE THAT I'M GETTING TIRED OF YOU.
YOU AIN'T GOT NO HEART.
I'LL JUST SHUT HER YAP!
I'LL JUST SHUT HER YAP!
I'M SENSING A PRESENCE IN THE ROOM.
I'M SENSING A PRESENCE IN THE ROOM.
MY DEPARTED SERVANT, PRESCOTT CHALMERS,
I BESEECH CONTACT.
IN MY FLAME, LET ME WITNESS THINE IMAGE.
IN THE EXPRESSION OF THE SACRED TAOIST SQUARE
DO I INVOKE YOUR SPIRIT!
DO I INVOKE YOUR SPIRIT!
WHAT IS IT, GIBSON?
IT, UH, IT LOOKS LIKE MR. CHALMERS, MA'AM.
PRESCOTT, IS THAT YOU?
YES, OF COURSE IT'S HIM.
WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY, MR. CHALMERS?
WHAT DO YOU WANT DOROTHY TO DO WITH IT?
WELL...
HA HA HA!
ALWAYS FAITHFUL, I PROMISED I'D BE HERE FOR YOU.
PRESCOTT...
IS THAT YOU?
WE'RE WAITING, MR. CHALMERS.
YES, PRESCOTT.
WHAT SHALL WE DO
ABOUT MR. POLOSKY AND MISS PETERS?
GIVE THEM THE MONEY?
YES.
I WANT TO GIVE IT TO THEM PERSONALLY.
BENNY?
GUESS AGAIN.
BENNY.
YOU MIGHT CALL THIS BAIT AND SWITCH.
HA HA HA!
GIBSON, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
MR. CHALMERS IS LOOKING A BIT PEAKED, MA'AM.
YOUR FRIEND BENNY WAS RIGHT.
HA HA HA!
OH, JESUS CHRIST IN A CARDIGAN SWEATER.
AAH!
YOU AIN'T GOT NO HEART.
WELL, MAYBE AL AND BENNY
WILL FINALLY GET IT TOGETHER NOW.
AFTER ALL, TWO DEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE.
AS FOR SAM, IT TURNED OUT SHE WAS RIGHT.
HER HUSBAND WAS CHEATING ON HER...
WITH A ZOMBIE HE MET ON A BUSINESS TRIP
OUT TO THE GHOST.
IN THE END, I DECIDED TO LET SAM HANDLE THINGS HER OWN WAY.
GO AHEAD...
SLAY IT AGAIN, SAM.
HA HA HA!
[Shriek]
Aah ha ha ha ha ha!
It was another one of those hot L.A. days.
Things were about to get interesting.
When she walked in.
Her name was Samantha and she was beautiful.
A regular corpus delicti.
With a great kiss.
Cavity that is.
Something in her socket said beware.
Must've been the way they said hello to me.
So, sweetheart, you say your husband's been cheating on you with another ghoul?
That it?
Well, I'll be glad to hear your story, but first I've got a tawdry tale of my own to tell.
It's about a couple of scam artists who want to make a killing, provided they don't kill each other first.
I call itseance.
I call itseance.
I am eternal flame.
In fire, all things begin, and all things return.
But...
I am not death, as the uninitiated would have me.
I am point of transition.
I am breath that transforms.
I am life.
In this flame, let me witness thine image, Prescott chalmers, my departed servant.
In the expression of the sacred taoist square do I invoke your image.
[Chanting]
What do you wish to tell us this night?
Do you wish to tell us something, o spirit?
Jesus Christ in a cardigan sweater.
Benny, one lousy line!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"Give the money to my friends, Dorothy."
The line's not the problem.
The deac's the problem.
My nightmare is dying old and broke.
I got a name for it-- monkey island.
That's where loser cons go at the end, dead-eyed and desperate.
There ain't no life on monkey island.
There's nobody there to deac.
That's why you hate it.
This isn't Pittsburgh.
Remember Pittsburgh?
The first time you went soft.
The first time you choked.
Somebody got dead in Pittsburgh.
Listen to me.
You want out of this life?
Here it is.
After this score, you go your way, I'll go mine.
We'll walk away rich.
What we're doing, we don't deserve to walk away.
Madame leona, are you here?
You got spiders in your veins.
You're tangling up my web, sweetheart.
Will you quit pushing?
Can you see all right?
Yeah, yeah.
Madame?
Yes.
I am here.
I'll be right with you.
[Thud]
Benny you're going to blow the whole deal.
Sorry.
I slipped.
How do I look?
You look beautiful.
Come in, Mrs. chalmers.
Come in.
Madame leona, this is my new valet Gibson.
Pleasure to meet you.
You sound hoarse.
Are you sick?
Just a cold, my dear.
Please, sit down, and we'll get started.
You may put the briefcase on the table, please.
[Benny] Gee, that poor woman.
How did I ever get into this mess?
How do I look?
Come on, Benny.
Tell me you don't miss it with me and you just a little.
You want to know what I miss?
I miss the shower after.
[Knock on door]
Come in.
Mr. chalmers, how nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming.
Mr. polosky, I'm sorry I'm late.
But your elevator is broken.
Oh, perhaps I should have warned you, I'm sorry.
Mr. chalmers, this is miss Alison Peters, whom I told you about.
Mr. polosky told me there would be a young lady here.
He never told me she was beautiful.
Because he's an honest lawyer.
Mr. polosky's been negligent on both our behalfs.
He should've told me how handsome my cousin is.
Please.
Frankly, I'm a little confused about my relation to miss-- miss Peters here.
Of course.
As I explained over the phone,
I'm executor of the estate of your Uncle Albert Peters.
The only man I know by that name is my mother's brother, who died...
When she was a child.
Some sort of train accident, I believe.
I love trains.
Cigarette?
No, thank you.
Mr. chalmers, your Uncle didn't die in a train accident.
He was found guilty of masterminding the Wilmington bank robbery of 1901.
The Wilmington bank robbery?
$200,000.
In his day the largest payroll highest in state history.
He got 20 years.
Well, daddy was daddy.
I imagine your mother believed it best you thought him dead.
That happens in families.
Well, after serving his time, your Uncle began a new life in Chicago.
He started a business, married, and raised a family.
Now, last year, your Uncle, Alison's-- miss Peters'--father died.
Now, along with his public will,
I found a second document-- details of another investment account.
It was opened under an assumed name to be passed on to any or all of Albert Peters' heirs.
This is the account's net worth as of last month.
A little under $3 million.
My God.
Indeed.
However, there's a problem.
As you'll see on the first sheet, the account was opened before Peters went to prison.
The opening balance was $200,000.
Cash.
Oh.
The Wilmington bank money?
I'm sure that's how the D.A. will see it.
But as far as I can tell, as long as we can keep the authorities out of this, you could probably claim the money without trouble.
All you'd need would be the account number.
Which you have.
And what do you want, Mr. polosky?
Nothing.
The probate gives me 10% from the sale of the investments.
I don't want any more than that.
Albert was a friend.
Mr. polosky, would you mind if we have a word?
Of course not.
I'll be outside.
[Door opens and closes]
That was an interesting story, but I don't believe a word of it.
You and me both, cousin.
Although it does explain a few things about daddy.
Oh?
Such as?
Well, he claimed to be this big world war I hero.
The only mustard gas he saw was at a hot dog stand at wrigley field.
I was a world war I hero.
You have the cane to prove it.
I want to do some checking.
Why don't we meet later?
To talk.
I'm only in town for a few days.
I'm staying at the park Plaza.
Where could we meet?
Well, why don't we meet there?
For the privacy it will afford us, of course.
Of course.
How do I look?
This is nuts.
Why must I take pictures?
The deac's flowing.
If the deac stops flowing, we whip out the 8 x 10s.
I think you got hot pants.
Keep the pics to remember me by when I'm in tangiers and you're wherever you're going.
Milwaukee.
Zip me.
Blackmail got us into it in Pittsburgh.
Says you.
You going soft on me got us into this.
Get in the closet.
Cousin Prescott will be here any minute.
I don't want anything soft in this room.
[ Knocking at door ]
Coming.
Prescott, hi.
A rose for a rose.
Thank you.
How about an eye opener for an eye opener?
What ever you're having.
[Romantic music playing]
That's a lovely song.
I've never heard it before.
It's one of my favorites.
I play it all the time.
Did you find what you were looking for this afternoon?
It seems our Mr. polosky is on the level.
Ho ho!
Really?
It's a top-shelf portfolio.
The investment group guarantees a total buyout.
There's a chance it could triple in time.
It's a shame we'd have to sell out now.
So why sell it now?
Why don't we buy polosky out?
It's perfect.
Give him 300,000, and we hold on tight.
Well, that would be $150,000 each.
I don't think I can get my hands on that kind of money.
How much do you think you can get your hands on?
Kissing cousins, aren't we?
I shutter at the thought of how many family gatherings we've missed.
Shall I...
No, don't.
I want to see every inch of you.
[Kissing and moaning]
[Zip]
[Camera snaps]
[Humming same tune]
Ha ha ha!
Ah, you poor bastard.
My Uncle took some shrapnel in the war.
Good morning, Mr. polosky.
Good morning, miss Peters.
Morning.
Good morning, Mr. chalmers.
I've done all the paperwork, but as I told you over the phone, buying me out isn't a wise business move.
We appreciate your concern.
My cousin and I have made up our minds.
[Sniff]
Well, I'll just get you to sign the documents.
[Humming same tune]
♪♪ Adored one, I'll keep the future clear for you ♪♪♪♪
[Humming]
[Stops humming]
Is that one of your favorite songs, too, Mr. polosky?
I've been had.
A couple of two-bit hustlers.
Or am I giving you credit for one bit too many?
Mr. chalmers-- save it for the bunco squad!
Benny, show him the pictures.
O.K., Buster, feast your eyes on those.
All right.
Dear God.
I hope you have a very understanding wife.
Horrific.
Terrible.
Ha ha ha!
My wife will never see these.
Christ, Benny!
Damn.
Al.
Prescott.
Prescott!
Prescott, don't you think you should talk about this?
Prescott.
Prescott!
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Prescott.
Please...
Miss Peters.
You're capable of many things.
Murder isn't one of them.
Al!
Benny!
Aah!
[Thud]
Oh, no.
[Prescott] Please, help me.
Prescott?
Hold on!
I'm going to go get help.
The hell you are.
This is your fault.
$300,000, and you blow it!
Get down there, Benny.
You pointing the gun at me?
A man's lying down there!
You're pointing the damn gun at me?
Benny!
Benny!
[Prescott] Please...
Don't leave me here.
Aw, jeez.
We were close, Benny.
We were really close on this one.
Aw, no.
[Prescott] Aah!
[Smash]
[Elevator dings]
Next stop-- monkey island.
Best double clock ever, and the butter-and-egg man falls down an elevator shaft.
You ever hear of a guy dying like that?
Stupid mug.
Have a little respect for the dead.
I do.
Very little respect.
Hello, officers.
Ma'am.
This is a mistake, being here.
We gave them our statements.
We're John and Jane straight-up citizens.
I'm out of here tonight.
I'm on a bus.
See you next life.
[Door opens]
Thanks for coming down, Mrs. chalmers.
I know this is real difficult.
I appreciate your cooperation.
You can go.
Your statements checked out fine.
Officer castle will see you home.
Hold that bus, Benny.
Mrs. chalmers.
Yes.
We're Alison Peters and Benny polosky.
Yes.
You were with my...
Prescott.
We'd, uh...
We'd like to give you this.
Give me what?
I'm sorry, my dear.
I'm blind.
Oh, uh...
It's his cane.
Thank you, my dear.
Prescott mentioned you to me.
Something about a long-lost relative.
Yes.
I want you to know that I intend to fulfill my husband's obligations.
Now, that won't be necessary.
Let the lady finish.
As I was saying,
I'll have to talk to Prescott and get his approval.
How's that?
I want to make sure that the business has my husband's approval.
I've made an appointment for tomorrow evening with my spiritual adviser madame leona.
Madame leona, say your name again.
You're a wicked woman.
You wear your wickedness like a caul.
[Imitates madame leona] You wear your wickedness like a caul.
See if you can imitate a dame with scruples.
I pity you both.
Madame chalmers is sincere woman who has embarked on honorable quest.
What you are doing is disgusting.
Listen to the pot calling the kettle disrespectful.
Spiritual adviser-- now, there's a sure con if I ever heard one.
You do not appreciate the powers you are dealing with.
I appreciate that I'm getting tired of you.
You ain't got no heart.
I'll just shut her yap!
[Chanting]
I'm sensing a presence in the room.
My departed servant, Prescott chalmers,
I beseech contact.
In my flame, let me witness thine image.
In the expression of the sacred taoist square do I invoke your spirit!
What is it, Gibson?
It, uh, it looks like Mr. chalmers, ma'am.
Prescott, is that you?
Yes, of course it's him.
What about the money, Mr. chalmers?
What do you want Dorothy to do with it?
Well...
Ha ha ha!
Always faithful, I promised I'd be here for you.
Prescott...
Is that you?
We're waiting, Mr. chalmers.
Yes, Prescott.
What shall we do about Mr. polosky and miss Peters?
Give them the money?
Yes.
I want to give it to them personally.
Benny?
Guess again.
Benny.
You might call this bait and switch.
Ha ha ha!
Gibson, what's happening?
Mr. chalmers is looking a bit peaked, ma'am.
Your friend Benny was right.
Ha ha ha!
Oh, Jesus Christ in a cardigan sweater.
Aah!
You ain't got no heart.
Well, maybe al and Benny will finally get it together now.
After all, two deads are better than one.
As for Sam, it turned out she was right.
Her husband was cheating on her...
With a zombie he met on a business trip out to the ghost.
In the end, I decided to let Sam handle things her own way.
Go ahead...
Slay it again, Sam.
Ha ha ha!
Captioning made possible by Warner bros.
public performance of captions prohibited without permission of national captioning institute
See you later.
Looking good.
Going out?
No big deal, just Shooters.
Oh, great, this chicken breast is never gonna thaw.
Let me change, and I'll go with you.
Yeah, well, but tonight I thought, you know...
Oh, right, cruising for babes.
Well, don't let me slow you down, Fido.
Woof, woof.
What is that?
- Love spice?
- Don't wait up.
Hi.
I was cleaning out the fridge and found this champagne.
Where'd you find the glasses, the dishwasher?
No, the cupboard.
- What's that smell?
- What?
What smell?
- I don't know.
- So are you interested?
A little champagne?
A little conversation?
No, I was kind of counting on doing nothing tonight.
Yeah, me too.
So why don't we just do nothing together?
No, no, some other time, Bill.
Let's do nothing together?
- That's lame, even for you.
- She caught me off guard.
- Besides, I have a toothache.
- You have a toothache?
Well, her loss, my gain.
Well, I give up on her.
Women like that will never ever give you a chance.
I don't know.
I think it has something to do with that aftershave.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
What?
Oh, my God, when?
Yeah, sure.
I'll be there in the morning.
- What's wrong?
- That was my boss.
- Yeah?
- Now my ex-boss.
You're not gonna believe this, honey.
They sold the shop.
- So where does that leave you?
- Well, out of work.
She's mailing my check.
I have to pick my personal stuff up in the morning.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
You look absolutely miserable.
- Did things go that badly last night?
- No, no.
My tooth, it's acting up again.
Is that why you were banging around all night?
How about going to see a dentist?
I have a good one.
It's not that big a deal, OK?
These things go away.
So you holding out for gum disease, root canals, oral surgery?
A lecture from the woman who flosses more than the tooth fairy.
Feels swollen, can you tell?
Oh, you really should have that looked at.
I'm making an appointment with Dr Estren.
- Dr Estren?
- Best dentist in L.A.
- And you won't feel a thing.
- Thanks, Mom.
You know, I charge two bucks a shot.
Then put it on my tab.
I'm getting shots for my portfolio.
You know, you really do have a beautiful bike.
Especially from the pipes up.
Well, it's a lot more beautiful at 60 miles an hour.
Want to go for a ride?
No.
I just finished my shots.
And I was kind of counting on doing nothing today.
Yeah.
I was thinking of doing nothing too.
How about we do nothing together?
Oh, the power.
It feels like I can go anywhere.
But will you still love it after you've swallowed a moth at 60 miles an hour?
- Where'd you learn to ride like that?
- Oh, prison.
Had you going.
Had you going!
Nothing about you would surprise me.
- We'll see about that.
- Yeah, we'll see.
Yeah, I come out here a lot.
It's desolate.
Yeah, that it is.
I like being alone.
You think there's something wrong with that?
No, no, I'm the same way.
When I was growing up, I was alone a lot.
Cos my mother wasn't around much, you know.
- I just learned to like it.
- Yeah, the freedom.
Yeah, the freedom.
There's a great stretch ahead.
Takes you through the pass.
It's really beautiful.
We'll have to do it sometime.
Now I have this interview, though.
Wilshire and Hunt, photo assistant job.
Hey, I'll take you.
If they're offering my job back, doesn't that mean we won?
No, that's all they're offering, Matt.
They won't admit they fired you because you're gay or discuss a monetary settlement.
So that's like saying I imagined the whole thing.
Down deep I thought they'd back off when they realized I was serious.
They'll only do what we force them to do.
I miss the halfway house, Sarah.
I miss Kenny and Tiny D. I think about them all the time.
And the burger stand's getting real old.
Matt, look, this is your decision, but they wouldn't have made this offer if we didn't have a strong case.
I say reject it.
Let's make them do the right thing.
If they want a fight, they got one.
- Reject their offer.
- Yeah.
Next time you're at the beach, stop by the burger stand.
Even our coffee's better than this.
Lose the light fixtures.
I want recessed tinted quartz.
And, oh, these clothes.
What did they sell here, big and beautiful?
- Sorry.
Was this your place?
- Oh, no.
I'm Jane Mancini.
I worked here.
You're Kay Beacon.
Why doesn't anybody recognize me when my mother's around?
What is this, the ritual last look?
I'm just getting some of my personal things.
My coffee cup, my makeup egg and my design book.
I design all my own dresses.
I love it.
I love your designs.
The front-slit skirt is fabulous.
Those gathers, the drop front, that was spring '90.
God, that V-neck, everybody had it before the season was over.
Wait a minute.
I designed this dress.
Don't be embarrassed.
I see my old things everywhere.
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
- This is not a Kay Beacon knockoff.
- It's a knockoff of a knockoff.
But what the heck, at least you used all my ideas in a smart way.
- I'll be out in a second.
- The question is, could you do better using my new ideas under my supervision?
Seriously?
Be at my studio tomorrow at 9.00.
We'll talk.
- So long, Jane Mancini.
- Bye.
I'll wait for you.
Best tacos in town are just a couple blocks away.
I've had enough culture shock for one morning.
- I'll just grab a cab.
- All right.
Thanks for this morning.
I had a good time.
I did too.
Great bike.
Thanks.
- Hello.
- Good afternoon, madam.
I would like to sell this.
Very, very fine stones, madam.
Excellent piece.
How much will you give me?
Well, I'll give you its full-market value, madam.
Seven thousand dollars.
I paid almost 12 for that four years ago.
There is a recession, you know.
The market is flat.
Only the White House doesn't know this.
Never could resist a witty European man.
I'll take it.
I just need some photo identification to have your check made out.
Oh, well...
I forgot my wallet in the car.
A friend dropped me off.
Why don't I bring my ID back on the way from the bank?
It's company policy, madam.
I must see your ID.
I'll tell you, why don't I put it in my safe until you come back?
No, thanks.
You following me?
Thought you were looking for a photography job.
- How is that any of your business?
- Sorry, I was just curious.
If you wanna know something, just ask me, all right?
OK.
Come on, get on, and I'll take you home.
No, I'll find my own way home.
To my new career, my brilliant career.
So, what are you, exactly?
Junior design associate, honey, to Kay Beacon.
Who's Kay Beacon?
Kay Beacon has one of the hottest names in fashion.
Everybody's knocking off her stuff.
Even me.
- Hey, I'm very proud of you.
- This is an amazing opportunity.
I'll inspect the merchandise, draft her designs, and, who knows, maybe even throw in a few ideas of my own.
- Aren't you excited for me?
- Hey, I'm thrilled.
This is great.
To your brilliant career.
There's just something special about a pineapple, pepperoni and goat cheese pizza.
Special doesn't do it justice.
So where did you meet this mysterious ex-husband of yours.
The one you never talk about?
I'll bet there's a generation of ferrets somewhere in your family tree.
Actually, I think ferrets live in holes, so...
OK, all right.
I was in New York in college, and I was doing a project at the Met, and that's how I met him.
Will you take the light out of my eyes and put the rubber hose away?
All right, next topic.
- Is the job hunt too personal?
- Complete washout.
Glamour jobs are always hard to find.
I wish I had a talent like photography.
I had a great teacher.
My mother.
We used to go out on Sundays and prowl around and look for really great shots.
God, she had a great eye.
We were really close.
- She's still back east?
- Yeah.
I'm surprised that Michael talked the landlord into letting you do this.
Did I tell you that I slept with him?
Gullible.
I finally get a few days off, but do I get to kick back and vegetate?
Not with empty paint cans in the new tenant's garbage.
Serves you right for being garbage detective.
So she's touching up a few cracks.
Think of it as work she's saving you.
Black paint, guys.
At last, a little diversity around here.
Aren't you curious about the ins and outs of Satanism?
Hold this.
Excuse me, locksmith?
- What apartment were you working in?
- Mine.
- She changed my locks.
- Were they broken?
- No.
- Wait a minute.
I'll need a duplicate key.
- Landlord's rules.
- Sorry.
Against my rules.
Listen, Jo, let's not get off on the wrong foot.
Now, what about this black paint?
OK, you're a photographer.
You have a darkroom or something, fine.
But could we clear it with the manager first?
Or at least discuss it?
Sure, OK, Mike.
As soon as I get some time, we'll discuss it.
I don't mean to be a jerk, but I need a key.
Unless, of course, you'd rather be living elsewhere.
You'll have it.
Now, can I close my door?
Moira showed you what to do?
I already knew.
I inspected the incoming stock at the store.
- Pass or fail?
- Pass.
Wrong.
That sleeve pleat is crooked.
Everything is labeled Kay Beacon.
That means that it has to be perfect.
- Not great, not terrific, but perfect.
- I understand.
Let me guess.
Because you're a designer too?
- I may not be in the same league...
- You don't believe that.
You think I'm someone a few years older who just got lucky.
You need this job, honey.
If you have any ability at all, this may be your shot.
- I appreciate that.
- No, you don't.
But if you study every move I make and work your butt off, maybe you will.
I want you to go look through last year's line.
If there's anything that fits you at all, wear it.
It's yours.
Really?
Thank you.
Moira, teach Jane how to inspect again.
The Kay Beacon way.
We're coming through.
Watch your buns.
I'm sorry it took so long, buddy.
Kitchen chaos, you know.
- Look out.
Sorry, sorry!
- Matt...
Matt?
- Matt?
What a shocker.
- Oh, but Pete Stoller in a tie?
- How you doing?
You look great!
- It's the best.
Matt, check this out, after six months in stock, they put me in sales.
- Me...
- OK, now I know it's you for sure.
That laugh drove me crazy for months.
So, how's everybody back at the house?
Mr Thomas, Sue?
Terrific.
Yeah, everybody's fine.
You know, sometimes I'll be on the boulevard, and I'll just...
- You still go back there?
- No, no, no...
Nothing like that.
No hustling, no crack.
That's my dead life.
I just meant that sometimes when I'm back there it reminds me of the house and of you and the talks we used to have.
You helped me through a lot of stuff.
I'm proud of you, Pete.
- God, so, what's all this?
- Oh, you know, extra money.
- You know how it is.
- Yeah, yeah.
You look great.
- Keep up the good work, OK?
- OK.
Hey, I'm sorry about this morning, all right?
No biggie.
A darkroom.
It's very cool.
- Michael calm down yet?
- That guy is so anal.
He needs to prescribe something for himself.
He's all right.
He just takes things seriously.
Yeah, you're right.
I'm a bitch.
Look, I need a favor.
- Do you have anything besides water?
- Beer.
Great.
Well, what do you need?
A bracelet I need to sell, only I can't because I don't have a photo ID.
- You don't have a driver's license?
- Who drives in New York?
So I don't have a photo ID, and I'm broke, flat, Jake.
I'm not used to this, and it feels terrible.
Trust me.
It's not terminal.
I got a couple of bucks I can loan you.
I'll be fine once I sell this bracelet.
Come on, do it for me?
Is that why you were at the jewellery store?
Jake, come on.
Yes or no?
Too bad the stones are mismatched.
No pride in workmanship.
It's worth around four thousand.
But I know a guy, so I'll give you 45 hundred.
It's worth eight, so I'll take seven to save a trip to another jeweller.
You're wrong, see this?
OK, OK.
Seven thousand.
Driver's license, please.
- Who is Beth?
- Excuse me?
Beth?
I don't know.
The name on the back of the bracelet.
You don't know?
No, I'm selling this for a friend.
I don't want trouble.
This could be stolen.
No.
It's not stolen, it's...
- What happened?
- Who's Beth?
You didn't sell it.
I told you I needed the money.
I hate being used.
Worse, I hate being lied to.
- What does that mean?
- Is it stolen?
Thank you for the vote of confidence.
- I knew I could depend on you.
- You're not answering.
Why, if you're not gonna believe the answer?
Try me.
I am just so sick of you people and all your questions.
Why don't you just mind your own business?
- Fine.
- Gotta know everything, all the time.
You ask for a simple favor and you just...
You know, Billy, that Jo?
- Don't trust her.
- Told you.
She's trouble.
That is last thing I need.
- So keep your distance.
- Damn straight I will.
And you know what?
I would advise you to do the same thing.
So she got under your skin, there, Jake, huh?
No.
No.
I'm telling you, that Kay is the most arrogant, manipulative woman.
She totally humiliated me in front of the staff,
- then sent me home with a free outfit.
- I thought this was a dream job.
I can't figure out if she likes me or hates me.
It's tough because she's totally mean to everyone.
A woman that young and that successful, you would think that she...
Sweetheart, can we send Kay Beacon home now?
She's been with us all through dinner.
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Thank you.
- Come here.
- What?
Do you know how sexy you look sometimes?
Just sitting here, sipping your tea.
- I do not.
- Talking about your mean boss.
Now, just relax.
You've had a tough day.
Now, you can just relax.
I'll be back in a sec.
Jane, what are you doing?
I thought we agreed about getting pregnant again.
I know, but does it have to happen tonight?
I don't believe this.
So you fall into this new job, and suddenly having a baby isn't important anymore?
Honey, I have doubts whether I want to have a child now.
- Or anytime soon.
- OK.
I'm going to bed.
Yeah, hang on!
- Good morning.
Are you Jake Hanson?
- Yeah.
- You own a '68 black Triumph?
- Yeah.
- Did you loan it out to anyone?
- Of course, he did.
Do I look like a motorcycle thief?
I've never seen this woman in my life.
Jake...
Yeah, OK.
Yeah, I loaned it to her.
I'm getting a ticket?
What am I getting a ticket for?
For allowing your bike to be operated by an unlicensed driver.
- Have a good day, Mr Hanson.
- How can I miss?
I haven't even brushed my teeth yet, I've already got a ticket.
- I used the spare house key.
- From under the plant outside?
You are out of control!
You were right about getting into the wind to clear your head.
- It was great.
- Next time, use a fan.
Jake, look, yesterday was a disaster.
You have a right to be angry at me.
- Thank you!
- I handled the bracelet thing terribly.
But it's mine, I swear to God it is.
That thing with Michael, I'm gonna clear it up today.
Most of all, I want things to be right between us.
I do.
I need friends, people who really care.
I think you do too.
To prove that I mean it, I'm gonna split that ticket with you.
- You.
You are an original.
- Been called worse than that.
- You owe me, big-time, lady.
- I can live with that.
For starters, you're taking me to dinner.
- I pick the place.
- Well...
Jake, that's an extraordinarily disgusting habit.
Sarah, what's going on?
I'm late for my lunch shift.
Matt, sit down, sit down.
They just upped the offer to $10,000, plus your job back,
- if we settle this out of court.
- Ten-thousand bucks?
- Yes!
We won!
- Well, see, not exactly.
I was thinking that if we take this thing to trial, we could be looking at 100 grand, minimum.
My instincts say we should go for it.
This is a clear case of discrimination, one that I think the state would like to make an example out of.
This kid came by the restaurant yesterday.
Reminded me why I started working at that shelter to begin with.
I can't help kids spending the next year in court.
So you're giving up, just like that?
No, we've won.
How much more money do I need to make my point?
Bottom line, 100 grand.
No.
No, bottom line, I miss my kids.
I was making a difference every day before this thing happened.
Nothing else matters more than that.
I wanna get back to doing it.
It's all decided then.
Ten thousand dollars and a resumption of employment.
- I just hope you're satisfied.
- Sarah, I'm ecstatic.
Hi.
You look a little out of it.
What did Dr Estren say?
Not to operate passenger jets until I'm off the pain pills.
Did he have to drill?
So deep I could hear people speaking Chinese.
It's interesting.
Your eyes look like marbles,
- but you sound almost normal.
- You were right.
Between the novocaine, the headphones and the gas, the pills, it was less painful than a New Kids concert.
I came home early for nothing.
Actually, I just got a pain.
Could you just grab me two pills?
Considering what a light beer does to you, I think you'll have one.
Too weak to argue.
Could you just turn on the tube for me, please?
Thank you.
I was wondering, could you grab a blanket?
- It's kind of chilly in here.
- One blanket, coming right up.
Oh, yeah, and could you just run down to the video place.
A couple of good movies, you know, would just help ease my pain.
Maybe you should recuperate at your parents' house.
I just got you through a broken heart.
This is all the thanks I get?
All right, just let me go change into my nurse's uniform.
So this is where the hip go after a Cuban-Chinese dinner?
Cutting edge.
Wait, you mean Jake Hanson hasn't heard of Private Pain?
Oh, I'm busted.
Well, this is it, the happening spot.
The sleaze and stars all under one roof.
You sure did find them.
Come on.
Yeah, I found them.
Now I'm gonna photograph them.
I need these photos for my portfolio.
You know, dark and moody.
Here.
- Let's hide this.
- Don't you do anything the easy way?
- Do you?
- You know, you really smell good.
- You just gotta have it, don't you?
- What?
Every woman has to fall all over you.
Oh, they don't have to, but they usually do.
- Hey, I didn't say it.
- God, you just...
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't look, don't look, don't look.
- The blonde!
- What?
The blonde getting out of the limo, I think it's Madonna.
That...
- God, smooth...
- Didn't work, did it?
Beth, when did you hit L. A?
Wrong lady.
I don't know you, pal.
- No, wait.
It's me, Jerry.
- I said wrong lady, all right?
- Beth, come on.
What are you doing?
- Hey.
Come on.
The lady said she doesn't know you.
Back off.
Sorry.
Jo?
Jo?
Jo!
Alison?
Alison?
Alison!
Alison.
Alison.
- Billy, what is it?
What can I do?
- The pain...
Let me help you make it better.
- How's that?
- I'm not sure.
Could you run it by me again?
Oh, Alison.
Oh, Alison...
Billy?
Billy?
Careful.
Alison!
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah, I mean...
I was...
We were...
Oh, it was just a disturbing dream.
Someone should've warned me.
Those pills have serious side effects.
Somebody shouldn't be popping them like candy.
- Good night, Billy.
- Good night, Alison.
Oh, no, no, no.
- What happened to you?
- I don't like fights.
- And who's Beth?
- I don't know, he was mistaken.
Look, it was dark in there, he was drunk...
The name on the bracelet happened to be a coincidence?
I don't care what the truth is.
I just want to hear it.
Why?
Because I owe it to you?
Because you deserve it?
- Because it keeps things simple.
- Simple?
Look, there is nothing simple about my life right now.
- Making faces at the toaster?
- Checking my teeth for lipstick.
It's early.
Go back to bed.
Well, come with me.
You didn't get home that many hours ago.
Work was a disaster yesterday.
And Kay called me on all of it.
God, she gets me so mad.
She is rude, vain, opinionated...
- The collective term is "bitch."
- But most of all, she is good, Michael.
And I just want her to know that I'm good too.
Well, that's not gonna happen, Jane.
Not with her breed.
She would rather donate a vital organ while she's still alive than admit that.
- And I don't want to see you hurt.
- Oh, sweetheart.
I can take care of myself.
You don't need this woman to tell you what you know.
I know.
Look, tomorrow is Sunday.
We will just spend the whole day together talking things out, and then we'll finish what we started two nights ago.
- I love you, Jane.
- I love you too.
- But right now I gotta run.
- Oh, of course, Kay's waiting.
- The fashion business sucks.
- It's a lot like medicine.
Bye, honey.
- Sleep OK?
- Yeah.
I feel like my brain's been cryogenically frozen for 50 years.
It's just beginning to thaw.
Oh, right.
Coffee.
Quite a dream you had last night.
The way you were clutching at that pillow and screaming for me.
- What exactly was happening?
- I can't remember.
Oh, come on, a dream like that?
Well, we were in the apartment, and it was just the two of us.
It was late, we were on the couch...
And then, out of the blue, a Tyrannosaurus rex pops its head into the window and snatches you out in its jaw.
A dinosaur...
What were you holding on to?
It's tail.
I was trying to get it to drop you.
- You were trying to save my life?
- Yeah, something like that.
So do you dream about me?
- No.
- Oh, come on, you do too.
I do not.
OK.
But it's nothing I can talk about.
You're not leaving this room until you tell me.
I am sorry, Billy.
But some things should be kept private.
Ten-thousand dollars?
I can't believe it!
So, what are you gonna do?
I know this amazing mutual fund my brother told me about.
That's what I'd put it in.
You could always buy some land, not in L. A...
Rhonda, slow down.
None of the above.
Well, don't tell me you're gonna blow it on a car.
- Nope.
I'm starting a legal aid fund.
- A legal aid fund?
For victims of discrimination based on sexual orientation.
Seriously?
You're not gonna keep any of it?
No.
Well, but then again, I made a killing at Bikini Burger.
Wow, well, it sounds like a great investment to me.
And, Suzanne, be sure the Bonnie Plaid jacket buttons are black, not some dark-blue beauties your brother-in-law got a deal on.
Mo, be precise on the neckline or a lot of customers will be arrested for boob exposure.
The new Kay Beacon collection:
Smart, flattering, perfect.
How did I know my brilliance wouldn't satisfy everyone?
- What's wrong, Jane?
- Nothing.
It's all very good.
- Very commercial.
- But we all have our off days, Jane.
Lord knows you'd understand that.
Maybe I overlooked some detail, a touch that your talented designer's eye has discovered...
Maybe.
So share your thoughts.
It isn't an invitation I extend often.
All right, the jacket buttons.
They should be bigger.
- And the skirt needs a belt.
- That's it?
Bigger buttons are heavier.
When the jacket's worn open, they'll sag.
The result?
Unhappy, sloppy-looking customer.
Sorry.
You were absent when they covered buttons at the Institut du Chic.
If becoming a successful designer means turning into a rude, egomaniacal bitch like yourself, I must be in the wrong business.
May I see you in my office, please?
You're right.
I am thoughtless and insensitive.
And I can be a bitch.
But I think you're talented.
And I'd hate to see you leave.
If you could get through the first week, you can probably last two.
- Who knows, maybe a month.
- God help me.
- Excuse me.
- Somebody sign for that!
- No.
This is my husband, Michael.
- How do you do?
- Sorry.
- It's OK.
Good looking and a doctor.
I guess your mother sleeps like a log, Jane.
Did you come to peek at the torture chamber?
No, actually, I brought Jane lunch.
You do allow lunch?
A full 30 minutes, even on weekends.
There's a perfect place right upstairs on the roof.
- Honey, this is such a sweet surprise.
- I couldn't wait until tomorrow.
You know, sweetie.
This new job of yours has pushed buttons I didn't know I had.
What you said about forgetting your career when you got pregnant was true.
- But I was a willing participant.
- But you deserve this shot.
You've earned it, and I want you to know I'm behind you all the way.
Thank you, honey.
So, what about us?
We both want a baby, Michael.
I'm just asking to delay it.
See, I have a basic career question to answer, and this is the perfect time and place to do it.
But we are partners, so I have to ask if that's OK with you.
I love you too much to say no.
Haven't you got things confused?
I'm not the kind of guy that you have to run away from.
I'm not running from you.
Look, I don't care about your deep dark secrets, or your phony name, or your locks on the door, the bracelet...
I care about you.
Why?
I haven't given you much reason to.
Wrong.
No.
Underneath, you're dying...
You're desperate to have someone care about you.
I'm not gonna hurt you, and I don't want anything from you.
You just make me feel good.
I want to be around you.
I want you to trust me.
Please, trust me?
Look, all of my life has felt like an escaping of something.
When I was seven years old, my mother died.
Suicide.
I won't bore you with the details.
And my father didn't waste any time remarrying.
When I got to college,
I met my husband, Charles Reynolds.
Disgustingly wealthy, handsome.
From one of those Mayflower families.
It was perfect.
I always imagined myself as Cinderella, and my prince had finally come.
- What happened?
- Well, it was pretty good for awhile.
I dropped out of school.
Photography just seemed like a silly hobby.
And I was spending so much time trying to be a socialite for him.
I just started to see myself fade away.
And I knew I had to get out, right then, so I did.
I just left.
No note, no goodbyes, no nothing.
He doesn't know where you are?
No.
All I wanted was just to start living my life.
You know, my life.
- Still wondering about that bracelet?
- Yeah, who's Beth?
Jo Beth is my full name.
My mother called me Jo.
And when she died, I didn't want anyone else calling me that.
But it's really who I am.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for all the lies.
I just...
I don't know when to stop running.
See?
I told you we were alike.
I know a way.
in the future,my son will lead mankind in a war against skynet, the computer system programmed to destroy the world.
It has sent machines back through time.
Some to kill him.
One to protect him.
Today we fight to stop skynet from ever being created.
To change our future.
To change his fate.
The war to save mankind begins now.
The Sarah Connor Chronicles Season01 Episode05
Previously on terminator:
The sarah connor chronicles... cromartie is here.
Are you forgetting that I blew his head off?
He came through.
He knows we're here.
It's just a head.
we're programmed to repair ourselves.
We're programmed to blend in.
there are other people here.
resistance fighters.
humans sent back from the future by john.
Who have money and guns.
jumper outside the gym!
It's my new friend.
The crying one om the bathroom.
- We gotta help her now!
- No.
I need you to look at these photographs.
Tell me if you recognize anybody.
The young one.
His name is andrew goode.
He was an intern at cyberdyne one summer.
Do you want to have dinner with me tonight?
My turk plays chess at at level that could defeat every human player that's ever lived, and probably ever will live.
you talk about it like it's human.
Well,you never know.
andy goode must be killed.
of all the training my son received in the jungles of central america, nothing prepared him better for combat than the game of chess.
It taught him almost everything he needed to know about war.
That to win you must be patient, bold,calculating,
and most of all... willing to sacrifice.
Andy,haven't heard from you in a while.
sorry I've been out of touch.
But after the fire in my house... how can I explain?
It was kind of a blessing.
Can you meet me?
Where are you?
A hotel in pasadena.
I'm checking into a tournament.
a tournament?
Yeah,you know,chess.
Charley dixon?
Agent kester,fbi.
I need to ask you a few questions.
What is this about?
Sarah connor.
Come in.
Are you really good at math?
Yes.
You wanna do mine?
Yes.
We got a problem.
Andy goode rebuilt his chess computer.
The turk.
But you napalmed it.
Apparently he spent every minute since then in a coffee shop in van nuys rewriting the code from memory.
A good code is like a good song in your head.
It's gotta come out.
Yeah,well,the song might just blow up the world.
You should have killed him when you had the chance.
And I'm surprised it's taken you this long to bring that up.
I'm busy doing john's homework.
Andy entered it into a tournament.
Computer versus human?
Computer versus computer.
It's the new thing.
These programs are too smart and powerful to play people anymore.
It gets better the more we talk about it.
You're going to school.
You and tin miss can meet me there later.
Mom,it's chess; you don't know anything.
I know a bit about andy.
Besides,you can't be absent.
Absent gets you on the radar.
Okay,I get it.
You go.
Can I have some money for lunch?
isn't this awesome?
God,I love robots.
Come here.
so is this one better or worse?
Well,it's different,really.
More adaptable,but less predictable.
Not as powerful for now,but quicker on its feet.
It has a hunger for learning,but sometimes the lessons it learns-- sounds more human.
Well,if you want an analogy,I'd say that turk i had grown into a brooding teenager, and turk ii is still more of a precocious child.
Ah,speaking of brooding and precocious,this is my partner,dmitri shipkov.
I built the turk,but dmitri taught it to play chess.
She'll never sleep with you.
Da,poka.
- You should plug that in.
- Yep.
Don't listen to him.
He's--he's just worked up about the military contract.
We have a deal to split the money.
What military contract?
Well,the one the winner gets.
Why don't you people get your story straight?
Is she dead or isn't she?
Sarah connor survived the explosion in the bank vault.
And so did her son.
Yeah,that was eight years ago.
You guys just figured that out?
Yes.
Yes?
Yes,what?
Yes,we just figured that out.
babe,who was that at the door?
Good morning,ma'am.
He's from the fbi.
I'm asking a few questions.
- Charley,is something wrong?
- No.
I'm looking for the connors.
Sarah connor?
Your ex?
- I'm looking for them here.
- Here?
Mr. Dixon wanted to marry sarah connor before you.
She's alive.
Maybe he's hiding her here.
What?
I already told you,no.
No,okay?
Look,all due *********** the woman that i knew,sarah reese, she blew herself up in a bank eight years ago.
I never knew,and I do not know sarah connor.
If you see or hear anything,call me.
Any time,I never sleep.
Just a reminder,grief counseling will be available in my office throughout the week.
What are they doing?
They're writing notes.
For jordan.
She's dead.
Yeah,I remember watching her fall.
Me too.
How will she get the notes?
She won'T.
But you said-- sometimes things happen and they're so bad,
people just don't know how to deal with their sadness.
So they write it in a note.
But I thought people cried when they were sad.
Sometimes it's not enough.
Are you gonna...
I didn't really know her.
I didn't either.
I like the note part.
Can I get the diagnostic unit?
We're using it
You're kinda hogging it
You gonna make this into a thing?
If you guys are gonna stand around and bitch at each other,I'll take it
Nice accent,white boy.
I have no idea what's with those guys.
They're always messg with me.
Yeah,man,I've no idea.
- I'm morris.
- John.
Hey,uh,I saw you talking to cheryl weston this morning.
Maybe no one told you cause you're new but she's damaged goods.
She's my chem partner.
Do you know her or something?
No one knows her.
Something crazy went on at the last school she was in,but no one knows what it is.
Her dad's got her locked down tight.
It's a **
It's truth.
Not much of it.
I'm just looking out for you,bro.
Yeah,you and everyone else.
An extremely close match between the american and japanese computers here in the finals.
The americans,led by programmer andrew goode,have a slight positional advantage.
The japanese seize control of the center with bishop to c5.
Do you know how many grand masters are here?
How's andy doing?
Well,that depends on what your plans are for andy.
On the one hand,he's in the final round,on the other hand... the winner gets a military contract.
Military?
Are you serious?
What do we do?
Cheer very hard for the japanese or cameron will kill him.
an unorthodox move by the japanese,leaving their queen hanging on d6 square.
The american computer calculating a response.
What just happened?
That bishop on c5 totally hammered him.
Black's in total zugswang.
Translation?
The japanese just lost theiqueen.
They're in big trouble.
Andy's gonna win.
So that was quite a speech earlier.
With the agent.
That wasn't a speech,it's was just... just what it was.
What it was,was a lie.
What?
A lie.
You have a tell.
a what?
A tell?
Yeah,a tell.
When you lie.
Do you know why you love me,charley?
I'm gonna tell you why you love me.
It's cause I'm not that girl.
I'm not that jealous girl.
I'm not that insecure girl.
I'm not that petty girl.
Of course not.
Yeah,so just don't make me into that girl by lying to me.
If that woman is alive,if you've seen her... this is important.
I saw john.
What?
Where?
Here.
In our house.
In our house?
In our house?
What did he want?
I don't know.
I think he just wanted to see me.
What are you gonna do about it?
I don't know.
They're fugitives,charlie.
They're dangerous people.
Sarah's not dangerous.
Oh well,maybe not the sarah you knew.
Sarah reese,but sarah connor killed a man.
We don't know that.
Well,what do we know?
What do you know?
The japanese desperately hoping for counterplay after the disastrous loss of their queen.
Victory appears imminent for the americans.
Andy goode's turk seized control of the match in the middle game, and now appears just moves away from winning.
Rook to c2.
Checkmate.
A shocking turn of events.
The japanese team has won the tournament.
It's over.
Andy lost.
But the other team... they didn't lose their queen,they sacrificed it.
Just like byrne-fischer all over again.
Byrne-fischer,1956?
Never mind.
The point is... the turk fell for a trap?
It's like it just... choked.
So now,what?
We go after them now?
No,their names weren't in the safe house.
Andy's was.
- What computational error?
you put the bishop on e6 to begin with!
- You asked me to teach it chess-
- I taught it chess.
I can't help it if it's stupid!
Nobody's gonna want andy's program now.
That thing's kind of crazy.
He could still be a threat.
It could still become skynet.
It could also become pong.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Maybe I'll just sit andy down and tell him everything.
Andy.
Who are you?
Put your hands above your head!
Do it now!
Turn!
Turn!
Spread 'em!
Put your hands behind your back.
Over here.
I'm so sorry,andy.
What's this?
You should write andy a note if you can't cry.
Doesn't bother you that he's dead,does it?
The world is safer without him.
that was way too easy.
L.A.P.D.Firewalls really blow.
Show me what you found.
Okay.
No name,but he's got this tattoo on his arm.
He's one of them.
That's a tattoo from a skynet work camp.
He's a resistance fighter.
From the future.
Like the three guys in the safe house?
He was the fourth.
Then you know him.
- In the future.
- So do you.
He's one of your best soldiers.
They've been watching andy goode.
Doing surveillance.
Same as us.
Well,not exactly the same.
He actually killed the guy.
That was not his mission.
You sent him here to wait for us.
Well,then I guess he changed his mind.
A lot.
I have to talk to him.
Talk to him?
How?
He's in lockdown.
Freeze.
What are you doing?
Math.
I already did your homework.
Yeah,I know,but I still have to take the test.
I need to know this stuff.
Then why did you ask me to do it?
Because maybe it's kind of hard to concentrate on geometry when people keep dying around you.
You have no idea what I'm talking about,do you?
You're grieving.
Grieving?
How do you know what grieving is?
I read all the notes.
Cameron baum,mr.
Harris wants to see you.
I know this is difficult for you to talk about, so I'm gonna need you to be strong.
Okay?
Can you do that for me?
Yes.
I can be strong.
People say you were the last person to speak with jordan before she... died.
Is that true?
I don't know.
Are you asking me if people say I was the last person to talk to jordan, or are you asking me if I was the last one to talk to her?
I guess I'm asking if you were.
I don't know.
What did she say when you did talk to her?
I mean,was it something upsetting for you to hr?
She said,"you saw it,right?
Right?
You saw it?
It's so freakin' big and right out there."
She was talking about the graffiti?
It's freakin' big.
Yes.
Yes,it is.
- And no.
- No?
No,it wasn't upsetting for me to hear it.
Did jordan mention any names?
Any specific people that she was upset with?
Her parents.
Anyone else?
The hall monitors.
Anyone else?
You ask that question a lot.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
I don't think I told you anything.
Oh,okay.
Can I go now?
I'm done with grief counseling,and I feel much better.
Yeah,please.
Go.
Yo,john doe,you got a visitor.
Those hurt?
Sometimes they crank those tight before they bring you in here.
That way,you might ask me to loosen them up.
And I am able to accommodate you in that.
It's a trick they do.
It gives us a connection.
But we already got a connection.
Your prints are everywhere.
Oven,light switch,toilet.
Safe.
Wasn't us who found it.
But somebody did.
After the police thought they cleared the scene, somebody came back and emptied the safe right quick.
Didn't force it either.
They knew the combination.
So we've got you running from the scene of andrew goode's murder.
And we've got you living at,and disappearing from, and most likely returning to the scene of these three murders.
All of which would be a prosecutorial bounty.
But I've also got forensic evidence, linking this to this
and this.
Feeling connected yet?
What is it?
The forensic evidence linking all these people-- what is it?
Blood.
Not my blood.
No,not your blood.
And,technically,not even blood.
Some kind of synthetic.
Come on,man,help me out.
Tell me something I don't know.
We're all gonna die.
Yeah,I want him out of local custody today.
He has more to say and I want him on federal turf when he says it.
yes,this is cameron's mother.
ms.
Baum,you're aware of the recent tragedy we've had here at school?
- Jordan somebody.
- Tallen.
When I spoke to cameron about it,she seemed strangely unaffected.
I'm sure you're doing all you can as a parent.
It's been overwhelming for all of us,first with the tornado,then the move.
Tornado?
I'm sorry,she didn't ******** that might explain what I think might be classic post-traumatic stress.
You're gonna have to speak up.
You shouldn't be here.
I know who you are.
And I know who you are.
Who else but sarah connor would have burned down that poor kid's house?
It was you,wasn't it?
On andy's porch that night.
You've been watching.
You wanted to kill him,the poor kid,and you did.
I didn't do it.
All I wanted was the turk.
Somebody else killed him and took the machine.
What?
He was dead when I got there.
He was dead and the turk was gone,and I hoped you'd done it.
You thought I killed him?
But you're here.
And the turk is out there.
So we both failed.
You gotta get out of here.
If you haven't figured it out,I have a t-888 on my ass.
Now if you found me,it will too.
- We should get you out.
- Go.
Find the partner,the russian.
He's gotta be neck-deep in this also.
- You're dead in here.
- Go!
Please.
I won't be the bastard who brings metal down on the connors,so just go.
You're-- you're prettier than your picture.
Picture?
Yeah,it's actually how I clocked you.
My brother carried your snap for luck.
Who's your brother?
What does it matter?
You don't know the reese boys,and you never will.
Reese boys?
Derek reese.
Brother's kyle.
when john sent kyle reese back to protect me,we had two days together.
He told me about the future,about the apocalypse, and the terror of a world run by machines.
Kyle reese saved my life.
He gave me a son.
He never told me that he had a brother.
He never told me we would have mily.
That in our grief we are not alone.
Cheri.
Cheri.
Walk away.
John,please.
Lock and key,bro.Lock and k mom's here.
I'm morris.
Your brother's new best friend.
Cameron.
Nice grip.
Watch yourself.
Just lookin' out for ya.
Field trip.
I call shotgun.
I call 9-millimeter.
What's the E.T.A.On my prisoner?
All right.
- Drop it.Now.
- Easy.Easy.
Run.
You stay close.
Take the jeep and follow us.
You metal bitch.
She's on our side.
****** Lose him.
Let's go.
- Where's cameron?
- Leave her,let's go.
Let's go.
Stay back
Get down
Bring me the toolbox.
Switchblade.
Pliers.
Do something.
We have to help him.
Don't let that thing touch me.
- We have to stop your bleeding.
- Get away from me.
Please don't move.
You're increasing your blood loss.
I can't fix it.
You took a bullet out of me.
He has internal damage.
He needs medical attention,or he's gonna die.
A stun gun.
Are you nuts?
He needs a doctor.
What,so you're just gonna go out and kidnap one?
There's an E.R.A mile away.
It's almost dark.
Mom,this is crazy,all right.
Even for you,it's insane.
Well,we have to save him.
And what happens when you get caught?
Then what?
I said we have to save him.
You don't even know who this guy is.
He's your uncle.
He doesn't know.
He's your father's brother.
His name's derek reese.
John.
Two females,approximately 5'6",120 pounds, overpower you and your partner, ambush your secure vehicle,and kidnap my prisoner.
That an accurate summation of what happened out here today,officer?
Yeah.
5'6".
5'6".
if there is a flaw in chess as a game of war,it is this:
Unlike war,the rules of chess are constant.
The pieces unchangeable.
You will never win the heart of a rook or the mind of a knight.
They are deaf to your arguments.
And so be it.
The goal of a chess game is total annihilation.
But,in war,even as the blood beats in your ears and you race after your enemy, there is the hope that saner minds than yours will stop you before you reach your target.
In war,unlike chess,rules can be changed.
Truces can be called.
The greatest of enemies can become the best of friends.
Derek.
Derek.
He's not breathing.
Reese!
Reese!
In war,there is hope.
Did you give your friend back his stuff?
Oh, yeah.
He wasn't there, so I left it in his room.
How'd you get in if he wasn't there?
His roommate let me in.
What kind of question is that?
I thought you broke in or something.
I don't know.
Now, don't worry about this tablecloth.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Oh, that is really nice.
Don't be nervous.
She's the one who's supposed to be nervous.
Yeah, well, if her family just wasn't so rich.
She's not marrying Matt for his money.
That's good, because if she is, she's in for a terrible surprise.
Matt was saying that he didn't think she'd ever seen artificial fabric... before she went to college.
- Oh.
This is so nice.
I wish somebody had gone to all this trouble for me when I was getting married.
- Give me the glasses.
- I got 'em.
You smell like alcohol.
Take the back way, go up the stairs to the shower... run it hot until it's all gone and you've sweated the liquor out.
Well, if I'm such a screwup that I can't even go in the front door of my own house...
You want to go in the front door, Tim?
You go ahead.
Go in the front door and go hug your mother.
Is that what you want to do?
Then why don't you do it?
- I said I was sorry.
- I'm tired of you being sorry, Tim.
I am worn out with sorry.
Instead of being so damn sorry all the time, you might just try a little discipline.
Phil, is that you?
Tim?
- You're late.
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, good.
You remembered the glasses.
And the shrimp.
Aren't you good.
Yeah.
I thought we weren't gonna make a big deal of this.
- Matt said that we shouldn't make a big deal of things.
- What?
Oh.
Phil, a tablecloth isn't a big deal.
A tablecloth is a tablecloth.
Where's Tim?
- Upstairs.
He's, uh...
- What?
Nothing.
Uh...
The toilet had a thing today.
Somebody stuffed it with little creamer packages.
I could have brought you a tablecloth from the restaurant.
For this size table?
What are you talking about, Phil?
Come on.
Allison is used to nice things.
Did you have to call the plumber?
For what?
- For the toilet.
- Oh.
No.
No, uh...
Tim got it.
He just kept at it.
See?
I don't know why you worry about him so much.
- Hey, there she is!
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!
- Mom?
- In the kitchen.
Thank you.
We almost did find a tenant, but he got arrested two days before he moved in.
So I guess it turned out to be a good thing.
Except that we turned down a really nice couple.
Karen, uh, cut the celery in half before you slice it.
- What?
- In half.
Here.
Like this.
Oh.
Okay.
Anyway, this nice couple would have been great... except they tried to bargain with us, which irritated Tom.
I would have tried to bargain too.
You never know.
It doesn't hurt to ask.
Considering we don't get free rent unless the whole place is full... we can't really afford to hold a grudge.
Anyway, when we called them back, they'd already found...
What do you think?
Should I put these out now, or should I wait until Matt and Allison get here?
- Uh, whatever.
- Hmm.
Having children is an economic thing too, though.
You have to plan for it.
And have some kind of savings.
I've always thought that if you've got the love, then everything else...
Lisa quit teaching school the moment Karen was born.
It was a decision we were prepared to make... because we had worked and saved for it.
That's what you have to do.
Right.
Right.
So...
- Is this it?
- Yes.
This is it.
This is it.
Wow.
- You've seen the pond where I twisted my ankle.
Right?
- Yeah.
You've seen the church where I was confirmed.
Right?
My dad's restaurant.
Now, this is the high school... where I became an intellectual giant.
- Come on.
- Matt...
Come on.
This is the romantic part.
This is where it all began.
Where I wrote my first published work for the Viking Ledger.
Won my first debate in interscholastic competition.
And I scored so well on my National Merit Test... that I got a scholarship to Yale... and met Allison Hall, the girl I'm gonna marry.
The woman you're going to marry.
- That's a 10.
- Ten, 11, 12, 13.
- That's a double.
- Whoa.
- That's 26.
- I'm still winning.
- Twenty-six.
- What have I got here?
Tim, save some of those for Matt and Allison.
- All right.
It's my turn.
- Gross.
- Shoot.
- Where are they?
- They're here.
They just drove up.
- Oh, but I'm winning.
- Of course you are.
- You've got both blanks, two S's, the J
- Oh, pout.
You haven't opened up the game once.
That's why you're winning.
- You're a leech.
- Is the Q' still out?
- Don't look at my letters.
We're finishing this after dinner.
Here you are!
Traffic is murder from New Haven.
- Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.
Allison, please call me Phil.
Come in.
You must be starving.
- Hi.
- Traffic was terrible.
- I'm so glad you're home.
- Traffic's tough.
- It is.
- Get out of here.
Mmm, something smells good.
This is something else.
- Here's a picture of me and Allison.
- Whoa.
- Sorry.
- Watch it, Dad.
Gonna poke somebody's eye out.
Here's a picture of yours truly and his bride-to-be... on the most amazing yacht you have ever seen.
- Look at that.
- Oh.
That's incredible.
- Look at that.
Wow.
This belongs to your father?
Well, yeah, but we never really use it.
It belongs to his business.
If we want to take it out, we have to pay to, unless it's a company thing.
Look at it.
Great paint job.
Dear God, we are thankful today to be here as a family.
We thank you for this food and the work you have given us to provide it.
We especially thank you for bringing Allison into our family.
We pray that you will bless Matt and Allison and their marriage...
- as you have blessed us.
This we humbly ask in your name.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Well, here's to Allison and Matt.
Cheers.
The church was built in 1852.
It's incredible.
And the chapel was named after one of Allison's relatives.
Oh, no.
It's a distant relative.
And by marriage.
My family really isn't involved with the chur...
You won't believe who's being invited to the wedding.
The Kennedys.
The Pattersons.
Diane Sawyer.
The Kennedys.
Wait.
Will you stop it?
You know what?
We don't know them.
I mean, my dad does business with them, or he raised money for them.
- I don't even know which.
- Karen campaigned for one of the Kennedys.
- Who was it?
- Joseph Kennedy.
Of course, we didn't know them either
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Well, we could have.
We have a restaurant.
That's where all those congressmen seem to spend their time.
Speaking of restaurants, Andy is driving me nuts about your bachelor party.
I think he's taking this best man thing too seriously.
He even called me the other day when I was teaching class.
I didn't see Kyle's name on the invitation list.
What happened to Kyle?
Are we through?
Anyone want seconds?
- I'll have some pie.
- Is Kyle coming?
- He's transferring to Duke.
- Not until the fall, is he?
- Oh, no.
- What?
What's the matter?
- I forgot to get the sherbet for tonight.
- Sherbet with pie?
No, you.
It...
It's for the punch.
It goes in the punch.
Your mother likes it.
- Uh, Matt, honey...
- Want me to get it?
I'll get it.
No problem.
- I'll go with you.
- No, let my family entertain you for a couple of minutes.
- I've got money, Mom.
- Well, I, um...
No, really.
It's really close.
I'll be right back.
- What kind, Mom?
- A half gallon oflime sherbet.
- Try not to miss me too much.
All right?
- Okay.
So when's everyone coming?
- Soon.
- Thanks, son.
So, uh, Andy's gonna be the best man.
It's definite.
I told you that.
I think it's something... something I would probably remember.
Lisa?
- Lisa?
- Yeah.
Why don't we save the pie for when everyone is here?
All right.
Over here.
The youngest pictures are at the bottom... and then work their way up to as close to the present as we can be.
We moved around a lot when the children were young.
I guess if we had anything to do over... we would have stayed in one place... or at least settled down a little sooner.
Still, wherever we went, there was always a room...
- except Korea.
There was always a room like this one... and after we got everything moved in... we'd all come in and take a place on the wall... and just start putting everything back up again.
I think it gave them continuity.
Yeah, no doubt about it.
We've always tried to find ways to strengthen our identity as a family.
- I promise this will be over soon.
- It's perfectly fine.
Uh, Karen.
By the way, thanks a lot for telling Tim about Andy.
I thought you had told him.
Do you hate me now?
- Yep.
- Matt.
You're awful.
- Almost there.
- Are you going to West Point, Timmy?
No, I don't think so, Granny.
I'm too old for West Point now.
Your father will be so happy.
- I'll go then.
- What time is it?
Phil.
Gene.
Come on.
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- Judy?
Cindy.
I can't decide whether this is one of the benefits or the shortcomings... having a professional photographer for a son-in-law.
I wasn't aware there were any shortcomings.
Cindy, come on.
- How are you, Mom?
- Oh, uh, Uncle Gene.
This is our first picture with Allison, so try not to make any noises with your body.
- Thank you very much.
Phil, smile.
Please, look like you're having a good time.
Okay, everybody.
All right.
Ready?
- Set.
- Is it set?
- Go.
- All right, everybody.
Think love.
- There we go.
That was good.
- It's a math problem.
- Oh.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm kind of scary-looking in the morning.
Uh, you mind if I play through?
- They're waiting on me downstairs.
- Oh, sure.
Thanks.
- Whoa.
The hair fairies came and danced on my head last night.
Um, what is this about a math problem?
Oh, well... it's either a math problem or a history question... or a geography something or other.
You're kidding.
I was the first man elected to the presidency of the United States... who was born under the American flag.
Martin Van Buren.
Who does this?
- Dad.
- Still?
He's done it ever since we were little kids.
You know, math problem.
Something he likes to call vocabulary builders.
He has a lot of time on his hands.
It's funny, actually, if we get the answer right.
Yeah?
What if you don't get the answer right?
Well, it's still funny... but for entirely different reasons.
Come on, Miss Grable.!
Well, at least it was better than one of our family parties.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My family almost never gets together without a lawyer.
Yea.!
Way to go.!
- He's so funny.
- Yeah, I spend all my time here laughing.
- He doesn't like me much.
- Really?
Well, I married his daughter and kept her from becoming a great novelist.
Oh, well, that was mean of you.
The whole concept of art photography... is not something Phil appreciates, you know.
Wedding photos, no problem.
He likes wedding photos, but the whole idea that somebody might... spend a lot of money on expensive equipment... you know, turn their apartment into a studio... that's very challenging for him.
- Aaah.
No fair, no fair, wounding an older man.
Ha-ha-ha!
- Is Tim in school, or is hejust...
- No, he flunked out.
- Really.
- He seems pretty smart.
- He is.
He also looks a little hung over, doesn't he?
Oops.
You know Tim used to be R.O.T.C.?
Yeah, Matt said he wanted to go to West Point.
I'm not sure about that.
I think Phil wanted him to go to West Point.
Tim just wanted to do whatever Phil wanted.
But I think he didn't end up having the grades... or, um, the captain didn't have the connections or something.
But you're right though.
Tim is...
Tim is pretty smart.
- There you go.
Nice.!
Come on, Tim!
I'd love to see some of these pictures on the wall.
You've seen the wall?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What, um...
What was Matt supposed to be?
Matt?
Well, given the way Karen and Tim have turned out... it doesn't really matter much what Matt does.
Really?
No.
See, hejust has to be perfect.
And, um, if he isn't perfect... just keep it to yourself, because I don't think anybody in this family wants to know.
- Come on.!
- Yes!
All right.
40-love.
Set point.
Come on, Tim.
Set point.
Come on.
This is set point.
Right?
Set point?
Yes, this is set point.
Out.
Wait, wait, wait.
Okay.
Come on, Karen.
We're waitin'.
In.!
Yes.!
- Yea!
- Good game.
Uhh!
- Ow.!
- What the hell's the matter with you?
What do you want?
I couldn't get it.
I would never have made that shot.
What are you hitting me for?
I'm not hitting you because you missed the shot.
I am hitting you because you didn't try.
Good game, Karen.
Good game.
Good game, Matt.
Say something to him.
Gotta let 'em win every now and then... or they get discouraged.
Of course.
Hi, honey.
- Come here.
- You played so well, your father let you win.
- Isn't he nice?
- Tim, you all right?
- I'm not playing anymore.
This is it.
- Hey, look, it's...
- Leave me alone.
All right?
All I did is ask you, Tim.
- I said leave me alone.
Okay?
Leave me alone!
- Okay, fine.
Three months of driver ed.
One month with a simulator.
One month of behind-the-wheel practice with an instructor.
And the day you get your license... with absolutely no training whatsoever... you can crawl into the backseat... and congratulations, you're a parent.
What do you think that says about our society?
Now he's started, No one knows how to be a good parent.
This isn't about the back seat of cars?
I can't stand this.
The most important part of parenting...
Well, not the most important part.
I guess, reasonably, you can't break it down that way.
- It's preparation.
It's key.
Key!
- Hey, look.!
It's the Carters, and they're taking their women out for a walk!
- Hey, Tom.
Hey.
- How ya doin', Andy?
How are you, young man?
- Hey, Andy.
How ya doin'?
- This is Allison Hall.
- I'm Andy Paulson.
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Matt told me all about you.
- Just remember...
Matt is jealous because I'm more popular than he is, and he can't stand it.
Hey.
I've got to get to work.
I'll see you later, Andy.
- See you later, Captain.
- We're coming, Dad.
- Yeah.
- So, Andy, what are you doing today?
- I'm going with you guys.
- Oh, no!
Hey, Tom!
Put your wife on a leash!
You guys played a good game.
You looked like professionals out there.
Give me a hand in the car here, Matt.
I got some stuff.
Sure thing.
I just, uh...
I wanted to tell you how much your mother and I like Allison.
I knew you would, Dad.
There's a couple of things I want to ask you.
- Okay.
- But, uh...
You know, I, uh...
- I don't want to pry.
- All right.
All right.
What I want to know here is if you are really and truly committed to Allison.
- For better, for worse and all that?
- Yes, I'm completely committed.
And you know what you're doing?
- Did you?
I mean...
Well...
Sometimes, uh, we feel like we're...
locked into something that we can't back out of.
It's like the French in World War I.
- You know that story.
- The Guns of August.
I read that in my eighth-grade summer.
Yeah, well, that was a disaster.
So, you really and truly love this girl.
Yep.
I do.
Well, that's all that matters.
Well, I appreciate your asking, Dad.
All right.
Take this to the basement for me, will you?
Yes, sir.
What?
So, a bachelor party, huh?
What can happen?
It's gonna be in the back room of my dad's restaurant.
- What?
I don't know.
Just something about being here and seeing you with your family... and all these things that you grew up with.
Mmm.
I'm sorry.
This is making you uncomfortable, isn't it?
What?
Well, I'm being a little too pushy.
I'm sorry.
Oh, that's okay.
You don't have to be sorry.
Later.
We're supposed to be on vacation.
We're not on vacation.
We're visiting my parents.
Do you have any idea how tense you are?
Yeah, it's all that talk about raising children.
It makes me nuts.
Why?
Tom.
Karen.
We can't afford it.
We can't afford two of us, much less three of us.
I could work part-time somewhere.
That is my parents talking.
- Why should you work five million hours a week...
- No, listen, Tom.
I'm not ready to have a child.
You are not ready to have a child.
By the time you think we're ready...
Do you realize what my parents would say if I were to get pregnant now?
You know how Daddy is about planning and preparation.
And the money.
Surprise, surprise.
I didn't marry your daddy.
I married you.
It's our decision.
If they don't like it, they can just take a cruise till our kids are through college.
I'm trying to imagine Daddy on a cruise.
A long, long, long, long...
- Tom!
- Long, long...
Hey, Nick, old buddy.
Have a nice couple days off?
Yeah, went out with my folks on the boat.
- You ready for Matt's party tomorrow?
- Yep.
Pass me a Cape Codder over there, would you?
Is there a problem of some kind?
Look, I can't.
You can't?
What do you mean?
You should talk about it with your dad.
Okay?
You're saying my father told you I can't...
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I've been looking over the books here... and, you know, uh, there's $200 missing from petty cash.
- Oh.
I borrowed it.
- What for?
- Excuse me?
- What would you like me to list it as?
- Oh.
- Blackmail?
Extortion?
Hush money?
What?
- Blackmail?
- Six months ago...
I noticed the day after the health inspector came... you borrowed $150 from petty cash... and you listed it as cleanup expenses.
- We can list it as that.
- What's the point of this?
I'll tell you what the point is.
I'm tired of pretending, you know, that you're the great dispenser... of orders and values and goodness... and I'm some kind of criminal because I want a drink in the afternoon.
Fine.
I'm only doing this because I give up on you.
Nick?
Make the kid a drink if he wants a drink, and write it off to inventory.
I'm sorry.
I should have told him myself.
All right?
There.
Are you satisfied?
Oh, yeah.
I'm really satisfied.
- You've made my life worth living.
- Oh, for God sakes.
You know, I resent...
I really resent the way you look down on me.
I try.
I'm here.
I'm doing something.
It's not like you're so much better than me.
It's not like you're perfect.
And if I want a drink in the afternoon right now... then I think I should have it.
I don't have to explain it to you.
I'm through explaining things to you!
I've done my time on Maple Drive.
Okay?
So I flunked out of school.
So what?
Why couldn't we have just told Mom I flunked out of school?
Huh?
I didn't kill anyone.
I had a bad time.
So what?
Why can't we tell her and just move on?
Why?
What's gonna happen?
What's gonna happen if we just sit down and say it out loud, Dad?
Look...
If I have to live this way...
I think I deserve a drink now and then.
If I want it.
Okay?
I think it's what I deserve.
Why do you do it here?
Why don't you do it somewhere else?
Why do you force me to watch it?
Because I think it's what you deserve.
What I deserve?
I think you should know, Tim... the last few days, every time I have seen you... every time I have looked at you... the only response I have had is to thank God I have another son.
You have all the advantages.
That doesn't work for me.
I look at you, and there isn't anyone else.
You're the only father I've got.
Which one of us is worse off?
I wonder.
If music be the food oflove... play on.
Give me excess of it... that, surfeiting... the appetite may sicken, and so die.
- One more time.
- No, no!
Come on!
It's the fourth time we've watched it.
- This guy's my hero.
- This is brilliant.
- One more time.
- Oh, come on, you guys.
No.
No.
This is the fourth time.
- Put on me.
Get to me.
- I'm tired of watching that guy.
Oh, that's great.
Just what I want to do, watch you.
Okay, here it is.
Here it is.
Hold on, now.
Oh, hello.
Hello.
- I'm Andrew Paulson...
- Geek.
And as president of this class, and therefore the most important senior on this entire tape... and also as an example to my peers...
I am pleased to admit that I am going to spend my entire future...
- groveling for money as a sleazy advertising executive!
- Yeah!
- I want to say hello to Julie... and good luck to Kyle and Matt when they get to Yale... and thank you, Mr. Edwards, for putting up with us this entire year.
And a hearty congratulations to Sylvester Stallone on Rocky IV.!
Yeah!
Rocky!
Yeah!
I swear, you can't believe...
They took, like, three weeks telling us... how serious and sincere and honest we had to be... for this video thing, and...
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait.
- Wait.
Just let me see this person.
- Wait?
Push 'em back!
Okay.
Um, my name's Kyle Trainer, and, uh, I'm trying not to smile.
That's the guy from the picture on your wall.
I was on the staff of the school paper and on the debate team... and Matt Carter and I went to State, and we came in third place.
Did that sound memorized?
Okay.
Anyway, here it is.
Thor is graduating, and I've enjoyed drawing him these past two years... even though Mr. Carlson hasn't always liked what he had to say.
- Hope he made you laugh.
- Obviously, Kyle was paying attention during study hall... because this looks very, very sincere to me.
It's been the best time of my life so far... and I'm gonna miss it and all my friends.
That's it.
He goes to Yale?
He was.
He's, uh, transferring.
Really?
Why?
How should I know?
I haven't seen him in months.
Have you?
I haven't seen him since high school, except when he was with you.
- All right.
We gotta go.
- No, you're not leaving yet.
- Yes, we have to.
- Oh, what time you have to leave tomorrow?
Oh, fairly early.
I promised my parents I'd be on the Vineyard by tomorrow night.
On the Vineyard.
Did you hear that?
The Vineyard.
Ooh.
The Vineyard.
Whatcha thinkin'?
Oh, nothing.
It's silly.
Nah, it couldn't be.
Not if you're thinking it.
- Oh, it is.
- What?
- I'm terrified.
- You're terrified.
- Of what?
Thanks.
Remember what you said?
About being in love with someone... and how it never works out the first time?
Yeah.
Well, this is the first time... that I've ever been in love with someone.
I mean, really, really in love.
I mean, I love you so much it scares me.
And...
I would do anything for you, Matt.
All you have to do is ask.
- Ow.
Good night.
Good night.
Who is it?
It's me.
Hey.
Wow, it's, uh...
- You look mad or something.
Yeah.
As much as I don't want to be...
I am a little mad... and I'm trying not to be, but it's really hard.
I just keep trying to keep in mind... that when you're expected to be the perfect child... that you probably have to learn how to lie at a really early age.
Oh...
Allison, what... what are you talking about?
I don't know how to begin this.
- Matt, I love you.
- I love you too.
- W
- What...
- Just...
But we can't do this.
I haven't slept all night.
I've just been up... and I've been sitting and I've been thinking... and I've been going over stuff, and I'm sorry, but we can't.
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, Allison.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- Shh.
Shh.
Here.
Here.
You know... the funny thing is is in the back of my mind...
I always thought that...
I always thought that you might be gay.
And I hated myself for thinking it... because I thought it was my fault.
Look, Allison, I am not gay.
- I have never been gay.
- Oh, God!
Allison, shh.
All right, all right.
I've had the feelings, Allison, but...
- Matt, you had a relationship.
You had an ongoing relationship.
- Shh.
You were in love with this guy.
If you love me, don't lie to me.
I am not your family!
All right, all right.
I don't, Allison.
I won't.
Now, please.
Shh.
Allison, Allison.
- What?
- Baby, please don't do this to me.
- I can change.
I've been trying, Allison.
- Matt...
You can try all you want, but you can't be somebody else.
Allison, please.
Please don't do this to me.
Please don't do this to me.
I'm trying.
Matt, I don't think this is the kind of thing that you can talk yourself out of.
Matt, I can't go through with something like this... because your parents are gonna be upset with you.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna get out of here before they get up.
Allison, no.
Now, how am I gonna explain that?
How am I gonna explain that?
Matt.
Allison, please.
You can't tell people I'm gay.
You can't go around saying...
You can't go around saying that, 'cause it's not true.
- Okay.
- My par...
Allison...
My parents would die.
They would die, Allison.
Please don't do this to me.
Please don't do this to me.
- Please don't do this to me.
- Okay.
- Baby, please don't do this to me.
- Listen to me.
Matt, I am not angry with you.
All right?
And I will not tell anybody about you and Kyle.
What you say, that's your decision.
Matt, I have to go.
I have to go.
- Allison, please.
- It's okay.
I have to go.
I know you don't want to see me anymore, so I'm not here.
Just put my stuff on the bed and leave the key with it.
I was thinking today, after you called... about the day you first told me how you felt.
Those were the best three years of my life... and because of that, the last eight months have been hell.
Sometimes I think you'll call or something... that you'll say at least we can be friends.
But I guess that's not going to happen.
So, I hope, for your sake, that you have a great marriage and a happy life.
Maybe someday you might want to see me.
Until then, good luck.
Love, Kyle.
P.S. Thanks for bringing back my stuff.
Scott goes four for four.
Good morning, son.
- Good morning, Dad.
- Good morning.
- Ah, Karen?
- Hmm?
- Isn't that your third bowl of cereal?
- No.
- I think it is.
- Well, it isn't.
- Matt, honey?
- Hmm?
Isn't Allison coming to church with us this morning?
Hmm?
Oh, that's right.
You guys were asleep when we got back from Andy's last night.
Allison had to leave.
She's already gone.
- What?
- Well...
She called her parents, and they were confused, um... 'cause they planned this big lunch for her and thought she was coming back this morning.
- So she left around 6:00.
- Oh, Matt.
That's a shame.
Well, she told me to tell you guys what a nice time she had... and, uh, she can't wait to see everyone again.
She was very impressed with you guys.
Could you pass the milk, please?
She is such a sweet girl.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- Zip!
- Whoo.!
- Come on.!
- Get down.
- Here it comes.!
- Here it comes.
- Come on.
- Whoo.!
- Oh.
- Are those beautiful?
- Oh, wow.!
- Oh.!
- Matt.
- Hey.
- Gentlemen.
Hey, hey.
- Hey, Matt.
Whoo!
- Hey, our first casualty.
{y:i}Hey, you guys.!
- Shh!
Do you mind?
We're coming to the biggest part.
- You mean the best part!
- Same thing.
- Are those for real?
Hey, Andy!
Andy!
Imagine if you had a little class, what you could do.
Hey, I have class.
I have low class.
- Hey, Matt, where's Kyle?
- He's at school.
- Oh, my God.
Look at that.
Tie me up, tie me down.
- Hey, Dad.
Why I ever agreed to let Andy do this I will never know.
I guess I really like you or something.
- Here.
Go easy on this stuff now.
- You can count on that.
Thanks for this whole thing.
It's really wonderful.
- Yeah.
Look, I, uh...
I just wanted you to know that...
I can't imagine a father... being prouder of his son than I am of you.
I look at you and I think maybe...
I did something right in my life.
- I just wanted you to know that.
Well, Dad, I've always wanted you to be proud of me.
You and Mom are the most important people in my life.
Oh, Captain Carter, you promised.
Okay, Andy.
Okay.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Uh...
Ta-dum!
Okay, okay, okay.
Be quiet, you guys.
I have an announcement.
- As the best man in this room,
- I have an announcement.
- Shh!
No, seriously.
I have to get serious for a minute.
- No.
- Just for a minute.
No, no.
I have to say this.
Because Matt Carter is my best friend...
- and I know everything about him,
- Aww.
And the truth about Matt Carter is... he really is a great guy.
Hear!
Hear!
Thank you for that spontaneous and heartfelt burst of emotion.
- But, no, it's really true.
He's dependable, and he's probably the smartest guy I know who's my age.
Occasionally he says something sort of interesting.
So, it's really difficult for me to accept... that he is going to have such a beautiful woman to call his wife.
I mean, somebody who's just as smart and just as nice... andjust as much fun as he is.
I think the only thing that keeps me from being completelyjealous... is the fact that he really deserves it.
So, God bless, Matt, and congratulations.
- All right, Matt.
Wait, wait.
Wa...
Hold it.
Just, um...
Just wait.
Uh, I have a toast.
I think a brother should be allowed to say something.
Right?
Can I say something, Matt?
- All right.
Good.
- Go ahead.
Uh, Andy, introduced himself... as the best man.
And that's a little hard for me.
I have a-a little problem with that.
I mean, you're all right.
You're a nice guy and all, but you're not the best man.
You're only the best man by default.
And if anybody knows anything about default, it's me.
Right?
Now, I'd like to propose a toast to the real best man... in this li...
this little society.
Here is a toast to... my kid brother, Matt.
The best man I know.
I don't know how he did it, but he did it right.
- Yeah.
- To the best man.
- Hear!
Hear!
- Yeah.
- I love you, Matt.
- Thanks.
I do.
We don't see any internal injuries... any other fractures, and the skull looks okay.
So, we're gonna keep him down here till tomorrow for observation.
- But I think he's gonna be okay.
Uh-huh.
Did he say anything?
Is he conscious?
- I mean, how did this happen?
- I can't tell you that.
But he's lucky.
Very lucky.
May I see him?
Please?
Sure.
One person only though.
Now, it looks a lot worse than it is.
Excuse me.
Could you tell me?
I was wondering, what was the alcohol level of his blood?
There's a law now, isn't there, that you have to check... the blood alcohol level of a person in a car accident?
He wasn't drunk, Mrs. Carter, legally or otherwise.
No drugs either.
I'll check back on you in a little while.
- Ohh.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Wow.
What's going on?
You were in a car accident.
You drove your car off the road and into a telephone pole.
Look, um, I tried to call Allison... but I couldn't find her number.
Allison.
Karen, uh...
- You okay?
- Yeah.
It's just, um...
Well, listen, uh...
Don't tell anyone about this.
What?
Well, uh, Allison is...
What?
Allison decided she's not gonna marry me.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I know.
- Is that why she left early?
- Uh-huh.
Why?
I mean...
Karen, I can't...
I'll tell you about this later.
I don't have the energy to go into it now.
But we'll have a long talk eventually.
- Yeah, okay.
- Oh, and, Karen, you know...
Yeah, I'll keep Mom out of this until you can deal with it.
- Thanks.
- God.
Well, look, I was thinking we can go ahead with the wedding anyways.
I don't know.
I think people will notice if she doesn't show up.
God.
Well, it's just our family.
No...
No, I mean, I'm sorry.
I know this is really, really terrible for you...
- But, um...
- you think you can wait till Tom and I leave to tell Mom?
- Yes.
- Wow.
- I really...
I am sorry.
I'm really sorry.
As best I can remember, I turned the corner... and there was this miniature collie in the middle of the road... and it looked up at me, and it had the strangest expression on its little face... and it was just frozen there, and l-I... turned the steering wheel and I hit my brake.
And that's it.
That's all I can remember.
That happens all the time, people doing that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Except for, Matt, next time, kill the dog.
Just aim your car straight for the dog and kill it.
I'm just telling you this on behalf of the insurance company.
Oh, by the way, we tried to reach Allison... but we couldn't find the right number... and I'm pretty sure her parents have unlisted phones.
They have unlisted addresses, Mom.
That's all right.
I called her this afternoon, and, uh... she wanted to come up, but I told her not to.
You know, she's very frightened that my cast is going to upstage her at the wedding.
That was so funny.
- Yeah, it was.
I almost hurt myself, Mom.
- He did.
- Come in.
I asked the people at the desk if there was anyone here before I came back.
I thought, you know, this early...
You're okay, right?
So I'm told.
Kyle, why are you here?
You know, I heard...
I heard you had an accident.
Okay.
I'll go.
I'm sorry.
Wait.
Wait.
It's not that I... l-I can't see you right now.
All right.
All right.
Kyle.!
Kyle, wait a second.!
- Who else?
- Andy's father.
- Get out.
- No, he called from California.
- Get out.
- More to make sure, I think, that Andy was in no way responsible.
Oh, now, who sent these?
You want me to open this?
Uh, no.
Mom, I got a problem here.
Thanks.
- Ah, you know, it seems cool in here.
Too cool.
- Mom...
- Are you chilly?
Is it cold in here to you?
- Mom...
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm going to ask the nurse.
I'll be right back.
So Matt's coming back tomorrow.
Oh, yeah.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I'm just... tired, I guess.
Oh.
I called in and, uh, checked our messages.
Mm-hmm.
Dr. Bridges's office wanted to confirm your appointment next week.
Okay.
- Well, who's Dr. Bridges?
- Uh, he's, uh...
Oh, how you say it?
He's a...
I don't know the name of the specialty.
My last checkup, I had a low iron count.
Well, why didn't you say something?
Look.
It's nothing.
It's a dietary thing.
It's nothing to get dramatic about.
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Nothing.
Look how well he's walking, Phil.
Better than yesterday.
Come on.
I'll race him in.
- Phil?
- Yeah?
I wanna put those flowers upstairs.
Sweetheart...
We thank you for this food which we are about to receive.
We hope Allison and her family are well.
We're grateful to be here together, but we're grateful most of all... for the safety of our family and for the quick recovery of Matt.
For this and all our many blessings, we thank you.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Gee.
I really wish I could help.
- Uh-huh.
- I do.
Right.
I believe you.
- I drove by that telephone pole today.
- What telephone pole?
The telephone pole Matt ran into.
Curious thing about it was that you could follow the path the car took... once it went off the highway... but there were no skid marks.
It was literally like...
- like Matt just deliberately drove it off the road.
- Tim, what is wrong with you?
- I am fed up with your...
- I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to Matt!
Is that what happened?
What the hell is the matter with you?
Look, man.
Say something, okay?
You're scaring me a little.
- Matt, what is this?
I didn't have a car accident, Andy.
I drove my car off the road on purpose.
What?
Why would you do something like that?
Allison decided she's not gonna marry me.
Oh, man.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
- Really.
But why, man?
I mean, what happened?
She seemed like she was really...
We're friends no matter what.
Right?
I can't even believe you would ask me this.
Of course we're friends.
What the hell is goin' on?
Allison doesn't wanna marry me... because I'm gay.
Really?
Yeah.
Really.
I mean, hey, you can't really blame her for not wanting to marry you.
I mean, there's a lot of things you can overlook in a relationship... but...
I don't think this is one of'em.
How are you gonna explain this to your parents?
I don't know.
- Don't hug me.
- Geez, it doesn't mean I wanna marry you.
No, it's the ribs.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You know something?
You're my best friend.
You're my best friend in the whole world.
The best friend I ever had.
You know?
Same here.
Hey, this doesn't mean you're gonna start humming'...
Broadway show tunes on long car trips, does it?
Shut up.
I was just checkin'.
No, I'm still on hold.
No, I'm waiting for Dr. Bridges.
All right.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, um...
This is Tom Gregg.
L...
My wife, Karen, has an appointment with you next week.
Um...
And, well, I know it sounds kind of crazy, but...
Should I be worried about anything?
I mean, she says it's not...
Yeah, I'm still here.
Um...
I don't know.
I mean, is she...
I can't...
Can you tell me...
Something about the first trimester?
Pressure on.
- How ya doin'?
Okay?
- Yeah.
Lisa?
- What is it, honey?
- Mom?
How dare you.
What?
How dare you embarrass your father and me like this.
How dare you lie to me.
- What?
- Lisa!
You told me Allison was going home to see her parents.
I have a note.
I have a note.
I have a note here from Allison saying thank you... and how sorry she is.
What's going on, son?
What have you done?
Well, Allison and I...
We decided we're not gonna get married, Dad.
B-But I was gonna tell you, but...
But?
But?
But what?
But what?
You were going to tell me, but you didn't?
Look, Mom, we're not getting married.
That's all.
I think it's better we leave it at that.
No, I don't think so.
The invitations have already gone out.
People know!
- I think...
I want an explanation.
- Mom...
You better start explaining yourself, young man.
You owe me an explanation!
You already know.
You know exactly why.
You want me to say it?
- Don't talk to me that way.
- Lower your voice.
No!
You want me to say it?
I didn't swerve to avoid a dog.
I swerved to avoid living this life!
- I thought it would be better to be dead than tell you...
- I've heard enough...
No, you haven't!
I tried to kill myself!
- No, you didn't.
You had...
You had an accident.
- No!
No!
No!
I thought it would be better to be dead...
- No!
No, you had...
- Mom.!
- I thought it'd be better to be dead than...
- No...
Yes!
Than to tell you I was gay!
I drove the car off the road on purpose.
I did it on purpose, Mom.
On purpose.
Yes!
On purpose.
- No, you didn't.
- I did it on purpose.
- No!
- She knows.
Mom, you know.
You walked in on me and Kyle two years ago.
I won't listen to this.
I will not have these things said in my house.
Now, you call Allison and you tell her that you're wrong... that you made a mistake.
You go to hell.
- Matt!
- Go to hell!
- Matt.!
- Go to hell!
Leave him alone.
- What?
- I said just leave him alone.
How does it feel, Captain?
What?
How does it feel to almost lose your child?
How bad does it feel?
- Tom.
- I don't know what's come over you, Tom... but I don't think this is any of your concern.
I'm sorry, Phil.
I'm 32 years old.
You don't get to decide what concerns me.
Your standard of conduct might be sufficient reason for you to lose your child... but I have to draw the line when it comes to losing mine.
What children?
You don't have any children.
No, I don't.
I don't have any children.
I don't.
Because my wife would rather have an abortion without telling me... without even telling me she's pregnant... rather than risk upsetting you by having a baby at the wrong time.
You have a son who drinks himself...
- into a stupor every night.
- Oh, God, Tom.
You've got a daughter who's ashamed of her husband.
- I am not ashamed.
- Who's ashamed of her husband... you're ashamed of me, Karen...
and you've got another son... who almost killed himself rather than tell you he's not what you think he is.
And I'm not prepared to be a parent?
Because I can't afford it?
Really?
- It's about money?
- Tom, we're not gonna talk about this now.
No?
When are we gonna talk about it?
When someone actually dies?
Would that be better?
What's the military term for it?
Acceptable losses, isn't it?
Well, these are not acceptable losses.
I can't accept them.
I can't.
Is what you said true?
Yeah.
Yeah, Dad, I'm gay.
No, I'm not talkin' about that.
I can't deal with that right now.
I mean about driving the car off the road.
About trying to kill yourself.
Is that the truth?
Yeah, it is, Dad.
W...
Was it because...
Did you really think we'd rather have you dead?
I don't know.
Dad, it's hard to know.
Well, I wouldn't.
I wouldn't rather have you dead.
No matter what you did.
No matter what you are.
Listen, um...
Can you...
Can you promise your father... that you won't do that again?
Now, I know...
I know things are gonna be a little tough around here, but...
I wouldn't survive it, Matt.
It would kill me.
Promise me.
Okay.
I promise.
Okay.
Did you talk to Matt?
Yeah.
Well, is he gonna call her?
Lisa, I don't think that's a very good idea right now.
What do you mean?
You're just...
You're just gonna let him get away with it?
Get away with what?
What am I letting him get away with?
With embarrassing us.
With humiliating us.
Maybe it's not about us.
Maybe it's about him.
What are you t...
Of course it's about us.
All of it.
L...
I've spent my entire life sacrificing... so m-my children can have a future.
So they can be something.
Don't...
Don't tell me it's not about us.
It is us.
This is us.
What do you want from him, Lisa?
Would you rather have his brains smashed around the street?
Or see him hanging in the garage?
What is it you want?
Do you love your children, Lisa?
Whatever they are, they're our children.
It's a lie.
It's all a lie.
No, it's not a lie.
This is a lie!
- And that's a lie.
- Lisa!
Lisa.
- What are you doing?
- And this is a lie...
- No.
No, it's not a lie.
- This is...
Lisa.
Tom, please.
Please what?
It seemed like...
What choice do I have?
Tom, it's my body.
Fine.
This is my body, and I can do with it what I want... and right now, I want to take it home.
- I wanted to tell you.
- Well, now you don't have to.
I didn't want to go behind your back.
But you did, and I can't live like that.
I'll make allowances for you 'cause I know that's the way you were raised, but, uh...
I'm not your parents.
So why lie to me?
- 'Cause I'm afraid.
- Of course you are.
Maybe we're not meant to be parents, but we have to discuss it, Karen.
First, you have to come to a decision... because I've put you first in this marriage all along.
I love my parents a lot, but, um...
I'm your husband first, and they know that.
I'm sorry, Tom.
I'm sorry.
I know.
I want to have it.
I do.
Really.
I do.
I just...
What if I end up being like her?
I don't wanna be like her.
Hey.
- It could be worse.
What if I got to be like your dad?
You know I'm a mess.
I'm gonna worry 100% of the time.
I'll have to take off work for a while.
I told you a hundred times I'd get an extra job.
And I meant it.
It would help if you wouldn't be so nice.
Let's go ask your parents how nice I am.
- No.
I think we'd better just get out of here.
- Yeah.
Mom.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry for wrecking the car and hurting myself the way I did.
I know you had to go to a lot of extra trouble.
And I'm sorry this wedding thing has happened too.
I know you don't understand.
I don't expect you to, Mom.
But I did want you to know that I was sorry.
I don't...
I don't understand how anyone could choose to be like this.
It's just, uh...
It is not to be understood.
I didn't choose this.
I am this.
Mom, I didn't choose to be gay.
Do you think I'd choose to be this different from everyone else... that I'd choose to make you and Dad this upset... and I'd choose to lose someone as beautiful and wonderful as Allison?
And what about Al DS?
I mean, suppose somebody wanted to be gay.
Would they want to be gay now?
I don't know.
And I don't want to know.
Then you don't wanna know me either.
Hello, Kyle.
W-W-Wait.
Don't hang up.
Uh...
I'm really sorry.
And I was calling to say that...
No.
I'm callin' from a pay phone.
Well, things are a little nuts at my house right now.
I'll talk to you about that later if you want.
But, uh...
What I was wondering is if...
Uh...
What I'd like to know is if... we could possibly go for a cup of coffee?
'Cause I really need to talk to you.
Please.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.
Whatcha doin'?
Oh, I don't know.
Waiting for you to come home, I guess.
You didn't have to do that.
Look, you have a son who almost kills himself... and then write a book about what you're supposed to do and how you're supposed to react.
- How about that?
- Sorry.
Yeah, it's been hard on you.
It's your bad luck to be born into a family... where people don't always know the right thing to do or say.
I got it.
Homosexual.
There.
I said it.
Didn't make me sick or anything.
That's pretty good, Dad.
L-I think the word, uh, gay is a little easier.
I don't like that word.
That's a perfectly good word that's been destroyed, and I don't like it.
Okay.
Since I have said the word... uh, can I ask you a few questions?
Because...
I mean, do you mind?
I'm just... trying to think through this properly.
Okay.
Go ahead.
I mean...
I've been thinking about this because I've heard it before.
What do you say about this thing... about God hating homosexuals... about homosexuals being unnatural or...
or going to hell?
What do you say about that?
I don't know.
I can't tell you, Dad.
Well, I think we should look into that, don't you?
No, not really.
I don't believe that.
Well, what you believe isn't factual.
If you go around telling people that you're a... that you're a homosexual... sooner or later, someone's gonna say this... and you should know how to defend yourself.
That's all I'm saying.
I'm not thrilled about this, and I don't want to give you the wrong idea.
I would rather you be normal.
I think I am normal.
Don't quibble with me.
You know what I mean.
Yes, sir.
But whatever you are, you're my son.
And I...
I'm, uh...
That's all.
You're my son.
And I don't think I want people... saying things like that about my son... without knowing how to respond.
So we should look into that.
You may not know this, but Alexander the Great... who I happen to think was a damn good general...
Alexander the Great was a homosexual too.
I love you, Dad.
I love you too, son.
[Chattering]
Did you give your friend back his stuff?
Oh, yeah.
He wasn't there, so I left it in his room.
How'd you get in if he wasn't there?
His roommate let me in.
What kind of question is that?
I thought you broke in or something.
I don't know.
Now, don't worry about this tablecloth.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Oh, that is really nice.
Don't be nervous.
She's the one who's supposed to be nervous.
Yeah, well, if her family just wasn't so rich.
She's not marrying Matt for his money.
That's good, because if she is, she's in for a terrible surprise.
Matt was saying that he didn't think she'd ever seen artificial fabric... before she went to college.
- [Laughing]
- Oh.
This is so nice.
I wish somebody had gone to all this trouble for me when I was getting married.
- Give me the glasses.
- I got'em.
You smell like alcohol.
Take the back way, go up the stairs to the shower... run it hot until it's all gone and you've sweated the liquor out.
Well, if I'm such a screw up that I can't even go in the front door of my own house...
You want to go in the front door, Tim?
You go ahead.
Go in the front door and go hug your mother.
Is that what you want to do?
Then why don't you do it?
- I said I was sorry.
- I'm tired of you being sorry, Tim.
I am worn out with sorry.
Instead of being so damn sorry all the time, you might just try a little discipline.
[Woman] Phil, is that you?
Tim?
- You're late.
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, good.
You remembered the glasses.
And the shrimp.
Aren't you good.
Yeah.
I thought we weren't gonna make a big deal of this.
Matt said that we shouldn't make a big deal of things.
Oh.
Phil, a tablecloth isn't a big deal.
A tablecloth is a tablecloth.
Where's Tim?
- Upstairs.
He's, uh...
- What?
Nothing.
Uh...
The toilet had a thing today.
Somebody stuffed it with little creamer packages.
I could have brought you a tablecloth from the restaurant.
For this size table?
What are you talking about, Phil?
Come on.
Allison is used to nice things.
Did you have to call the plumber?
For what?
- For the toilet.
- Oh.
No.
No, uh...
Tim got it.
He just kept at it.
See?
I don't know why you worry about him so much.
[Sighs] [Car Horn Honking]
- Hey, there she is!
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!
[Both Laughing]
- Mom?
- In the kitchen.
Thank you.
We almost did find a tenant, but he got arrested two days before he moved in.
So I guess it turned out to be a good thing.
Except that we turned down a really nice couple.
Karen, uh, cut the celery in half before you slice it.
- What?
- In half.
Here.
Like this.
Oh.
Okay.
Anyway, this nice couple would have been great... except they tried to bargain with us, which irritated Tom.
I would have tried to bargain too.
You never know.
It doesn't hurt to ask.
Considering we don't get free rent unless the whole place is full... we can't really afford to hold a grudge.
Anyway, when we called them back, they'd already found...
What do you think?
Should I put these out now, or should I wait until Matt and Allison get here?
- Uh, whatever.
- Hmm.
Having children is an economic thing too, though.
You have to plan for it.
And have some kind of savings.
I've always thought that if you've got the love, then everything else...
Lisa quit teaching school the moment Karen was born.
It was a decision we were prepared to make... because we had worked and saved for it.
That's what you have to do.
Right.
Right.
So...
- Is this it?
- Yes.
This is it.
This is it.
Wow.
You've seen the pond where I twisted my ankle.
Right?
You've seen the church where I was confirmed.
Right?
My dad's restaurant.
Now, this is the high school... where I became an intellectual giant.
[Sighs]
- Come on.
- Matt...
Come on.
This is the romantic part.
[Sighs]
This is where it all began.
Where I wrote my first published work for the Viking Ledger.
Won my first debate in interscholastic competition.
And I scored so well on my National Merit Test... that I got a scholarship to Yale... and met Allison Hall, the girl I'm gonna marry.
The woman you're going to marry.
- That's a 10.
- Ten, 11, 12, 13.
- That's a double.
- Whoa.
- That's 26.
- I'm still winning.
- Twenty-six.
- What have I got here?
Tim, save some of those for Matt and Allison.
- All right.
It's my turn.
- Gross.
- Shoot.
- Where are they?
[Car Approaching]
- They're here.
They just drove up.
- Oh, but I'm winning.
- Of course you are.
- You've got both blanks, two S's, the "J."
- Oh, pout.
You haven't opened up the game once.
That's why you're winning.
- You're a leech.
- [Scoffs]
- Is the "Q" still out?
- Don't look at my letters.
We're finishing this after dinner.
Here you are!
[Matt] Traffic is murder from New Haven.
- Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.
Allison, please call me "Phil." Come in.
You must be starving.
- Hi.
- Traffic was terrible.
- I'm so glad you're home.
- Traffic's tough.
- It is.
- [Laughing] Get out of here.
[Matt] Mmm, something smells good.
This is something else.
- Here's a picture of me and Allison.
- Whoa.
- Sorry.
- Watch it, Dad.
[Matt] Gonna poke somebody's eye out.
Here's a picture of yours truly and his bride-to-be... on the most amazing yacht you have ever seen.
- Look at that.
- Oh.
That's incredible.
- Look at that.
[Allison Chuckles]
Wow.
This belongs to your father?
Well, yeah, but we never really use it.
It belongs to his business.
If we want to take it out, we have to pay to, unless it's a company thing.
Look at it.
Great paint job.
[Lisa] Dear God, we are thankful today to be here as a family.
We thank you for this food and the work you have given us to provide it.
We especially thank you for bringing Allison into our family.
We pray that you will bless Matt and Allison and their marriage...
- as you have blessed us.
- [Sniffles]
This we humbly ask in your name.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
[Phil] Well, here's to Allison and Matt.
Cheers.
[Matt] The church was built in 1852.
It's incredible.
And the chapel was named after one of Allison's relatives.
Oh, no.
It's a distant relative.
And by marriage.
My family really isn't involved with the chur...
You won't believe who's being invited to the wedding.
The Kennedys.
The Pattersons.
Diane Sawyer.
The Kennedys.
Wait.
Will you stop it?
You know what?
We don't know them.
I mean, my dad does business with them, or he raised money for them.
- I don't even know which.
- Karen campaigned for one of the Kennedys.
- Who was it?
- Joseph Kennedy.
[Phil] Of course, we didn't know them either.
[Chuckling]
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Well, we could have.
We have a restaurant.
That's where all those congressmen seem to spend their time.
Speaking of restaurants, Andy is driving me nuts about your bachelor party.
I think he's taking this best man thing too seriously.
[Karen] He even called me the other day when I was teaching class.
I didn't see Kyle's name on the invitation list.
What happened to Kyle?
Are we through?
Anyone want seconds?
- I'll have some pie.
[Karen] Is Kyle coming?
- He's transferring to Duke.
[Phil] Not until the fall, is he?
- [Lisa] Oh, no.
- What?
What's the matter?
- I forgot to get the sherbet for tonight.
- Sherbet with pie?
No, you.
It...
It's for the punch.
It goes in the punch.
Your mother likes it.
- Uh, Matt, honey...
- Want me to get it?
I'll get it.
No problem.
- I'll go with you.
- No, let my family entertain you for a couple of minutes.
- I've got money, Mom.
- Well, I, um...
No, really.
It's really close.
I'll be right back.
- What kind, Mom?
- A half gallon of lime sherbet.
- Try not to miss me too much.
All right?
- Okay.
[Karen] So when's everyone coming?
[Lisa] Soon.
- Thanks, son.
So, uh, Andy's gonna be the best man.
It's definite.
[Phil] I told you that.
I think it's something... something I would probably remember.
[Clears Throat] Lisa?
[Phil] Lisa?
- Yeah.
Why don't we save the pie for when everyone is here?
All right.
Over here.
The youngest pictures are at the bottom... and then work their way up to as close to the present as we can be.
We moved around a lot when the children were young.
I guess if we had anything to do over... we would have stayed in one place... or at least settled down a little sooner.
Still, wherever we went, there was always a room... except Korea.
- [Chuckles]
[Lisa] There was always a room like this one... and after we got everything moved in... we'd all come in and take a place on the wall... and just start putting everything back up again.
I think it gave them continuity.
Yeah, no doubt about it.
We've always tried to find ways to strengthen our identity as a family.
[Classical On Stereo]
- I promise this will be over soon.
- It's perfectly fine.
Uh, Karen.
By the way, thanks a lot for telling Tim about Andy.
I thought you had told him.
Do you hate me now?
- Yep.
- Matt.
You're awful.
- Almost there.
- Are you going to West Point, Timmy?
No, I don't think so, Granny.
I'm too old for West Point now.
Your father will be so happy.
- I'll go then.
- What time is it?
Phil.
Gene.
Come on.
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- Judy?
Cindy.
I can't decide whether this is one of the benefits or the shortcomings... having a professional photographer for a son-in-law.
I wasn't aware there were any shortcomings.
Cindy, come on.
- [Phil] How are you, Mom?
- Oh, uh, Uncle Gene.
This is our first picture with Allison, so try not to make any noises with your body.
- [Laughing]
- Thank you very much.
Phil, smile.
Please, look like you're having a good time.
Okay, everybody.
All right.
Ready?
- Set.
- [Phil] Is it set?
- Go.
- All right, everybody.
Think "love."
- There we go.
That was good.
- [Chattering]
- It's a math problem.
- Oh.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm kind of scary-looking in the morning.
Uh, you mind if I play through?
- They're waiting on me downstairs.
- Oh, sure.
Thanks.
- Whoa.
[Chuckles]
The hair fairies came and danced on my head last night. [Chuckles]
Um, what is this about a math problem?
Oh, well... it's either a math problem or a history question... or a geography something or other.
You're kidding.
"I was the first man elected to the presidency of the United States... who was born under the American flag."
"Martin Van Buren." Who does this?
- Dad.
- Still?
[Spits] He's done it ever since we were little kids.
[Spitting]
You know, math problem.
Something he likes to call "vocabulary builders."
He has a lot of time on his hands.
It's funny, actually, if we get the answer right.
Yeah?
What if you don't get the answer right?
[Sighs] Well, it's still funny... but for entirely different reasons.
[Phil Groaning]
[Phil] Come on, Miss Grable!
[Shutter Clicks] - [Grunting]
Well, at least it was better than one of our family parties.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My family almost never gets together without a lawyer.
[Allison] Yea!
Way to go!
- [Shutter Clicking] [Allison Chuckles]
- He's so funny.
- Yeah, I spend all my time here laughing.
- He doesn't like me much.
- Really?
Well, I married his daughter and kept her from becoming a great novelist.
Oh, well, that was mean of you.
The whole concept of art photography... is not something Phil appreciates, you know.
Wedding photos, no problem.
He likes wedding photos, but the whole idea that somebody might... spend a lot of money on expensive equipment... you know, turn their apartment into a studio... that's very challenging for him.
- Aaah.
[Shutter Clicks]
No fair, no fair, wounding an older man.
Ha-ha-ha!
[Shutter Clicks]
- Is Tim in school, or is he just...
- No, he flunked out.
- Really.
[Allison] He seems pretty smart.
[Tom] He is.
He also looks a little hung over, doesn't he?
Oops.
You know Tim used to be R.O.T.C.?
Yeah, Matt said he wanted to go to West Point.
I'm not sure about that.
I think Phil wanted him to go to West Point.
Tim just wanted to do whatever Phil wanted.
But I think he didn't end up having the grades... or, um, the captain didn't have the connections or something.
But you're right though.
Tim is...
Tim is pretty smart.
[Shutter Clicks] [Matt] There you go.
Nice!
Come on, Tim!
I'd love to see some of these pictures on the wall.
You've seen the wall?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What, um...
What was Matt supposed to be?
Matt?
Well, given the way Karen and Tim have turned out... it doesn't really matter much what Matt does.
Really?
No.
See, he just has to be perfect.
And, um, if he isn't perfect... just keep it to yourself, because I don't think anybody in this family wants to know.
[Phil Shouts]
[Phil] Come on!
- Yes!
All right.
[Karen] 40-love.
Set point.
Come on, Tim.
Set point.
Come on.
[Phil] This is set point.
Right?
Set point?
Yes, this is set point.
Out.
[Laughing] Wait, wait, wait.
Okay.
[Ball Bouncing On Court]
Come on, Karen.
We're waitin'.
In!
Yes!
- Yea!
- Good game.
Uhh!
[Tim] Ow!
- What the hell's the matter with you?
What do you want?
I couldn't get it.
I would never have made that shot.
What are you hitting me for?
I'm not hitting you because you missed the shot.
I am hitting you because you didn't try.
Good game, Karen.
Good game.
Good game, Matt.
Say something to him.
[Exhales] Gotta let'em win every now and then... or they get discouraged.
[Cackles]
- Come here.
- [Laughing]
- You played so well, your father let you win.
- Isn't he nice?
- Tim, you all right?
- I'm not playing anymore.
This is it.
- Hey, look, it's...
- Leave me alone.
All right?
[Matt] All I did is ask you, Tim.
- I said leave me alone.
Okay?
Leave me alone!
[Matt] Okay, fine.
[Sighs]
Three months of driver ed.
One month with a simulator.
One month of behind-the-wheel practice with an instructor.
And the day you get your license... with absolutely no training whatsoever... you can crawl into the backseat... and congratulations, you're a parent.
What do you think that says about our society?
Now he's started, "No one knows how to be a good parent."
This isn't about the back seat of cars?
I can't stand this.
The most important part of parenting...
Well, not the most important part.
I guess, reasonably, you can't break it down that way.
- It's preparation.
It's key.
Key!
[Man] Hey, look!
It's the Carters, and they're taking their women out for a walk!
- Hey, Tom.
Hey.
- How ya doin', Andy?
How are you, young man?
- [Tom] Hey, Andy.
How ya doin'?
- This is Allison Hall.
- I'm Andy Paulson.
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Matt told me all about you.
- Just remember...
Matt is jealous because I'm more popular than he is, and he can't stand it.
Hey.
I've got to get to work.
I'll see you later, Andy.
- See you later, Captain.
- We're coming, Dad.
- Yeah.
- So, Andy, what are you doing today?
- I'm going with you guys.
- Oh, no!
Hey, Tom!
Put your wife on a leash!
[Allison] You guys played a good game.
You looked like professionals out there.
Give me a hand in the car here, Matt.
I got some stuff.
Sure thing.
I just, uh...
I wanted to tell you how much your mother and I like Allison.
[Matt Sighs] I knew you would, Dad.
There's a couple of things I want to ask you.
- Okay.
- But, uh...
You know, I, uh...
- I don't want to pry.
- All right.
All right.
What I want to know here is if you are really and truly committed to Allison.
- For better, for worse and all that?
- Yes, I'm completely committed.
And you know what you're doing?
- Did you?
- [Laughing]
I mean...
Well...
Sometimes, uh, we feel like we're... locked into something that we can't back out of.
It's like the French in World War I.
- You know that story.
- The Guns of August.
I read that in my eighth-grade summer.
Yeah, well, that was a disaster.
[Phil Chuckles]
So, you really and truly love this girl.
Yep.
I do.
Well, that's all that matters.
[Matt] Well, I appreciate your asking, Dad.
[Phil] All right.
Take this to the basement for me, will you?
Yes, sir.
What?
So, a bachelor party, huh?
What can happen?
It's gonna be in the back room of my dad's restaurant.
- [Sighs]
- What?
I don't know.
Just something about being here and seeing you with your family... and all these things that you grew up with.
Mmm.
I'm sorry.
This is making you uncomfortable, isn't it?
What?
Well, I'm being a little too pushy.
I'm sorry.
Oh, that's okay.
You don't have to be sorry.
Later.
[Chuckles]
[Tom] We're supposed to be on vacation.
We're not on vacation.
We're visiting my parents.
Do you have any idea how tense you are?
Yeah, it's all that talk about raising children.
It makes me nuts.
Why?
Tom.
Karen.
We can't afford it.
We can't afford two of us, much less three of us.
I could work part-time somewhere.
That is my parents talking.
- Why should you work five million hours a week...
- No, listen, Tom.
I'm not ready to have a child.
You are not ready to have a child.
By the time you think we're ready...
Do you realize what my parents would say if I were to get pregnant now?
You know how Daddy is about planning and preparation.
And the money.
Surprise, surprise.
I didn't marry your daddy.
I married you.
It's our decision.
If they don't like it, they can just take a cruise till our kids are through college.
I'm trying to imagine Daddy on a cruise.
A long, long, long, long...
- Tom!
- Long, long...
[Sighs] Hey, Nick, old buddy.
Have a nice couple days off?
Yeah, went out with my folks on the boat.
- You ready for Matt's party tomorrow?
- Yep.
Pass me a Cape Codder over there, would you?
Is there a problem of some kind?
Look, I can't.
You can't?
[Chuckling]
What do you mean?
You should talk about it with your dad.
Okay?
You're saying my father told you I can't...
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I've been looking over the books here... and, you know, uh, there's S200 missing from petty cash.
- Oh.
I borrowed it.
- What for?
- Excuse me?
- What would you like me to list it as?
- Oh.
- Blackmail?
Extortion?
Hush money?
What?
- Blackmail?
- Six months ago...
I noticed the day after the health inspector came... you borrowed S150 from petty cash... and you listed it as cleanup expenses.
- We can list it as that.
- What's the point of this?
I'll tell you what the point is.
I'm tired of pretending, you know, that you're the great dispenser... of orders and values and goodness... and I'm some kind of criminal because I want a drink in the afternoon.
Fine.
I'm only doing this because I give up on you.
Nick?
Make the kid a drink if he wants a drink, and write it off to inventory.
I'm sorry.
I should have told him myself.
All right?
There.
Are you satisfied?
Oh, yeah.
I'm really satisfied.
- You've made my life worth living.
- Oh, for God sakes.
You know, I resent...
I really resent the way you look down on me.
I try.
I'm here.
I'm doing something.
It's not like you're so much better than me.
It's not like you're perfect.
And if I want a drink in the afternoon right now... then I think I should have it.
I don't have to explain it to you.
I'm through explaining things to you!
I've done my time on Maple Drive.
Okay?
So I flunked out of school.
So what?
Why couldn't we have just told Mom I flunked out of school?
Huh?
I didn't kill anyone.
I had a bad time.
So what?
Why can't we tell her and just move on?
Why?
What's gonna happen?
What's gonna happen if we just sit down and say it out loud, Dad?
Look...
[Chuckles]
If I have to live this way...
I think I deserve a drink now and then.
If I want it.
Okay?
I think it's what I deserve.
Why do you do it here?
Why don't you do it somewhere else?
Why do you force me to watch it?
Because I think it's what you deserve.
What I deserve?
I think you should know, Tim... the last few days, every time I have seen you... every time I have looked at you... the only response I have had is to thank God I have another son.
You have all the advantages.
That doesn't work for me.
I look at you, and there isn't anyone else.
You're the only father I've got.
Which one of us is worse off?
I wonder.
If music be the food of love... play on.
Give me excess of it... that, surfeiting... the appetite may sicken, and so die.
- One more time.
- No, no!
Come on!
It's the fourth time we've watched it.
[Andy] This guy's my hero.
[Matt] This is brilliant.
- One more time.
- Oh, come on, you guys.
No.
No.
This is the fourth time.
- Put on me.
Get to me.
- I'm tired of watching that guy.
[Allison Laughs] Oh, that's great.
Just what I want to do, watch you.
Okay, here it is.
Here it is.
Hold on, now.
Oh, hello.
Hello.
- I'm Andrew Paulson...
- Geek.
And as president of this class, and therefore the most important senior on this entire tape... and also as an example to my peers...
I am pleased to admit that I am going to spend my entire future...
- groveling for money as a sleazy advertising executive!
- Yeah!
- [Indistinct Comment]
- I want to say hello to Julie... and good luck to Kyle and Matt when they get to Yale... and thank you, Mr. Edwards, for putting up with us this entire year.
And a hearty congratulations to Sylvester Stallone on Rocky IV!
Yeah!
Rocky!
Yeah!
I swear, you can't believe...
They took, like, three weeks telling us... how serious and sincere and honest we had to be... for this video thing, and...
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait.
- Wait.
Just let me see this person.
- Wait?
[Audio Garbled]
Push'em back!
Okay.
Um, my name's Kyle Trainer, and, uh, I'm trying not to smile.
That's the guy from the picture on your wall.
I was on the staff of the school paper and on the debate team... and Matt Carter and I went to State, and we came in third place.
Did that sound memorized?
Okay.
Anyway, here it is.
Thor is graduating, and I've enjoyed drawing him these past two years... even though Mr. Carlson hasn't always liked what he had to say.
- Hope he made you laugh.
- Obviously, Kyle was paying attention during study hall... because this looks very, very sincere to me.
It's been the best time of my life so far... and I'm gonna miss it and all my friends.
That's it.
[Allison] He goes to Yale?
He was.
He's, uh, transferring.
Really?
Why?
How should I know?
I haven't seen him in months.
Have you?
[Andy] I haven't seen him since high school, except when he was with you.
- All right.
We gotta go.
- No, you're not leaving yet.
- Yes, we have to.
- Oh, what time you have to leave tomorrow?
Oh, fairly early.
I promised my parents I'd be on the Vineyard by tomorrow night.
"On the Vineyard." Did you hear that?
"The Vineyard." Ooh.
"The Vineyard."
[Matt] Whatcha thinkin'?
Oh, nothing.
It's silly.
Nah, it couldn't be.
Not if you're thinking it.
- Oh, it is.
- What?
- I'm terrified.
- You're terrified.
- Of what?
- [Sighs]
Thanks.
Remember what you said?
About being in love with someone... and how it never works out the first time?
Yeah.
Well, this is the first time... that I've ever been in love with someone.
I mean, really, really in love.
I mean, I love you so much it scares me.
And...
I would do anything for you, Matt.
All you have to do is ask.
- Ow.
- [Laughing]
Good night.
Good night.
[Sighs]
[Knocking]
Who is it?
It's me.
Hey.
Wow, it's, uh...
- [Sniffles]
- You look mad or something.
[Sniffles] Yeah.
As much as I don't want to be...
I am a little mad... and I'm trying not to be, but it's really hard.
[Sobbing]
I just keep trying to keep in mind... that when you're expected to be the perfect child... that you probably have to learn how to lie at a really early age.
Oh...
Allison, what... what are you talking about?
I don't know how to begin this.
- Matt, I love you.
- I love you too.
- W
- What...
- Just...
[Sniffles] But we can't do this.
I haven't slept all night.
I've just been up... and I've been sitting and I've been thinking... and I've been going over stuff, and I'm sorry, but we can't.
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, Allison.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- [Sniffling]
- Shh.
Shh.
Here.
Here.
You know... the funny thing is in the back of my mind...
I always thought that...
I always thought that you might be gay.
And I hated myself for thinking it... because I thought it was my fault.
[Crying]
Look, Allison, I am not gay.
- I have never been gay.
- Oh, God!
Allison, shh.
All right, all right.
I've had the feelings, Allison, but...
- Matt, you had a relationship.
You had an ongoing relationship.
- Shh.
You were in love with this guy.
If you love me, don't lie to me.
I am not your family!
All right, all right.
I don't, Allison.
I won't.
Now, please.
Shh.
Allison, Allison.
- What?
- Baby, please don't do this to me.
- I can change.
I've been trying, Allison.
- Matt...
You can try all you want, but you can't be somebody else.
Allison, please.
Please don't do this to me.
Please don't do this to me.
I'm trying.
Matt, I don't think this is the kind of thing that you can talk yourself out of.
Matt, I can't go through with something like this... because your parents are gonna be upset with you.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna get out of here before they get up.
Allison, no.
Now, how am I gonna explain that?
How am I gonna explain that?
Matt.
Allison, please.
You can't tell people I'm gay.
You can't go around saying...
You can't go around saying that, 'cause it's not true.
- Okay.
- My par...
Allison...
My parents would die.
They would die, Allison.
Please don't do this to me.
Please don't do this to me.
- Please don't do this to me.
- Okay.
- Baby, please don't do this to me.
- Listen to me.
Matt, I am not angry with you.
All right?
And I will not tell anybody about you and Kyle.
What you say, that's your decision.
Matt, I have to go.
I have to go.
- Allison, please.
- It's okay.
I have to go.
[Kyle's Voice] I know you don't want to see me anymore, so I'm not here.
Just put my stuff on the bed and leave the key with it.
I was thinking today, after you called... about the day you first told me how you felt.
Those were the best three years of my life... and because of that, the last eight months have been hell.
Sometimes I think you'll call or something... that you'll say at least we can be friends.
But I guess that's not going to happen.
So, I hope, for your sake, that you have a great marriage and a happy life.
Maybe someday you might want to see me.
Until then, good luck.
Love, Kyle.
P.S. Thanks for bringing back my stuff.
[Chattering]
Scott goes four for four.
Good morning, son.
- Good morning, Dad.
[Lisa] Good morning.
- Ah, Karen?
- Hmm?
- Isn't that your third bowl of cereal?
- No.
- I think it is.
- Well, it isn't.
- Matt, honey?
- Hmm?
Isn't Allison coming to church with us this morning?
Hmm?
Oh, that's right.
You guys were asleep when we got back from Andy's last night.
Allison had to leave.
She's already gone.
- What?
- Well... [Chuckles]
She called her parents, and they were confused, um... 'cause they planned this big lunch for her and thought she was coming back this morning.
- So she left around 6:00.
- Oh, Matt.
That's a shame.
Well, she told me to tell you guys what a nice time she had... and, uh, she can't wait to see everyone again.
She was very impressed with you guys.
Could you pass the milk, please?
She is such a sweet girl.
[Chuckles] Yeah.
[Shouting, Hooting, Whistling]
[Dance]
- Zip!
- Whoo!
- Come on!
- Get down.
- [Chattering]
- Here it comes!
[Laughing]
- Here it comes.
- Come on.
- Whoo!
- Oh.
- Are those beautiful?
[Laughing]
- Oh, wow!
- Oh!
- Matt.
- Hey.
- Gentlemen.
Hey, hey.
- Hey, Matt.
Whoo!
Hey, our first casualty.
[Hooting]
[Andy] Hey, you guys!
- Shh!
Do you mind?
We're coming to the biggest part.
- You mean the best part!
- Same thing.
- Are those for real?
Hey, Andy!
Andy!
Imagine if you had a little class, what you could do.
Hey, I have class.
I have low class.
- Hey, Matt, where's Kyle?
- He's at school.
- Oh, my God.
Look at that.
[Chattering]
Tie me up, tie me down.
[Chattering Continues]
- Hey, Dad.
Why I ever agreed to let Andy do this I will never know.
I guess I really like you or something.
[Phil] Here.
Go easy on this stuff now.
- You can count on that.
Thanks for this whole thing.
It's really wonderful.
- Yeah.
[Hooting]
Look, I, uh...
I just wanted you to know that...
I can't imagine a father... being prouder of his son than I am of you.
[Chuckles] I look at you and I think maybe...
I did something right in my life.
- I just wanted you to know that.
[Glasses Clink]
Well, Dad, I've always wanted you to be proud of me.
You and Mom are the most important people in my life.
Oh, Captain Carter, you promised.
Okay, Andy.
Okay.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Uh...
Ta-dum!
[Music Stops] [Whooping, Applauding]
[Whistling] [Shouting]
[Chattering, Laughing]
Okay, okay, okay.
Be quiet, you guys.
I have an announcement.
- As the best man in this room, [Men Groaning]
- I have an announcement.
- Shh!
No, seriously.
I have to get serious for a minute.
- No.
- Just for a minute.
No, no.
I have to say this.
Because Matt Carter is my best friend...
- and I know everything about him,
- Aww.
And the truth about Matt Carter is... he really is a great guy.
Hear!
Hear!
Thank you for that spontaneous and heartfelt burst of emotion.
[Laughing]
- But, no, it's really true.
He's dependable, and he's probably the smartest guy I know who's my age.
Occasionally he says something sort of interesting.
So, it's really difficult for me to accept... that he is going to have such a beautiful woman to call his wife.
I mean, somebody who's just as smart and just as nice... and just as much fun as he is.
I think the only thing that keeps me from being completely jealous... is the fact that he really deserves it.
So, God bless, Matt, and congratulations.
- All right, Matt.
[Glass Clinking]
Wait, wait.
Wa...
Hold it.
Just, um...
Just wait.
Uh, I have a toast.
I think a brother should be allowed to say something.
Right?
Can I say something, Matt?
- All right.
Good.
- Go ahead.
Uh, Andy, introduced himself... as the best man.
And that's a little hard for me.
I have a-a little problem with that.
I mean, you're all right.
You're a nice guy and all, but you're not the best man.
You're only the best man by default.
And if anybody knows anything about default, it's me.
Right?
Now, I'd like to propose a toast to the real best man... in this li...
this little society.
Here is a toast to... my kid brother, Matt.
The best man I know.
I don't know how he did it, but he did it right.
- Yeah.
- To the best man.
- Hear!
Hear!
- Yeah.
- I love you, Matt.
- Thanks.
I do.
[Hushed Chattering]
[Tires Screeching]
[Glass Breaking]
We don't see any internal injuries... any other fractures, and the skull looks okay.
So, we're gonna keep him down here till tomorrow for observation.
- [Phil Sighs]
- But I think he's gonna be okay.
[Phil] Uh-huh.
Did he say anything?
Is he conscious?
- I mean, how did this happen?
- I can't tell you that.
But he's lucky.
Very lucky.
[Lisa] May I see him?
Please?
Sure.
One person only though.
Now, it looks a lot worse than it is.
Excuse me.
Could you tell me?
I was wondering, what was the alcohol level of his blood?
There's a law now, isn't there, that you have to check... the blood alcohol level of a person in a car accident?
He wasn't drunk, Mrs. Carter, legally or otherwise.
No drugs either.
I'll check back on you in a little while.
[Monitor Beeping]
- Ohh.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Wow.
What's going on?
You were in a car accident.
You drove your car off the road and into a telephone pole.
Look, um, I tried to call Allison... but I couldn't find her number.
Allison.
[Groans]
[Sighs] Karen, uh...
- You okay?
- Yeah.
It's just, um...
Well, listen, uh...
Don't tell anyone about this.
What?
Well, uh, Allison is...
What?
Allison decided she's not gonna marry me.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
[Sighs] I know.
- Is that why she left early?
- Uh-huh.
Why?
I mean...
Karen, I can't...
I'll tell you about this later.
I don't have the energy to go into it now.
But we'll have a long talk eventually.
- Yeah, okay.
- Oh, and, Karen, you know...
Yeah, I'll keep Mom out of this until you can deal with it.
- Thanks.
- God.
Well, look, I was thinking we can go ahead with the wedding anyways.
I don't know.
I think people will notice if she doesn't show up.
God.
[Laughing]
Well, it's just our family.
No...
No, I mean, I'm sorry.
I know this is really, really terrible for you...
[Laughing]
- But, um...
- you think you can wait till Tom and I leave to tell Mom?
- Yes.
- Wow.
- I really...
I am sorry.
I'm really sorry.
[Matt] As best I can remember, I turned the corner... and there was this miniature collie in the middle of the road... and it looked up at me, and it had the strangest expression on its little face... and it was just frozen there, and I-I... turned the steering wheel and I hit my brake.
And that's it.
That's all I can remember.
That happens all the time, people doing that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Except for, Matt, next time, kill the dog.
Just aim your car straight for the dog and kill it.
I'm just telling you this on behalf of the insurance company.
Oh, by the way, we tried to reach Allison... but we couldn't find the right number... and I'm pretty sure her parents have unlisted phones.
They have unlisted addresses, Mom.
That's all right.
I called her this afternoon, and, uh... she wanted to come up, but I told her not to.
You know, she's very frightened that my cast is going to upstage her at the wedding.
That was so funny.
- Yeah, it was.
I almost hurt myself, Mom.
- He did.
[Knocking]
- Come in.
I asked the people at the desk if there was anyone here before I came back.
I thought, you know, this early...
You're okay, right?
So I'm told.
Kyle, why are you here?
You know, I heard...
I heard you had an accident.
Okay.
I'll go.
I'm sorry.
Wait.
Wait.
It's not that I...
I-I can't see you right now.
All right.
All right.
Kyle!
Kyle, wait a second!
[Door Closes]
[Bell Dings]
- Who else?
[Lisa] Andy's father.
- Get out.
- No, he called from California.
- Get out.
- More to make sure, I think, that Andy was in no way responsible.
Oh, now, who sent these?
You want me to open this?
Uh, no.
Mom, I got a problem here.
Thanks.
- Ah, you know, it seems cool in here.
Too cool.
- Mom...
- Are you chilly?
Is it cold in here to you?
- Mom...
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm going to ask the nurse.
I'll be right back.
So Matt's coming back tomorrow.
Oh, yeah.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I'm just... tired, I guess.
Oh.
I called in and, uh, checked our messages.
Mm-hmm.
Dr. Bridges's office wanted to confirm your appointment next week.
Okay.
- Well, who's Dr. Bridges?
- Uh, he's, uh...
Oh, how you say it?
He's a...
I don't know the name of the specialty.
My last checkup, I had a low iron count.
Well, why didn't you say something?
Look.
It's nothing.
It's a dietary thing.
It's nothing to get dramatic about.
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Nothing.
Look how well he's walking, Phil.
Better than yesterday.
Come on.
I'll race him in.
- Phil?
- Yeah?
I wanna put those flowers upstairs.
Sweetheart...
We thank you for this food which we are about to receive.
We hope Allison and her family are well.
We're grateful to be here together, but we're grateful most of all... for the safety of our family and for the quick recovery of Matt.
For this and all our many blessings, we thank you.
- Amen.
- Amen.
[Chattering]
Gee.
I really wish I could help.
- Uh-huh.
- I do.
Right.
I believe you.
- I drove by that telephone pole today.
- What telephone pole?
The telephone pole Matt ran into.
Curious thing about it was that you could follow the path the car took... once it went off the highway... but there were no skid marks.
It was literally like...
- like Matt just deliberately drove it off the road.
- Tim, what is wrong with you?
- I am fed up with your...
- I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to Matt!
Is that what happened?
What the hell is the matter with you?
Look, man.
Say something, okay?
You're scaring me a little.
- Matt, what is this?
- [Sighs]
I didn't have a car accident, Andy.
I drove my car off the road on purpose.
What?
Why would you do something like that?
Allison decided she's not gonna marry me.
Oh, man.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
- Really.
But why, man?
I mean, what happened?
She seemed like she was really...
[Breathes Deeply]
We're friends no matter what.
Right?
I can't even believe you would ask me this.
Of course we're friends.
What the hell is goin' on?
Allison doesn't wanna marry me... because I'm gay.
Really?
Yeah.
Really.
[Mouths Words, Chuckles]
I mean, hey, you can't really blame her for not wanting to marry you.
I mean, there's a lot of things you can overlook in a relationship... but...
I don't think this is one of'em.
How are you gonna explain this to your parents?
I don't know.
- Don't hug me.
- Geez, it doesn't mean I wanna marry you.
[Chuckles] No, it's the ribs.
[Laughs] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You know something?
You're my best friend.
You're my best friend in the whole world.
The best friend I ever had.
You know?
Same here.
Hey, this doesn't mean you're gonna start hummir...
Broadway show tunes on long car trips, does it?
[Laughs] Shut up.
I was just checkin'.
[Chuckles]
[Tom] No, I'm still on hold.
No, I'm waiting for Dr. Bridges.
All right.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, um...
This is Tom Gregg.
I...
My wife, Karen, has an appointment with you next week.
Um...
And, well, I know it sounds kind of crazy, but...
Should I be worried about anything?
I mean, she says it's not...
Yeah, I'm still here.
Um...
I don't know.
I mean, is she...
I can't...
Can you tell me...
Something about the first trimester?
[Ball Bounces] [Shoes Squeaking]
Pressure on.
[Chattering]
- How ya doin'?
Okay?
- Yeah.
Lisa?
- What is it, honey?
[Matt] Mom?
How dare you.
What?
[Lisa] How dare you embarrass your father and me like this.
How dare you lie to me.
- What?
- Lisa!
You told me Allison was going home to see her parents.
I have a note.
I have a note here from Allison saying thank you... and how sorry she is.
What's going on, son?
What have you done?
Well, Allison and I...
We decided we're not gonna get married, Dad.
B-But I was gonna tell you, but...
"But?"
"But"?
But what?
But what?
You were going to tell me, but you didn't?
Look, Mom, we're not getting married.
That's all.
I think it's better we leave it at that.
No, I don't think so.
The invitations have already gone out.
People know!
- I think...
I want an explanation.
- Mom...
You better start explaining yourself, young man.
You owe me an explanation!
You already know.
You know exactly why.
You want me to say it?
- Don't talk to me that way.
- Lower your voice.
No!
You want me to say it?
I didn't swerve to avoid a dog.
I swerved to avoid living this life!
- I thought it would be better to be dead than tell you...
- I've heard enough...
No, you haven't!
I tried to kill myself.
- No, you didn't.
You had...
You had an accident.
- No!
No!
No!
I thought it would be better to be dead...
- No!
No, you had...
- Mom!
- I thought it'd be better to be dead than...
- No...
Yes!
Than to tell you I was gay!
I drove the car off the road on purpose.
I did it on purpose, Mom.
On purpose.
Yes!
On purpose.
- No, you didn't.
- I did it on purpose.
- No!
- She knows.
Mom, you know.
You walked in on me and Kyle two years ago.
I won't listen to this.
I will not have these things said in my house.
Now, you call Allison and you tell her that you're wrong... that you made a mistake.
You go to hell.
- Matt!
- Go to hell!
- Matt!
- Go to hell!
Leave him alone.
- What?
- I said just leave him alone.
[Door Closes]
How does it feel, Captain?
What?
How does it feel to almost lose your child?
How bad does it feel?
[Karen] Tom.
- I don't know what's come over you, Tom... but I don't think this is any of your concern.
I'm sorry, Phil.
I'm 32 years old.
You don't get to decide what concerns me.
Your standard of conduct might be sufficient reason for you to lose your child... but I have to draw the line when it comes to losing mine.
What children?
You don't have any children.
No, I don't.
I don't have any children.
I don't.
Because my wife would rather have an abortion without telling me... without even telling me she's pregnant... rather than risk upsetting you by having a baby at the wrong time.
You have a son who drinks himself...
- into a stupor every night.
- Oh, God, Tom.
You've got a daughter who's ashamed of her husband.
- I am not ashamed.
- Who's ashamed of her husband... you're ashamed of me, Karen...
and you've got another son... who almost killed himself rather than tell you he's not what you think he is.
And I'm not prepared to be a parent?
Because I can't afford it?
Really?
- It's about money?
- Tom, we're not gonna talk about this now.
No?
When are we gonna talk about it?
When someone actually dies?
Would that be better?
What's the military term for it? "Acceptable losses", isn't it?
Well, these are not acceptable losses.
I can't accept them.
I can't.
[Knocking]
Is what you said true?
Yeah.
Yeah, Dad, I'm gay.
No, I'm not talkin' about that.
I can't deal with that right now.
I mean about driving the car off the road.
About trying to kill yourself.
Is that the truth?
Yeah, it is, Dad.
W...
Was it because...
Did you really think we'd rather have you dead?
I don't know.
Dad, it's hard to know.
Well, I wouldn't.
I wouldn't rather have you dead.
No matter what you did.
No matter what you are.
[Sighs]
Listen, um...
Can you...
Can you promise your father... that you won't do that again?
Now, I know...
I know things are gonna be a little tough around here, but...
I wouldn't survive it, Matt.
It would kill me.
Promise me.
Okay.
I promise.
Okay.
[Sniffles] Did you talk to Matt?
[Sighs] Yeah.
Well, is he gonna call her?
Lisa, I don't think that's a very good idea right now.
What do you mean?
You're just...
You're just gonna let him get away with it?
Get away with what?
[Scoffs]
What am I letting him get away with?
With embarrassing us.
With humiliating us.
Maybe it's not about us.
Maybe it's about him.
What are you t...
Of course it's about us.
All of it.
I...
I've spent my entire life sacrificing... so m-my children can have a future.
So they can be something.
Don't...
Don't tell me it's not about us.
It is us.
This is us.
What do you want from him, Lisa?
Would you rather have his brains smashed around the street?
Or see him hanging in the garage?
What is it you want?
Do you love your children, Lisa?
Whatever they are, they're our children.
It's a lie.
It's all a lie.
No, it's not a lie.
This is a lie!
- And that's a lie.
- Lisa!
Lisa.
- What are you doing?
- And this is a lie...
- No.
No, it's not a lie.
- This is...
Lisa.
Tom, please.
Please what?
It seemed like...
What choice do I have?
Tom, it's my body.
Fine.
This is my body, and I can do with it what I want... and right now, I want to take it home.
- I wanted to tell you.
- Well, now you don't have to.
I didn't want to go behind your back.
But you did, and I can't live like that.
I'll make allowances for you 'cause I know that's the way you were raised, but, uh...
I'm not your parents.
So why lie to me?
- 'Cause I'm afraid.
- Of course you are.
Maybe we're not meant to be parents, but we have to discuss it, Karen.
First, you have to come to a decision... because I've put you first in this marriage all along.
I love my parents a lot, but, um...
I'm your husband first, and they know that.
I'm sorry, Tom.
I'm sorry.
I know.
I want to have it.
I do.
Really.
I do.
I just...
What if I end up being like her?
I don't wanna be like her.
Hey.
- [Sniffles]
- It could be worse.
What if I got to be like your dad?
- [Laughs] - [Chuckles]
You know I'm a mess.
I'm gonna worry 100% of the time.
[Sniffles] I'll have to take off work for a while.
I told you a hundred times I'd get an extra job.
And I meant it.
It would help if you wouldn't be so nice.
[Chuckles] Let's go ask your parents how nice I am.
- No.
I think we'd better just get out of here.
- Yeah.
Mom.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry for wrecking the car and hurting myself the way I did.
I know you had to go to a lot of extra trouble.
And I'm sorry this wedding thing has happened too.
I know you don't understand.
I don't expect you to, Mom.
But I did want you to know that I was sorry.
[Sniffles] I don't...
I don't understand how anyone could choose to be like this.
It's just, uh...
It is not to be understood.
I didn't choose this.
I am this.
Mom, I didn't choose to be gay.
Do you think I'd choose to be this different from everyone else... that I'd choose to make you and Dad this upset... and I'd choose to lose someone as beautiful and wonderful as Allison?
And what about AIDS?
I mean, suppose somebody wanted to be gay.
Would they want to be gay now?
I don't know.
And I don't want to know.
Then you don't wanna know me either.
[Sobbing]
[Glass Rattling]
Hello, Kyle.
W-W-Wait.
Don't hang up.
Uh...
I'm really sorry.
And I was calling to say that...
No.
I'm callin' from a pay phone.
Well, things are a little nuts at my house right now.
I'll talk to you about that later if you want.
But, uh...
What I was wondering is if...
Uh...
What I'd like to know is if... we could possibly go for a cup of coffee?
'Cause I really need to talk to you.
Please.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.
Whatcha doin'?
Oh, I don't know.
Waiting for you to come home, I guess.
You didn't have to do that.
Look, you have a son who almost kills himself... and then write a book about what you're supposed to do and how you're supposed to react.
- How about that?
- Sorry.
Yeah, it's been hard on you.
It's your bad luck to be born into a family... where people don't always know the right thing to do or say.
I got it.
Homosexual.
There.
I said it.
Didn't make me sick or anything.
That's pretty good, Dad.
I-I think the word, uh, "gay" is a little easier.
I don't like that word.
That's a perfectly good word that's been destroyed, and I don't like it.
Okay.
Since I have said the word... uh, can I ask you a few questions?
Because...
I mean, do you mind?
I'm just... trying to think through this properly.
Okay.
Go ahead.
I mean...
I've been thinking about this because I've heard it before.
What do you say about this thing... about God hating homosexuals... about homosexuals being unnatural or...
or going to hell?
What do you say about that?
I don't know.
I can't tell you, Dad.
Well, I think we should look into that, don't you?
No, not really.
I don't believe that.
Well, what you believe isn't factual.
If you go around telling people that you're a... that you're a homosexual... sooner or later, someone's gonna say this... and you should know how to defend yourself.
That's all I'm saying.
I'm not thrilled about this, and I don't want to give you the wrong idea.
I would rather you be normal.
I think I am normal.
Don't quibble with me.
You know what I mean.
Yes, sir.
But whatever you are, you're my son.
And I...
I'm, uh...
That's all.
You're my son.
And I don't think I want people... saying things like that about my son... without knowing how to respond.
So we should look into that.
You may not know this, but Alexander the Great... who I happen to think was a damn good general...
Alexander the Great was a homosexual too.
I love you, Dad.
I love you too, son.
Did you give your friend back his stuff?
Oh, yeah.
He wasn't there, so I left it in his room.
How'd you get in if he wasn't there?
His roommate let me in.
What kind of question is that?
I thought you broke in or something.
I don't know.
Now, don't worry about this tablecloth.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Oh, that is really nice.
Don't be nervous.
She's the one who's supposed to be nervous.
Yeah, well, if her family just wasn't so rich.
She's not marrying Matt for his money.
That's good, because if she is, she's in for a terrible surprise.
Matt was saying that he didn't think she'd ever seen artificial fabric... before she went to college.
Oh.
This is so nice.
I wish somebody had gone to all this trouble for me when I was getting married.
- Give me the glasses.
- I got'em.
You smell like alcohol.
Take the back way, go up the stairs to the shower... run it hot until it's all gone and you've sweated the liquor out.
Well, if I'm such a screw up that I can't even go in the front door of my own house...
You want to go in the front door, Tim?
You go ahead.
Go in the front door and go hug your mother.
Is that what you want to do?
Then why don't you do it?
- I said I was sorry.
- I'm tired of you being sorry, Tim.
I am worn out with sorry.
Instead of being so damn sorry all the time, you might just try a little discipline.
Phil, is that you?
Tim?
- You're late.
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, good.
You remembered the glasses.
And the shrimp.
Aren't you good.
Yeah.
I thought we weren't gonna make a big deal of this.
Matt said that we shouldn't make a big deal of things.
Oh.
Phil, a tablecloth isn't a big deal.
A tablecloth is a tablecloth.
Where's Tim?
- Upstairs.
He's, uh...
- What?
Nothing.
Uh...
The toilet had a thing today.
Somebody stuffed it with little creamer packages.
I could have brought you a tablecloth from the restaurant.
For this size table?
What are you talking about, Phil?
Come on.
Allison is used to nice things.
Did you have to call the plumber?
For what?
- For the toilet.
- Oh.
No.
No, uh...
Tim got it.
He just kept at it.
See?
I don't know why you worry about him so much.
- Hey, there she is!
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!
- Mom?
- In the kitchen.
Thank you.
We almost did find a tenant, but he got arrested two days before he moved in.
So I guess it turned out to be a good thing.
Except that we turned down a really nice couple.
Karen, uh, cut the celery in half before you slice it.
- What?
- In half.
Here.
Like this.
Oh.
Okay.
Anyway, this nice couple would have been great... except they tried to bargain with us, which irritated Tom.
I would have tried to bargain too.
You never know.
It doesn't hurt to ask.
Considering we don't get free rent unless the whole place is full... we can't really afford to hold a grudge.
Anyway, when we called them back, they'd already found...
What do you think?
Should I put these out now, or should I wait until Matt and Allison get here?
- Uh, whatever.
- Hmm.
Having children is an economic thing too, though.
You have to plan for it.
And have some kind of savings.
I've always thought that if you've got the love, then everything else...
Lisa quit teaching school the moment Karen was born.
It was a decision we were prepared to make... because we had worked and saved for it.
That's what you have to do.
Right.
Right.
So...
- Is this it?
- Yes.
This is it.
This is it.
Wow.
You've seen the pond where I twisted my ankle.
Right?
You've seen the church where I was confirmed.
Right?
My dad's restaurant.
Now, this is the high school... where I became an intellectual giant.
- Come on.
- Matt...
Come on.
This is the romantic part.
This is where it all began.
Where I wrote my first published work for the Viking Ledger.
Won my first debate in interscholastic competition.
And I scored so well on my National Merit Test... that I got a scholarship to Yale... and met Allison Hall, the girl I'm gonna marry.
The woman you're going to marry.
- That's a 10.
- Ten, 11, 12, 13.
- That's a double.
- Whoa.
- That's 26.
- I'm still winning.
- Twenty-six.
- What have I got here?
Tim, save some of those for Matt and Allison.
- All right.
It's my turn.
- Gross.
- Shoot.
- Where are they?
They're here.
They just drove up.
- Oh, but I'm winning.
- Of course you are.
- You've got both blanks, two S's, the "J."
- Oh, pout.
You haven't opened up the game once.
That's why you're winning.
You're a leech.
- Is the "Q" still out?
- Don't look at my letters.
We're finishing this after dinner.
Here you are!
Traffic is murder from New Haven.
- Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.
Allison, please call me "Phil." Come in.
You must be starving.
- Hi.
- Traffic was terrible.
- I'm so glad you're home.
- Traffic's tough.
- It is.
- Get out of here.
Mmm, something smells good.
This is something else.
- Here's a picture of me and Allison.
- Whoa.
- Sorry.
- Watch it, Dad.
Gonna poke somebody's eye out.
Here's a picture of yours truly and his bride-to-be... on the most amazing yacht you have ever seen.
- Look at that.
- Oh.
That's incredible.
Look at that.
Wow.
This belongs to your father?
Well, yeah, but we never really use it.
It belongs to his business.
If we want to take it out, we have to pay to, unless it's a company thing.
Look at it.
Great paint job.
Dear God, we are thankful today to be here as a family.
We thank you for this food and the work you have given us to provide it.
We especially thank you for bringing Allison into our family.
We pray that you will bless Matt and Allison and their marriage... as you have blessed us.
This we humbly ask in your name.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Well, here's to Allison and Matt.
Cheers.
The church was built in 1852.
It's incredible.
And the chapel was named after one of Allison's relatives.
Oh, no.
It's a distant relative.
And by marriage.
My family really isn't involved with the chur...
You won't believe who's being invited to the wedding.
The Kennedys.
The Pattersons.
Diane Sawyer.
The Kennedys.
Wait.
Will you stop it?
You know what?
We don't know them.
I mean, my dad does business with them, or he raised money for them.
- I don't even know which.
- Karen campaigned for one of the Kennedys.
- Who was it?
- Joseph Kennedy.
Of course, we didn't know them either.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Well, we could have.
We have a restaurant.
That's where all those congressmen seem to spend their time.
Speaking of restaurants, Andy is driving me nuts about your bachelor party.
I think he's taking this best man thing too seriously.
He even called me the other day when I was teaching class.
I didn't see Kyle's name on the invitation list.
What happened to Kyle?
Are we through?
Anyone want seconds?
- I'll have some pie.
- Is Kyle coming?
- He's transferring to Duke.
- Not until the fall, is he?
- Oh, no.
- What?
What's the matter?
- I forgot to get the sherbet for tonight.
- Sherbet with pie?
No, you.
It...
It's for the punch.
It goes in the punch.
Your mother likes it.
- Uh, Matt, honey...
- Want me to get it?
I'll get it.
No problem.
- I'll go with you.
- No, let my family entertain you for a couple of minutes.
- I've got money, Mom.
- Well, I, um...
No, really.
It's really close.
I'll be right back.
- What kind, Mom?
- A half gallon of lime sherbet.
- Try not to miss me too much.
All right?
- Okay.
So when's everyone coming?
- Soon.
- Thanks, son.
So, uh, Andy's gonna be the best man.
It's definite.
I told you that.
I think it's something... something I would probably remember.
Lisa?
- Lisa?
- Yeah.
Why don't we save the pie for when everyone is here?
All right.
Over here.
The youngest pictures are at the bottom... and then work their way up to as close to the present as we can be.
We moved around a lot when the children were young.
I guess if we had anything to do over... we would have stayed in one place... or at least settled down a little sooner.
Still, wherever we went, there was always a room... except Korea.
There was always a room like this one... and after we got everything moved in... we'd all come in and take a place on the wall... and just start putting everything back up again.
I think it gave them continuity.
Yeah, no doubt about it.
We've always tried to find ways to strengthen our identity as a family.
- I promise this will be over soon.
- It's perfectly fine.
Uh, Karen.
By the way, thanks a lot for telling Tim about Andy.
I thought you had told him.
Do you hate me now?
- Yep.
- Matt.
You're awful.
- Almost there.
- Are you going to West Point, Timmy?
No, I don't think so, Granny.
I'm too old for West Point now.
Your father will be so happy.
- I'll go then.
- What time is it?
Phil.
Gene.
Come on.
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- Judy?
Cindy.
I can't decide whether this is one of the benefits or the shortcomings... having a professional photographer for a son-in-law.
I wasn't aware there were any shortcomings.
Cindy, come on.
- How are you, Mom?
- Oh, uh, Uncle Gene.
This is our first picture with Allison, so try not to make any noises with your body.
Thank you very much.
Phil, smile.
Please, look like you're having a good time.
Okay, everybody.
All right.
Ready?
- Set.
- Is it set?
- Go.
- All right, everybody.
Think "love."
There we go.
That was good.
- It's a math problem.
- Oh.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm kind of scary-looking in the morning.
Uh, you mind if I play through?
- They're waiting on me downstairs.
- Oh, sure.
Thanks.
Whoa.
The hair fairies came and danced on my head last night.
Um, what is this about a math problem?
Oh, well... it's either a math problem or a history question... or a geography something or other.
You're kidding.
"I was the first man elected to the presidency of the United States... who was born under the American flag."
"Martin Van Buren." Who does this?
- Dad.
- Still?
He's done it ever since we were little kids.
You know, math problem.
Something he likes to call "vocabulary builders."
He has a lot of time on his hands.
It's funny, actually, if we get the answer right.
Yeah?
What if you don't get the answer right?
Well, it's still funny... but for entirely different reasons.
Come on, Miss Grable!
Well, at least it was better than one of our family parties.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My family almost never gets together without a lawyer.
Yea!
Way to go!
- He's so funny.
- Yeah, I spend all my time here laughing.
- He doesn't like me much.
- Really?
Well, I married his daughter and kept her from becoming a great novelist.
Oh, well, that was mean of you.
The whole concept of art photography... is not something Phil appreciates, you know.
Wedding photos, no problem.
He likes wedding photos, but the whole idea that somebody might... spend a lot of money on expensive equipment... you know, turn their apartment into a studio... that's very challenging for him.
Aaah.
No fair, no fair, wounding an older man.
Ha-ha-ha!
Is Tim in school, or is he just...
- No, he flunked out.
- Really.
- He seems pretty smart.
- He is.
He also looks a little hung over, doesn't he?
Oops.
You know Tim used to be R.O.T.C.?
Yeah, Matt said he wanted to go to West Point.
I'm not sure about that.
I think Phil wanted him to go to West Point.
Tim just wanted to do whatever Phil wanted.
But I think he didn't end up having the grades... or, um, the captain didn't have the connections or something.
But you're right though.
Tim is...
Tim is pretty smart.
There you go.
Nice!
Come on, Tim!
I'd love to see some of these pictures on the wall.
You've seen the wall?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What, um...
What was Matt supposed to be?
Matt?
Well, given the way Karen and Tim have turned out... it doesn't really matter much what Matt does.
Really?
No.
See, he just has to be perfect.
And, um, if he isn't perfect... just keep it to yourself, because I don't think anybody in this family wants to know.
- Come on!
- Yes!
All right.
40-love.
Set point.
Come on, Tim.
Set point.
Come on.
This is set point.
Right?
Set point?
Yes, this is set point.
Out.
Wait, wait, wait.
Okay.
Come on, Karen.
We're waitin'.
In!
Yes!
- Yea!
- Good game.
Uhh!
- Ow!
- What the hell's the matter with you?
What do you want?
I couldn't get it.
I would never have made that shot.
What are you hitting me for?
I'm not hitting you because you missed the shot.
I am hitting you because you didn't try.
Good game, Karen.
Good game.
Good game, Matt.
Say something to him.
Gotta let'em win every now and then... or they get discouraged.
Come here.
- You played so well, your father let you win.
- Isn't he nice?
- Tim, you all right?
- I'm not playing anymore.
This is it.
- Hey, look, it's...
- Leave me alone.
All right?
All I did is ask you, Tim.
- I said leave me alone.
Okay?
Leave me alone!
- Okay, fine.
Three months of driver ed.
One month with a simulator.
One month of behind-the-wheel practice with an instructor.
And the day you get your license... with absolutely no training whatsoever... you can crawl into the backseat... and congratulations, you're a parent.
What do you think that says about our society?
Now he's started, "No one knows how to be a good parent."
This isn't about the back seat of cars?
I can't stand this.
The most important part of parenting...
Well, not the most important part.
I guess, reasonably, you can't break it down that way.
- It's preparation.
It's key.
Key!
- Hey, look!
It's the Carters, and they're taking their women out for a walk!
- Hey, Tom.
Hey.
- How ya doin', Andy?
How are you, young man?
- Hey, Andy.
How ya doin'?
- This is Allison Hall.
- I'm Andy Paulson.
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Matt told me all about you.
- Just remember...
Matt is jealous because I'm more popular than he is, and he can't stand it.
Hey.
I've got to get to work.
I'll see you later, Andy.
- See you later, Captain.
- We're coming, Dad.
- Yeah.
- So, Andy, what are you doing today?
- I'm going with you guys.
- Oh, no!
Hey, Tom!
Put your wife on a leash!
You guys played a good game.
You looked like professionals out there.
Give me a hand in the car here, Matt.
I got some stuff.
Sure thing.
I just, uh...
I wanted to tell you how much your mother and I like Allison.
I knew you would, Dad.
There's a couple of things I want to ask you.
- Okay.
- But, uh...
You know, I, uh...
- I don't want to pry.
- All right.
All right.
What I want to know here is if you are really and truly committed to Allison.
- For better, for worse and all that?
- Yes, I'm completely committed.
And you know what you're doing?
Did you?
I mean...
Well...
Sometimes, uh, we feel like we're... locked into something that we can't back out of.
It's like the French in World War I.
- You know that story.
- The Guns of August.
I read that in my eighth-grade summer.
Yeah, well, that was a disaster.
So, you really and truly love this girl.
Yep.
I do.
Well, that's all that matters.
Well, I appreciate your asking, Dad.
All right.
Take this to the basement for me, will you?
Yes, sir.
What?
So, a bachelor party, huh?
What can happen?
It's gonna be in the back room of my dad's restaurant.
What?
I don't know.
Just something about being here and seeing you with your family... and all these things that you grew up with.
Mmm.
I'm sorry.
This is making you uncomfortable, isn't it?
What?
Well, I'm being a little too pushy.
I'm sorry.
Oh, that's okay.
You don't have to be sorry.
Later.
We're supposed to be on vacation.
We're not on vacation.
We're visiting my parents.
Do you have any idea how tense you are?
Yeah, it's all that talk about raising children.
It makes me nuts.
Why?
Tom.
Karen.
We can't afford it.
We can't afford two of us, much less three of us.
I could work part-time somewhere.
That is my parents talking.
- Why should you work five million hours a week...
- No, listen, Tom.
I'm not ready to have a child.
You are not ready to have a child.
By the time you think we're ready...
Do you realize what my parents would say if I were to get pregnant now?
You know how Daddy is about planning and preparation.
And the money.
Surprise, surprise.
I didn't marry your daddy.
I married you.
It's our decision.
If they don't like it, they can just take a cruise till our kids are through college.
I'm trying to imagine Daddy on a cruise.
A long, long, long, long...
- Tom!
- Long, long...
Hey, Nick, old buddy.
Have a nice couple days off?
Yeah, went out with my folks on the boat.
- You ready for Matt's party tomorrow?
- Yep.
Pass me a Cape Codder over there, would you?
Is there a problem of some kind?
Look, I can't.
You can't?
What do you mean?
You should talk about it with your dad.
Okay?
You're saying my father told you I can't...
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I've been looking over the books here... and, you know, uh, there's S200 missing from petty cash.
- Oh.
I borrowed it.
- What for?
- Excuse me?
- What would you like me to list it as?
- Oh.
- Blackmail?
Extortion?
Hush money?
What?
- Blackmail?
- Six months ago...
I noticed the day after the health inspector came... you borrowed S150 from petty cash... and you listed it as cleanup expenses.
- We can list it as that.
- What's the point of this?
I'll tell you what the point is.
I'm tired of pretending, you know, that you're the great dispenser... of orders and values and goodness... and I'm some kind of criminal because I want a drink in the afternoon.
Fine.
I'm only doing this because I give up on you.
Nick?
Make the kid a drink if he wants a drink, and write it off to inventory.
I'm sorry.
I should have told him myself.
All right?
There.
Are you satisfied?
Oh, yeah.
I'm really satisfied.
- You've made my life worth living.
- Oh, for God sakes.
You know, I resent...
I really resent the way you look down on me.
I try.
I'm here.
I'm doing something.
It's not like you're so much better than me.
It's not like you're perfect.
And if I want a drink in the afternoon right now... then I think I should have it.
I don't have to explain it to you.
I'm through explaining things to you!
I've done my time on Maple Drive.
Okay?
So I flunked out of school.
So what?
Why couldn't we have just told Mom I flunked out of school?
Huh?
I didn't kill anyone.
I had a bad time.
So what?
Why can't we tell her and just move on?
Why?
What's gonna happen?
What's gonna happen if we just sit down and say it out loud, Dad?
Look...
If I have to live this way...
I think I deserve a drink now and then.
If I want it.
Okay?
I think it's what I deserve.
Why do you do it here?
Why don't you do it somewhere else?
Why do you force me to watch it?
Because I think it's what you deserve.
What I deserve?
I think you should know, Tim... the last few days, every time I have seen you... every time I have looked at you... the only response I have had is to thank God I have another son.
You have all the advantages.
That doesn't work for me.
I look at you, and there isn't anyone else.
You're the only father I've got.
Which one of us is worse off?
I wonder.
If music be the food of love... play on.
Give me excess of it... that, surfeiting... the appetite may sicken, and so die.
- One more time.
- No, no!
Come on!
It's the fourth time we've watched it.
- This guy's my hero.
- This is brilliant.
- One more time.
- Oh, come on, you guys.
No.
No.
This is the fourth time.
- Put on me.
Get to me.
- I'm tired of watching that guy.
Oh, that's great.
Just what I want to do, watch you.
Okay, here it is.
Here it is.
Hold on, now.
Oh, hello.
Hello.
- I'm Andrew Paulson...
- Geek.
And as president of this class, and therefore the most important senior on this entire tape... and also as an example to my peers...
I am pleased to admit that I am going to spend my entire future...
- groveling for money as a sleazy advertising executive!
- Yeah!
I want to say hello to Julie... and good luck to Kyle and Matt when they get to Yale... and thank you, Mr. Edwards, for putting up with us this entire year.
And a hearty congratulations to Sylvester Stallone on Rocky IV!
Yeah!
Rocky!
Yeah!
I swear, you can't believe...
They took, like, three weeks telling us... how serious and sincere and honest we had to be... for this video thing, and...
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait.
- Wait.
Just let me see this person.
- Wait?
Push'em back!
Okay.
Um, my name's Kyle Trainer, and, uh, I'm trying not to smile.
That's the guy from the picture on your wall.
I was on the staff of the school paper and on the debate team... and Matt Carter and I went to State, and we came in third place.
Did that sound memorized?
Okay.
Anyway, here it is.
Thor is graduating, and I've enjoyed drawing him these past two years... even though Mr. Carlson hasn't always liked what he had to say.
- Hope he made you laugh.
- Obviously, Kyle was paying attention during study hall... because this looks very, very sincere to me.
It's been the best time of my life so far... and I'm gonna miss it and all my friends.
That's it.
He goes to Yale?
He was.
He's, uh, transferring.
Really?
Why?
How should I know?
I haven't seen him in months.
Have you?
I haven't seen him since high school, except when he was with you.
- All right.
We gotta go.
- No, you're not leaving yet.
- Yes, we have to.
- Oh, what time you have to leave tomorrow?
Oh, fairly early.
I promised my parents I'd be on the Vineyard by tomorrow night.
"On the Vineyard." Did you hear that?
"The Vineyard." Ooh.
"The Vineyard."
Whatcha thinkin'?
Oh, nothing.
It's silly.
Nah, it couldn't be.
Not if you're thinking it.
- Oh, it is.
- What?
- I'm terrified.
- You're terrified.
Of what?
Thanks.
Remember what you said?
About being in love with someone... and how it never works out the first time?
Yeah.
Well, this is the first time... that I've ever been in love with someone.
I mean, really, really in love.
I mean, I love you so much it scares me.
And...
I would do anything for you, Matt.
All you have to do is ask.
Ow.
Good night.
Good night.
Who is it?
It's me.
Hey.
Wow, it's, uh...
You look mad or something.
Yeah.
As much as I don't want to be...
I am a little mad... and I'm trying not to be, but it's really hard.
I just keep trying to keep in mind... that when you're expected to be the perfect child... that you probably have to learn how to lie at a really early age.
Oh...
Allison, what... what are you talking about?
I don't know how to begin this.
- Matt, I love you.
- I love you too.
- W
- What...
- Just...
But we can't do this.
I haven't slept all night.
I've just been up... and I've been sitting and I've been thinking... and I've been going over stuff, and I'm sorry, but we can't.
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, Allison.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Shh.
Shh.
Here.
Here.
You know... the funny thing is in the back of my mind...
I always thought that...
I always thought that you might be gay.
And I hated myself for thinking it... because I thought it was my fault.
Look, Allison, I am not gay.
- I have never been gay.
- Oh, God!
Allison, shh.
All right, all right.
I've had the feelings, Allison, but...
- Matt, you had a relationship.
You had an ongoing relationship.
- Shh.
You were in love with this guy.
If you love me, don't lie to me.
I am not your family!
All right, all right.
I don't, Allison.
I won't.
Now, please.
Shh.
Allison, Allison.
- What?
- Baby, please don't do this to me.
- I can change.
I've been trying, Allison.
- Matt...
You can try all you want, but you can't be somebody else.
Allison, please.
Please don't do this to me.
Please don't do this to me.
I'm trying.
Matt, I don't think this is the kind of thing that you can talk yourself out of.
Matt, I can't go through with something like this... because your parents are gonna be upset with you.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna get out of here before they get up.
Allison, no.
Now, how am I gonna explain that?
How am I gonna explain that?
Matt.
Allison, please.
You can't tell people I'm gay.
You can't go around saying...
You can't go around saying that, 'cause it's not true.
- Okay.
- My par...
Allison...
My parents would die.
They would die, Allison.
Please don't do this to me.
Please don't do this to me.
- Please don't do this to me.
- Okay.
- Baby, please don't do this to me.
- Listen to me.
Matt, I am not angry with you.
All right?
And I will not tell anybody about you and Kyle.
What you say, that's your decision.
Matt, I have to go.
I have to go.
- Allison, please.
- It's okay.
I have to go.
I know you don't want to see me anymore, so I'm not here.
Just put my stuff on the bed and leave the key with it.
I was thinking today, after you called... about the day you first told me how you felt.
Those were the best three years of my life... and because of that, the last eight months have been hell.
Sometimes I think you'll call or something... that you'll say at least we can be friends.
But I guess that's not going to happen.
So, I hope, for your sake, that you have a great marriage and a happy life.
Maybe someday you might want to see me.
Until then, good luck.
Love, Kyle.
P.S. Thanks for bringing back my stuff.
Scott goes four for four.
Good morning, son.
- Good morning, Dad.
- Good morning.
- Ah, Karen?
- Hmm?
- Isn't that your third bowl of cereal?
- No.
- I think it is.
- Well, it isn't.
- Matt, honey?
- Hmm?
Isn't Allison coming to church with us this morning?
Hmm?
Oh, that's right.
You guys were asleep when we got back from Andy's last night.
Allison had to leave.
She's already gone.
- What?
- Well...
She called her parents, and they were confused, um... 'cause they planned this big lunch for her and thought she was coming back this morning.
- So she left around 6:00.
- Oh, Matt.
That's a shame.
Well, she told me to tell you guys what a nice time she had... and, uh, she can't wait to see everyone again.
She was very impressed with you guys.
Could you pass the milk, please?
She is such a sweet girl.
Yeah.
- Zip!
- Whoo!
- Come on!
- Get down.
Here it comes!
Here it comes.
- Come on.
- Whoo!
- Oh.
- Are those beautiful?
- Oh, wow!
- Oh!
- Matt.
- Hey.
- Gentlemen.
Hey, hey.
- Hey, Matt.
Whoo!
Hey, our first casualty.
Hey, you guys!
- Shh!
Do you mind?
We're coming to the biggest part.
- You mean the best part!
- Same thing.
- Are those for real?
Hey, Andy!
Andy!
Imagine if you had a little class, what you could do.
Hey, I have class.
I have low class.
- Hey, Matt, where's Kyle?
- He's at school.
Oh, my God.
Look at that.
Tie me up, tie me down.
Hey, Dad.
Why I ever agreed to let Andy do this I will never know.
I guess I really like you or something.
- Here.
Go easy on this stuff now.
- You can count on that.
Thanks for this whole thing.
It's really wonderful.
Look, I, uh...
I just wanted you to know that...
I can't imagine a father... being prouder of his son than I am of you.
I look at you and I think maybe...
I did something right in my life.
I just wanted you to know that.
Well, Dad, I've always wanted you to be proud of me.
You and Mom are the most important people in my life.
Oh, Captain Carter, you promised.
Okay, Andy.
Okay.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Uh...
Ta-dum!
Okay, okay, okay.
Be quiet, you guys.
I have an announcement.
As the best man in this room,
- I have an announcement.
- Shh!
No, seriously.
I have to get serious for a minute.
- No.
- Just for a minute.
No, no.
I have to say this.
Because Matt Carter is my best friend...
- and I know everything about him,
- Aww.
And the truth about Matt Carter is... he really is a great guy.
Hear!
Hear!
Thank you for that spontaneous and heartfelt burst of emotion.
But, no, it's really true.
He's dependable, and he's probably the smartest guy I know who's my age.
Occasionally he says something sort of interesting.
So, it's really difficult for me to accept... that he is going to have such a beautiful woman to call his wife.
I mean, somebody who's just as smart and just as nice... and just as much fun as he is.
I think the only thing that keeps me from being completely jealous... is the fact that he really deserves it.
So, God bless, Matt, and congratulations.
All right, Matt.
Wait, wait.
Wa...
Hold it.
Just, um...
Just wait.
Uh, I have a toast.
I think a brother should be allowed to say something.
Right?
Can I say something, Matt?
- All right.
Good.
- Go ahead.
Uh, Andy, introduced himself... as the best man.
And that's a little hard for me.
I have a-a little problem with that.
I mean, you're all right.
You're a nice guy and all, but you're not the best man.
You're only the best man by default.
And if anybody knows anything about default, it's me.
Right?
Now, I'd like to propose a toast to the real best man... in this li...
this little society.
Here is a toast to... my kid brother, Matt.
The best man I know.
I don't know how he did it, but he did it right.
- Yeah.
- To the best man.
- Hear!
Hear!
- Yeah.
- I love you, Matt.
- Thanks.
I do.
We don't see any internal injuries... any other fractures, and the skull looks okay.
So, we're gonna keep him down here till tomorrow for observation.
But I think he's gonna be okay.
Uh-huh.
Did he say anything?
Is he conscious?
- I mean, how did this happen?
- I can't tell you that.
But he's lucky.
Very lucky.
May I see him?
Please?
Sure.
One person only though.
Now, it looks a lot worse than it is.
Excuse me.
Could you tell me?
I was wondering, what was the alcohol level of his blood?
There's a law now, isn't there, that you have to check... the blood alcohol level of a person in a car accident?
He wasn't drunk, Mrs. Carter, legally or otherwise.
No drugs either.
I'll check back on you in a little while.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Wow.
What's going on?
You were in a car accident.
You drove your car off the road and into a telephone pole.
Look, um, I tried to call Allison... but I couldn't find her number.
Allison.
Karen, uh...
- You okay?
- Yeah.
It's just, um...
Well, listen, uh...
Don't tell anyone about this.
What?
Well, uh, Allison is...
What?
Allison decided she's not gonna marry me.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I know.
- Is that why she left early?
- Uh-huh.
Why?
I mean...
Karen, I can't...
I'll tell you about this later.
I don't have the energy to go into it now.
But we'll have a long talk eventually.
- Yeah, okay.
- Oh, and, Karen, you know...
Yeah, I'll keep Mom out of this until you can deal with it.
- Thanks.
- God.
Well, look, I was thinking we can go ahead with the wedding anyways.
I don't know.
I think people will notice if she doesn't show up.
God.
Well, it's just our family.
No...
No, I mean, I'm sorry.
I know this is really, really terrible for you...
But, um...
- you think you can wait till Tom and I leave to tell Mom?
- Yes.
- Wow.
- I really...
I am sorry.
I'm really sorry.
As best I can remember, I turned the corner... and there was this miniature collie in the middle of the road... and it looked up at me, and it had the strangest expression on its little face... and it was just frozen there, and I-I... turned the steering wheel and I hit my brake.
And that's it.
That's all I can remember.
That happens all the time, people doing that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Except for, Matt, next time, kill the dog.
Just aim your car straight for the dog and kill it.
I'm just telling you this on behalf of the insurance company.
Oh, by the way, we tried to reach Allison... but we couldn't find the right number... and I'm pretty sure her parents have unlisted phones.
They have unlisted addresses, Mom.
That's all right.
I called her this afternoon, and, uh... she wanted to come up, but I told her not to.
You know, she's very frightened that my cast is going to upstage her at the wedding.
That was so funny.
- Yeah, it was.
I almost hurt myself, Mom.
- He did.
Come in.
I asked the people at the desk if there was anyone here before I came back.
I thought, you know, this early...
You're okay, right?
So I'm told.
Kyle, why are you here?
You know, I heard...
I heard you had an accident.
Okay.
I'll go.
I'm sorry.
Wait.
Wait.
It's not that I...
I-I can't see you right now.
All right.
All right.
Kyle!
Kyle, wait a second!
- Who else?
- Andy's father.
- Get out.
- No, he called from California.
- Get out.
- More to make sure, I think, that Andy was in no way responsible.
Oh, now, who sent these?
You want me to open this?
Uh, no.
Mom, I got a problem here.
Thanks.
- Ah, you know, it seems cool in here.
Too cool.
- Mom...
- Are you chilly?
Is it cold in here to you?
- Mom...
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm going to ask the nurse.
I'll be right back.
So Matt's coming back tomorrow.
Oh, yeah.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I'm just... tired, I guess.
Oh.
I called in and, uh, checked our messages.
Mm-hmm.
Dr. Bridges's office wanted to confirm your appointment next week.
Okay.
- Well, who's Dr. Bridges?
- Uh, he's, uh...
Oh, how you say it?
He's a...
I don't know the name of the specialty.
My last checkup, I had a low iron count.
Well, why didn't you say something?
Look.
It's nothing.
It's a dietary thing.
It's nothing to get dramatic about.
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Nothing.
Look how well he's walking, Phil.
Better than yesterday.
Come on.
I'll race him in.
- Phil?
- Yeah?
I wanna put those flowers upstairs.
Sweetheart...
We thank you for this food which we are about to receive.
We hope Allison and her family are well.
We're grateful to be here together, but we're grateful most of all... for the safety of our family and for the quick recovery of Matt.
For this and all our many blessings, we thank you.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Gee.
I really wish I could help.
- Uh-huh.
- I do.
Right.
I believe you.
- I drove by that telephone pole today.
- What telephone pole?
The telephone pole Matt ran into.
Curious thing about it was that you could follow the path the car took... once it went off the highway... but there were no skid marks.
It was literally like...
- like Matt just deliberately drove it off the road.
- Tim, what is wrong with you?
- I am fed up with your...
- I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to Matt!
Is that what happened?
What the hell is the matter with you?
Look, man.
Say something, okay?
You're scaring me a little.
Matt, what is this?
I didn't have a car accident, Andy.
I drove my car off the road on purpose.
What?
Why would you do something like that?
Allison decided she's not gonna marry me.
Oh, man.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
- Really.
But why, man?
I mean, what happened?
She seemed like she was really...
We're friends no matter what.
Right?
I can't even believe you would ask me this.
Of course we're friends.
What the hell is goin' on?
Allison doesn't wanna marry me... because I'm gay.
Really?
Yeah.
Really.
I mean, hey, you can't really blame her for not wanting to marry you.
I mean, there's a lot of things you can overlook in a relationship... but...
I don't think this is one of'em.
How are you gonna explain this to your parents?
I don't know.
- Don't hug me.
- Geez, it doesn't mean I wanna marry you.
No, it's the ribs.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You know something?
You're my best friend.
You're my best friend in the whole world.
The best friend I ever had.
You know?
Same here.
Hey, this doesn't mean you're gonna start hummir...
Broadway show tunes on long car trips, does it?
Shut up.
I was just checkin'.
No, I'm still on hold.
No, I'm waiting for Dr. Bridges.
All right.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, um...
This is Tom Gregg.
I...
My wife, Karen, has an appointment with you next week.
Um...
And, well, I know it sounds kind of crazy, but...
Should I be worried about anything?
I mean, she says it's not...
Yeah, I'm still here.
Um...
I don't know.
I mean, is she...
I can't...
Can you tell me...
Something about the first trimester?
Pressure on.
- How ya doin'?
Okay?
- Yeah.
Lisa?
- What is it, honey?
- Mom?
How dare you.
What?
How dare you embarrass your father and me like this.
How dare you lie to me.
- What?
- Lisa!
You told me Allison was going home to see her parents.
I have a note.
I have a note here from Allison saying thank you... and how sorry she is.
What's going on, son?
What have you done?
Well, Allison and I...
We decided we're not gonna get married, Dad.
B-But I was gonna tell you, but...
"But?"
"But"?
But what?
But what?
You were going to tell me, but you didn't?
Look, Mom, we're not getting married.
That's all.
I think it's better we leave it at that.
No, I don't think so.
The invitations have already gone out.
People know!
- I think...
I want an explanation.
- Mom...
You better start explaining yourself, young man.
You owe me an explanation!
You already know.
You know exactly why.
You want me to say it?
- Don't talk to me that way.
- Lower your voice.
No!
You want me to say it?
I didn't swerve to avoid a dog.
I swerved to avoid living this life!
- I thought it would be better to be dead than tell you...
- I've heard enough...
No, you haven't!
I tried to kill myself.
- No, you didn't.
You had...
You had an accident.
- No!
No!
No!
I thought it would be better to be dead...
- No!
No, you had...
- Mom!
- I thought it'd be better to be dead than...
- No...
Yes!
Than to tell you I was gay!
I drove the car off the road on purpose.
I did it on purpose, Mom.
On purpose.
Yes!
On purpose.
- No, you didn't.
- I did it on purpose.
- No!
- She knows.
Mom, you know.
You walked in on me and Kyle two years ago.
I won't listen to this.
I will not have these things said in my house.
Now, you call Allison and you tell her that you're wrong... that you made a mistake.
You go to hell.
- Matt!
- Go to hell!
- Matt!
- Go to hell!
Leave him alone.
- What?
- I said just leave him alone.
How does it feel, Captain?
What?
How does it feel to almost lose your child?
How bad does it feel?
- Tom.
- I don't know what's come over you, Tom... but I don't think this is any of your concern.
I'm sorry, Phil.
I'm 32 years old.
You don't get to decide what concerns me.
Your standard of conduct might be sufficient reason for you to lose your child... but I have to draw the line when it comes to losing mine.
What children?
You don't have any children.
No, I don't.
I don't have any children.
I don't.
Because my wife would rather have an abortion without telling me... without even telling me she's pregnant... rather than risk upsetting you by having a baby at the wrong time.
You have a son who drinks himself...
- into a stupor every night.
- Oh, God, Tom.
You've got a daughter who's ashamed of her husband.
- I am not ashamed.
- Who's ashamed of her husband... you're ashamed of me, Karen...
and you've got another son... who almost killed himself rather than tell you he's not what you think he is.
And I'm not prepared to be a parent?
Because I can't afford it?
Really?
- It's about money?
- Tom, we're not gonna talk about this now.
No?
When are we gonna talk about it?
When someone actually dies?
Would that be better?
What's the military term for it? "Acceptable losses", isn't it?
Well, these are not acceptable losses.
I can't accept them.
I can't.
Is what you said true?
Yeah.
Yeah, Dad, I'm gay.
No, I'm not talkin' about that.
I can't deal with that right now.
I mean about driving the car off the road.
About trying to kill yourself.
Is that the truth?
Yeah, it is, Dad.
W...
Was it because...
Did you really think we'd rather have you dead?
I don't know.
Dad, it's hard to know.
Well, I wouldn't.
I wouldn't rather have you dead.
No matter what you did.
No matter what you are.
Listen, um...
Can you...
Can you promise your father... that you won't do that again?
Now, I know...
I know things are gonna be a little tough around here, but...
I wouldn't survive it, Matt.
It would kill me.
Promise me.
Okay.
I promise.
Okay.
Did you talk to Matt?
Yeah.
Well, is he gonna call her?
Lisa, I don't think that's a very good idea right now.
What do you mean?
You're just...
You're just gonna let him get away with it?
Get away with what?
What am I letting him get away with?
With embarrassing us.
With humiliating us.
Maybe it's not about us.
Maybe it's about him.
What are you t...
Of course it's about us.
All of it.
I...
I've spent my entire life sacrificing... so m-my children can have a future.
So they can be something.
Don't...
Don't tell me it's not about us.
It is us.
This is us.
What do you want from him, Lisa?
Would you rather have his brains smashed around the street?
Or see him hanging in the garage?
What is it you want?
Do you love your children, Lisa?
Whatever they are, they're our children.
It's a lie.
It's all a lie.
No, it's not a lie.
This is a lie!
- And that's a lie.
- Lisa!
Lisa.
- What are you doing?
- And this is a lie...
- No.
No, it's not a lie.
- This is...
Lisa.
Tom, please.
Please what?
It seemed like...
What choice do I have?
Tom, it's my body.
Fine.
This is my body, and I can do with it what I want... and right now, I want to take it home.
- I wanted to tell you.
- Well, now you don't have to.
I didn't want to go behind your back.
But you did, and I can't live like that.
I'll make allowances for you 'cause I know that's the way you were raised, but, uh...
I'm not your parents.
So why lie to me?
- 'Cause I'm afraid.
- Of course you are.
Maybe we're not meant to be parents, but we have to discuss it, Karen.
First, you have to come to a decision... because I've put you first in this marriage all along.
I love my parents a lot, but, um...
I'm your husband first, and they know that.
I'm sorry, Tom.
I'm sorry.
I know.
I want to have it.
I do.
Really.
I do.
I just...
What if I end up being like her?
I don't wanna be like her.
Hey.
It could be worse.
What if I got to be like your dad?
You know I'm a mess.
I'm gonna worry 100% of the time.
I'll have to take off work for a while.
I told you a hundred times I'd get an extra job.
And I meant it.
It would help if you wouldn't be so nice.
Let's go ask your parents how nice I am.
- No.
I think we'd better just get out of here.
- Yeah.
Mom.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry for wrecking the car and hurting myself the way I did.
I know you had to go to a lot of extra trouble.
And I'm sorry this wedding thing has happened too.
I know you don't understand.
I don't expect you to, Mom.
But I did want you to know that I was sorry.
I don't...
I don't understand how anyone could choose to be like this.
It's just, uh...
It is not to be understood.
I didn't choose this.
I am this.
Mom, I didn't choose to be gay.
Do you think I'd choose to be this different from everyone else... that I'd choose to make you and Dad this upset... and I'd choose to lose someone as beautiful and wonderful as Allison?
And what about AIDS?
I mean, suppose somebody wanted to be gay.
Would they want to be gay now?
I don't know.
And I don't want to know.
Then you don't wanna know me either.
Hello, Kyle.
W-W-Wait.
Don't hang up.
Uh...
I'm really sorry.
And I was calling to say that...
No.
I'm callin' from a pay phone.
Well, things are a little nuts at my house right now.
I'll talk to you about that later if you want.
But, uh...
What I was wondering is if...
Uh...
What I'd like to know is if... we could possibly go for a cup of coffee?
'Cause I really need to talk to you.
Please.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.
Whatcha doin'?
Oh, I don't know.
Waiting for you to come home, I guess.
You didn't have to do that.
Look, you have a son who almost kills himself... and then write a book about what you're supposed to do and how you're supposed to react.
- How about that?
- Sorry.
Yeah, it's been hard on you.
It's your bad luck to be born into a family... where people don't always know the right thing to do or say.
I got it.
Homosexual.
There.
I said it.
Didn't make me sick or anything.
That's pretty good, Dad.
I-I think the word, uh, "gay" is a little easier.
I don't like that word.
That's a perfectly good word that's been destroyed, and I don't like it.
Okay.
Since I have said the word... uh, can I ask you a few questions?
Because...
I mean, do you mind?
I'm just... trying to think through this properly.
Okay.
Go ahead.
I mean...
I've been thinking about this because I've heard it before.
What do you say about this thing... about God hating homosexuals... about homosexuals being unnatural or...
or going to hell?
What do you say about that?
I don't know.
I can't tell you, Dad.
Well, I think we should look into that, don't you?
No, not really.
I don't believe that.
Well, what you believe isn't factual.
If you go around telling people that you're a... that you're a homosexual... sooner or later, someone's gonna say this... and you should know how to defend yourself.
That's all I'm saying.
I'm not thrilled about this, and I don't want to give you the wrong idea.
I would rather you be normal.
I think I am normal.
Don't quibble with me.
You know what I mean.
Yes, sir.
But whatever you are, you're my son.
And I...
I'm, uh...
That's all.
You're my son.
And I don't think I want people... saying things like that about my son... without knowing how to respond.
So we should look into that.
You may not know this, but Alexander the Great... who I happen to think was a damn good general...
Alexander the Great was a homosexual too.
I love you, Dad.
I love you too, son.
Here I am!
Who's this?
Look at that.
Watch that ladder.
What happened?
Let me try something here.
What is it?
What's gone wrong here, then?
Won't work, huh?
Here we go.
What are you guys looking at?
Get me out of here!
Here!
It's mine!
Do you mind?
- Taxi!
- Taxi!
Taxi!
Come on.
Jacques!
Jacques, you're late!
I'm late.
I have to mow Mrs. Oglethorpe's lawn.
Stop that!
Stop that!
Stop that!
You moron.
There will be changes around here after today, and I will personally see that you will be the first one to go.
- Allow me.
- Wipe off those filthy hands!
- Take this.
- Oh, for me?
Carry it to the house, you idiot!
Here you are, my dear.
Do come in, Edmund.
My dear Lillian.
I'm so sorry I'm late, but there's so much to do in handling the Oglethorpe enterprises now that dear Oscar has passed on.
You are a good friend, Edmund.
And such a comfort in my time of need.
I hope more than a friend, Lillian.
As the lawyer for the Oglethorpe family,
I have been entrusted with the last will and testament of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.
- Edmund, I beg your pardon.
- Yes, dear lady?
I must apologize, but we really must wait for my personal solicitor, Roland T. Flakfizer.
- Jacques.
- Lillian,
I've been employed by your late husband for over 1 3 years.
- Are you dismissing me?
- Good heavens, no, Edmund.
I was involved in a minor accident with the Bentley last year.
Miraculously, he was by my side to assist me.
Oh, Jacques, I want you to go to this address and summon this gentleman at once.
I've been calling all morning and leaving messages.
- I can't seem to reach him.
- Yes, Mrs. O...
Lillian, how long must we wait?
I can assure you, once Mr. Flakfizer receives my message, he will race to be by my side.
Anyone hurt?
Roland T. Flakfizer, attorney at law.
Don't try to get up.
- I specialize in accident cases.
- We're both fine.
I know what I'm doing, I know what I'm doing.
You wouldn't happen to have any french fries on you, would you?
All right, all right.
Step back, step back.
I've got injured clients here.
Sir, you have caused grievous harm to my clients and their vehicle.
And through your negligence, this child has suffered severe neck injuries.
- Leave me alone.
- Stick with me, kid, and you can afford enough Nintendo software to sink a battleship.
- I can sue my parents?
- I sued mine.
- My neck!
- Corruptible youth.
God bless them.
My Lord, madam.
You shouldn't be walking in your condition.
This woman is with child.
If any harm came to this infant, by God, sir, you will feel my wrath in court.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't try to weasel out of this.
Dozens of witnesses saw your reckless driving.
How many of you saw this man carelessly, and without regard for life and property, careen into my clients at almost 85 miles per hour?
And who of you will tell their story to my young, 24-year-old,
Miss International Wet T-shirt champion, nymphomaniac secretary?
Yo!
Right here!
Right here!
Hey, hey!
Flakfizer's at it again, I see.
- Check for outstanding...
- Roland T. Flakfizer?
That's him.
Thank you very much.
You agree with me, I agree with you.
Hold that thought.
I swear, I never touched your daughter.
Taxi!
Here we go.
Get in.
Get in.
- Where to?
- Any place with no extradition laws.
- And step on it.
- Right.
- Mr. Roland T. Flakfizer?
- That depends.
- Do I owe you money?
- No.
In a drunken stupor, did I promise to marry you?
- No.
- Then I'm your man.
- Lillian Oglethorpe wants to see you.
- The Lillian Oglethorpe?
In her mid-50s, with possible gusts up to 60, 65?
- Yes.
Can you come right away?
- Is she still rich?
By all means.
The Oglethorpe place.
Big bucks.
Yeah, you settle back, I'll get you there safe and sound.
One-way street.
Don't worry, this happens a lot.
You enjoy driving a cab?
No.
As soon as I get me driver's license, I'm quitting.
A guy's really gotta haul rump to make ends meet these days.
I mean, apart from the cab, I'm a pool man, I perform liposuction,
I got me own toupee business.
My motto:
"Something that size should have hair on it."
Aren't those numbers clicking by awfully fast?
- You're probably a speed-reader.
- Well, you got me there.
Another two miles and we own this cab.
- I hope you brought money.
- Oh, sure.
I have a wallet just like that.
Hey, that is my wallet.
When I get some money, this could come in handy.
Such behavior.
Stealing another man's wallet.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- I don't believe it.
You!
- What are you doing?
- Do you know who I am?
A psychotic cab driver?
I'm Rocco Melonchek.
I hope you know you're blowing any possible tip.
You were my attorney in my divorce case until you started dating my wife during the trial.
And you got the court to double the alimony request she originally made.
You didn't want her to keep seeing me in cheap motels, did you?
For God's sake, man, she was your wife!
- Help me.
- Get off.
All right, all right, all right.
Five-minute break.
All right, break's over.
Wait a minute, wait.
You're a businessman.
- Let's talk business.
- Fine, and then I'll kill you.
I thought I recognized you.
I've been looking for you for the past three years.
- You're lying.
- Of course I am, but hear me out.
Clients are impressed by a law firm with a big staff.
The more employees, the bigger the fees.
So I could use a man like you in my organization.
Travel, excitement and a chance for advancement.
Of course, you'll start out on the bottom rung.
But work hard and in no time you'll move up to next-to-the-bottom rung.
- You got a dental plan?
- Lose a tooth, you get two free.
- What's my job?
- You can be my chauffeur.
- How much?
- Two hundred bucks a week.
- 600.
- 300.
- 400.
- 800.
- 900.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Shouldn't I be in this negotiation somewhere?
- 350 and not a penny more.
- I'll take it.
- What happened to 1000?
- I allowed for taxes.
- I want four weeks in advance.
- Five weeks.
Hold it.
I'm giving you one minute to stop this.
- Two minutes.
- Five minutes.
- Seven minutes.
- Nine minutes.
I've stepped into my own private hell.
We'd better get going.
The faster we get to Lillian, the quicker I can afford your salaries.
For 350 bucks a week, you drive.
Lillian, we really can't wait any longer.
I suppose you're right, Edmund.
I can't imagine what is keeping Roland.
- You guys wait here.
- Hey, you're the boss.
The reading of the last will and testament of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.
- Roland!
- Please, call me what everyone else calls me: "Your Royal Sex Machine."
I wouldn't come without bringing you a terribly expensive gift.
I hope you like it.
It reminds me of you.
Roland, how thoughtful of you.
But I believe I have one just like it.
Oh, no problem.
I'll take it back and get the money.
Mrs. Oglethorpe, you look wonderful.
I could make love to you right here and now.
Roland, please.
Let's keep this on a professional level.
Very well, then.
I'll charge you 50 bucks a pop.
Mr. Oglethorpe!
How well I remember him.
Gone now, but not forgotten.
I was never crazy about his taste in clothes.
I hope this speech doesn't seem like a rambling affair, which is something I'm sure we'll be involved in.
Oh, Lillian, you make me feel just like a natural woman.
I've heard enough.
- Sir, I am appalled.
- Lillian, who is this man?
Roland, this is Mr. Edmund Lazlo.
A likely story.
Just look at him.
He's obviously after your money and social standing, but I was here first.
Hey, how is everyone?
- Have you got any mustard in here?
- Hey, I'm the boss, remember?
- I told you to wait outside.
- Today's my day off.
Excuse me.
And just who are you?
He's a member of my staff.
Lillian Oglethorpe, Rocco Melonchek.
Rocco Melonchek, Lillian Oglethorpe.
In order to tell you two apart, one of you will have to wear a mustache.
Nice to meet someone else who buys their clothes at big-and-tall-man shops.
- I beg your pardon?
- Why?
You can't help it.
Refreshments.
Good idea, Jacques.
He was so devoted to my husband.
Darling Oscar is dead now, you know.
Well, I hope so.
I understand they buried him.
- Just make yourself feel at home.
- Lillian,
I really do believe we should begin.
Oh, yes, yes, certainly.
Will you all please find yourselves a seat?
Oh, I beg your...
The last will and testament of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.
- Do you have a bathroom?
- I protest!
This is most irregular!
- Lillian...
- Edmund!
Please be careful.
This man is in obviously no condition to carry on.
Rocco, will you continue?
- Lillian, I...
- Right, let's cut to the payoff here.
Blah, blah, blah...
Minnesota holdings, ski boat, ski boat, ski boat...
Yacht...
"To my gay lover, I leave--"
It was a joke.
I was just joking.
Yes.
Now.
Yes, here we are.
"All my worldly goods to be transferred into the care of my wife, Lillian."
- Darling.
- "And because of my love for the arts, I request that half my fortune be used to establish a ballet company."
Excellent.
Wonderful.
Nothing like the thrill of spending an evening watching a bunch of anorexics leaping around, guys with bulging genitals...
I hope I'm not arousing you.
This is all very well and good, but I wouldn't know the first thing
- about running such a company.
- Mrs. Oglethorpe...
-...as your trusted lawyer...
- You can use those words together?
...and friend I naturally assumed that task would fall to me.
Why would anyone wanna be the head of a ballet company?
"And the director of the company shall receive $500,000 a year salary."
I'll take the job.
I have ballet running through my veins.
Lillian, I'm your man!
Outrageous!
I doubt whether he knows the difference between the first, second, third, fourth or fifth positions!
Hey, he is strictly missionary position.
I will not allow a rogue like you to handle the Oglethorpe Ballet.
This document should be treated with the dignity and respect it deserves.
Hello!
This is no time for family pictures.
Charity work.
I gather these for those less fortunate than ourselves who can't afford pornography.
Edmund!
I demand this man be dismissed immediately!
- Jacques, you're working for me now.
- For what reason?
- Does it make you angry?
- Yes!
That's a good enough reason for me.
Lillian, I have a dream.
We'll bring in a whole new breed of ballet-goers with innovative giveaways.
Leotard nights, wet tutu competitions.
And we'll be the first company performing ballet for the hard of hearing.
We'll have the ballerinas wear wooden shoes.
Mrs. Oglethorpe, this man doesn't know what he's talking about.
Now, leave this matter to me and I will sign for you the world's premier dancer, The Great Volare.
Volare?
How wonderful.
Wait a second!
Uno pari-mutuel.
Not the Volare!
You know The Great Volare?
I knew him back when he was known as the Pretty Good Volare.
We served in the Army together.
He owes me one.
I threw myself on top of an 1 8-year-old Vietnamese girl and saved his life.
- Nonsense!
- That's where you're wrong.
This is nonsense.
Lillian, I am the only one who can bring you the world's greatest male ballerina.
For myself, I ask only a nominal salary, plus a cut of gross receipts, a bonus of 25 percent on anything above break-even, a $300 per diem, the use of a company car and housing.
By all means, make my husband's dream come true.
What, you want him to marry a cheerleader?
Give us a ballet.
Oh, this is so exciting.
I can see I am no longer required as the family lawyer.
Look, I'm thinking of becoming a lawyer.
- Can I buy your diploma off you?
- Good heavens.
I need you both.
Very well, Lillian.
As you wish.
- For now.
- Then this evening I'm off to the ballet.
I must shave, shower, get new clothes and practice signing your name.
My pearl...
I bid you all a fondue.
If you should lose this hand in an industrial accident, keep it for me.
Gentlemen!
Alan.
I brought this for you.
It's not exactly a bouquet, but it's a start.
So sweet.
Were you watching the ballet again tonight?
Of course.
I love to watch you dance.
Someday we're gonna be on that stage dancing together.
At the rate I'm going, I'm not so sure.
Alan, don't talk that way.
We agreed that if one of us got into a major company, it could only help the both of us.
Tonight I'm going to talk to Volare about you.
I would love that.
I mean, no one dances like The Great Volare.
Except you.
Catch.
Tickets, please?
No smoking in the theater.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
Please.
- Five and six.
- Eleven.
Now it's your turn: 25 and 67.
Miss!
These seats are dreadful.
They're facing the stage.
Hey, did we miss the coming attractions?
Who's the bad guy?
Is Tom Cruise in this?
Do you work out?
- I'm looking for The Great Volare.
- He's on-stage.
And he doesn't appreciate visitors backstage.
No, no, no, I'm not a visitor.
This is strictly business.
- This creep bothering you?
- No.
No.
She's quite delightful, thank you.
Ok, I give up.
How come he doesn't throw up?
Bravo, Mr. Volare.
They love you.
That audience wouldn't know a ballet from a bullfight.
And who are you to speak to me?
Where is my towel?
When I come off-stage, I expect my towel immediately.
- Do you understand me?
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Fire him.
Tina, darling, you were marvelous.
Perhaps we should meet in my dressing room after the performance and discuss your career.
I'd like that very much, Mr. Volare.
- Thank you.
- Lisa!
Darling, I thought we'd have dinner tonight after the closing-night party.
Oh, well, thank you, but I'm afraid I've already made plans.
Mr. Volare, I'd like you to meet my friend Alan Grant.
It's a privilege to meet you, Mr. Volare.
I'm a huge fan of yours.
Well, Alan's a dancer too, with the Performing Artists Group, the nonprofit ballet troupe.
Really?
How sweet.
It's a fine idea to keep busy until one is good enough to command a salary.
My cue.
- She looked 1 8, officer, I swear!
- Too noisy around here.
I'll say.
I got twice the sleep at a Julio Iglesias concert.
This guy's gotta get off-stage soon.
Let's go back, wait for him, sign him up.
Excuse us.
Excuse me.
We have to get this plutonium back to the lab.
- Jacques.
- Hey.
- You know him?
- Sure.
He used to drive Mr. Oglethorpe to the theater,
- then I'd sneak him into the ballet.
- I'm gonna be the best man
- at their wedding.
- I hope so.
Excuse me, we didn't get your name.
Oh, my name's Rocco Melonchek.
I'm the ballet world's up-and-coming manager/agent.
I'm here to sign a contract with The Great Volare.
I hate to burst your bubble, but Volare already has an agent and manager.
That's too bad.
Any of them real sick?
You don't need Volare.
What you need is the next great ballet talent.
A young, fresh face.
- Alan Grant.
- Exactly.
- I got it right.
- There's my cue.
Jacques, convince Mr. Melonchek Alan's the person he's looking for.
This is all well and good, but can he dance?
Could he make millions?
Would he sign a contract for a lot of money, but take scale,
leaving his manager with everything else?
Sure he would.
Wouldn't you, Alan?
Alan?
Can't you see he's watching the woman he adores?
- You're in love with her, aren't you?
- You bet.
- When's the wedding?
- There won't be one unless I can find a job dancing.
To tell you the truth, Mr. Melonchek, I'm about out of money and I'm gonna have to go back to Minneapolis.
I'll tell you what.
Don't you buy that plane ticket just yet, because I am gonna get you an audition with Roland T. Flakfizer, ballet director.
- You could do that?
- Sure.
They're like this.
Well, let's go to work, Mr. Melonchek.
I now pronounce us dancer and manager.
Yeah!
Come in.
Tina, darling.
I'm so glad you've come.
You were most inspiring tonight.
I can see that under my guidance, your career will soar.
Already I can hear the audience roar.
- Who are you?
- Roland T. Flakfizer, managing director of the Oglethorpe-Flakfizer Ballet Company.
You wouldn't happen to have a plunger on you, would you?
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, I see you have a pretty visitor.
I'll tell you what.
I'll get a girl and we'll double.
- You got five minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Five minutes?
My God!
Have you consulted another doctor?
- You are out of line.
- And you are out of toilet paper.
- But we're still short one girl.
- What are you doing here?
- To sign you for my ballet company.
- To sign me for your ballet company?
Swear to God, I just said that.
Why don't you run along and let us men talk business.
Just leave your phone number and favorite color with the manager and later we'll talk business.
- You're cute, Mr...?
- Garvey.
Steve Garvey.
I think we have something beautiful, you and I.
Someday you'll have my children.
In fact, they're out in the car, if you want them.
Oh, God...
You're still here?
I will have you thrown out of the theater.
- First, we talk ballet.
- I know nothing of your ballet.
We have a lot in common.
I'm managing director and I don't either.
Look, I don't dance for just anyone.
I am ballet.
My dance shoes are in the Louvre in Paris.
So what?
Last year, I left a raincoat in Cleveland.
Do you realize what I was doing at the age of 7?
I can imagine.
You must be thankful you didn't go blind.
I was dancing professionally.
Well, whatever you call it: flogging the carrot, polishing the cue stick, choking the chicken, clearing the snorkel...
But I didn't come back here to rehash good times.
Volare, dance with the Oglethorpe-Flakfizer Ballet Company and you can name your price.
Money is no object.
It isn't mine.
Look, I'm offering you a check for $500,000.
It's made out to Volare, Great, The.
I don't dance for the money.
Then you dance and I'll keep the money.
Look, I will not dance for your ballet and that is final.
A Flakfizer doesn't know the meaning of the word "no."
And we're a little fuzzy on the word "panagglutinin" and "viscosity."
All right, all right.
Let's sweeten the pot.
The same money,
- we throw in a girl.
- No!
Then would you object to me getting one?
I'm a lonely man, Mr. Volare.
I will give you till the count of ten to get out of here.
- One, two, three--
- Before you get stuck somewhere around six, I'll go.
If there's anything I can ever do for you, forget it.
Because I don't do those kind of things.
And for the last time, I warn you about that highly contagious rash.
I beg you to see to it at once.
Hygiene, Mr. Volare.
Hygiene.
- Mr. Flakfizer.
- Where?
!
I'm sorry, I thought my father showed up.
Come here, come here.
Did Volare accept your offer?
I didn't know the meaning of the word "no,"
but he had it down pretty good.
You wouldn't happen to have a world-famous dancer stuffed in a drawer somewhere, would you?
As a matter of fact, I would.
His name's Alan Grant.
He can dance rings around Volare.
He's even more talented than Gorbachev.
- Gesundheit.
- Baryshnikov.
- God bless you.
- Baryshnikov.
Hi.
How's it going?
How you doing?
You look very nice today.
He's one of the best dancers in the country.
Hire him for the ballet.
What do you say?
No, no, nay, nyet.
I have to find some way to sign Volare.
When I do that, I'm director of the ballet.
And, gentlemen, that spells cash with a capital...
- K.
- You should go back to school.
I hated teaching.
- Flakfizer, I thought you were smart.
- I am smart.
I said no to you, didn't I?
I'm offering you two incomes.
Your paycheck from the ballet company and then when you sign Alan Grant to dance, another hefty check as part of Alan's management team.
How do we get this past Mrs. Oglethorpe?
Relax.
After she sees Alan dance, you've got nothing to worry about.
Except for taxes, depletion of the ozone layer and diseases due to any sexual contact.
- That's a load off my mind.
- All you gotta do is convince Mrs. Oglethorpe to let Alan into the charity bazaar.
Are you kidding?
I can charm the pants off of her.
Now, that is a disgusting thought.
Gentlemen, you're gonna have to sneak him in.
Not so fast.
You know, I worry about you, I really do.
We're gonna make this legal.
We need a contract.
A binding document, with plenty of loopholes.
Exactly.
Jacques, draw up the standard contract, would you, please?
Hello, Jacques.
We've got years to go before we even come close to the Japanese.
Right.
Sign that.
- This paper's blank.
- I'll fill it in later.
Fair enough.
You're not gonna cheat me or anything?
I give you my word as a gentleman.
Well, you had me until then.
All right, all right.
Fifty-fifty split.
- Now, this is more like it.
- What about me?
To show you no favoritism, Rocco and I
- will also split your salary fifty-fifty.
- Thanks.
That should keep you out of a higher income bracket.
Come to think of it, that should keep you out of any income bracket.
Rocco, Jacques, tomorrow, Alan Grant joins the Oglethorpe Ballet Company.
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Ninth Annual Oglethorpe Charity Festival.
- Let's go.
- It gives me great pleasure to announce the Oglethorpe Ballet Company will be leaving for New York tomorrow, where we...
You two go and get dressed.
Be ready in ten minutes.
- T en minutes?
We'll be ready.
- And you're gonna be a star.
You know, if you keep this up, I may even start to believe it.
Nice to have a chance to make someone's wish come true.
That's a nice thing to do.
Well, how did the market close?
Well, roll over my amalgamated, split my utilities and double my capital venture overlays.
Now, call me in an hour and tell me what the hell I'm talking about.
Pull over.
Everybody all set?
We've got everything so under control, it's pathetic.
- And so is he.
- Good.
Driver, drive on.
Look out for that truck!
- Buffy...
- Lillian.
Get this thing up on the rack and have it overhauled.
Better yet, why don't you get up on the rack and I'll see you in an hour.
Avanti!
Here, Buffy.
There you are.
- Darling.
- Have you come to see Mommy?
What a charming little animal.
Do you know dogs, Mr. Melonchek?
Know dogs?
I used to be a chef in a Korean restaurant.
Good food, good friends, good conversation.
Roland, I'm so upset Volare turned us down.
I know.
What a slap in our collective faces.
Like I told you, he has no respect for our ballet.
I wouldn't want a man like that dancing for me.
- Or with me, for that matter.
- I offered him half the moon.
I keep asking myself, "Why didn't he sign with us?"
Because he said he wouldn't work with you if you were the last person on earth.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
Fetch.
My darling Lillian, Volare has shunned us.
Hold your chins up high, for I have discovered a fabulous young dancer.
- A talent that soars.
- Volare.
It's Volare!
Oh, good heavens.
It's him.
- It's Volare.
- Step back.
Step back.
Step back.
Lillian, permit me to introduce
- The Great Volare.
- I've seen greater.
SignorVolare, I understand you've refused to dance with our company.
The truth of the matter is Mr. Volare won't work with Mr. Flakfizer.
But, my dear Lillian, I am happy to announce that I have signed Mr. Volare to dance with and to be the artistic director of the Oglethorpe Ballet Company.
Ladies and gentlemen, the overture has started.
- Overture to what?
- The ballet find of the century.
- What?
- Roll up!
Roll up!
Top-class ballet, this way!
Lillian, just a little surprise I cooked up.
If you don't like it, it was Rocco's idea.
Oh, Roland, I love a surprise.
Yeah!
Yo, Rocco, Rocco.
Mrs. Oglethorpe, meet the future world champion of ballet,
- Mr. Alan Grant.
- It's a pleasure.
Nice to meet you.
Mrs. Oglethorpe, I would like to make an announcement.
- He's being deported.
- I have found my prima ballerina...
-...the lovely Miss Lisa Le Baron.
- What?
Well...
But what about Alan?
Shall we say, a most unusual technique.
Perhaps better suited to experimental theater.
You can't talk to my client like that.
If Alan isn't in the company, I won't be either.
- Neither will I.
- That's a victory for all mankind.
You're making a mistake, my dear.
Lisa, I agree with Volare.
But, Alan, we'll be apart for months.
Remember when you told me that with you dancing,
- it would be good for both of us?
- Yes, but--
When Volare makes you a star, you can choose anyone to dance with.
Dance with the Oglethorpe.
Come on.
I'll be the proudest guy in the country.
- All right.
- You've made a wise choice, my dear.
- Then it's settled.
I am so excited.
- You're excited?
Feel these nipples.
Now, Lillian, about the directorship of the ballet company...
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course, Edmund.
You have brought us The Great Volare.
And dear Roland has presented us with our ballerina.
I think it only fair that you and Roland share the honor.
- Flakfizer?
This is preposterous.
- Preposterous, is it?
Why don't we step outside
- and settle this like men.
- We are outside.
Then why don't we step inside and settle this like women.
Or are you afraid, Lazlo?
- I'm twice the man you are.
- So is she.
And it's driving me mad.
Oh, Lillian, can't you see I'm on fire?
And you, you contemptible cur!
Maybe you don't want to work for Mrs. Oglethorpe.
- Is that so, Edmund?
- Of course not!
I will do anything that is best for the ballet.
Well, there's no need to commit suicide.
And to show you no hard feelings, how about a cigar.
- I don't smoke.
- Well, I do.
Why don't you run out and get me one.
And now, since I'm in charge of the ballet, just jamming that thought home, I propose a toast.
Champagne!
I'm not going to work with such an uncouth pig.
- Certainly, Mr. Volare.
- Now it's on to New York!
And a hefty per diem.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Here you go.
Here you go.
I'm all out of American currency.
Take a fistful of Romanian 50s, all right?
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
The end of another grueling day.
The press conference is to begin in five minutes.
Roland seems to be running a little late.
Late?
That charlatan hasn't been around in weeks.
I don't know why you put up with him.
He's never in his office.
He never responds to his calls.
He's totally irresponsible.
Lisa.
Relax, my dear.
Everyone is nervous their first time.
Just follow my lead.
I'm very experienced.
- That's very kind of you, Mr. Volare.
- Oh, come on.
Call me Roberto.
Roberto.
Lisa, I know an intimate little bistro with a fabulous view of the city.
Perhaps dinner and an all-night boat ride?
Well, I don't really think that would be such a good idea--
I hope I'm interrupting something.
Volare, you know it's not polite to drool in public.
Roland, I haven't seen you for weeks.
Lillian, my pile of sweetness.
I'm so sorry.
I've been busy promoting our ballet at beauty pageants.
And then, of course, there's my volunteer work at the breast-implant clinic.
And how I missed you.
In fact, I missed you so much, two days ago I went out and I bought a woman who looks just like you.
- Oh, you silly.
- For you.
From you.
Another lovely bracelet.
I didn't want this wrist to think I was neglecting it.
- Oh, Roland...
- Lillian, l--
Lazlo, I didn't see you there.
I stand corrected.
I saw you, but I chose to ignore you.
Lisa, my darling.
Will you excuse us?
Two's company and three's an adult movie.
- Mrs. Oglethorpe, may we start?
- Oh, please.
Is she a fox or what?
Ladies and gentlemen, for many weeks now the Oglethorpe Ballet Company have been in rehearsal.
Tomorrow we open with Roberto Volare's interpretation of Tears of the Swan.
At this time, I wish to introduce to you the creative genius behind our company, the brightest light in the ballet firmament...
Thank you for those kind words, Edmund Lazlo.
I don't know who does your hair, but tell me, where do they do it and when are they bringing it back?
Well, I had a speech all prepared, but today I'm going to speak from the heart.
You've no doubt asked yourself, "Why has he been chosen for this task of running the Oglethorpe?"
Well, the whole story is right here in my autobiography:
Flakfizer:
A Man's Man.
But I like women a lot more.
My intimate views of Jackie, Cher, Sean, Larry, Moe, Curly.
Over 200 pages of provocative pictures, and only one page has any writing on it.
Act now and you can get one of these fabulous "Flakfizer is ballet" T-shirts.
MasterCard and Visas accepted.
That brings me to the task at hand, to introduce the woman I adore.
Behind every great man is a woman.
And thank heaven I have Lillian Oglethorpe, because, quite frankly,
I enjoy the shade.
Dear Lillian, soon I hope to take you on a Caribbean cruise, where we can hold hands on a soft summer's evening and watch that old Jamaican moon.
Why that old Jamaican will be mooning us, I have no idea.
And now, here she is, the woman voted by her senior class
"most likely to go up a few dress sizes,"
a woman who would be a man, except her name is Lillian,
Lillian Oglethorpe.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey, what's with all the tears?
This should be the happiest night of your life.
I know it should be.
It's just that I miss Alan so much.
Well, I'd feel the same way if the man I loved was thousands of miles away.
Of course, I'd be living a whole different lifestyle.
Here, come with me.
I know just the thing to cheer you up.
If you just step right in here, my dear, your spirits might just brighten.
- But that's Mr. Volare's dressing room.
- Of course.
He's got the best champagne.
- Alan!
- Lisa.
Flakfizer flew Alan out to see you in the opening of the ballet.
It's a formal affair.
Do you have tuxedos?
I got mine.
That's great for tomorrow, but aren't you a little overdressed for today?
Oh, no.
- I'm very impressed.
- I don't have any luggage.
Then this all makes sense.
I was worried there for a second.
Mr. Flakfizer, thank you.
I see you're saving your best stuff for Alan.
I think we should leave the lovers alone for a few minutes.
Make that a few hours.
- I missed you so much.
- I don't want us to be apart ever again.
- I told you before!
- Oh, my God, it's Volare.
- You better hide.
- Don't hang my tight by the crotch!
- It throws off my bulge!
- Yes, Volare, I'm sorry.
Lisa, what a pleasant surprise.
I see you decided to start our little party early, huh?
- Roberto, you've got the wrong idea.
- Oh, no.
I think I've got the right idea.
- Roberto, stop it!
- Get your hands off of her!
- You!
What are you doing here?
- Mr. Flakfizer flew me out.
You and Mr. Flakfizer are going to be sorry for this.
- Volare, what happened?
- It's Flakfizer.
He's brought that performance artist out here.
- Hasn't that information arrived yet?
- No, but we may not need it.
I have devised a little plan.
He's staying at Lillian's townhouse.
All we have to do is make a few arrangements.
Oh, no.
Lillian?
- Well, no one's in.
- Roland.
This is just a business call.
I didn't think you were back so soon.
- Roland.
- Lillian can't we just be friends?
Why, you're not Lillian.
- You gonna spank me?
- We can start there and see what happens.
- Are we alone?
- Servants have the day off.
Lillian is already at the theater, but I'm here.
- Take me.
- Okay.
Let's say two out of three falls.
No standing eight count.
Wait.
I wanna make love by candlelight.
I could do you one better.
I think this is more in keeping with...things to come.
Not a bad little pad Lillian's got here.
- Was that the doorbell?
- That wasn't you?
Never mind.
Just ignore it.
Well, it's a big house.
Maybe they can't hear the bell.
Let's try this.
Wait a minute.
I'll be right back.
If you need anything, there's plenty of batteries in my room.
Oh, let me try this.
Good idea.
You go through the window.
If the alarm goes off, I'll run away so they won't catch both of us.
We don't want any!
Oh, it's you.
We have to talk.
It's very important.
Look.
The next half-hour, give or take 29 minutes, will be very important for me, so thanks for dropping by.
Yeah, but--
Flakfizer!
- The face is familiar.
- It's mine.
And so it is.
Say, if you ever visit this planet again, give me a call.
We'll have lunch.
- Flakfizer.
- How come you didn't knock?
I'm using a better grade of gas.
- That's not bad, is it?
- You know, I always enjoy it when we get together, but I want you out, or I'll be forced to kill you.
I'll tell the police
- I did it out of love.
- Flakie, aren't you coming to bed?
- That's a girl.
- Not just a girl, a way of life.
What if Mrs. Oglethorpe comes back?
She'll have to wait her turn.
I saw Tina first.
Don't you see?
Lazlo wants Mrs. Oglethorpe to catch you in bed with her!
Oh, no!
Mrs. Oglethorpe!
I've been in situations like this before.
We act calm.
Stay cool.
Okay, okay.
Tina leaves by the back door and no one is any the wiser.
- It's an old Gary Hart trick.
- I'm not leaving till I'm satisfied.
You beast!
Really has a such a nice light touch with women.
You big brute!
How dare you...
Get her out of sight!
No, no, no!
That's Lillian's room.
- In here.
In here.
- Not there!
She can't be found there.
That's my room.
I don't know why you insist on returning to my home.
We can't miss the final dress rehearsal of the ballet.
Lillian, my dear, we can't go without Flakfizer.
I just thought it would make for a better appearance if we all arrive at the same time.
You have been looking at your watch all morning, Edmund.
Your behavior is most peculiar.
You big animal!
What was that?
We must investigate!
Edmund, what is this?
You relentless sex stallion.
Oh, great.
Now she's talking about me.
What was that?
Jacques, show her what will happen if she doesn't shut up.
That came from your suite.
- Hide her!
- My bedroom?
Ninety-eight, 99, 100.
Lillian, Lazlo.
My two favorite L's.
What on earth are you doing here at this ungodly hour?
I know you're up to something, Flakfizer.
- A snap inspection?
- Roland.
- What are you doing in my bedroom?
- This is your room?
Thank God.
I thought someone sewed up all my fly-holes.
Lazlo, how about the three of us going down to the kitchen
- and making a big sandwich.
- I hardly think so.
I'm going to check under the bed.
Edmund!
What on earth has gotten into you?
- Be more careful.
- You did that on purpose.
You're trying to conceal the fact that--
Your suite.
And I think you're pretty terrific yourself.
You stay here.
There's no telling what he may do in this crazed state!
Lazlo.
I say, Lazlo.
- What are you looking for?
- A woman.
- How about calling an escort service?
- I'm calling the police.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
The guest bedrooms.
- Roland.
- All right.
Get in.
Get in.
- Roland, what is all the commotion?
- It's Lazlo.
I've never seen him like this.
Quick, in here.
And while you're in there, why don't you make the bed.
I know she's here somewhere.
- Lazlo!
- What?
- What was that?
- I don't know, but it came from in here.
- Edmund, this is outrageous.
- I can explain.
- He's got a woman tied up.
- Edmund!
- She looks dazed and drugged.
- No.
He's obviously the grand dragon of some sex-slave cult.
- And she looks like she's about 1 5.
- No, no, no.
Okay, 1 4, then.
In fact, I know she's 1 4 because I was dating her a year ago.
Edmund, I want you out of my house this instant.
If I had to take a wild guess, I'd say you're out of a job.
I hope there's no hard feelings.
You know, Lazlo, this is a good look for you.
Flakfizer.
Lazlo, are you decent?
- Lillian.
- Quick, smelling salts!
And a crane, if you got one.
Oh, my goodness.
You've done it now, Lazlo.
I don't feel a thing.
This woman is dead.
- You're holding his wrist.
- Then this man is dead.
- Mrs. Oglethorpe is unconscious.
- Smelling salts, right away.
Hello, excuse me, gentlemen?
Triple Speed Messenger Service.
I got a message here for a guy named Lazlo.
Give me that.
This is a litany of fraudulent accident cases, bad debts and several police departments who would love to get their hands on you.
And when Mrs. Oglethorpe comes to, she will read this and she will have no course but to fire you!
Quick, try some chloroform.
I'm taking Lillian to the hospital.
You, help me get her to the car.
Why don't you take him along for a brain scan.
Gently.
Easy.
- What are we gonna do now?
- What any Flakfizer would do.
What, something devious and underhanded?
You know the family.
If we don't get that letter before Lillian wakes up, we're dead ducks.
Multiple fractures?
Lucky day.
The name's Flakfizer.
No job too small, no fee too large.
If any limb falls off, mail it to me.
It can only strengthen our case.
Roland T. Flakfizer.
This is your lucky day.
- This man's dead.
- Then he won't be needing this.
- I'm almost all out of business cards.
- Excuse me.
What are you gentlemen doing here?
We're here to see Mrs. Lillian Oglethorpe.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She's on a private floor.
Hospital personnel and doctors only.
Hi.
Ed Breckerman, security.
There's a Mercedes on fire in the doctors' parking lot.
When will Mrs. Oglethorpe regain consciousness?
She's under a sedative.
You'll have to ask the doctor.
- You called?
- At last.
No letter here.
Right, I'll carve.
Dark meat or white?
Now, this is a very important woman.
I hope you know your business.
Hey, so do we.
I wanna assure you we've been doctors
- for many, many floors now.
- You're not the doctor I saw earlier.
He caught what she got.
We're filling in.
She's been out since she came here?
- Yes.
- And so she hasn't been able
- to read anything, then, huh?
- Of course not.
Good.
It will bring on complications.
Not for her, necessarily,
- but complications nonetheless.
- She's coming to, doctor.
- Now we got complications.
- She's going out, doctor.
- The crisis is over.
- This is ludicrous.
I don't think anyone will argue that point.
Let the games begin.
It's the first annual Vasectomy Bowl.
- What is going on?
- A happy doctor is a good doctor.
What is the meaning of this?
Are you sure you're a doctor?
That's gotta hurt.
At least, I hope it does.
- Doctor, we'll have to run a few tests.
- Table for one.
- There you go.
- Ground transportation, courtesy of Medicare.
You say ether and I say either Ether, either
Oh, please proceed.
I'm just checking on Mrs. Oglethorpe.
- Well, doctor?
- Yes, doctor?
- Yes, doctor?
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
- Yes.
Well, I thought we'll have to perform a full "rectumology."
An epidemic.
Drop those pants.
Not you, the patient.
- I thought you were cardiologists.
- They're all connected.
We enter the rectum and head north.
Why do you think we have such long instruments?
- X-rays for Dr. Blazie.
- I'll take those.
I deal in x-rays.
- I see you do too.
- I used to work at Las Vegas General.
Security to Room 1 404.
- Yeah.
Hit me.
- I'll play these.
Read them and weep.
Three hearts.
Beats a pair of kidneys.
- Doctor, your diagnosis?
- Difficult to tell from the negative.
- It's her liver.
- Looks more like veal to me.
- What is this?
- An obstruction in the fourth lumbar.
Huge backup in the lower intestine.
My advice is to avoid the intestine and plan an alternate route.
Grab a left at the first major artery and get on the fifth lumbar heading south.
Skeletal update every hour on the hour.
- Time for a thorough checkup.
- It's gotta be here somewhere.
- The operation is a success!
- Success.
- Success.
- Doctors, we're done here.
Arrest those men.
Come here.
Come on, man.
What are you doing?
Come on.
Come here.
Stay still, all right?
- So you were the doctors.
- No, we're not them.
We're someone else.
The three you're looking for are our twin brothers.
You'll never see us together, because we love the same women.
That's next on Geraldo.
- Roland.
- Yes?
- What are you doing here?
- That's a good question.
- What am I doing here?
- lmpersonating a doctor, harassing a patient, altering medical records.
Trespassing, destroying hospital property.
And don't forget Alan punching out Volare.
- Whose side are you on anyway?
- Give me that.
- Stealing private property.
- It could happen to anyone.
- Society's to blame.
- Too much violence in the movies.
- It's my environment.
- We were carrying out orders!
It's the Japanese.
They're buying up everything.
Did we leave anything out?
Could I have a personalized number?
Is my hair okay?
Empty your pockets.
You can make one call.
Hello, Sportsline?
Steamer, hi.
This is Rocco.
Am I on the air?
Give me that.
Be careful with that.
Do you know who this man is?
This is Jackson Pollock Jr., son of Roy Lichtenstein.
In a few years, this could be worth millions.
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows my sorrow
What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about When you sort it out, Alfie?
In the jungle, the mighty jungle, The lion sleeps tonight
In the jungle, the quiet jungle, The lion sleeps tonight
Hey.
- You got visitors.
- Maybe it's somebody
- with a recording contract.
- Alan.
Lisa.
You can go home, fellas.
- You bribed a guard?
- I paid your bail.
- How did you do that?
- I used my severance pay.
- You have servants?
- No.
Volare fired me.
It seems I wasn't appreciative enough.
- He can't do that.
- No, he's done it, all right.
And now he's dancing with Lisa's understudy.
The one with the large chest?
There's nobody in the company like that.
- Would be if I were running things.
- This is terrible.
And Volare's vowed to blackball us from ever dancing for a major ballet company.
- That's not fair.
- I know.
- And it's all my fault.
- Oh, it's your fault, huh?
Alan, don't talk that way.
Why, I wouldn't dance with Volare if he were the last man on earth.
Wait a minute.
Just because you're not in the ballet doesn't mean you won't dance tonight.
Flakfizer's right.
I don't know why, but he's right.
And I think it's about time for Alan to make his New York debut.
To the theater, and not a minute to lose!
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.
Tina, darling.
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.
- Five minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Five minutes?
Oh, my God.
What have I been doing?
- Four minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Four minutes?
Three minutes, Mr. Jolson.
What's going on here?
Where do you want these, Mr. Volare?
Anywhere.
Just keep them out of my way.
All right.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Get out of here.
Go.
Hey, you too.
You too.
Out.
Where do you want these, Mr. Volare?
- What's going on here?
!
- How do I know?
Have you lost your mind?
Lobstergram for Mr. Volare.
Lobstergram!
Oh, there you are.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
A masseuse!
Lazlo!
Mr. Volare is coming.
Places, please.
T onight is your night, my dear.
Thanks to you, Edmund.
After the performance,
I will announce you as the sole director of our ballet company.
If I do say so myself, the ballet is in good hands.
How could I ever have trusted someone as nefarious as Roland Flakfizer?
I don't wish to hear his name mentioned ever again.
Edmund.
It's those idiots!
I will put a stop to this.
Good evening, ballet fans.
We've got a good one.
Another big-league ballet battle starring that plucky Roberto "Bulldog" Volare.
And what a great night for a ballet it is.
The sky is clear, the wind is blowing from left to right, which means the ballerinas should be flying out of here.
And here we go.
Volare does a pirouette, another pirouette.
A skip, a leap.
He spins.
He scores!
Listen to that crowd!
- It's him!
- We return you now to your regularly scheduled program.
Come here.
Get the police now!
Hi.
Get out!
Get...
Hold it.
The Great Volare?
Bon voyage.
No!
- All right, yeah.
- Okay.
Here we go.
- Slam-dunk.
- Yes!
This is an outrage!
I will not continue unless you put a stop to this!
Yes, sir.
- Spread out.
Find them!
- Let's go.
Don't-
- Hey, give me that.
Get out of here.
Get out.
Damn.
Get off.
Off.
Let's go, this way.
- This way.
- Ole!
What on earth is happening?
Edmund.
Anyone?
- You rang?
- Roland, what is happening?
Ballet history.
When do we go on?
I'd say right about now.
There they are!
Arrest those men!
- Don't let them get away!
- Oh, boy.
I will never work for the Oglethorpe Ballet again!
- Will you put that in writing?
- This evening could ruin my career!
At least we're thinking along the same lines.
I must explain to my public this is all your doing.
- They're trying to tell you something.
- I quit!
That's what they're trying to tell you.
Officers, take these people away.
Oh, my God, he's got a gun!
The man's insane.
He could use a gift certificate to the Betty Ford Center.
We'll have lunch right after the lobotomy.
Always remember, nobody likes you.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Wonderful.
Wonderful!
We're a hit!
Go on, get back out there.
Get back out there.
- Listen to that crowd!
- You're a ballet legend.
- And you're not even dead yet.
- Oh, Roland, I'm so glad I trusted you.
Rest assured, my darling, I will never leave your side again.
What's that?
Nothing.
Hey, what happened?
I got an idea.
Hey, big boy.
Come here.
Yes.
Oh, boy.
Here I am!
Who's this?
Look at that.
Watch that ladder.
What happened?
Let me try something here.
What is it?
What's gone wrong here, then?
Won't work, huh?
Here we go.
What are you guys looking at?
Get me out of here!
Here!
It's mine!
Do you mind?
- Taxi!
- Taxi!
Taxi!
Come on.
Jacques!
Jacques, you're late!
I'm late.
I have to mow Mrs. Oglethorpe's lawn.
Stop that!
Stop that!
Stop that!
You moron.
There will be changes around here after today, and I will personally see that you will be the first one to go.
- Allow me.
- Wipe off those filthy hands!
- Take this.
- Oh, for me?
Carry it to the house, you idiot!
Here you are, my dear.
Do come in, Edmund.
My dear Lillian.
I'm so sorry I'm late, but there's so much to do in handling the Oglethorpe enterprises now that dear Oscar has passed on.
You are a good friend, Edmund.
And such a comfort in my time of need.
I hope more than a friend, Lillian.
As the lawyer for the Oglethorpe family,
I have been entrusted with the last will and testament of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.
- Edmund, I beg your pardon.
- Yes, dear lady?
I must apologize, but we really must wait for my personal solicitor, Roland T. Flakfizer.
- Jacques.
- Lillian,
I've been employed by your late husband for over 1 3 years.
- Are you dismissing me?
- Good heavens, no, Edmund.
I was involved in a minor accident with the Bentley last year.
Miraculously, he was by my side to assist me.
Oh, Jacques, I want you to go to this address and summon this gentleman at once.
I've been calling all morning and leaving messages.
- I can't seem to reach him.
- Yes, Mrs. O...
Lillian, how long must we wait?
I can assure you, once Mr. Flakfizer receives my message, he will race to be by my side.
Anyone hurt?
Roland T. Flakfizer, attorney at law.
Don't try to get up.
- I specialize in accident cases.
- We're both fine.
I know what I'm doing, I know what I'm doing.
You wouldn't happen to have any french fries on you, would you?
All right, all right.
Step back, step back.
I've got injured clients here.
Sir, you have caused grievous harm to my clients and their vehicle.
And through your negligence, this child has suffered severe neck injuries.
- Leave me alone.
- Stick with me, kid, and you can afford enough Nintendo software to sink a battleship.
- I can sue my parents?
- I sued mine.
- My neck!
- Corruptible youth.
God bless them.
My Lord, madam.
You shouldn't be walking in your condition.
This woman is with child.
If any harm came to this infant, by God, sir, you will feel my wrath in court.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't try to weasel out of this.
Dozens of witnesses saw your reckless driving.
How many of you saw this man carelessly, and without regard for life and property, careen into my clients at almost 85 miles per hour?
And who of you will tell their story to my young, 24-year-old,
Miss International Wet T-shirt champion, nymphomaniac secretary?
Yo!
Right here!
Right here!
Hey, hey!
Flakfizer's at it again, I see.
- Check for outstanding...
- Roland T. Flakfizer?
That's him.
Thank you very much.
You agree with me, I agree with you.
Hold that thought.
I swear, I never touched your daughter.
Taxi!
Here we go.
Get in.
Get in.
- Where to?
- Any place with no extradition laws.
- And step on it.
- Right.
- Mr. Roland T. Flakfizer?
- That depends.
- Do I owe you money?
- No.
In a drunken stupor, did I promise to marry you?
- No.
- Then I'm your man.
- Lillian Oglethorpe wants to see you.
- The Lillian Oglethorpe?
In her mid-50s, with possible gusts up to 60, 65?
- Yes.
Can you come right away?
- Is she still rich?
By all means.
The Oglethorpe place.
Big bucks.
Yeah, you settle back, I'll get you there safe and sound.
One-way street.
Don't worry, this happens a lot.
You enjoy driving a cab?
No.
As soon as I get me driver's license, I'm quitting.
A guy's really gotta haul rump to make ends meet these days.
I mean, apart from the cab, I'm a pool man, I perform liposuction,
I got me own toupee business.
My motto:
"Something that size should have hair on it."
Aren't those numbers clicking by awfully fast?
- You're probably a speed-reader.
- Well, you got me there.
Another two miles and we own this cab.
- I hope you brought money.
- Oh, sure.
I have a wallet just like that.
Hey, that is my wallet.
When I get some money, this could come in handy.
Such behavior.
Stealing another man's wallet.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- I don't believe it.
You!
- What are you doing?
- Do you know who I am?
A psychotic cab driver?
I'm Rocco Melonchek.
I hope you know you're blowing any possible tip.
You were my attorney in my divorce case until you started dating my wife during the trial.
And you got the court to double the alimony request she originally made.
You didn't want her to keep seeing me in cheap motels, did you?
For God's sake, man, she was your wife!
- Help me.
- Get off.
All right, all right, all right.
Five-minute break.
All right, break's over.
Wait a minute, wait.
You're a businessman.
- Let's talk business.
- Fine, and then I'll kill you.
I thought I recognized you.
I've been looking for you for the past three years.
- You're lying.
- Of course I am, but hear me out.
Clients are impressed by a law firm with a big staff.
The more employees, the bigger the fees.
So I could use a man like you in my organization.
Travel, excitement and a chance for advancement.
Of course, you'll start out on the bottom rung.
But work hard and in no time you'll move up to next-to-the-bottom rung.
- You got a dental plan?
- Lose a tooth, you get two free.
- What's my job?
- You can be my chauffeur.
- How much?
- Two hundred bucks a week.
- 600.
- 300.
- 400.
- 800.
- 900.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Shouldn't I be in this negotiation somewhere?
- 350 and not a penny more.
- I'll take it.
- What happened to 1000?
- I allowed for taxes.
- I want four weeks in advance.
- Five weeks.
Hold it.
I'm giving you one minute to stop this.
- Two minutes.
- Five minutes.
- Seven minutes.
- Nine minutes.
I've stepped into my own private hell.
We'd better get going.
The faster we get to Lillian, the quicker I can afford your salaries.
For 350 bucks a week, you drive.
Lillian, we really can't wait any longer.
I suppose you're right, Edmund.
I can't imagine what is keeping Roland.
- You guys wait here.
- Hey, you're the boss.
The reading of the last will and testament of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.
- Roland!
- Please, call me what everyone else calls me: "Your Royal Sex Machine."
I wouldn't come without bringing you a terribly expensive gift.
I hope you like it.
It reminds me of you.
Roland, how thoughtful of you.
But I believe I have one just like it.
Oh, no problem.
I'll take it back and get the money.
Mrs. Oglethorpe, you look wonderful.
I could make love to you right here and now.
Roland, please.
Let's keep this on a professional level.
Very well, then.
I'll charge you 50 bucks a pop.
Mr. Oglethorpe!
How well I remember him.
Gone now, but not forgotten.
I was never crazy about his taste in clothes.
I hope this speech doesn't seem like a rambling affair, which is something I'm sure we'll be involved in.
Oh, Lillian, you make me feel just like a natural woman.
I've heard enough.
- Sir, I am appalled.
- Lillian, who is this man?
Roland, this is Mr. Edmund Lazlo.
A likely story.
Just look at him.
He's obviously after your money and social standing, but I was here first.
Hey, how is everyone?
- Have you got any mustard in here?
- Hey, I'm the boss, remember?
- I told you to wait outside.
- Today's my day off.
Excuse me.
And just who are you?
He's a member of my staff.
Lillian Oglethorpe, Rocco Melonchek.
Rocco Melonchek, Lillian Oglethorpe.
In order to tell you two apart, one of you will have to wear a mustache.
Nice to meet someone else who buys their clothes at big-and-tall-man shops.
- I beg your pardon?
- Why?
You can't help it.
Refreshments.
Good idea, Jacques.
He was so devoted to my husband.
Darling Oscar is dead now, you know.
Well, I hope so.
I understand they buried him.
- Just make yourself feel at home.
- Lillian,
I really do believe we should begin.
Oh, yes, yes, certainly.
Will you all please find yourselves a seat?
Oh, I beg your...
The last will and testament of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.
- Do you have a bathroom?
- I protest!
This is most irregular!
- Lillian...
- Edmund!
Please be careful.
This man is in obviously no condition to carry on.
Rocco, will you continue?
- Lillian, I...
- Right, let's cut to the payoff here.
Blah, blah, blah...
Minnesota holdings, ski boat, ski boat, ski boat...
Yacht...
"To my gay lover, I leave--"
It was a joke.
I was just joking.
Yes.
Now.
Yes, here we are.
"All my worldly goods to be transferred into the care of my wife, Lillian."
- Darling.
- "And because of my love for the arts, I request that half my fortune be used to establish a ballet company."
Excellent.
Wonderful.
Nothing like the thrill of spending an evening watching a bunch of anorexics leaping around, guys with bulging genitals...
I hope I'm not arousing you.
This is all very well and good, but I wouldn't know the first thing
- about running such a company.
- Mrs. Oglethorpe...
-...as your trusted lawyer...
- You can use those words together?
...and friend I naturally assumed that task would fall to me.
Why would anyone wanna be the head of a ballet company?
"And the director of the company shall receive $500,000 a year salary."
I'll take the job.
I have ballet running through my veins.
Lillian, I'm your man!
Outrageous!
I doubt whether he knows the difference between the first, second, third, fourth or fifth positions!
Hey, he is strictly missionary position.
I will not allow a rogue like you to handle the Oglethorpe Ballet.
This document should be treated with the dignity and respect it deserves.
Hello!
This is no time for family pictures.
Charity work.
I gather these for those less fortunate than ourselves who can't afford pornography.
Edmund!
I demand this man be dismissed immediately!
- Jacques, you're working for me now.
- For what reason?
- Does it make you angry?
- Yes!
That's a good enough reason for me.
Lillian, I have a dream.
We'll bring in a whole new breed of ballet-goers with innovative giveaways.
Leotard nights, wet tutu competitions.
And we'll be the first company performing ballet for the hard of hearing.
We'll have the ballerinas wear wooden shoes.
Mrs. Oglethorpe, this man doesn't know what he's talking about.
Now, leave this matter to me and I will sign for you the world's premier dancer, The Great Volare.
Volare?
How wonderful.
Wait a second!
Uno pari-mutuel.
Not the Volare!
You know The Great Volare?
I knew him back when he was known as the Pretty Good Volare.
We served in the Army together.
He owes me one.
I threw myself on top of an 1 8-year-old Vietnamese girl and saved his life.
- Nonsense!
- That's where you're wrong.
This is nonsense.
Lillian, I am the only one who can bring you the world's greatest male ballerina.
For myself, I ask only a nominal salary, plus a cut of gross receipts, a bonus of 25 percent on anything above break-even, a $300 per diem, the use of a company car and housing.
By all means, make my husband's dream come true.
What, you want him to marry a cheerleader?
Give us a ballet.
Oh, this is so exciting.
I can see I am no longer required as the family lawyer.
Look, I'm thinking of becoming a lawyer.
- Can I buy your diploma off you?
- Good heavens.
I need you both.
Very well, Lillian.
As you wish.
- For now.
- Then this evening I'm off to the ballet.
I must shave, shower, get new clothes and practice signing your name.
My pearl...
I bid you all a fondue.
If you should lose this hand in an industrial accident, keep it for me.
Gentlemen!
Alan.
I brought this for you.
It's not exactly a bouquet, but it's a start.
So sweet.
Were you watching the ballet again tonight?
Of course.
I love to watch you dance.
Someday we're gonna be on that stage dancing together.
At the rate I'm going, I'm not so sure.
Alan, don't talk that way.
We agreed that if one of us got into a major company, it could only help the both of us.
Tonight I'm going to talk to Volare about you.
I would love that.
I mean, no one dances like The Great Volare.
Except you.
Catch.
Tickets, please?
No smoking in the theater.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
Please.
- Five and six.
- Eleven.
Now it's your turn: 25 and 67.
Miss!
These seats are dreadful.
They're facing the stage.
Hey, did we miss the coming attractions?
Who's the bad guy?
Is Tom Cruise in this?
Do you work out?
- I'm looking for The Great Volare.
- He's on-stage.
And he doesn't appreciate visitors backstage.
No, no, no, I'm not a visitor.
This is strictly business.
- This creep bothering you?
- No.
No.
She's quite delightful, thank you.
Ok, I give up.
How come he doesn't throw up?
Bravo, Mr. Volare.
They love you.
That audience wouldn't know a ballet from a bullfight.
And who are you to speak to me?
Where is my towel?
When I come off-stage, I expect my towel immediately.
- Do you understand me?
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Fire him.
Tina, darling, you were marvelous.
Perhaps we should meet in my dressing room after the performance and discuss your career.
I'd like that very much, Mr. Volare.
- Thank you.
- Lisa!
Darling, I thought we'd have dinner tonight after the closing-night party.
Oh, well, thank you, but I'm afraid I've already made plans.
Mr. Volare, I'd like you to meet my friend Alan Grant.
It's a privilege to meet you, Mr. Volare.
I'm a huge fan of yours.
Well, Alan's a dancer too, with the Performing Artists Group, the nonprofit ballet troupe.
Really?
How sweet.
It's a fine idea to keep busy until one is good enough to command a salary.
My cue.
- She looked 1 8, officer, I swear!
- Too noisy around here.
I'll say.
I got twice the sleep at a Julio Iglesias concert.
This guy's gotta get off-stage soon.
Let's go back, wait for him, sign him up.
Excuse us.
Excuse me.
We have to get this plutonium back to the lab.
- Jacques.
- Hey.
- You know him?
- Sure.
He used to drive Mr. Oglethorpe to the theater,
- then I'd sneak him into the ballet.
- I'm gonna be the best man
- at their wedding.
- I hope so.
Excuse me, we didn't get your name.
Oh, my name's Rocco Melonchek.
I'm the ballet world's up-and-coming manager/agent.
I'm here to sign a contract with The Great Volare.
I hate to burst your bubble, but Volare already has an agent and manager.
That's too bad.
Any of them real sick?
You don't need Volare.
What you need is the next great ballet talent.
A young, fresh face.
- Alan Grant.
- Exactly.
- I got it right.
- There's my cue.
Jacques, convince Mr. Melonchek Alan's the person he's looking for.
This is all well and good, but can he dance?
Could he make millions?
Would he sign a contract for a lot of money, but take scale,
leaving his manager with everything else?
Sure he would.
Wouldn't you, Alan?
Alan?
Can't you see he's watching the woman he adores?
- You're in love with her, aren't you?
- You bet.
- When's the wedding?
- There won't be one unless I can find a job dancing.
To tell you the truth, Mr. Melonchek, I'm about out of money and I'm gonna have to go back to Minneapolis.
I'll tell you what.
Don't you buy that plane ticket just yet, because I am gonna get you an audition with Roland T. Flakfizer, ballet director.
- You could do that?
- Sure.
They're like this.
Well, let's go to work, Mr. Melonchek.
I now pronounce us dancer and manager.
Yeah!
Come in.
Tina, darling.
I'm so glad you've come.
You were most inspiring tonight.
I can see that under my guidance, your career will soar.
Already I can hear the audience roar.
- Who are you?
- Roland T. Flakfizer, managing director of the Oglethorpe-Flakfizer Ballet Company.
You wouldn't happen to have a plunger on you, would you?
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, I see you have a pretty visitor.
I'll tell you what.
I'll get a girl and we'll double.
- You got five minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Five minutes?
My God!
Have you consulted another doctor?
- You are out of line.
- And you are out of toilet paper.
- But we're still short one girl.
- What are you doing here?
- To sign you for my ballet company.
- To sign me for your ballet company?
Swear to God, I just said that.
Why don't you run along and let us men talk business.
Just leave your phone number and favorite color with the manager and later we'll talk business.
- You're cute, Mr...?
- Garvey.
Steve Garvey.
I think we have something beautiful, you and I.
Someday you'll have my children.
In fact, they're out in the car, if you want them.
Oh, God...
You're still here?
I will have you thrown out of the theater.
- First, we talk ballet.
- I know nothing of your ballet.
We have a lot in common.
I'm managing director and I don't either.
Look, I don't dance for just anyone.
I am ballet.
My dance shoes are in the Louvre in Paris.
So what?
Last year, I left a raincoat in Cleveland.
Do you realize what I was doing at the age of 7?
I can imagine.
You must be thankful you didn't go blind.
I was dancing professionally.
Well, whatever you call it: flogging the carrot, polishing the cue stick, choking the chicken, clearing the snorkel...
But I didn't come back here to rehash good times.
Volare, dance with the Oglethorpe-Flakfizer Ballet Company and you can name your price.
Money is no object.
It isn't mine.
Look, I'm offering you a check for $500,000.
It's made out to Volare, Great, The.
I don't dance for the money.
Then you dance and I'll keep the money.
Look, I will not dance for your ballet and that is final.
A Flakfizer doesn't know the meaning of the word "no."
And we're a little fuzzy on the word "panagglutinin" and "viscosity."
All right, all right.
Let's sweeten the pot.
The same money,
- we throw in a girl.
- No!
Then would you object to me getting one?
I'm a lonely man, Mr. Volare.
I will give you till the count of ten to get out of here.
- One, two, three--
- Before you get stuck somewhere around six, I'll go.
If there's anything I can ever do for you, forget it.
Because I don't do those kind of things.
And for the last time, I warn you about that highly contagious rash.
I beg you to see to it at once.
Hygiene, Mr. Volare.
Hygiene.
- Mr. Flakfizer.
- Where?
!
I'm sorry, I thought my father showed up.
Come here, come here.
Did Volare accept your offer?
I didn't know the meaning of the word "no,"
but he had it down pretty good.
You wouldn't happen to have a world-famous dancer stuffed in a drawer somewhere, would you?
As a matter of fact, I would.
His name's Alan Grant.
He can dance rings around Volare.
He's even more talented than Gorbachev.
- Gesundheit.
- Baryshnikov.
- God bless you.
- Baryshnikov.
Hi.
How's it going?
How you doing?
You look very nice today.
He's one of the best dancers in the country.
Hire him for the ballet.
What do you say?
No, no, nay, nyet.
I have to find some way to sign Volare.
When I do that, I'm director of the ballet.
And, gentlemen, that spells cash with a capital...
- K.
- You should go back to school.
I hated teaching.
- Flakfizer, I thought you were smart.
- I am smart.
I said no to you, didn't I?
I'm offering you two incomes.
Your paycheck from the ballet company and then when you sign Alan Grant to dance, another hefty check as part of Alan's management team.
How do we get this past Mrs. Oglethorpe?
Relax.
After she sees Alan dance, you've got nothing to worry about.
Except for taxes, depletion of the ozone layer and diseases due to any sexual contact.
- That's a load off my mind.
- All you gotta do is convince Mrs. Oglethorpe to let Alan into the charity bazaar.
Are you kidding?
I can charm the pants off of her.
Now, that is a disgusting thought.
Gentlemen, you're gonna have to sneak him in.
Not so fast.
You know, I worry about you, I really do.
We're gonna make this legal.
We need a contract.
A binding document, with plenty of loopholes.
Exactly.
Jacques, draw up the standard contract, would you, please?
Hello, Jacques.
We've got years to go before we even come close to the Japanese.
Right.
Sign that.
- This paper's blank.
- I'll fill it in later.
Fair enough.
You're not gonna cheat me or anything?
I give you my word as a gentleman.
Well, you had me until then.
All right, all right.
Fifty-fifty split.
- Now, this is more like it.
- What about me?
To show you no favoritism, Rocco and I
- will also split your salary fifty-fifty.
- Thanks.
That should keep you out of a higher income bracket.
Come to think of it, that should keep you out of any income bracket.
Rocco, Jacques, tomorrow, Alan Grant joins the Oglethorpe Ballet Company.
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Ninth Annual Oglethorpe Charity Festival.
- Let's go.
- It gives me great pleasure to announce the Oglethorpe Ballet Company will be leaving for New York tomorrow, where we...
You two go and get dressed.
Be ready in ten minutes.
- T en minutes?
We'll be ready.
- And you're gonna be a star.
You know, if you keep this up, I may even start to believe it.
Nice to have a chance to make someone's wish come true.
That's a nice thing to do.
Well, how did the market close?
Well, roll over my amalgamated, split my utilities and double my capital venture overlays.
Now, call me in an hour and tell me what the hell I'm talking about.
Pull over.
Everybody all set?
We've got everything so under control, it's pathetic.
- And so is he.
- Good.
Driver, drive on.
Look out for that truck!
- Buffy...
- Lillian.
Get this thing up on the rack and have it overhauled.
Better yet, why don't you get up on the rack and I'll see you in an hour.
Avanti!
Here, Buffy.
There you are.
- Darling.
- Have you come to see Mommy?
What a charming little animal.
Do you know dogs, Mr. Melonchek?
Know dogs?
I used to be a chef in a Korean restaurant.
Good food, good friends, good conversation.
Roland, I'm so upset Volare turned us down.
I know.
What a slap in our collective faces.
Like I told you, he has no respect for our ballet.
I wouldn't want a man like that dancing for me.
- Or with me, for that matter.
- I offered him half the moon.
I keep asking myself, "Why didn't he sign with us?"
Because he said he wouldn't work with you if you were the last person on earth.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
Fetch.
My darling Lillian, Volare has shunned us.
Hold your chins up high, for I have discovered a fabulous young dancer.
- A talent that soars.
- Volare.
It's Volare!
Oh, good heavens.
It's him.
- It's Volare.
- Step back.
Step back.
Step back.
Lillian, permit me to introduce
- The Great Volare.
- I've seen greater.
SignorVolare, I understand you've refused to dance with our company.
The truth of the matter is Mr. Volare won't work with Mr. Flakfizer.
But, my dear Lillian, I am happy to announce that I have signed Mr. Volare to dance with and to be the artistic director of the Oglethorpe Ballet Company.
Ladies and gentlemen, the overture has started.
- Overture to what?
- The ballet find of the century.
- What?
- Roll up!
Roll up!
Top-class ballet, this way!
Lillian, just a little surprise I cooked up.
If you don't like it, it was Rocco's idea.
Oh, Roland, I love a surprise.
Yeah!
Yo, Rocco, Rocco.
Mrs. Oglethorpe, meet the future world champion of ballet,
- Mr. Alan Grant.
- It's a pleasure.
Nice to meet you.
Mrs. Oglethorpe, I would like to make an announcement.
- He's being deported.
- I have found my prima ballerina...
-...the lovely Miss Lisa Le Baron.
- What?
Well...
But what about Alan?
Shall we say, a most unusual technique.
Perhaps better suited to experimental theater.
You can't talk to my client like that.
If Alan isn't in the company, I won't be either.
- Neither will I.
- That's a victory for all mankind.
You're making a mistake, my dear.
Lisa, I agree with Volare.
But, Alan, we'll be apart for months.
Remember when you told me that with you dancing,
- it would be good for both of us?
- Yes, but--
When Volare makes you a star, you can choose anyone to dance with.
Dance with the Oglethorpe.
Come on.
I'll be the proudest guy in the country.
- All right.
- You've made a wise choice, my dear.
- Then it's settled.
I am so excited.
- You're excited?
Feel these nipples.
Now, Lillian, about the directorship of the ballet company...
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course, Edmund.
You have brought us The Great Volare.
And dear Roland has presented us with our ballerina.
I think it only fair that you and Roland share the honor.
- Flakfizer?
This is preposterous.
- Preposterous, is it?
Why don't we step outside
- and settle this like men.
- We are outside.
Then why don't we step inside and settle this like women.
Or are you afraid, Lazlo?
- I'm twice the man you are.
- So is she.
And it's driving me mad.
Oh, Lillian, can't you see I'm on fire?
And you, you contemptible cur!
Maybe you don't want to work for Mrs. Oglethorpe.
- Is that so, Edmund?
- Of course not!
I will do anything that is best for the ballet.
Well, there's no need to commit suicide.
And to show you no hard feelings, how about a cigar.
- I don't smoke.
- Well, I do.
Why don't you run out and get me one.
And now, since I'm in charge of the ballet, just jamming that thought home, I propose a toast.
Champagne!
I'm not going to work with such an uncouth pig.
- Certainly, Mr. Volare.
- Now it's on to New York!
And a hefty per diem.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Here you go.
Here you go.
I'm all out of American currency.
Take a fistful of Romanian 50s, all right?
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
The end of another grueling day.
The press conference is to begin in five minutes.
Roland seems to be running a little late.
Late?
That charlatan hasn't been around in weeks.
I don't know why you put up with him.
He's never in his office.
He never responds to his calls.
He's totally irresponsible.
Lisa.
Relax, my dear.
Everyone is nervous their first time.
Just follow my lead.
I'm very experienced.
- That's very kind of you, Mr. Volare.
- Oh, come on.
Call me Roberto.
Roberto.
Lisa, I know an intimate little bistro with a fabulous view of the city.
Perhaps dinner and an all-night boat ride?
Well, I don't really think that would be such a good idea--
I hope I'm interrupting something.
Volare, you know it's not polite to drool in public.
Roland, I haven't seen you for weeks.
Lillian, my pile of sweetness.
I'm so sorry.
I've been busy promoting our ballet at beauty pageants.
And then, of course, there's my volunteer work at the breast-implant clinic.
And how I missed you.
In fact, I missed you so much, two days ago I went out and I bought a woman who looks just like you.
- Oh, you silly.
- For you.
From you.
Another lovely bracelet.
I didn't want this wrist to think I was neglecting it.
- Oh, Roland...
- Lillian, l--
Lazlo, I didn't see you there.
I stand corrected.
I saw you, but I chose to ignore you.
Lisa, my darling.
Will you excuse us?
Two's company and three's an adult movie.
- Mrs. Oglethorpe, may we start?
- Oh, please.
Is she a fox or what?
Ladies and gentlemen, for many weeks now the Oglethorpe Ballet Company have been in rehearsal.
Tomorrow we open with Roberto Volare's interpretation of Tears of the Swan.
At this time, I wish to introduce to you the creative genius behind our company, the brightest light in the ballet firmament...
Thank you for those kind words, Edmund Lazlo.
I don't know who does your hair, but tell me, where do they do it and when are they bringing it back?
Well, I had a speech all prepared, but today I'm going to speak from the heart.
You've no doubt asked yourself, "Why has he been chosen for this task of running the Oglethorpe?"
Well, the whole story is right here in my autobiography:
Flakfizer:
A Man's Man.
But I like women a lot more.
My intimate views of Jackie, Cher, Sean, Larry, Moe, Curly.
Over 200 pages of provocative pictures, and only one page has any writing on it.
Act now and you can get one of these fabulous "Flakfizer is ballet" T-shirts.
MasterCard and Visas accepted.
That brings me to the task at hand, to introduce the woman I adore.
Behind every great man is a woman.
And thank heaven I have Lillian Oglethorpe, because, quite frankly,
I enjoy the shade.
Dear Lillian, soon I hope to take you on a Caribbean cruise, where we can hold hands on a soft summer's evening and watch that old Jamaican moon.
Why that old Jamaican will be mooning us, I have no idea.
And now, here she is, the woman voted by her senior class
"most likely to go up a few dress sizes,"
a woman who would be a man, except her name is Lillian,
Lillian Oglethorpe.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey, what's with all the tears?
This should be the happiest night of your life.
I know it should be.
It's just that I miss Alan so much.
Well, I'd feel the same way if the man I loved was thousands of miles away.
Of course, I'd be living a whole different lifestyle.
Here, come with me.
I know just the thing to cheer you up.
If you just step right in here, my dear, your spirits might just brighten.
- But that's Mr. Volare's dressing room.
- Of course.
He's got the best champagne.
- Alan!
- Lisa.
Flakfizer flew Alan out to see you in the opening of the ballet.
It's a formal affair.
Do you have tuxedos?
I got mine.
That's great for tomorrow, but aren't you a little overdressed for today?
Oh, no.
- I'm very impressed.
- I don't have any luggage.
Then this all makes sense.
I was worried there for a second.
Mr. Flakfizer, thank you.
I see you're saving your best stuff for Alan.
I think we should leave the lovers alone for a few minutes.
Make that a few hours.
- I missed you so much.
- I don't want us to be apart ever again.
- I told you before!
- Oh, my God, it's Volare.
- You better hide.
- Don't hang my tight by the crotch!
- It throws off my bulge!
- Yes, Volare, I'm sorry.
Lisa, what a pleasant surprise.
I see you decided to start our little party early, huh?
- Roberto, you've got the wrong idea.
- Oh, no.
I think I've got the right idea.
- Roberto, stop it!
- Get your hands off of her!
- You!
What are you doing here?
- Mr. Flakfizer flew me out.
You and Mr. Flakfizer are going to be sorry for this.
- Volare, what happened?
- It's Flakfizer.
He's brought that performance artist out here.
- Hasn't that information arrived yet?
- No, but we may not need it.
I have devised a little plan.
He's staying at Lillian's townhouse.
All we have to do is make a few arrangements.
Oh, no.
Lillian?
- Well, no one's in.
- Roland.
This is just a business call.
I didn't think you were back so soon.
- Roland.
- Lillian can't we just be friends?
Why, you're not Lillian.
- You gonna spank me?
- We can start there and see what happens.
- Are we alone?
- Servants have the day off.
Lillian is already at the theater, but I'm here.
- Take me.
- Okay.
Let's say two out of three falls.
No standing eight count.
Wait.
I wanna make love by candlelight.
I could do you one better.
I think this is more in keeping with...things to come.
Not a bad little pad Lillian's got here.
- Was that the doorbell?
- That wasn't you?
Never mind.
Just ignore it.
Well, it's a big house.
Maybe they can't hear the bell.
Let's try this.
Wait a minute.
I'll be right back.
If you need anything, there's plenty of batteries in my room.
Oh, let me try this.
Good idea.
You go through the window.
If the alarm goes off, I'll run away so they won't catch both of us.
We don't want any!
Oh, it's you.
We have to talk.
It's very important.
Look.
The next half-hour, give or take 29 minutes, will be very important for me, so thanks for dropping by.
Yeah, but--
Flakfizer!
- The face is familiar.
- It's mine.
And so it is.
Say, if you ever visit this planet again, give me a call.
We'll have lunch.
- Flakfizer.
- How come you didn't knock?
I'm using a better grade of gas.
- That's not bad, is it?
- You know, I always enjoy it when we get together, but I want you out, or I'll be forced to kill you.
I'll tell the police
- I did it out of love.
- Flakie, aren't you coming to bed?
- That's a girl.
- Not just a girl, a way of life.
What if Mrs. Oglethorpe comes back?
She'll have to wait her turn.
I saw Tina first.
Don't you see?
Lazlo wants Mrs. Oglethorpe to catch you in bed with her!
Oh, no!
Mrs. Oglethorpe!
I've been in situations like this before.
We act calm.
Stay cool.
Okay, okay.
Tina leaves by the back door and no one is any the wiser.
- It's an old Gary Hart trick.
- I'm not leaving till I'm satisfied.
You beast!
Really has a such a nice light touch with women.
You big brute!
How dare you...
Get her out of sight!
No, no, no!
That's Lillian's room.
- In here.
In here.
- Not there!
She can't be found there.
That's my room.
I don't know why you insist on returning to my home.
We can't miss the final dress rehearsal of the ballet.
Lillian, my dear, we can't go without Flakfizer.
I just thought it would make for a better appearance if we all arrive at the same time.
You have been looking at your watch all morning, Edmund.
Your behavior is most peculiar.
You big animal!
What was that?
We must investigate!
Edmund, what is this?
You relentless sex stallion.
Oh, great.
Now she's talking about me.
What was that?
Jacques, show her what will happen if she doesn't shut up.
That came from your suite.
- Hide her!
- My bedroom?
Ninety-eight, 99, 100.
Lillian, Lazlo.
My two favorite L's.
What on earth are you doing here at this ungodly hour?
I know you're up to something, Flakfizer.
- A snap inspection?
- Roland.
- What are you doing in my bedroom?
- This is your room?
Thank God.
I thought someone sewed up all my fly-holes.
Lazlo, how about the three of us going down to the kitchen
- and making a big sandwich.
- I hardly think so.
I'm going to check under the bed.
Edmund!
What on earth has gotten into you?
- Be more careful.
- You did that on purpose.
You're trying to conceal the fact that--
Your suite.
And I think you're pretty terrific yourself.
You stay here.
There's no telling what he may do in this crazed state!
Lazlo.
I say, Lazlo.
- What are you looking for?
- A woman.
- How about calling an escort service?
- I'm calling the police.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
The guest bedrooms.
- Roland.
- All right.
Get in.
Get in.
- Roland, what is all the commotion?
- It's Lazlo.
I've never seen him like this.
Quick, in here.
And while you're in there, why don't you make the bed.
I know she's here somewhere.
- Lazlo!
- What?
- What was that?
- I don't know, but it came from in here.
- Edmund, this is outrageous.
- I can explain.
- He's got a woman tied up.
- Edmund!
- She looks dazed and drugged.
- No.
He's obviously the grand dragon of some sex-slave cult.
- And she looks like she's about 1 5.
- No, no, no.
Okay, 1 4, then.
In fact, I know she's 1 4 because I was dating her a year ago.
Edmund, I want you out of my house this instant.
If I had to take a wild guess, I'd say you're out of a job.
I hope there's no hard feelings.
You know, Lazlo, this is a good look for you.
Flakfizer.
Lazlo, are you decent?
- Lillian.
- Quick, smelling salts!
And a crane, if you got one.
Oh, my goodness.
You've done it now, Lazlo.
I don't feel a thing.
This woman is dead.
- You're holding his wrist.
- Then this man is dead.
- Mrs. Oglethorpe is unconscious.
- Smelling salts, right away.
Hello, excuse me, gentlemen?
Triple Speed Messenger Service.
I got a message here for a guy named Lazlo.
Give me that.
This is a litany of fraudulent accident cases, bad debts and several police departments who would love to get their hands on you.
And when Mrs. Oglethorpe comes to, she will read this and she will have no course but to fire you!
Quick, try some chloroform.
I'm taking Lillian to the hospital.
You, help me get her to the car.
Why don't you take him along for a brain scan.
Gently.
Easy.
- What are we gonna do now?
- What any Flakfizer would do.
What, something devious and underhanded?
You know the family.
If we don't get that letter before Lillian wakes up, we're dead ducks.
Multiple fractures?
Lucky day.
The name's Flakfizer.
No job too small, no fee too large.
If any limb falls off, mail it to me.
It can only strengthen our case.
Roland T. Flakfizer.
This is your lucky day.
- This man's dead.
- Then he won't be needing this.
- I'm almost all out of business cards.
- Excuse me.
What are you gentlemen doing here?
We're here to see Mrs. Lillian Oglethorpe.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She's on a private floor.
Hospital personnel and doctors only.
Hi.
Ed Breckerman, security.
There's a Mercedes on fire in the doctors' parking lot.
When will Mrs. Oglethorpe regain consciousness?
She's under a sedative.
You'll have to ask the doctor.
- You called?
- At last.
No letter here.
Right, I'll carve.
Dark meat or white?
Now, this is a very important woman.
I hope you know your business.
Hey, so do we.
I wanna assure you we've been doctors
- for many, many floors now.
- You're not the doctor I saw earlier.
He caught what she got.
We're filling in.
She's been out since she came here?
- Yes.
- And so she hasn't been able
- to read anything, then, huh?
- Of course not.
Good.
It will bring on complications.
Not for her, necessarily,
- but complications nonetheless.
- She's coming to, doctor.
- Now we got complications.
- She's going out, doctor.
- The crisis is over.
- This is ludicrous.
I don't think anyone will argue that point.
Let the games begin.
It's the first annual Vasectomy Bowl.
- What is going on?
- A happy doctor is a good doctor.
What is the meaning of this?
Are you sure you're a doctor?
That's gotta hurt.
At least, I hope it does.
- Doctor, we'll have to run a few tests.
- Table for one.
- There you go.
- Ground transportation, courtesy of Medicare.
You say ether and I say either Ether, either
Oh, please proceed.
I'm just checking on Mrs. Oglethorpe.
- Well, doctor?
- Yes, doctor?
- Yes, doctor?
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
- Yes.
Well, I thought we'll have to perform a full "rectumology."
An epidemic.
Drop those pants.
Not you, the patient.
- I thought you were cardiologists.
- They're all connected.
We enter the rectum and head north.
Why do you think we have such long instruments?
- X-rays for Dr. Blazie.
- I'll take those.
I deal in x-rays.
- I see you do too.
- I used to work at Las Vegas General.
Security to Room 1 404.
- Yeah.
Hit me.
- I'll play these.
Read them and weep.
Three hearts.
Beats a pair of kidneys.
- Doctor, your diagnosis?
- Difficult to tell from the negative.
- It's her liver.
- Looks more like veal to me.
- What is this?
- An obstruction in the fourth lumbar.
Huge backup in the lower intestine.
My advice is to avoid the intestine and plan an alternate route.
Grab a left at the first major artery and get on the fifth lumbar heading south.
Skeletal update every hour on the hour.
- Time for a thorough checkup.
- It's gotta be here somewhere.
- The operation is a success!
- Success.
- Success.
- Doctors, we're done here.
Arrest those men.
Come here.
Come on, man.
What are you doing?
Come on.
Come here.
Stay still, all right?
- So you were the doctors.
- No, we're not them.
We're someone else.
The three you're looking for are our twin brothers.
You'll never see us together, because we love the same women.
That's next on Geraldo.
- Roland.
- Yes?
- What are you doing here?
- That's a good question.
- What am I doing here?
- lmpersonating a doctor, harassing a patient, altering medical records.
Trespassing, destroying hospital property.
And don't forget Alan punching out Volare.
- Whose side are you on anyway?
- Give me that.
- Stealing private property.
- It could happen to anyone.
- Society's to blame.
- Too much violence in the movies.
- It's my environment.
- We were carrying out orders!
It's the Japanese.
They're buying up everything.
Did we leave anything out?
Could I have a personalized number?
Is my hair okay?
Empty your pockets.
You can make one call.
Hello, Sportsline?
Steamer, hi.
This is Rocco.
Am I on the air?
Give me that.
Be careful with that.
Do you know who this man is?
This is Jackson Pollock Jr., son of Roy Lichtenstein.
In a few years, this could be worth millions.
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows my sorrow
What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about When you sort it out, Alfie?
In the jungle, the mighty jungle, The lion sleeps tonight
In the jungle, the quiet jungle, The lion sleeps tonight
Hey.
- You got visitors.
- Maybe it's somebody
- with a recording contract.
- Alan.
Lisa.
You can go home, fellas.
- You bribed a guard?
- I paid your bail.
- How did you do that?
- I used my severance pay.
- You have servants?
- No.
Volare fired me.
It seems I wasn't appreciative enough.
- He can't do that.
- No, he's done it, all right.
And now he's dancing with Lisa's understudy.
The one with the large chest?
There's nobody in the company like that.
- Would be if I were running things.
- This is terrible.
And Volare's vowed to blackball us from ever dancing for a major ballet company.
- That's not fair.
- I know.
- And it's all my fault.
- Oh, it's your fault, huh?
Alan, don't talk that way.
Why, I wouldn't dance with Volare if he were the last man on earth.
Wait a minute.
Just because you're not in the ballet doesn't mean you won't dance tonight.
Flakfizer's right.
I don't know why, but he's right.
And I think it's about time for Alan to make his New York debut.
To the theater, and not a minute to lose!
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.
Tina, darling.
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.
- Five minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Five minutes?
Oh, my God.
What have I been doing?
- Four minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Four minutes?
Three minutes, Mr. Jolson.
What's going on here?
Where do you want these, Mr. Volare?
Anywhere.
Just keep them out of my way.
All right.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Get out of here.
Go.
Hey, you too.
You too.
Out.
Where do you want these, Mr. Volare?
- What's going on here?
!
- How do I know?
Have you lost your mind?
Lobstergram for Mr. Volare.
Lobstergram!
Oh, there you are.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
A masseuse!
Lazlo!
Mr. Volare is coming.
Places, please.
T onight is your night, my dear.
Thanks to you, Edmund.
After the performance,
I will announce you as the sole director of our ballet company.
If I do say so myself, the ballet is in good hands.
How could I ever have trusted someone as nefarious as Roland Flakfizer?
I don't wish to hear his name mentioned ever again.
Edmund.
It's those idiots!
I will put a stop to this.
Good evening, ballet fans.
We've got a good one.
Another big-league ballet battle starring that plucky Roberto "Bulldog" Volare.
And what a great night for a ballet it is.
The sky is clear, the wind is blowing from left to right, which means the ballerinas should be flying out of here.
And here we go.
Volare does a pirouette, another pirouette.
A skip, a leap.
He spins.
He scores!
Listen to that crowd!
- It's him!
- We return you now to your regularly scheduled program.
Come here.
Get the police now!
Hi.
Get out!
Get...
Hold it.
The Great Volare?
Bon voyage.
No!
- All right, yeah.
- Okay.
Here we go.
- Slam-dunk.
- Yes!
This is an outrage!
I will not continue unless you put a stop to this!
Yes, sir.
- Spread out.
Find them!
- Let's go.
Don't-
- Hey, give me that.
Get out of here.
Get out.
Damn.
Get off.
Off.
Let's go, this way.
- This way.
- Ole!
What on earth is happening?
Edmund.
Anyone?
- You rang?
- Roland, what is happening?
Ballet history.
When do we go on?
I'd say right about now.
There they are!
Arrest those men!
- Don't let them get away!
- Oh, boy.
I will never work for the Oglethorpe Ballet again!
- Will you put that in writing?
- This evening could ruin my career!
At least we're thinking along the same lines.
I must explain to my public this is all your doing.
- They're trying to tell you something.
- I quit!
That's what they're trying to tell you.
Officers, take these people away.
Oh, my God, he's got a gun!
The man's insane.
He could use a gift certificate to the Betty Ford Center.
We'll have lunch right after the lobotomy.
Always remember, nobody likes you.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Wonderful.
Wonderful!
We're a hit!
Go on, get back out there.
Get back out there.
- Listen to that crowd!
- You're a ballet legend.
- And you're not even dead yet.
- Oh, Roland, I'm so glad I trusted you.
Rest assured, my darling, I will never leave your side again.
What's that?
Nothing.
Hey, what happened?
I got an idea.
Hey, big boy.
Come here.
Yes.
Oh, boy.

when you are alone eternally, you live for the comfort of the senses-- food, sex.
i'd become very selective, and it was getting harder for me to find food, even living in the city.
my choosiness about food cost me my lover, and without him, there is no sex.
for six nights, i have found nothing to eat.
but then came good news.
i was sad.
i was starved.

"what about italian?"

where'd it come from?
what, sal?
the toaster?
honestly, i don't know.
you was with leguto.
when leguto fell off the face of the earth, you became mine.
then you got this idea because i just took over, maybe i'm confused, maybe i'm letting things slip through the cracks.
no, sal, i would never think-- where did it come from?
sal, tell me what the answer is.
what should i say?
it came from a warehouse.
it came off a truck from the airport!
a truck you hit tuesday!
where's my end, gilly?
i had to take inventory, make sure you got a complete cross section of the merchandise.
i thought this was just a sit-down.
yeah, but somebody ain't getting up.
i got a message for your warehouse guys.
please, god.
sallie, no.
the message is... don't fuck with me!
sal!
we got eyes on us!
maybe somebody saw this guy come in here.
what are you saying?
you telling me something?
get rid of him discreet.
you want discreet?
you fucking shoot him.
ray!
do it!
please, sal, no.
you don't understand.
it's a terrible mistake.
i want to live.
i'll do anything for you.
please!
please help me!
please, sal.
you don't understand.
gilly, that's fucking disgusting.
no, please!
don't do it to me!
you don't understand!
don't do it to me.
don't!
you don't understand!
fucking die.
next time i tell you to pull the trigger, you fucking pull the trigger!
sal, come on, relax.
joe's one of us.
yeah.
ha ha!
this shit's starting to get to me.
ha ha ha!
yeah.
he does what he's got to do.
he loves it.
he's fucking sick.
you can't talk like that.
this is war.
we're soldiers.
we kill to protect what's ours.
here. take this.
it's clean.
i'm good at stealing.
i'm not a shooter.
if you're not a shooter, you're shot.
bang!
you just can't sit around and watch anymore.
sal will tell you to whack somebody, and you got no choice.
come on.
fucking cops!
hey!
jesus, joey!
aah!
ow!
hey, back off!
you think we're fucking entertainment?
fucking asshole!
oh, shit.
you think we're fucking mtv?
get out of here!
back off!
yay!
yay!
come on!
what's wrong with him?
whoa!
fuck, joey!
you don't do that!
what the fuck am i supposed to do?
you don't do those things!
take it easy, man!
go home and get your head straight.
go ahead.
i'm sorry, tony.
oh!
jeez, i'm sorry.
i ruined you.
let me help you.
give me your bag.
put your hand up here.
i'm really, uh... i'm sorry about that.
i didn't see you there.
marie:
he looked promising.
can i give you a ride somewhere?
maybe i could buy you a drink--coffee, hot tea.
you could do with some warming up.
marie:
he felt promising.
but his eyes were... sad, so very sad.
my first rule-- never play with the food.
are you sure?
[engine starts] [tires screech] [honks horn]
do not touch the car.
do not touch the fucking car!
marie:
this guy was perfect.
gee, i'm sorry.
don't hurt me, o.k.?
i--i just got scared.
i could have got run over.
thank god you've got good reflexes.
you can really move for someone so... big.
look, we're getting soaked.
i'll give you a lift.
where you going?
gee, tony, this is just so great of you.
i know it's a little out of your way.
across the fucking river.
all sinatra?
hey, don't start on sinatra.
there's this park-- got a great view of the city.
you want to see a great view, tony?
sinatra: dd that old black magic has me in its spell dd dd that old black magic that you weave so well dd
dd icy fingers up and down my spine dd dd same old witchcraft dd dd when your eyes meet mine dd
dd the same old tingle that i feel inside dd dd and then that elevator starts its ride dd very nice.
dd down and down i go dd hey.
dd round and round dd hey, yourself.
i can tell you're excited.
yes.
dd i should stay away, but what can i do?
dd dd i hear your name, and i'm aflame dd not shy, are you?
dd aflame with such a burning desire dd dd that only your kiss dd dd can put out the fire dd come on, baby.
let's get in the back.
give tony a little room to get into some motion.
come on.
dd i have waited for, the mate dd aah!
what are you, some kind of a freak?
grrr!
aah!
aah!
grrr!
dd round and round i go dd dd in a spin dd dd lovin' the spin that i'm in dd dd under that old black magic dd dd called love dd
marie:
my second rule-- always finish the food.
that means eliminating the feed marks and a central nervous system disconnect.
[siren]
oh, that's o.k.
this one has everyone a little spooked.
standard shotgun hit, right?
nah. this guy's lost a lot of blood.
yeah, well, he had his head blown off.
this guy's really lost a lot of blood.
it's not here.
decent amount of splatter, but hardly what you'd expect.
blood should have settled in his ankles, turning them purple.
i'd say this guy's about five quarts low.
what in hell are you doing out here?
i was with tony last night.
i heard he got hit.
any of these cops could be in the mob's pocket.
the damn press is here!
he was a friend.
a friend?
he stood up for me.
without tony, i'd be in a lot of trouble.
you're not in trouble, gennaro.
you're gone.
it's over.
what?
i'm putting you into protection.
morales!
you're kidding me.
mm-mm. you've been under too long.
look, sinclair-- no. no.
save it, gennaro, because i'm not listening to you this time.
you are a danger to this investigation and to yourself.
i'm in total control.
oh?
coming here?
that cowboy stunt last night with the van?
this asshole was too damn close.
that's bullshit!
i was doing my job!
just get him out of here!
you cannot pull me out now.
it's absolutely the wrong fucking time.
macelli will ask me to make a hit.
i'm going to tape it and nail the fucker.
i've lived with them for three years-- eating, drinking, stealing.
you've been sitting behind a desk.
you come here and say, "that's it. it's over."
it's all i fucking got.
all right. we got your testimony, your tapes.
you'll get us macelli, huh?
come on.
miss sinclair!
hi, guys.
this was the first time my food made the front page.
hey.
thank you.
that fucking pig.
i knew he wasn't right.
sallie, our problem is-- the problem is, find joey gennaro.
put two behind his fucking ear.
don't say that in front of your attorney.
sinclair will come down on you with the rico act and freeze your assets.
you're afraid you won't get paid?
that's the least of my worries.
i'm saying make arrangements.
yeah. yeah. yeah.
what if i go right here?
make arrangements, that's what i'm saying!
make arrangements!
you putz.
who's this?
little girl got lost.
i figured i'd take her home.
i got my ass on the grill, and you can't get your mind off pussy.
jacko, ain't that the prick from the papers?
[camera clicking] yeah.
punch his fucking lights out.
[tires screech] ha ha ha!
you dress like a pimp and talk like a goon.
what makes you news?
excuse me?
she's from out of town.
must be from mars to talk like that.
nobody calls me pimp.
nobody calls me goon.
since i'm 16, what people call me is sallie the shark, and i pick my teeth with girls like you.
sal.
you're the dumbest bitch i ever met, but you got balls.
want a ride?
you got one.
i should have walked away, but he annoyed me.
thanks, carmine.
you're wonderful.
maybe i got to apologize.
my world's going to shit at the speed of light.
puts me in a mood.
call me sal.
what do i call you?
marie.
oui,marie... let's make up over a little late supper.
i'd love a little late supper, but it looks like we're not exactly alone.
tell me about it.
my guys, the feds, reporters.
probably some bastards want to put lead in my head.
lenny, lose them.
the hideaway.
losing them, sal.
ok, stay on your toes.
take me about an hour.
right, sal.
where's the bag?
right here.
oh.
hey, come on.
all right.
come on.
[music plays]
sinatra:
dd i've got you dd dd under my skin dd what do you think?
dd i've got you dd it's you.
i could do without the bars on the windows, but what are you going to do?
the city--it's a fucking zoo, right?
dd i've got you under my skin dd i was going to eat this with a colleague from squirrel hill.
boy, is he going to be pissed.
prepare yourself for a little bit of heaven.
[gasps] none for me, thanks.
hey,mangia, mangia.
you're a good-looking broad, but a little meat on the bones never goes out of style.
mussels and garlic from munafo's, for christ's sake.
come on.
i--i do not eat fish.
you're a vegetarian?
ha ha!
well, this is mussels.
they're vegetables... more or less.
ha ha ha!
uh!
i've got to... hey, the bathroom is over there.
this was a mistake.
uh!
oh... eh... baby... anything i can do?
come on, baby.
relax, hmm?
you want to lay down?
uh... garlic... garlic is hard for me.
you ain't italian, that's for sure.
heh heh!
this light... my eyes are sensitive.
sensitive.
is everything on you sensitive?
[breathing heavily] hey!
don't play mary virgin with me.
i look in your eyes.
you've been down some dark alleys.
yeah. heh heh.
come on, bitch!
take a ride, huh?
mmm.
mmm. mmm.
mmm.
oh, yeah, baby.
oh, yeah, come on.
yeah. oh, yeah.
oh, yeah. give it.
oh, yeah, give it.
grrr!
aah!
grrr!
ah!
sal!
oh, god!
[gagging]
i know i'm a freak to you guys-- half a crook, half a cop.
my wife thought that, too.
she left you, didn't she?
you'd leave me, too, if you could.
shh!
[suspenseful music plays]
aah!
[knock on door] shh!
uh!
ah!
pizza man.
[ring] yeah.
...myself.
i stand at attention!
name, dan quayle.
rank-- o.k. thanks.
[click]
look, when things cool down, you can start all over.
this shit won't cool down.
these guys will want my head forever.
who died?
macelli.
he took a hit on the north side.
shit.
you made him look so bad, his people took him out.
it's justice.
no, this is impossible.
you still got plenty of cases against his crew.
big cases.
shit!
excuse me.
i had you nailed, you son of a bitch.
where's the blood?
pardon?
the carotid artery was cut, right?
there should be blood from wall to wall.
well, what do you think?
my thinking is the less i say, the safer my pension.
you found something under his nails, right?
hair?
flesh?
traces of makeup?
perp was a female.
hmm.
what?
his temperature should be dropping.
yeah?
it's going up.
poor sallie.
he wasn't such a bad guy.
who was she, lenny?
who was she?
your mother!
come on. let's go.
come on!
you're dead.
you're already dead!
you're a fucking whore!
break it up!
jesus!
sorry you lost a client, bergman.
there's plenty more scum.
compared to you, my clients are paragons of honor!
get off me.
get off of me!
[spits]
tape it over to the west wall.
man:
watch your back!
[sirens] watch your back, please.
coming through here.
let us through.
shit!
[rustling] grrr!
aah!
[tires squealing]
uh!
[panting] grrr!
[panting]
grrr!

[door slams shut] [breathing heavily]
[barking]

[barking]
aah!
aah!
ah!

[glass breaks] you are under arrest.
stay away from me or i'll kill you!
god... just when i thought i understood some shit.
[grrr]
this him?
the big guy himself?
yup. he don't look so big now, though.
just another hefty bag enchilada, like the rest.
o.k. you can take him up.
see ya.
[door opens]
[belch] pardon you.
no, that wasn't me.
it was-- it was him.
it's just gas, fella.
come on. 1... 2...3.
some nights there's so much belching in here, it's like being in a ball park.
i'll see you later.
[click click]
uh!
what the hell hospital is this?
this isn't a hospital.
ugh!
yeeaah!
yaah!
grrr!
yaaah!
ugh!
well, stop him!
youstop him.
uh!
uh!
oh!
i want a line out.
i want my lawyer!
hey, look.
why don't you just lie down-- yaah!
come on, folks.
step aside, please.
step aside.
coming through.
all the way back.
right there.
that's good.
ladies and gentlemen... you cannot rush an autopsy.
as soon asweknow, you'llknow.
macelli?
macelli's alive!
oh.
[bell rings]
damn it!
[crash] oh!
aah!
aah!
[tires squealing] [horn honks]
[horn honks]
that's my car.
man:
petrelli with you?
[siren] will you get this car out of the way?
fuck!
move it!
what's the rush?
macelli's car smashed into a gas station in shadyside.
what was the meat wagon doing up there?
macelli was driving.
oh!
uh!
aah!
ugh!
stop!
i said... ooh!
stop the fucking car!
aah!
ah!
how the hell do i get to shadyside?
manny... [glass breaking]
[glass breaking]
turn off the fucking lights!
[muttering] ...find something that appeals, god damn it.
son of a bitch!
i'm fucking dying here.
sallie, maybe you ought to sit down.
no, no. i'm not sitting down.
i ain't lying down.
last time i laid down, a fucker tells me i'm dead!
some prick stuck a thermometer in my kidney.
it must have healed.
it's ok, sal.
it's ok.
let me get you that drink.
hey...you smell.
oh, i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
you smell good.
sallie!
we got to talk.
everybody thinks you're dead-- the cops, the press.
that's right.
it's a fucking plot.
yeah!
somebody tried to whack me-- the gambinos, the feds.
they laid me out in the morgue.
they tried to saw me in half.
you got to call a press conference!
you got to sue those cocksuckers.
[sniffing] huh... [sniffing] sallie?
[sniffing]
i was warming this for you.
sallie!
sallie, what the hell happened?
crazy bitch.
she fucking bit me.
we got to get you a doctor.
mmm!
no, i'm fine.
i just got this appetite.
mmm.
i'll call a couple of the boys.
grrr!
grrr!
[horn honks] you are in deep shit, lady, really deep shit.
you're the one that blew tony silva's head off and took macelli out.
i'd appreciate it if you would drive.
who do you work for?
self-employed.
you do this for fun?
for sport?
you do this for the blood?
you're a cop.
where's your cop radio?
this isn't my cop car.
i wish you hadn't jumped on it.
sorry.
macelli's not dead, is he?
why are you after him?
to kill him?
why didn't you make sure he was dead the first time you killed him?
[distorted voice] i fucked up, o.k.?
don't tell me it never happened to you.
what in hell are you?
i'll find out where macelli is.
jesus, joe!
macelli's here?
he's alive?
should i cuff him?
cuff her, for christ's sakes, but be careful.
she's fast, and she's strong.
she's the one who got macelli.
she's a goddamn freak.
she chomped macelli in the neck and drained his blood.
she blew tony's head off to make sure he stayed dead.
look, guys, i'm aware of how this sounds.
flinton, be careful. get out!
where'd you find her?
at the church outside macelli's.
she can climb-- joe, shut up and listen to yourself.
you got such a hard-on for macelli, you figure whoever iced him had to be some blood- sucking superbitch.
i know this whole thing is crazy.
how did macelli drive the car?
as far as i'm concerned, the medical examiner's a moron, and macelli is one dead son of a bitch.
what happened to your car?
she, uh... she jumped on it.
ha ha!
god.
put him in the car, dave.
oh, man.
you'll help me now?
yeah, yeah.
she's got him eating out of her claw.
you stay put, or the cuffs go on.
i mean it.
calling me a killer?
the whole time, he'sdriving like a maniac!
i mean, look at this car!
this is unit 5-3.
i need a home address in shadyside for a mr. emmanuel bergman.
he's an attorney.
this guy is a cop?
well, he's been suffering from job-related stress lately.
it's about 7 blocks up.
thanks.
sir, could you let me powder my nose?
oh, yeah. sure!
absolutely.
go ahead.
i am dracula.
oh... it's really good to see you.
i don't know what happened to the driver and my luggage and... well... and with all this, i... i thought i was in the wrong place.
i bid you welcome.
[wolves baying]
listen to them.
children of the night.
what music they make!
i swear on my mother, he was dead, and this ain't no improvement.
dracula: a spider spinning his web for the unwary fly.
blood is the light, mr. renfield.
[sniffing]
gennaro.
what about gennaro, sal?
he's here.
what do you mean, sal?
they probably stashed that prick in an underground bunker somewhere.
dracula:
you'll like it.
renfield:
aren't you drinking?
dracula:
i never drink... wine.
hey, sal, wait a minute.
no, sallie!
don't, sallie!
no, sallie!
no, sallie, don't!
the boys will check it out!
jesus christ!
everything all right?
stevie, uh... gennaro split.
fuck!
i don't need this.
mmm.
sal!
sal!
sal!
oh, my god!
don't, sal!
don't kill him here!
boys, boys, help!
help!
sal, listen to me.
you're losing it.
don't murder a cop on my lawn!
sal!
forgive me, sal.
you've got to get ahold of yourself.
come on.
come inside.
please.
can you believe this cocksucker?
show up here, huh?
where's the gun?
oh, he's got cuffs!
let's cuff him.
you see, sal?
now that you're inside, you're in an excellent situation.
no blood.
even if the cops came with a search warrant to talk to macelli, i'd tell them to get a ouija board because he's dead.
there's nothing in the fucking constitution clearer than freedom from unreasonable searches, and this isn't unreasonable, it's demented.
the government can't pronounce a man dead then invade his home looking for him.
you really whacked me, but there ain't no blood.
what a guy, manny.
hey, sallie!
manny, i... i need you.
sal, come on!
you always do for me.
do for me, manny.
it's o.k.
it'll be o.k.
[distorted voice] do this!
aah!
aah... woman in movie: the walls around are bare, echoing to our laughter, as though the dead were there.
man: ha ha!
nice little sentiment!
but there's more, even nicer.
quaff a cup to the dead already.
ah-choo!
oh, never mind the rest, dear!
that son of a bitch is heavy!
dracula:
to die, be really dead... that must be glorious.
woman:
why, count dracula!
there are far worse things... awaiting man... than death.
manny?
manny?
aah!
out light!
you killed him.
nah!
ha!
resting.
he's dead.
they said i was dead.
i ask you--am i dead?
[gasps] i got this tingle.
there's something you can do for me.
aah!
this shirt is disgusting.
this fat bastard.
come on!
what's he got, lead in his ass?
1...2... 3!
ugh!
please!
help me!
god!
god, please help me!
my manny!
manny, manny, manny!
lenny!
lenny, look!
please help me!
please!
help me!
help me!
help me!
oh, here's sal!
sal!
come on!
hurry the fuck up.
oh, god, somebody help me!
why don't you help me?
help me!
stop!
please stop!
oh!
please stop the car!
help me!
he killed my manny.
he ate my manny!
he wha--he--he... he killed my manny!
he ate manny!
radio: steve, what's happening?
you find joe?
for christ's sake, will you talk to me?
come on!
ugh!
i'm going to grind you down to blood... and screams.
hey, joey, we're going to take this nice and slow... so why don't you take your shoes off, get comfortable?
whoa!
hey, come on!
no, stop!
hey, come on!
sal, this is going to get all over my coat.
[crack]
i want him alive!
hey!
hey!
stop, for christ's sake!
son of a bitch.
would you please help me in the car?
he shot my fucking foot!
oh, shit!
if you had just left him to me, i would have stopped him before he fed.
now he's 100 times more dangerous.
who did macelli eat?
some guy named manny.
an innocent person dead because you screwed up!
manny bergman?
he wasn't innocent.
he's a lawyer.
maybe he's not dead.
maybe i have to finish him, too.
or what?
he becomes like macelli or becomes like you?
macelli's nothing like me.
he's a cold-blooded killer.
and what are you?
yeah.
[horn honks]
[horns honk]
hey!
jesus christ!
heh heh heh heh!
what the hell you doing?
we're on his ass!
it's over for now.
you two want a room?
yes.
no!
you know what macelli was.
i know what he's become.
if we stick together, we can find him.
i could find him right now.
just help me get out of these cuffs.
try that little key there.
macelli's got to get inside.
we should do the same.
you look beat.
you look a little drained yourself.
i'm fine.
you lost a lot of blood.
are you sure you don't need more?
don't worry.
you're not my type.
aah!
what is this shit?
what the fuck?
gee, mr. macelli.
i never seen you here so early.
is there something wrong?
mr. macelli, you want i should, uh, call somebody?
this is good.
leave me alone.
shut the door.
but you're in the freezer-- get out!
hit the fucking lights!
yeah, ok.
yeah, in my cold storage!
he's got a rump roast for a pillow!
thank you.
we have a deal?
we'll be staying till sundown--7:17 p.m.
she insists it was macelli and that joe gennaro was loaded into the back of macelli's limo.
then find them-- macelli and gennaro-- and you better hope gennaro's still alive.
oh, fellas. try not to lose your car this time.
yes, ma'am.
yes, ma'am.
dr. kivowitz says you'll be fine, manny.
you just need a transfusion.
mr. bergman, we know macelli did this.
he also tried to assault your wife.
can i count on you to press charges?
bergman?
bergman?
you're ok.
you're going to be fine.
you've been in there a long time.
you having trouble with that deep-down clean?
i thought you'd be asleep by now.
dream on.
i'm trusting you to see i don't get any sun.
can i trust you?
it's kind of a one-way street, this trust thing.
you can trust me.
right.
my eyes are sensitive.
i know you're good, joe.
a good man.
i see that.
i feel that.
yeah, well, see this, and feel this-- get the fuck away from me.
i won't hurt you.
just get over there on the bed.
chicken shit.
sleep tight.
hiya, bill.
g'day, haynes.
you better win at southampton tomorrow.
park these in a lucky spot for a few hours.
[beeping]
[alarm sounds] [alarm stops]
aah!
aah!
aah!
aah!
my god!
fuck!
aah!
[bed creaks]
we have to go.
i can't.
now's the time to get macelli.
he's sleeping.
he will sleep if he's not disturbed, but his senses are razor-sharp.
he can wake like that and move like this.
aah!
you need me, joe.
you really do.
i can't do this.
what happens when you get excited?
pretty much as usual, joe.
yeah, but maybe you bite.
right now, i need this more than blood.
[unzips zipper]
face it... you trust me.
at least, partially.
still a little worried here.
how can we stop this worry?
think i can have your name now?
marie.
marie.
where is everybody?
close the door!
lenny, what's the fucking emergency?
what happened to you?
someone shot me in the foot.
why?
what's going on, lenny?
he had me call you, said it was something important.
frank, ray, listen to the guy.
look at the guy!
tell me if it's not time to pass the torch.
you got macelli in there?
i'm just saying, look at the man.
hiya, boys!

[horns honking]
marie:
when you are alone eternally, you live for the comfort of the senses-- food, sex.
i'd become very selective, and it was getting harder for me to find food, even living in the city.
my choosiness about food cost me my lover, and without him, there is no sex.
for six nights, i have found nothing to eat.
but then came good news.
i was sad.
i was starved.
it was time to treat myself, and i thought,
"what about italian?"
don't worry about the car.
leave the keys in case we have to move it.
hey, lenny.
how you doing, huh?
all right.
what took you?
i had to dress right.
i had to shave.
he wants you in on this.
hey, ton, what's this all about, huh?
watch this.
aah!
aah!
[crunch] i love that.
place is bugged.
we do business downstairs.
come on.
see?
we come so far down, we're in china.
sal, how you doing?
i was honored by your call... a little surprised.
i didn't think-- have a seat.
so, uh, sal, what's happening here, huh?
what's this?
it's a...it's a toaster.
it's a toaster oven.
whoa, hey.
it's a nice one.
a lot of buttons.
hit this button... pops open.
you could put anything in here-- slice of pizza, pastry.
you pop it in.
comes out, the crust is crisp.
[slams oven door] microwave don't do that.
you ever tried cooking calzone in a microwave?
it comes out like a limp dick.
[laughter]
yeah.
korean.
they're getting a big chunk of the electronics action.
do you know why?
because they fucking steal.
any fucking idea that ain't nailed down.
you think some korean asshole came up with the toaster oven?
well, here they are, knocking them out.
where'd it come from?
what, sal?
the toaster?
honestly, i don't know.
you was with leguto.
when leguto fell off the face of the earth, you became mine.
then you got this idea because i just took over, maybe i'm confused, maybe i'm letting things slip through the cracks.
no, sal, i would never think-- where did it come from?
sal, tell me what the answer is.
what should i say?
it came from a warehouse.
it came off a truck from the airport!
a truck you hit tuesday!
where's my end, gilly?
i had to take inventory, make sure you got a complete cross section of the merchandise.
i thought this was just a sit-down.
yeah, but somebody ain't getting up.
i got a message for your warehouse guys.
please, god.
sallie, no.
the message is... don't fuck with me!
sal!
we got eyes on us!
maybe somebody saw this guy come in here.
what are you saying?
you telling me something?
get rid of him discreet.
you want discreet?
you fucking shoot him.
ray!
do it!
please, sal, no.
you don't understand.
it's a terrible mistake.
i want to live.
i'll do anything for you.
please!
please help me!
please, sal.
you don't understand.
gilly, that's fucking disgusting.
no, please!
don't do it to me!
you don't understand!
don't do it to me.
don't!
you don't understand!
fucking die.
next time i tell you to pull the trigger, you fucking pull the trigger!
sal, come on, relax.
joe's one of us.
yeah.
ha ha!
this shit's starting to get to me.
ha ha ha!
yeah.
he does what he's got to do.
he loves it.
he's fucking sick.
you can't talk like that.
this is war.
we're soldiers.
we kill to protect what's ours.
here. take this.
it's clean.
i'm good at stealing.
i'm not a shooter.
if you're not a shooter, you're shot.
bang!
you just can't sit around and watch anymore.
sal will tell you to whack somebody, and you got no choice.
come on.
fucking cops!
hey!
jesus, joey!
aah!
ow!
hey, back off!
you think we're fucking entertainment?
fucking asshole!
oh, shit.
you think we're fucking mtv?
get out of here!
back off!
yay!
yay!
come on!
what's wrong with him?
whoa!
fuck, joey!
you don't do that!
what the fuck am i supposed to do?
you don't do those things!
take it easy, man!
go home and get your head straight.
go ahead.
i'm sorry, tony.
oh!
jeez, i'm sorry.
i ruined you.
let me help you.
give me your bag.
put your hand up here.
i'm really, uh... i'm sorry about that.
i didn't see you there.
marie:
he looked promising.
can i give you a ride somewhere?
maybe i could buy you a drink--coffee, hot tea.
you could do with some warming up.
marie:
he felt promising.
but his eyes were... sad, so very sad.
my first rule-- never play with the food.
are you sure?
[engine starts] [tires screech] [honks horn]
do not touch the car.
do not touch the fucking car!
marie:
this guy was perfect.
gee, i'm sorry.
don't hurt me, o.k.?
i--i just got scared.
i could have got run over.
thank god you've got good reflexes.
you can really move for someone so... big.
look, we're getting soaked.
i'll give you a lift.
where you going?
gee, tony, this is just so great of you.
i know it's a little out of your way.
across the fucking river.
all sinatra?
hey, don't start on sinatra.
there's this park-- got a great view of the city.
you want to see a great view, tony?
sinatra: dd that old black magic has me in its spell dd dd that old black magic that you weave so well dd dd icy fingers up and down my spine dd
dd same old witchcraft dd dd when your eyes meet mine dd
dd the same old tingle that i feel inside dd dd and then that elevator starts its ride dd very nice.
dd down and down i go dd hey.
dd round and round dd hey, yourself.
i can tell you're excited.
yes.
dd i should stay away, but what can i do?
dd dd i hear your name, and i'm aflame dd not shy, are you?
dd aflame with such a burning desire dd dd that only your kiss dd dd can put out the fire dd come on, baby.
let's get in the back.
give tony a little room to get into some motion.
come on.
dd i have waited for, the mate dd aah!
what are you, some kind of a freak?
grrr!
aah!
aah!
grrr!
dd round and round i go dd dd in a spin dd dd lovin' the spin that i'm in dd dd under that old black magic dd dd called love dd
marie:
my second rule-- always finish the food.
that means eliminating the feed marks and a central nervous system disconnect.
[siren]
oh, that's o.k.
this one has everyone a little spooked.
standard shotgun hit, right?
nah. this guy's lost a lot of blood.
yeah, well, he had his head blown off.
this guy's really lost a lot of blood.
it's not here.
decent amount of splatter, but hardly what you'd expect.
blood should have settled in his ankles, turning them purple.
i'd say this guy's about five quarts low.
what in hell are you doing out here?
i was with tony last night.
i heard he got hit.
any of these cops could be in the mob's pocket.
the damn press is here!
he was a friend.
a friend?
he stood up for me.
without tony, i'd be in a lot of trouble.
you're not in trouble, gennaro.
you're gone.
it's over.
what?
i'm putting you into protection.
morales!
you're kidding me.
mm-mm. you've been under too long.
look, sinclair-- no. no.
save it, gennaro, because i'm not listening to you this time.
you are a danger to this investigation and to yourself.
i'm in total control.
oh?
coming here?
that cowboy stunt last night with the van?
this asshole was too damn close.
that's bullshit!
i was doing my job!
just get him out of here!
you cannot pull me out now.
it's absolutely the wrong fucking time.
macelli will ask me to make a hit.
i'm going to tape it and nail the fucker.
i've lived with them for three years-- eating, drinking, stealing.
you've been sitting behind a desk.
you come here and say, "that's it. it's over."
it's all i fucking got.
all right. we got your testimony, your tapes.
you'll get us macelli, huh?
come on.
miss sinclair!
hi, guys.
this was the first time my food made the front page.
hey.
thank you.
that fucking pig.
i knew he wasn't right.
sallie, our problem is-- the problem is, find joey gennaro.
put two behind his fucking ear.
don't say that in front of your attorney.
sinclair will come down on you with the rico act and freeze your assets.
you're afraid you won't get paid?
that's the least of my worries.
i'm saying make arrangements.
yeah. yeah. yeah.
what if i go right here?
make arrangements, that's what i'm saying!
make arrangements!
you putz.
who's this?
little girl got lost.
i figured i'd take her home.
i got my ass on the grill, and you can't get your mind off pussy.
jacko, ain't that the prick from the papers?
[camera clicking] yeah.
punch his fucking lights out.
[tires screech] ha ha ha!
you dress like a pimp and talk like a goon.
what makes you news?
excuse me?
she's from out of town.
must be from mars to talk like that.
nobody calls me pimp.
nobody calls me goon.
since i'm 16, what people call me is sallie the shark, and i pick my teeth with girls like you.
sal.
you're the dumbest bitch i ever met, but you got balls.
want a ride?
you got one.
i should have walked away, but he annoyed me.
thanks, carmine.
you're wonderful.
maybe i got to apologize.
my world's going to shit at the speed of light.
puts me in a mood.
call me sal.
what do i call you?
marie.
oui,marie... let's make up over a little late supper.
i'd love a little late supper, but it looks like we're not exactly alone.
tell me about it.
my guys, the feds, reporters.
probably some bastards want to put lead in my head.
lenny, lose them.
the hideaway.
losing them, sal.
ok, stay on your toes.
take me about an hour.
right, sal.
where's the bag?
right here.
oh.
hey, come on.
all right.
come on.

i had you nailed, you son of a bitch.
where's the blood?
pardon?
the carotid artery was cut, right?
there should be blood from wall to wall.
well, what do you think?
my thinking is the less i say, the safer my pension.
you found something under his nails, right?
hair?
flesh?
traces of makeup?
perp was a female.
hmm.

his temperature should be dropping.
yeah?

it's ok, sal.
it's ok.
let me get you that drink.
hey...you smell.
oh, i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
you smell good.
sallie!
we got to talk.
everybody thinks you're dead-- the cops, the press.
that's right.
it's a fucking plot.
yeah!
somebody tried to whack me-- the gambinos, the feds.
they laid me out in the morgue.
they tried to saw me in half.
you got to call a press conference!
you got to sue those cocksuckers.
[sniffing] huh... [sniffing] sallie?
[sniffing]
i was warming this for you.
sallie!
sallie, what the hell happened?
crazy bitch.
she fucking bit me.
we got to get you a doctor.
mmm!
no, i'm fine.
i just got this appetite.
mmm.
i'll call a couple of the boys.
grrr!
grrr!
[horn honks] you are in deep shit, lady, really deep shit.
you're the one that blew tony silva's head off and took macelli out.
i'd appreciate it if you would drive.
who do you work for?
self-employed.
you do this for fun?
for sport?
you do this for the blood?
you're a cop.
where's your cop radio?
this isn't my cop car.
i wish you hadn't jumped on it.
sorry.
macelli's not dead, is he?
why are you after him?
to kill him?
why didn't you make sure he was dead the first time you killed him?
[distorted voice] i fucked up, o.k.?
don't tell me it never happened to you.
what in hell are you?
i'll find out where macelli is.
jesus, joe!
macelli's here?
he's alive?
should i cuff him?
cuff her, for christ's sakes, but be careful.
she's fast, and she's strong.
she's the one who got macelli.
she's a goddamn freak.
she chomped macelli in the neck and drained his blood.
she blew tony's head off to make sure he stayed dead.
look, guys, i'm aware of how this sounds.
flinton, be careful. get out!
where'd you find her?
at the church outside macelli's.
she can climb-- joe, shut up and listen to yourself.
you got such a hard-on for macelli, you figure whoever iced him had to be some blood- sucking superbitch.
i know this whole thing is crazy.
how did macelli drive the car?
as far as i'm concerned, the medical examiner's a moron, and macelli is one dead son of a bitch.
what happened to your car?
she, uh... she jumped on it.
ha ha!
god.
put him in the car, dave.
oh, man.
you'll help me now?
yeah, yeah.
she's got him eating out of her claw.
you stay put, or the cuffs go on.
i mean it.
calling me a killer?
the whole time, he'sdriving like a maniac!
i mean, look at this car!
this is unit 5-3.
i need a home address in shadyside for a mr. emmanuel bergman.
he's an attorney.
this guy is a cop?
well, he's been suffering from job-related stress lately.
it's about 7 blocks up.
thanks.
sir, could you let me powder my nose?
oh, yeah. sure!
absolutely.
go ahead.
i am dracula.
oh... it's really good to see you.
i don't know what happened to the driver and my luggage and... well... and with all this, i... i thought i was in the wrong place.
i bid you welcome.
[wolves baying]
listen to them.
children of the night.
what music they make!
i swear on my mother, he was dead, and this ain't no improvement.
dracula: a spider spinning his web for the unwary fly.
blood is the light, mr. renfield.
[sniffing]
gennaro.
what about gennaro, sal?
he's here.
what do you mean, sal?
they probably stashed that prick in an underground bunker somewhere.
dracula:
you'll like it.
renfield:
aren't you drinking?
dracula:
i never drink... wine.
hey, sal, wait a minute.
no, sallie!
don't, sallie!
no, sallie!
no, sallie, don't!
the boys will check it out!
jesus christ!
everything all right?
stevie, uh... gennaro split.
fuck!
i don't need this.
mmm.
sal!
sal!
sal!
oh, my god!
don't, sal!
don't kill him here!
boys, boys, help!
help!
sal, listen to me.
you're losing it.
don't murder a cop on my lawn!
sal!
forgive me, sal.
you've got to get ahold of yourself.
come on.
come inside.
please.
can you believe this cocksucker?
show up here, huh?
where's the gun?
oh, he's got cuffs!
let's cuff him.
you see, sal?
now that you're inside, you're in an excellent situation.
no blood.
even if the cops came with a search warrant to talk to macelli, i'd tell them to get a ouija board because he's dead.
there's nothing in the fucking constitution clearer than freedom from unreasonable searches, and this isn't unreasonable, it's demented.
the government can't pronounce a man dead then invade his home looking for him.
you really whacked me, but there ain't no blood.
what a guy, manny.
hey, sallie!
manny, i... i need you.
sal, come on!
you always do for me.
do for me, manny.
it's o.k.
it'll be o.k.
[distorted voice] do this!
aah!
aah... woman in movie: the walls around are bare, echoing to our laughter, as though the dead were there.
man: ha ha!
nice little sentiment!
but there's more, even nicer.
quaff a cup to the dead already.
ah-choo!
oh, never mind the rest, dear!
that son of a bitch is heavy!
dracula:
to die, be really dead... that must be glorious.
woman:
why, count dracula!
there are far worse things... awaiting man... than death.
manny?
manny?
aah!
out light!
you killed him.
nah!
ha!
resting.
he's dead.
they said i was dead.
i ask you--am i dead?
[gasps] i got this tingle.
there's something you can do for me.
aah!
this shirt is disgusting.
this fat bastard.
come on!
what's he got, lead in his ass?
1...2... 3!
ugh!
please!
help me!
god!
god, please help me!
my manny!
manny, manny, manny!
lenny!
lenny, look!
please help me!
please!
help me!
help me!
help me!
oh, here's sal!
sal!
come on!
hurry the fuck up.
oh, god, somebody help me!
why don't you help me?
help me!
stop!
please stop!
oh!
please stop the car!
help me!
he killed my manny.
he ate my manny!
he wha--he--he... he killed my manny!
he ate manny!
radio: steve, what's happening?
you find joe?
for christ's sake, will you talk to me?
come on!
ugh!
i'm going to grind you down to blood... and screams.
hey, joey, we're going to take this nice and slow... so why don't you take your shoes off, get comfortable?
whoa!
hey, come on!
no, stop!
hey, come on!
sal, this is going to get all over my coat.
[crack]
i want him alive!
hey!
hey!
stop, for christ's sake!
son of a bitch.
would you please help me in the car?
he shot my fucking foot!
oh, shit!
if you had just left him to me, i would have stopped him before he fed.
now he's 100 times more dangerous.
who did macelli eat?
some guy named manny.
an innocent person dead because you screwed up!
manny bergman?
he wasn't innocent.
he's a lawyer.
maybe he's not dead.
maybe i have to finish him, too.
or what?
he becomes like macelli or becomes like you?
macelli's nothing like me.
he's a cold-blooded killer.
and what are you?
yeah.
[horn honks]
[horns honk]
hey!
jesus christ!
heh heh heh heh!
what the hell you doing?
we're on his ass!
it's over for now.
you two want a room?
yes.
no!
you know what macelli was.
i know what he's become.
if we stick together, we can find him.
i could find him right now.
just help me get out of these cuffs.
try that little key there.
macelli's got to get inside.
we should do the same.
you look beat.
you look a little drained yourself.
i'm fine.
you lost a lot of blood.
are you sure you don't need more?
don't worry.
you're not my type.
aah!
what is this shit?
what the fuck?
gee, mr. macelli.
i never seen you here so early.
is there something wrong?
mr. macelli, you want i should, uh, call somebody?
this is good.
leave me alone.
shut the door.
but you're in the freezer-- get out!
hit the fucking lights!
yeah, ok.
yeah, in my cold storage!
he's got a rump roast for a pillow!
thank you.
we have a deal?
we'll be staying till sundown--7:17 p.m.
she insists it was macelli and that joe gennaro was loaded into the back of macelli's limo.
then find them-- macelli and gennaro-- and you better hope gennaro's still alive.
oh, fellas. try not to lose your car this time.
yes, ma'am.
yes, ma'am.
dr. kivowitz says you'll be fine, manny.
you just need a transfusion.
mr. bergman, we know macelli did this.
he also tried to assault your wife.
can i count on you to press charges?
bergman?
bergman?
you're ok.
you're going to be fine.
you've been in there a long time.
you having trouble with that deep-down clean?
i thought you'd be asleep by now.
dream on.
i'm trusting you to see i don't get any sun.
can i trust you?
it's kind of a one-way street, this trust thing.
you can trust me.
right.
my eyes are sensitive.
i know you're good, joe.
a good man.
i see that.
i feel that.
yeah, well, see this, and feel this-- get the fuck away from me.
i won't hurt you.
just get over there on the bed.
chicken shit.
sleep tight.
hiya, bill.
g'day, haynes.
you better win at southampton tomorrow.
park these in a lucky spot for a few hours.
[beeping]
[alarm sounds] [alarm stops]
aah!
aah!
aah!
aah!
my god!
fuck!
aah!
[bed creaks]
we have to go.
i can't.
now's the time to get macelli.
he's sleeping.
he will sleep if he's not disturbed, but his senses are razor-sharp.
he can wake like that and move like this.
aah!
you need me, joe.
you really do.
i can't do this.
what happens when you get excited?
pretty much as usual, joe.
yeah, but maybe you bite.
right now, i need this more than blood.
[unzips zipper]
face it... you trust me.
at least, partially.
still a little worried here.
how can we stop this worry?
think i can have your name now?
marie.
marie.
where is everybody?
close the door!
lenny, what's the fucking emergency?
what happened to you?
someone shot me in the foot.
why?
what's going on, lenny?
he had me call you, said it was something important.
frank, ray, listen to the guy.
look at the guy!
tell me if it's not time to pass the torch.

i'm just saying, look at the man.

This might be a bad time to go off on your retreat, Master.
There is never a bad time to want to go off in the wilderness and commune with the oneness of the universe.
But what if Shredder and Krang pull another of their crazy schemes while you're away?
I feel certain that your ninja training will see you through.
I sure hope you're right.
And so, the message of this special report on world hunger is that we all must do our part to feed the hungry citizens of our planet.
This is April O'Neal signing off.
Man, I don't get it.
We can put a rocket on the moon, but we can't put food on everyone's table.
Take a number, amigo.
Scientist dudes have been working on that problemo for years.
Yeah, well maybe it's time our resident genius took a whack at it.
Yeah!
Maybe I can invent something that would help solve the world hunger problem.
I'll get to work on it right now.
Well, try to finish it before lunch, would you?
You can only keep a pizza warm for just so long.
Blast it!
Now where are those two lame brain mutants?
Whoa!
You clumsy louts.
Can't you do anything right?
Well, I thought we screamed pretty good.
Just take care of those guards.
Sneaking up on people and fighting dirty.
Now, that I like.
[yelling]
Hey, boss, what's Krang gonna do with all of these balloons?
Ooh, ooh, maybe he's gonna blow 'em up and have a party.
Those are weather balloons, you wet brains.
Aah!
You razor-brained klutzes!
You're throwing our plans off schedule.
Now, load up the rest of those tanks and bring them to the Technodrome.
Gentlemen, prepare to be astounded.
Behold my contribution to the problem of world hunger.
Ta-da!
The food revivifier!
Like, what's it do, dude?
Observe these soggy, overripe bananas.
Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
And now, a single jolt of the revivifier ray, and...
That's amazing!
They turned yellow again.
Sure, but how do they taste?
Well, the proof is in the eating.
Hey-hey, you made a believer out of me.
Well, as you see, my revivifier reverses the aging process of food.
Oh, wow.
That invention could help solve the world hunger problem.
Don't go away, dudes.
It could also solve another food problem.
I found this week-old slice of pizza behind the couch.
Could you, like, make it fresh again?
Oh, really, Michelangelo,
I've got more important things to think about.
Wrong, compadre.
There's nothing more important than thinking about pizza.
[Donatello] No, no, wait!
Stop!
Oh, you've bombarded us with the revivifying ray.
Do you realize what this means?
Uh, if it's about us turning yellow and waiting to be peeled,
I don't think I want to know.
Chill, Raphael.
You're not food, you're a turtle.
Yeah, that's the trouble.
I'm not sure what effect it might have on our reptilian bodies.
[both gulp] Uh-oh.
April, this is Burne.
Where are you?
I'm at Fifth and Main, chief.
Get over to the government weather station.
There's been a break-in.
Dozens of tanks of helium have been stolen, along with a crate filled with weather balloons.
I'm on my way.
Shredder, how could you?
Leaving Rocksteady and Bebop alone on the surface?
As they say on the surface, Krang, don't blow a gasket!
They'll return with the equipment on schedule.
You'll see.
Well, they'd better for your sake!
If those two bumbling cretins spoil my plan, you're gonna pay for it big time!
I never realized how purple picks up the lavender in your eyes.
Oh, thank you.
Do you--
Ooh!
What's going on?
[voices getting higher] Look at me.
I'm shrinking!
Me, too, and listen to my voice!
I sound just like a little turtle.
This is all your fault, Michelangelo .
I warned you not to touch that revivifier, and now we're getting younger and younger!
I said I was sorry.
What do you want, a letter of apology?
A lot of good that'll do.
We can't even read yet.
Yeah, you big bully.
I'm gonna tell Master Splinter on you.
I don't wanna be little!
Waah!
Kids.
There's just no pleasing them.
[beeps]
The TurtleCom!
That can only be one person.
Yo, April, what's doing, dudette?
There's been a break-in at the weather station.
You guys better get down there and check it out.
I'll bet it's Shredder.
What a time for him to show up.
Oh, boy!
We want to go and beat up mean old Mr. Shredder.
Oh, yeah!
I like beating up that big bully.
Don't you worry, Auntie April, we're on our way.
Come on, turtles, let's have some neato fun at the weather station!
[all shouting]
No, dudes, wait!
Come back!
Auntie April?
Oh, boy, this is gonna be fun.
Yeah, we'll find that mean old Shredder and punch him in the nose!
Yeah, neato!
Dudes, it's too dangerous!
You're too small to take on Shredder.
Move it, mister.
Whee!
Wait, micro-dudes!
Hey, hey, look, it's Auntie April!
Yoo-hoo, Auntie April!
We're gonna punch Shredder in the nose.
It's the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, only they've turned into the 5-year-old Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Oh, no!
Okay, we got all them helium tanks in the module.
Um, good.
Let's take 'em back to the Technodrome.
[Leonardo] Look, you guys, it's those big meanies!
[Raphael] Hee hee hee!
Let's get 'em!
Come on and fight, you big bird brains!
We're not afraid of you!
Heh, I don't believe it.
The turtles went and shrunk back to little kids.
It's like a dream come true.
Yeah, I just love beating up someone smaller than me.
Say nighty-night, little turtle.
I'm gonna punch out your lights.
All right, spud, try picking on someone your own size.
Well, let's take care of the big one first.
Hey!
watch it!
Hey, look, he's doing the Turtle Trot!
Hey, you big bullies, quit picking on our big brother.
Whoa!
Whoa!
That'll teach you to play dirty tricks.
That's it!
I've had it up to here with those brats.
Quick, dudes, run!
Oh, great.
Dead end.
Ha ha!
When is this game gonna be over?
[gulp] Sooner than you think.
Quick, fellas, hop aboard!
Whoa, April, are we happy to see you!
We sure are, Auntie April.
We were gettin' tired of that game.
Great news, boss.
Three of the turtles have turned into helpless little kids.
Excellent.
Return to the Technodrome immediately.
It's time to put those helium tanks to use.
[April] Oh, what a day.
I've never been so exhausted in my entire life.
[Michelangelo] Oh, for sure.
Who'd have thought three little tykes could take so much out of you?
Thank heavens for nap time.
Well, listen, April, I gotta split.
Sure, stick me with taking care of them all by myself.
I gotta go back to the lair and look through Donatello's notes.
Maybe there's an antidote to his revivifier gizmo.
And then I gotta figure out what Shred-head and his mutant morons are up to.
Irma.
I rushed over to warn you.
Burne said if you're late filing the weather station story, you'll be the late April O'Neil
Irma, I don't have time to explain, but I need you to baby-sit.
Three of the turtles have turned into 5-year-olds.
Mmm, they always did seem a little immature.
I know it's asking a lot, but--
Oh, say no more.
I'll keep an eye on the little shrinkers.
Irma, I love you for this.
Hmm.
So how come I have a feeling
I'll hate myself for this?
Okay, boss, now can you tell us why we're filling these balloons with helium?
Keep on filling them, and don't ask stupid questions.
Krang, why are they filling the balloons with helium?
I guess it's safe now to tell you.
I've sent this same treasure map to the city's most notorious criminal ringleaders.
It shows the location of a chest filled with stolen treasure buried on a secret tropical island.
What secret tropical island?
The one my foot soldiers are building at this very moment.
Come this way.
So this is your treasure island?
Yes, as phony as the proverbial $3.00 bill.
It will be kept afloat by the stolen helium-filled weather balloons, while this heavy chain hooked to the top of the Technodrome will keep it from floating away.
Once all the greedy treasure-hungry criminals are aboard the island,
I plan to cut the chain, and all my competition will just go floating away.
And I, and I alone, will be the boss of the entire underworld!
That certainly is a lot of exposition.
Well, someone had to do it.
[yawns]
Wow.
I feel better.
Yeah, I guess our little bodies needed a nappy.
Oh, hi, Auntie Irma.
What are you doing here?
I'm turtle-sitting.
Hey, I'm hungry.
What you got to eat?
Ice cream!
Get your Jolly Times ice cream!
Ooh, now that sounds yummy.
Hey, Mr. Ice Cream Man!
Stop!
We'll be right down!
No, guys, wait!
Come back!
Wait up, mister!
We wanna get some ice cream!
Get a move on, you guys.
We gotta dig up that hidden treasure.
Gangway, mister!
Sorry.
You little brats!
That man sure looks familiar.
Don't you remember?
That was Big Louie.
We beat him lots of times.
Oh, no.
The ice cream truck is driving away.
We gotta stop it!
[all] Tiny turtle power!
This is the last time I sit for any baby, even if it doesn't have a shell.
Oh, no!
[gulp] Maybe this wasn't such a neat idea after all.
[horn honks]
No!
Quick, Leonardo, what do we do now?
What are you asking me for?
I'm just a little tiny turtle.
Don't sweat it, micro-dudes.
I got you!
Turtles, are you all right?
Wow, Auntie Irma, you got your head on upside-down.
What a neat trick!
How do you do that?
It's better that you don't know.
Ah, Mother Nature is about to give birth to Bogus Island.
[Krang laughs]
I feel just like a new daddy.
Well, Shredder, what do you think of my scheme now?
So far, this crackpot idea of yours seems to be working.
What do we do with this leftover balloon?
Ooh!
Whoa!
Help!
Boss!
Help!
Idiots!
Must I do everything?
Please, get us down!
Whoa!
If these are your typical earthlings, why am I having so much trouble conquering this dumpy planet?
Get those bad guys!
Hi, guys, I'm back.
Oh!
My apartment!
What happened to it?
It was invaded by turtle tykes.
What'd you bring us, Auntie April?
Huh?
Some pizza?
What about Donatello's workshop?
Did you find an antidote for the revivifier ray?
Nada.
Donatello, think!
About your invention, do you have an antidote?
Uh, an Auntie Dote?
No, you're the only auntie I've got.
[Krang] Look, there's Pinkie McFingers arriving in his private yacht.
And now Big Louie and his henchmen.
[Shredder] And there's Mad Dog McMutt.
He's especially good at digging.
Ha.
Little do they realize, but soon I will be the only villain this city will have to contend with.
Ha ha ha ha!
What's this?
Only the story of the century!
April O'Neil, get on the horn!
[phone rings]
What's up, Chief?
Forget the stolen helium story.
Something bigger is breaking, and I want you to cover it!
Can't you get Vernon to cover it?
Things are breaking here, too.
If you don't do it, something else will be broken.
Your contract!
Uh, in that case, what's the scoop?
That's better.
Hoards of underworld characters are converging on a mysterious offshore island.
Now go check it out!
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, boy!
We wanna go with you and help you catch those crooks!
Please, can we?
Please, can we?
Huh?
Please, Auntie April?
Absolutely not.
It's much too dangerous.
I hope those little turtles aren't planning on following us.
No way.
I triple locked the pad personally.
Huh?
Surprise!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Are we there yet?
I have to go.
Chill, dudes.
We'll scope out the island any minute now.
There it is.
I see it.
Someone sees us!
You sure that ain't one of the invited guests?
No, you simp.
It's that nosy reporter April O'Neil.
Get her!
Oh, no!
The rotors have been hit!
Bummer!
[shouting]
You got a barf bag on this thing?
[shouting]
All right.
We got it.
Ha.
Let's go take April O'Neil prisoner.
Is everyone all right?
Yeah.
That was neato!
Can we go on that ride again?
When do we fight the bad guys?
I told you before, Leonardo, there'll be no fighting.
Ah, phooey.
We were looking forward to some real bone crushing head banging.
[gasps] Rocksteady and Bebop!
We'll handle this, April.
Turtles to the rescue!
Get 'em!
So we have uninvited guests.
Shredder!
So you're the one who's been luring all these criminals to this island.
Here's the rest of them, boss.
You were right.
They have shrunk to child size.
Oh, how cute.
Kitchy-kitchy-coo.
Still big enough to handle you, Mr. Shred-head.
Yeah, take that!
And that!
Here!
Get them!
They mustn't escape!
Right, boss.
Hand over that map, Mad Dog.
The treasure is mine.
That's what you think, Big Louie.
It belongs to me!
[laughs]
That's the end of the turtles.
Yeah, three of them, anyway.
Good news, boss.
The turtles are gone.
What?
Oh, no.
Those mutants are big dummies, aren't they?
Yeah.
They don't realize we love to play in water.
Guys, I hate to tell ya, but there's something weird going on here.
We're growing big, and our voices are changing.
We found the antidote to the revivifier ray.
It's plain old salt water.
Our natural environment.
Success, Krang.
The last of the turtles is my prisoner.
And do you have plans for him?
He and the unfortunate Miss O'Neil will float off into the stratosphere along with all the underworld buffoons.
Thanks to myself, the turtles are finito, kaput, wiped out!
Not in this lifetime, tin grin.
We're anything but wiped out.
Wouldn't you agree, compadre?
Most monumentally, amigo.
Cowabunga!
Don't just stand there, you horn heads!
Get them!
It'll be our pleasure, boss.
Stand back, guys.
This one's on me.
Or should I say on Rocksteady and Bebop!
Foot soldiers, attack the turtles!
My turn!
Quickly, back to the Technodrome.
Oh, great!
Another failure!
Once again, I'll have to handle things myself.
[April] The island, it's floating away!
So that's why Shredder stole those helium balloons.
Turtles, what are we waiting for?
[all] Turtle power!
The good news is we stopped the island from floating away.
And the bad news?
Uh, it's starting to sink.
I don't mean to panic anyone, but we gotta get off of this thing.
Hold on.
We can't leave without April.
But where is she?
Yoo-hoo, fellas!
I'm over here!
You repaired the rotor blade?
Hey, Donatello's not the only one who can fix things.
Channel 6 news copter calling the Coastguard.
Proceed to latitude 72, longitude 13, and rescue sinking island survivors.
Oh, and be sure to bring plenty of handcuffs.
Thanks for helping me dismantle this revivifier.
Man, if I never see it again, it'll be too soon.
Greetings, my students.
Welcome back from your retreat, Master Splinter.
How refreshing to see you all working so diligently.
what has brought about this new attitude?
Well, let's just say we've done a lot of growing up while you were away.
Closed-Captioned By J.R. Media Services, Inc.
Burbank, CA
This beautiful valley, these snow-born peaks..
..are the borders of the nation that the world calls India.
After this border begins the border of those nations..
..whose greed penetrates into ours and crosses its limits.
They wish to colour the ground of India red..
..with the blood of Indians themselves..
..and shatter India into a million pieces.
Such a nation is Dongri-La, which was once..
..made prosperous by India itself, nurtured and nourished.
Today it has a dictator, General Dong..
..who has become an enemy of India.
Just a few days back, in order to renew that enmity..
..he had sent a troop of 2000 trained militants.
But before they could put their devious feet on our soil..
..our Indian soldiers annihilated them.
But the commander of those militants managed to save..
..himself somehow and at this moment..
..he is going back to his country Dongri-La.
Long live Dong!
Welcome to Dongri-La, Mr. Commander.
- Thank you.
And congratulations, you escaped the clutches of death.
General Dong is awaiting you.
Make haste.
You are already 30 seconds late.
Long live Dong!
How are you Jhalu?
Fine, thank you.
Hurry up sir.
You are already 40 seconds late.
40 seconds?
Mr. D'Costa, you are extremely lucky.
You have saved your life for the second time.
Second time?
Because you are just 59 seconds late.
If you were late by 1 minute more..
..we had order to shoot you.
Better relax now.
General Dong is waiting for you..
..in Rangshala.
God may be wrong, but Dong can never be wrong.
Come on, come, come--.
See what all we have made for you.
You must have got the habit of eating Indian food..
..as you have drunk the water there.
See, we have made Indian food for you.
Look at these puri, rasgulla, gulab jamun, jalebi, laddoo..
lmarti?
Where is the imarti?
Here it comes.
Seen the imarti?
- Yes sir.
How delicious the imarti is that's prepared for you!
Sit.
- Me, sir?
Yes, yes, sit.
What all happened there?
General, as soon as we entered Kashmir..
..the Indian army ambushed us and at the orders of..
..General Sinha all the soldiers were shot.
On General Sinha's orders, all soldiers were shot!
- Yes, sir.
We prepare each of these soldiers with so much effort..
..and on General Sinha's orders all were shot.
But General, the top secret file that I had taken with me..
..which contains the names of all our agents in India..
..l did not let that file fall into their hands.
Secret file!
For this job, you should get a reward.
A promotion!
A promotion!
You are dismissed from the post..
..of Dongri-La's Secret Force Chief.
Sit down, sit down.
You will be the made the Home Minister here.
Hey, Home Minister.
Salute!
Thank you, general.
Thank you very much.
I forgot.
The food, the food is waiting for you.
Wait, a big mistake was to be committed!
A great sin!
This food is not for you.
This is for the Brahmins.
Today is your mourning feast.
Mourning feast.
People celebrate the mourning feast after death.
We are celebrating yours one day before death.
General, I..
Mr. D'Costa, tomorrow is Dongri-La's annual day.
There in front of all, you'll commit suicide.
Long live Dong!
Dong is never wrong.
No, you cannot leave us and go.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the greatest..
..reward of Dongri-La is the Gun of Honour.
And this year, the recipient of this honour..
..is our new Home Minister, Mr. Wilson D'Costa.
Jenny, Jenny, promise me that you'll make my son a soldier.
Not Dong's soldier, but a soldier of Dongri-La.
Promise me.
This photo.
Okay soldier, bye.
This Gun of Honour is the privilege of that soldier..
..who brings glory to Dongri-La, or of he who..
..gives up his life for the honour of Dongri-La.
I give my life not to the king, but for the honour of Dongri-La.
Your husband had definitely forgotten the duty of a soldier..
..while dying because he had anger in his eyes for me.
But I am General Dong.
I shall not forget my duty.
I will respect the widow of my soldier.
I will avenge the death of your husband.
Let this message be sent to General Sinha of India.
So General Dong has sent me the message that..
..our Army Annual Day will be the last day of my life!
Read that again, Mr. Iyengar.
General Sinha, if you wanted, you could have arrested..
..those 2000 soldiers of mine.
But no!
In order to become a national hero, you gunned them down.
I, being the leader of Dongri-La, am coming there myself..
..to pay tribute to those 2000 soldiers of mine.
I will be there to terminate you in front of your own soldiers..
..on the Annual Day at precisely 8:30.
Nonsense, absolutely nonsense.
General, I suggest that..
That I get scared of Dong's threat, not go to the parade..
..and break an age-old tradition of this country.
Not just your life, sir, but the pride of the whole nation..
..is at stake.
What if something happens to you, sir?
Then what?
Then what?
There will be one more assassination.
But this time, this country and the 80 crore people in it..
..may be aroused of their slumber.
Perhaps, this time we shall answer their havoc with ours.
I'll go to the parade.
Sir.
Already it is 8:25.
I think it is a blank threat.
Nothing can be said.
The man is from Dongri-La.
Be alert.
Yes, yes, yes, hold.
I am sending him.
Go to south belt, south belt.
- Yes.
Hold it there, hold it!
How did you dare to come here?
Dong is never wrong.
You are wrong.
I am not the real, but the fake Dong.
That is the real Dong.
I too am not the real Dong.
Then where is the real one?
See there.
Aren't you trapped in Dong's web?
You are all fools.
Running hither-thither.
The real Dong is there on the parade ground.
Sir, welcome home.
Even after living for 11 years in America..
..there is no change in you.
Looking same as ever.
I am not a thing that can change.
I am a man, not a shirt.
Krishna my boy, come in, come in.
Meet our defence secretary Mr. Iyengar.
Mr. Iyengar, this is Major Krishna Rao.
The one and only.
Yes, yes.
Who doesn't know him?
The recipient of the Param Veer Charkra..
"Major Krishna Rao.
My boy, is everything all right?
What was the urgency..
..that you wanted to meet me?
Sir, I have heard that to finish Dong and his soldiers..
..you are dispatching a mission to Dongri-La.
That is right.
Well, because of diplomatic angles, we cannot..
..attack Dongri-La.
And in its populace, there are Indians..
..also in large numbers.
To kill one Dong..
..we cannot kill thousands of our Indian brothers.
But even then, we have to avenge the death of General Sinha.
Sir, then give me the responsibility of this mission.
Talk practically, Krishna Rao.
You cannot be given..
..this responsibility under any circumstances..
..and you know it.
Your transfer has been done..
..to the peace centre.
Go and take charge.
Please try to understand me, sir.
You know that killing Dong is the aim of my life.
In the past eleven months in America, if I have thought..
"anything, then it is about how to reach Dongri-La.
Today I have only one month left.
I know, I know, my boy.
But I have some restrictions also.
I can't..
I can't give you this permission.
Please, sir.
You have given me all these medals..
..for my heroisms.
Today in the name of these medals..
..l seek permission from you, sir.
You will hear of Dong's death from Dongri-La..
..whether Major Krishna Rao returns alive or not.
You are wasting my time, Major Krishna Rao.
We've to go to a conference.
Please excuse me.
So excuse me, sir.
Do not think that Krishna Rao..
..is so weak that he cannot go to Dongri-La on his own.
Krishna Rae can give his resignation here..
..and before you send your mission he can reach there..
..and he can kill Dong also.
If that happens..
..then with Dong, once again will perish the pride..
..of Indian soldiers.
Therefore, give the permission, sir.
Dong has killed a soldier of the Indian army.
Therefore, his death shouldn't be at the hands of..
..any Krishna Rao, but at the hands of an Indian soldier.
But..
I haven't asked anything for my selfish means..
--I've only asked for the pride of my nation, not for a throne-.
This is my plan, sir.
So, you have a team also?
Yes sir, one of them is from the Tibetan border force..
..Himalayan range expert Black cat commander..
..Anju Sinha, and the other three are from the..
..army intelligence.
Who are they?
Hey friends, these girls!
Before Major Krishna Rao's orders come..
..let us bathe in the Ganges.
What Ganges?
I am prepared to bathe in the Jamuna also.
But brother, this time is only for the girls.
Brother, I have the remedy for this.
These beautiful girls!
Hello!
Hello, how are you?
Are you from Switzerland?
No, I am from Mudh Island.
Oh, Mudh Island.
Boys don't come here, do they?
- Boys?
Yes, I am very scared of boys.
Scared?
Yes, you know, uncle, boys are very aggressive.
They are loafers!
Sweethearts, there is no need to be scared of boys.
Boys are good.
You meet them everyday.
How sweet!
How interesting!
May we go now?
Hi girls!
Hi everybody!
Come on, have fun with us.
We have come for that only.
But I do not know how to swim.
If I drown, I'll die unmarried.
No, we'll not allow you to drown.
Come on, now.
What an item this is!
What quantity!
What has happened to your eyes suddenly!
The heat!
The heat!
The heat of youth!
Really, I'll get a hero?
But where will I get him?
This is a forecast from the lovers' radio-.
This is a forecast from the lovers' radio-.
Today the weather will be colourful.
It will be a monsoon of love.
The girl who will go alone..
--In the lovers' park will get her hero there
- You'll go?
Yes.
But what will I tell?
You won't have to tell.
He'll tell.
But what?
Under my umbrella..
Come under my umbrella..
Why do you get wet, Kama?
Under my umbrella..
Come under my umbrella..
Why do you get wet, Bimla?
Under my umbrella..
Come under my umbrella..
Why do you get wet, Salma?
Come, settle in my heart.
What are you thinking there?
Come under my umbrella..
Why getting wet, Kama?
Why getting wet, Bimla?
Why getting wet, Salma?
Hey girl, why are you going there?
Come here.
Are you coming, or should I go there?
You are a Marathi girl like a serpent wet in the tide.
You are a Marathi girl like a serpent wet in the tide.
I am your snake-charmer, I shall hold your dress.
I am your snake-charmer, I shall hold your dress.
I'll play the music of the heart..
You dance again and again.
Under my umbrella..
Come under my umbrella..
Why getting wet, Kama?
Why getting wet, Bimla?
Why getting wet, Salma?
It is morning; give me something in the name of Allah.
Give me two ripe mangoes;
take five ripe ones.
This is give and take.
You also give me something.
Give, take.. give, take..
God will look after you;
he'll fill your womb.
God will look after you;
he'll fill your womb.
If you give us little;
God will give you much more.
If you give us little;
God will give you much more.
These blind..
Give charity to these blind, you have lot of wealth.
Come under my umbrella..
Why are you getting wet, Karma?
Come inside my hut..
Why are you running like this?
Come inside my hut..
Why are you running like this?
Brother, till when will you keep doodling like this on paper?
Saying 'Your chapeau, your spectacles'?
Allah has not made such a girl for you till today.
If God has given me the imagination..
..then see, one day I shall get my flower amidst flowers.
Allah forbid!
Your face is ungainly; at least speak nice things.
It may not be good to hear, but it is true.
I do not see your mission getting accomplished.
What are you telling?
Pardon my impudence, sir.
But aren't you going with..
..Major Krishna Rao to Dongri-La on a secret mission?
But you won't be able to go, sir?
Why?
Those going to Dongri-La will now go to Death.
You have shot a lot of bullets;
now loosen your tongue also.
Who has sent you?
Me!
She is threatening us.
Whether you are capable of going to Dongri-La or not..
Hence, on the orders of General Kapoor..
..we came to test you.
That old man does not even understand that..
..negative to positive, positive to negative..
..east to west, west to east, female to male..
..should not be sent.
That brings a danger of short circuit.
What does that mean?
I'll explain the meaning.
It means that he is my elder brother, and he is my younger..
..but I am of your age.
And it's his season nowadays.
Season?
What do you mean?
When it is my season, heat is generated within me.
..and when heat is generated, I begin to sniff nice fragrances..
..and when I sniff nice fragrances, my pulse rises..
..and when my pulse rises, my eye begins to flap..
..and when my eyes begin to flap, I feel like kissing someone.
Shut up!
If you come ahead even one more step..
..then your libido will be the cause of your death.
I am Black Cat Commando from the Tibetan Force..
..Captain Anju Sinha.
And I am Allah Rakha.
Okay now, move, will you?
Mr. Kapoor and Mr. Rao..
..are waiting for you.
Where are you going?
What about my kiss?
You take it later with fun.
Allah forbid!
Hello, Dongri-La, Prince Kao..
I see..
I see.
Good, very good.
Great!
Great!
Finito.. finish!
Captain Chauhan, courage.
Captain Rakesh, determination
Captain Javed, intelligence.
Captain Anju Sinha, strategy.
Very good.
Major Krishna Rao, you have the perfect team.
And thanks to Defence Secretary Mr. Iyengar..
..you have the permission of the ministry also.
But this permission means only that if it is successful..
..then it is the victory of the Indian government..
..of the Indian people and the Indian army..
..and if this mission is unsuccessful..
..then it will be your, your, your, your and your defeat..
..the government will not be involved in this.
To prove Dong wrong, on the Annual Day..
..Force Five is coming from India?
Seal all borders of Dongri-La and keep strict vigil".
..on all the airports.
Please sit down, sit down, sit down.
Under any circumstances, I need to send..
..50000 infiltrators and 5000 human bombs to India..
..after the snow melts.
Begin their training for that quickly.
Yes sir-.
Excuse me, general.
What is a human bomb?
I'll demonstrate it to you, Colonel Jack.
Dong is your god.
His voice is the voice of your soul.
His order is your religion.
General Dong is your god.
Girls brought from the world over are hypnotised here.
Whenever any of Dong's orders fall on their ears..
..then they obey it like a machine.
Look.
Number 12, number 12, come forth.
Now go on that platform.
Good!
Tie that belt with the bomb to your waist.
Now press the button in front of the belt.
General Dong is your god.
These are my human bombs.
This is that part of the Himalayan range..
..where the border of our nation comes to an end.
This is China and this is Pakistan.
And this is the danger valley.
No man's land.
You mean, Mount Xinjhang?
- Right.
And above this, here is situated Dongri-La.
That means, we shall all have to descend on..
..Mount Xinjhang with the aid of parachutes?
No, that's out of the question.
There are cannons and radars on Mount Xinjhang..
..which we cannot escape.
There is only one way out..
..and that is mountain trekking.
We shall go trekking from here.
But, this is impossible.
Most of the valley's cliffs are..
..snow-covered in these days.
In most of the areas..
..of the valley, there is not even sunlight.
Okay, okay, don't get panicky.
We have provision for this.
There will be a man there to give us light..
..who can see in darkness and in find his path in snow.
Who's that?
The lion of the Himalayas, Dharam Singh.
Major Dharam Singh?
That infamous Dharam Singh..
..who was court-martialled and expelled from the army?
Yes.
That is impossible, sir.
Major Dharam Singh..
--Will not work for us- He hates the Indian army-.
This is not possible, sir.
He was insulted and removed..
..from the army.
Then buy him with money.
Now he's a professional private detective.
This will also be difficult.
Sir, his way of working is different.
He works for six months and loafs for six months.
When he loafs, there is no wealth in the world..
..that can make him do any work.
This is his time for loafing.
I want him by all means.
If not by money or love..
..then overpower him and bring him here.
I want him anyhow.
Okay, sir.
Impossible!
I tell you it is impossible.
Using strength, nobody can take Dharam Singh with him.
What did you say?
I meant, brother, that you can take him if you want.
Did you understand?
Then sir, you tell us, where is this elder brother of ours now?
Give me some booze..
Call some girl..
Drop the curtains..
Turn off the lights..
Put the anklets on my feet and watch my drama.
Put the anklets on my feet and watch my drama.
Put the anklets on my feet and watch my drama.
Put the anklets on my feet and watch my drama.
I will dance and sing; there will be chaos here.
I am the sizzling Dharam, I have no shame!

Put the anklets on my feet and watch my drama.
I will dance and sing; there will be chaos here.
I am the sizzling Dharam, I have no shame!
I am the sizzling Dharam, I have no shame!
Number fifty four..
House with the bamboo door..
Bamboo roof and a bamboo top..
Bamboo roof and a bamboo top..
The ceiling's got a bamboo floor.
Number fifty four..
One two three-- four 0' clock-- rock rock rock--.
..around the clock.
One two three-- four 0' clock-- rock rock rock--.
..around the clock.
I will dance and you will dance.
The whole world will dance.
I am the sizzling Dharam, I have no shame!
I am the sizzling Dharam, I have no shame!
I rule even today.
I speak to the angels.
See.
I proclaim war, I will show the world.
Even we know it, nobody has won against you.
See.
I proclaim war, I will show the world.
Even we know it, nobody has won against you.
Whether it is twenty, thirty, forty or fifty,
I am not lesser to anyone.
I am the sizzling Dharam, I have no shame!

Put the anklets on my feet and watch my drama.
I will dance and sing; there will be chaos here.
I am the sizzling Dharam, I have no shame!
I am the sizzling Dharam, I have no shame!
Why are you people wasting your time?
I will tell you finally.
I have no interest..
..in your mission and your money.
Just leave and please leave me alone.
Just a minute.
We agree that we cannot incite..
..you with money during your rest period.
Will you come with us according to your own free will..
..or should we take you there under the army rules?
Well, the army rules can take me there..
But it cannot put anything in my mind and soul.
I will have you trapped in the Danger valley..
..in such a way, you will have proper amnesia.
You will forget everything about yourself.
We know it.
And therefore, we are being patient with you.
The army needs you today.
What nonsense?
The army needs me today?
This Dharam Singh.
This undisciplined major Dharam Singh.
I was insulted and chucked out of the army.
Brother.. please forget all that now..
Forget it?
Should I forget that bitterness?
It is easy for you to say so.
How can I forget it?
This good for nothing drunkard..
How can I forget that Indian army had capable officers.
He had some dreams about the army too.
He had dreams.
He wanted a house and family.
Those dreams, now shattered, are piercing my soul..
..they are ripping apart my very veins.
Before the spark of anger that is in my chest..
..explodes like a volcano, you go from here.
Get out from here.
Today's news, today's news..
The soldier who killed..
..thousands of the enemy, Major Dharam Singh..
..is court-martialled.
Major Dharam Singh is court-martialled.
Major Dharam Singh is court-martialled.
Major Dharam Singh is court-martialled.
Major Dharam Singh is court-martialled.
The lion of the Himalayan ranges, the winner of the..
..Mahavir Chakra Award, IC number 7986F..
..Major Dharam Singh, the allegation upon you is that..
..on 4 January 1982 you refused to obey the orders..
..of your senior officer Briagdier Kapoor..
..and without any permission, you attacked the enemy..
..infiltrators at Karimulla sector in Kashipur..
..even when the responsibility of this was not in the hands..
..of the army but of the police of that area.
Major Dharam Singh, do you have to say anything about this?
Being a soldier, I am also a citizen, sir.
If I had waited for the police of Brigadier Kapoor..
..to thwart the attack of those infiltrators..
..then I don't know how many innocent people would have died.
And the responsibility of those deaths would not..
..have been mine, nor yours, nor Brigadier Kapoor's.
Major Dharam Singh, being a civilian what you did..
..is praiseworthy.
But the foundation of the army is..
..on discipline.
You've broken the discipline of the army.
This court holds you guilty and expels you from the..
--Indian army for ever- That's all-.
Sir, one is not punished so severely for taking a life..
..as you have punished me for saving thousands of lives.
This decision of yours has shattered all the dreams..
..all the hopes of a soldier.
How easily you said..
..Mr. Judge that it cannot be, that's all!
It cannot be, that's all!
Why did they do this with you?
Take it easy, Seema, take it easy.
At this juncture of life, I need you.
I need your support.
Love?
Support?
I want to give you so much love..
..as much as no one in this world must have give to anyone.
But now this cannot happen.
It is not possible.
Seema?
Yes, Dharam Singh.
My brother and father are in the army.
All their dreams are related to the army.
Will they permit me to marry any court-martialled person?
Today a daughter is sacrificing her love..
..for the sake of her brother and her father.
Forgive me, if possible.
Please forgive me.
Neither did I get god, nor my lover.
Dharam Singh, you can shed your blood..
..in the memory of your past bitterness..
..but you cannot wash away the stains of court-martial..
..with this blood of yours.
Major, this is a very good opportunity when..
..you can wash away those satins.
Just think.
When people will come to know that despite so much..
..being done against you, you have helped the army, then..
Okay, Dharam Singh, tell us one thing.
Were you just a soldier of the Indian army, not a citizen?
I just want to know, is Dharam Singh only a soldier..
..of the Indian army?
ls he not a citizen along with it?
Has Dong shamed only the Indian army by killing--.
..General Sinha, not the entire nation?
By entering our country, these infiltrators will cause havoc..
..will only the police be responsible for that..
..not the army?
Dharam Singh, this struggle is not only of the army..
..but of every Indian.
The responsibility of finishing these infiltrators..
..is not only of the army and the police..
..but of every citizen of India.
Big brother, not as soldiers of the Indian army..
..but as citizens of India, we beg you for your help.
Sir, not as a Major, but as an Indian citizen, I beg of you.
No!
No!
It's enough.
What a destiny!
Today I have seen that Dharam Singh in you..
..who was once an officer in the army.
Okay, I'll take you there.
But I have one condition.
No commander, no officer will order me.
I will do everything myself.
- Agreed.
Come.
Welcome, Major Dharam Singh, I am..
Major Krishna Rao, commander of Force Five..
..and you are Anju..
- Sinha!
Correct!
So how is life in Bangkok?
After discipline in the army..
..how do you like the life of a private detective?
Life is to be lived, Major.
Make it as colourful as you want.
Well said, Major.
Where are you going?
She is angry.
The matter is hot, go on.
She is your sister-in-law.
Again I must say, Dharam Singh, I am really..
..obliged to you.
By your joining this mission..
..l feel that we are half successful.
Major, I have not joined your mission.
I have promised to leave you till the border of Dongri-La.
That much is enough for us.
Now what next?
This is the Danger Valley and this is
..which opens up in the mouth of death.
We will first cross the Danger Valley.
After trekking for about 30 km, we shall reach a region..
..where even the sunlight doesn't reach.
The crazy heart yearned for the beloved.
The crazy heart yearned for the beloved.
I colored..
I colored my veil saffron, for my beloved.
The crazy heart yearned for the beloved.
The crazy heart yearned for the beloved.
I colored..
I colored my veil saffron, for my love.
The crazy heart yearned for the beloved.
The crazy heart yearned for the beloved.
This love is a sickness, I lost all my shame and shyness.
This love is a sickness, I lost all my shame and shyness.
The whole world says that I am crazy.
The whole world says that I am crazy.
My body and soul..
My body and soul yearns for my beloved.
The crazy heart yearned for the beloved.
Whatever happened..
will not return.
Nobody else will come in this heart other than you.
Whatever happened..
will not return.
If you don't support me, I know how to walk.
I know fire, I know how to burn.
This life is a doll, what if it burns?
This life is a doll, what if it burns?
There will be no special time to die too.
Whatever happened..
will not return.
Nobody else will come in this heart other than you.
Whatever happened..
will not return.
That is Dongri La's boundary.
Mount Jinjiyar.
The enemy and their radars cannot..
..thrust in the water and reach us.
Therefore, we will have to go up through this waterfall.
Okay.
Hold my hand..
Long live Dong!
Long live Dong!
You bloody Indians.
Do you think we are foolish like you?
You thought that you will come to Dongrila from this path?
And we will not find it out too?
Stupid!
We have prepared this water trap for fools like you.
Now, get ready to die.
Stop looking at me, damn it, I am all right.
Move.. move.. move..
Come on.
This is..
Oh my.. oh my!
It bit me.. honey bee..
it bit me.. oh..
Sir.. give us your hand..
Come on..
come on.. major.. give us your hand..
Careful
- Are you all right?
Yes, I am all right.
Captain, get the medical first aid kit.
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.
Careful.
- Okay.
Sir, he is bleeding, sir.
- Give him an injection.
Don't panic.. don't worry.
Nothing will happen to me.
The one who has taken wounds on his heart..
..what will happen to them with this wound?
The one who has drunk tears of blood..
..will he die of this blood?
- Tears of blood?
Yes, major.
I had a daughter.
Eleven months, fourteen days ago..
..l had taken her for a picnic in the middle of the sea..
..at the country's boundary.
Papa, look at that.. it seems that there is some island there.
Help me..
Shetty.
- Sir?
See that island?
- Sir.
Take us there.
Oh my god.
She's dead.
Shetty.
- Yes, sir?
Take Dolly to the launch.
I will see in the jungle.
Sir, you have done a good deed by..
It will be so easy to bring girls here from all..
"places, like India, Pakistan Bangladesh and Burma.
And sir, it can be turned into a human bomb training center.
Sir, you will have to come here regularly.
They are beautiful, very beautiful.
Export them to Dongrila and start training them.
How sweet.
Send her to our harem.
These girls seem to be very weak.
Their faces are so pale.
We cannot have our commission on selling them too.
Their eyes, kidneys and hearts.
Sell them in the markets.
But sir, what about their bones?
There are so many already.
Donate them to the medical schools.
Hey, you illegitimate son of Karna.
What a donation.
Indian army major.
Krishnarao.
Krishna.. has come to save the maidens from Kansa.
Dong, you think that you are Kansa?
People will laugh if they hear it.
Kansa was evil and bad.
He wasn't a pimp.
He didn't take the commission of selling women.
He wasn't a butcher who sold female flesh.
There are so many tyrants in this world.
But no body has been praised so much.
Did you see my patriotism?
I tolerate so much for Dongrila.
Dongrila.. for the people of Dongrila.. to feed them.
God has given everyone two hands to feed themselves, Dong.
You don't need those hands too.
Because the almighty has given you such a face..
..you will get work as a joker in any circus.
Foolish major"
..you have already done a mistake by coming here alone.
You committed the second mistake..
..by saying that Dong is a joker.
If you think that you are a hero..
Then o you Indian Hero, show me your magic.
Save these women from this joker, here.
This Indian needs just his hands to fight against jokers.
Shoot.. shoot..
Dong's dogs.. shoot..
But remember.. if even one bullet hits me..
..your leader's neck will be slashed too.
If My neck is tortured, you will be dead too.
I have risked my death, Dong.
If you have the guts, risk your death too.
Tell your dogs to shoot.
Shoot!
Children.. run!
Run!
Come on, joker.
I will take you to an Indian circus.
Shetty.. why are you staring at me?
Go with the children.
Sir, you?
Don't worry about me.
I will cover you in another boat.
It is necessary for the children to leave.
But papa--
- Dolly, go" 90--
Very good.. children.. go.. go..
Come on..
Dong.. come on..
Krishnrao, you will pay for this!
I have not ruined the engine, I ruined your life too.
Gorilla couldn't risk general Dong's life..
..by stopping all the girls.
But stopping..
..one girl, he has put your life to risk.
Dong is never wrong.
Papa!
Dong.. if anything happens to my daughter..
Nothing will happen to your daughter.
Stop those girls.. stop them.
Stop them..
- No..
- Stop them..
- No.
Or else.. your daughter.
- Papa..
You are dealing with an Indian soldier.
Not only a father.
To save so many daughters..
I can sacrifice one daughter.
Wow, Indian solider.. wow..
You have really proved Dong to be a joker today.
I will not kill your daughter now.
I will take her to Dongrila with me.
I will train her.
I will make her such..
..that she will dance in the open market..
..after one year, on the occasion of Dongrila's annual day.
No..
Dong is never wrong.
You are very proud of being an India solider, isn't it?
Save your daughter if you can.
Not a day, a month I give you time for a year.
In between this time, if you cannot take your daughter..
I will make you a pimp for your daughter.
You rascal!
Major, can I join your mission?
Hello.
Force five receiving, come in, please.. over.
Hello, headquarters, report.. over.
Sir, we have reached Dongrila's base.
But sir, it seems that our mission has been leaked to Dong.
Any encounter?
Over.
Yes, sir.
There was a lot of gunfire.
But all of us are safe, over.
You can enter into Dongrila only from Bongla pass.
Only from Bongla pass.
Over.
Message received.
God bless you, be alert.
Over.
Three code four one one.
Miss Cynthia.
Yes, Mr. Kapoor.
They escaped from there, even after..
..l gave such accurate information..
How?
If this is Dongrila's security, I think..
..that force five will be successful..
And me..
You will be exposed in your country.
Mr. Kapoor, isn't it?
- Yes.
Don't worry, Mr. Kapoor.
I have taken the charge now.
By the way, they will come through Bongla pass.
Keep that in mind.
Thank you, Mr. Kapoor.
There is some good news.
The information price, has been changed..
..from five lakh dollars to ten lakh dollars.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Give me regards to General Dong.
God forbid.
What I have found out today, what if someone else finds out?
Tell me the prize.
You must have sold your conscience in crores, sir.
Tell me the cost.
Just a rupee.
A rupee?
A rupee for every Indian.
Therefore..
It is one eighty crores for eighty crore Indians.
You must have taken this amount from general Dong.
Or did you sell your compatriots for cheaper than this?
People like us are defamed.
And faces, people like you.
Allahrakha..
- Hey, whom are you scaring with your shouts?
The person in your presence, is not your servant Allahrakha.
He is someone who has a conscience, a Muslim.
A patriotic Allahrakha!
My soldier.. you are a very small soldier.
You work for me.
Nobody will believe you.
It is better for you, if you make a deal with me.
Tell me how much do you want?
If a person sells his conscience and earns..
"money, he isn't human.
If a Muslim..
..is a betrayer to the country he lives, he isn't a Muslim!
I swear to the martyrs of Karbala.
Allahrakha will not tell anyone that you are a betrayer.
Or else, people will lose their belief in the army.
This Allahrakha, this small man..
..this small man, your worker, will kill you, today.
Allah!
Allah!
Nothing personal, my friend.
This is purely business.
Just business.
Control room, this is general Kapoor speaking.
My servant, Allahrakha, was a traitor.
He attacked me, his dead body is in my office.
Come and take it away.
Nothing personal.
Business.
Long live Dong!
Long live Dong!
The almighty can be wrong.
But Dong is never wrong.
General Dong is your Almighty.
His voice, is the voice of your soul.
Look at her, she moves twelve hours in twenty four hours.
And she.. she moves sixteen hours.
And general..
These girls have been punished to move eighteen hours everyday.
But these wretched Indian girls..
..they don't get ready at all.
Papa.
Papa"
MY Papa.
Your papa--
MY Papa.
Papa, when will you come to take me?
Your papa has come.. yes..
That lame has climbed all mountains.
He has come to take you.
I gave him time for a year.
But he has come in eleven months and sixteen days.
He has come..
Then you start counting your days.
Or run away.
Because if my papa has come..
..then these two weeks will be very difficult for you.
Very difficult.
Make her move the whole day!
Major Krishnarao will find these fourteen days very difficult.
Let them follow us.
There they are.
Go and catch them.
Don't worry about me..
shoot them!
Damn it!
Give me your hand, major.
He is going alla lone.
If I get him, I will get his friends too.
I swear to God..
I will fly from this today.
Look at this now.
You idiot bastard, leave me alone.
You English chicken.
When you have called Indian bastards..
I swear.. see what kind of bastards we are.
This is just the beginning.
We will take you below the umbrella some other day.
Finito.. finish.. come on..
come on.. follow me.
He is Prince Karl.
He is the brother of the dead king.
Dong has left him thinking that he..
..is a drunkard and a good for nothing.
But in reality, he is the president..
..of a underground revolutionary party.
And he wishes to free Dongrila from Dong's tyranny.
Therefore, he will help us secretly.
But you didn't speak about prince Karl..
..in the plan that you gave at the headquarters.
Just like how I hadn't mentioned major Dharamsingh too.
I want to play safe.
Even then, Dong knows all our steps.
Because one of his agent is in your security.
But that's impossible.
It is possible.
And therefore..
We will have to get the secret file first.
It has the names of all the agents of King Dong all over India.
Mrs. D'Costa will help you in this matter.
Hi.
- Hi.
She is the general secretary of our party.
She will take you to some safe place here, away from here.
We haven't come here to go to some safe place.
Dong is staying in the cantonment..
..residency outside the city at this time.
And the only mode of transport there..
..is a trolley, we can only go through a trolley.
But even a bird can go there without Dong's permission.
Therefore, I suggest..
You stay out of the city for your further plans.
The military has prepared traps for you inside the city.
Mr. Karl, your stop has arrived.
Okay, friends, all the best to you.
Please go with Mrs. D'Costa after this.
Finite" ﬁnite" ﬁnish"
This farm belongs to an officer of Dong, Jello.
Don't worry.
He lives in the cantonment.
He comes here only for eight days in a year, for holidays.
None will suspect a military officer's house.
But someone must be living in this farmhouse.
Some servant, or some gardener.
Some Juley lives near the river.
This Juley.. is it some woman's name?
- Yes.
She is a important member of our party.
Dong's officer and a revolutionary, very strange.
Her brother doesn't know about this.
We profit a lot with this.
We come to know about Dong's actions before.
Why don't you go and change?
I will bring Juley.
Shall I come along, to call Juley?
No, please go inside.
I will call her.
Juley..
Juley..
Juley..
It seems that she must be parading the new children.
I will teach you the salute now.
When you will be told to salute..
..then you will raise your hand like this and salute.
Okay?
So.. salute!
The real soldiers can give their life..
..for their commander's orders too.
Salute!
Juley..
Juley..
Mrs. D'Costa!
Juley..
Mrs. D'Costa.. you have arrived..
I thought that you wouldn't come.
Shall I tell you?
I heard that there will be a storm today.
The storm didn't come, and you arrived.
Yes.. your guests..
They have arrived.
They have?
Juley.
Thanks.
Juley.
- Thanks.
Juley.
- Thanks.
Juley.
- Thank you.
Juley.
- Thank you, pretty girl.
Juley.
- Javed.
Oh..
Will you feel bad if I give you the flower in my hair?
You will give me something and I won't like it?
Am I such a fool?
Juley.
- Thank you.
That's a wonderful name.
Welcome.
- Then this for me.
There is some different meaning for that.
That is bye, bye.
Then this will be for him.
We will make for you.
- I will accompany you..
Sir.. it is important to keep an eye..
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.
Okay, boys.
Let us get the positions please.
Captain Rakesh.Go behind.
Captain Javed, look at the gates.
- Yes, sir.
Captain Anju, you check the signals.
- Yes, sir.
Major Dharamsingh..
- I will check the ammunition.
Damn it.
What?
Does that mean you did not like me?
No.
I liked all, especially the one with blonde eyes.
No, no, he is a number one playboy.
Then the one with the gangster type body?
He does not know anything except walking like models.
The other two then.
First the one with a beard.
He is very boring.
Okay, that muscle man.
- He looks like your uncle.
But I liked all.
Okay, so you liked all but not me.
All others are heroes and am I a villain?
Do I not look like a hero?
Do I not?
You look.
You do look like a hero, but of art films.
What?
Do I look like an art film hero to you?
Does my face resemble Salim the lame one?
Do I have a flowing beard?
Do I have a bag on my shoulder?
Do I wear kurtas?
Do I smoke beedis?
Do I wear broken slippers?
Art film!
I'll make you laugh..
..in the style of commercial film heroes.
- Captain Ranveer!
How did you voice become so heavy?
Did you forget that my voice is heavy since..
..the time of Mahabharat?
- Sir.
Tell me one thing.
You have come here to Dongri-La..
..to become a hero or a comedian?
- Comedian.
Your friend is a better comedian than you.
He made me laugh instantly.
- Friend?
Who?
Ranveer?
Oh my God, what has happened?
Do not ask.
He has got a seizure.
You take care of him.
I shall bring the doctor rightaway.
God please, save him.
Please God.
Juley, just tell that you love me and I look like a hero.
You look like a hero.
Juley, where are my children?
Oh my God!
Oh God!
Keep your hands down.
Why did you not lower your hands?
You only had told till the commander does not instruct..
..the soldier must not keep his hands down.
Good, good, good.
Children!
Mother, mother!
Okay, then salute them.
Enough, you'll get tired.
Mother, has he come to sister to become a soldier?
No, he's already a big soldier of India.
Sister has told us many stories of India.
We'll become brave when we grow up like these soldiers..
..and free our nation from Dong.
Good, my little soldiers!
But if Dong remains alive..
..till you grow up, then your nation wouldn't survive.
I promise that I will free your nation from Dong.
Rocky, Javed, Captain Ranveer, come quickly.
What happened?
Sir, Major Kishan Nath's doctor has said..
..that gangrene is spreading in his foot.
The poison is quickly spreading all over his body.
It is necessary to operate upon him quickly.
Gangrene!
The terrorists of India..
..shall be very soon presented before you journalists.
Stop!
Hey Major, what happened?
- Checking, checking.
Hello, Colonel Richard, what is happening?
Checking?
Mrs. D'Costa, who is that man?
He is my new man.
He is my new man.
When did you marry?
Why did you not invite me?
I meant he is my servant.
Oh, I am sorry.
Servant.
Sir, I am madam's new servant.
Okay, okay, what is in this tanker?
Colonel Richard, I forgot to tell you..
..l have begun the business of supplying water to the city.
Water to the city?
There is no water shortage in the city.
Sir, this is not ordinary water.
This is special rose water..
..from the rose lake.
People have stomach problems..
..we have brought this water to cleanse those stomachs.
This is water of the rose lake.
Yes, sir.
Rose lake?
For your Dog sir.
Dog?
.
Dug.
Dog?
.
Dug.
Dog?
- Dog.
Not that barking dog.
Your Dog.
That means you provide water to General Dong.
Okay, okay, I'll check it myself.
Open, open.
Open, open.
Hey sir, check it leisurely.
Remove less water from it.
Good, good, nice water.
Okay Miss D'Costa, you can go now.
Let them go.
Wait!
Hold it!
Lift this.
Hey.you,you-.
It stung me, it stung me.
A bumblebee, it stung me.
Where is it?
This is the cure, sir.
When a bumblebee stings, this is the cure.
Cure?
Cure?
Did a bumblebee bite you?
- Yes, many times.
Did you get it treated?
- No, no.
So, I'll treat it.
I'll treat you.
The marks will go..
..the swellings will go.
Okay, beat me, beat me.
I have to go.
You do one thing, keep the boot..
..and continue hitting yourself.
Okay, bye, sir.
Wait.
I also want a bottle of water of the rose lake.
Sir, we are taking this water for Mr. Dong.
Why are you troubling us?
How can we give you water?
One bottle.
One glass.
Okay, one glass.
Take it.
Take it, but it will be a little warm.
Open the lower tap and take it.
You see there.
You do not look here.
Rose lake!
Very tasty, very tasty.
Yes, have some more.
It's good for you.
Sir, did you find it nice?
This was absolutely pure water.
That's why you liked it.
Next time I'll give you better water.
You try some more, sir.
Can I go, sir?
- Go, go.
Goodbye sir.
Let them go.
There is very strict checking here.
But we'll have to face this.
Because this is the only route..
..to reach the city till evening.
ls there no hospital outside the city?
Only the hospital in the city has operation facilities.
You understand.
Today the authorities have..
..cordoned off all routes leading to the city.
You will have to go there on foot only.
On foot?
Till today, we have not even gone..
..to the loo on foot.
Why Mr. Hardy?
Yes Mr. Laurel.
And never together.
Did you hear that?
And you want that we should..
..walk so far to the city from here?
Instead of performing in the hotel..
..we must perform in the hospital..
..which I think is near your hotel?
- Near the hospital?
But sir, we have called the head office for permission.
Perhaps, your vehicle will get permission to enter the city.
Save us, save us!
Who are you?
- Laurel and Hardy.
And you?
- Lambu and Chum.
But they are having a show today?
A show?
It's party time, it's party time, it's party, party, party time.
It's party time, it's party time, it's party,.
Party. party time
I am Laurel, you're Hardy;
let's begin the party.
I'm Lambu, you're Chutki;
give me a playful pinch.
Your heart is my heart..
My heart is yours.
See, do not change; do not go afar from me.
Your heart is my heart..
My heart is yours.
How lovely you are!
Tell me you are mine.
You are in my dreams.
You are in thoughts, all days and nights..
You are a part of my life.
How lovely you are!
Tell me you are mine.
You are in my dreams.
You are in thoughts, all days and nights..
You are a part of my life.
Your sorrow is mine..
My sorrow is yours..
See, do not change; do not go afar from me.
Your heart is my heart..
My heart is yours.
Hey, you wanna have some fun?
Look at me.
Leave that girl alone.
Let me come ahead, let my love be felt..
I shall wipe away these tears..
We have come in this world with a gift of love..
We shall remove these fears.
Your pain is mine..
My pain is yours.
See, do not change; do not go afar from me.
Your heart is my heart..
My heart is yours.
Stop.
Did you see General Dong's arrangement?
He emptied the whole hospital.
We knew that poison has..
..spread in Major Rao's body and that you would..
..surely bring him here for an operation.
Go, bring their other companions.
Wait!
There is no need to call.
Our men are here itself.
You stooge of Dong!
Javed, oxygen.
You people are surrounded from all sides.
Surrender to my men and come out of the hospital.
I give you time till I count up to 5.
One..
Two--.
Three..
Four..
Five..
Six..
Seven..
Eight..
Nine..
Ten..
Hundred..
Thousand..
Keep counting, baby, as far as you know.
Purring of cats does not tame lions.
Go and tell your Dong that to make him wrong..
..along with Major Kishan Rao, Dharam Singh has also come.
Javed, I'll try to bring the Major into consciousness..
..so that blood clotting does not take place.
But as soon as possible, you should arrange for lights.
Now there is only one way to arrange for lights.
That generator!
But for that we shall have to finish all these soldiers..
..and control this entire area.
And that is impossible.
Sheer madness!
Sir, please.
- Major!
Get aside.
Take the Major inside.
I am not important, the mission is important.
And to save me, you have put the mission into danger.
You do not worry about the mission.
Such dangers are commonplace to me.
If you have called me, have faith in me.
I'll gun all these dogs down to death.
I agree, Dharam Singh, that you will finish all of them.
But do not forget that Dong does not have..
..only these many men.
He has many more men.
If you kill me, more will come.
Your bullets will be exhausted, but these soldiers won't stop.
This is not a war, but a suicide.
What have you done to save me?
Sir, there is a valley here.
Major, this valley is safe.
You all go here and..
..save yourselves.
- What?
Major, you are so weak!
More than a soldier's reputation..
..you have begun to value your life?
Let our lives go today, but not our reputations.
I'll put down so many corpses of these dogs here today..
..that there will no earth left to burn their pyres.
Dong will remain alive, though.
His crime will be alive.
But brothers, if we die and Dong remains alive..
..then along with us will die the pride of those Indians who..
..know that their soldiers do not protect just their borders..
..but who can show to the whole world that..
..whenever a bastard like Dong can wreak havoc..
..in the world with his sword of terrorism..
..then Indians can also go into his country and..
..answer his havoc with ours.
Okay, commander.
You take these people and..
..enter into the valley.
Till then, I'll stop these people here.
You call me commander and teach me the wrong way also.
Have you forgotten that a commander first..
..extracts his people from danger?
After that he extracts himself.
How can we leave you in this condition?
I agree that my destiny has failed me, friend..
..but I am not such a big criminal that..
..l should not get the privilege to dying a soldier's death.
From today, I appoint you the commander of my small army.
My friend, my mission is yours from today.
Dong has challenged me; you have to fulfil that now.
In front of Dong, this father may be shamed..
..but not this soldier.
Major Kishan Rao, neither will a soldier be shamed..
..nor will a father.
Along with it, we shall not forget..
..to take your daughter Dolly with us.
This is a promise.
O Mother India, I have come to put my head in your feet..
Whatever breath I have left, I have come to give it to you.
O Mother India, I have come to put my head in your feet..
Whatever breath I have left, I have come to give it to you.
With our lives in our hands, we have come to show..
..the whole nation shall see, I have come here to die.
I have come to die for my friends.
My heart is touched by those who care for me.
My heart is touched by those who care for me.
The surrounding buildings will collapse, sir.
Many innocent people will die.
I say, blast the hospital.
Blast the hospital.
Headquarters here, Code 5 come in.
No Rakesh, the enemy is coming to know..
..of all our movements.
It may be that all information..
..through this transmitter may be intercepted..
"By the enemy's transmitter- It can also be that--.
..there is some traitor sitting in General Kapoor's office.
That means we should not send any news..
..to the headquarters?
No, we'll send the news.
The final news.
Hello, Mr. Kapoor, this is me.
Did you recognise my voice?
I am Dharam Singh, who was court-martialled due to you.
I'll tell you later why I am here.
Now there is a message..
..not for you, but for that cur of Dong who is relaying all..
..our messages to Dong.
If he is listening now..
..then let him listen with cocked ears that..
..Dongri-La's annual day will be the last day of Dong's life.
This is not a prediction, but Dharam Singh's challenge.
Dong is never wrong.
Come, come, Cynthia.
I was waiting for you.
See what all I have ordered for your dinner.
See these fruits.
See these breads and these sweets.
These are very important.
Come here.
Call the Brahmins.
Today is your mourning dinner, isn't it?
General!
Madam Cynthia, you were unsuccessful in killing..
..all other Indians except Major Kishan Rao.
For that General Dyer sentences you to death.
In the annual day to be celebrated four days from now..
..you shall commit suicide.
For that, my beautiful intelligent chief Miss Cynthia..
..within these four days if you find and tell us..
..where these Indians are hidden, then the annual day..
..will not be day for you to commit suicide..
..but it will be the most happy day for you.
Make haste, Miss Cynthia.
Today we need you for in the fight against Dong.
This fight is not just yours, but also of the people of Dongri-La.
We can even give up our lives for it.
You give the orders.
Great!
Look, anyhow you have to enter the cantonment..
..tomorrow and there is only one route for that.
Your brother Jaylu.
Jaylu?
Yes, Juley.
Your brother lives in the soldier barracks..
..in the cantonment area.
Behind those barracks..
..there is a valley that has no guard over it.
If we manage to put a in the barracks..
..then we can enter the barracks from the other side..
..of the valley through a rope trolley.
All right.
You cannot do this work alone.
The barrack wall is..
..made of stones and is four feet high.
To break it, it'll take about 4 to 5 hours and 2 people.
It's the job of a specialist.
So Ranveer will go with you.
But that's impossible.
Without special permission..
..no one can enter the cantonment area.
And then what will I tell Jaylu?
Why will he leave us alone in his barrack for such a long time?
Juley, the Major has a remedy for this problem.
Tomorrow, you'll have to pretend to marry Ranveer..
..in front of the village folk.
Papers, please.
Aha, you are the husband?
Congratulations.
Your husband is a colourful guy.
Happy honeymoon.
Juley is coming to the barracks for her honeymoon.
Okay, let her come, brother.
Your face, your magic..
Your face, your magic..
Allah is my benefactor..
Allah is my benefactor..
Your chapeau, your sunglasses..
Your chapeau, your sunglasses..
Allah is my benefactor..
Allah is my benefactor..
The kohl in your eyes is fragrant..
The flowers in your braid are fragrant.
The kohl in your eyes is fragrant..
The flowers in your braid are fragrant.
You bumblebee, don't come near..
You're flirting with me.
Your smile is my doom..
It's a nuisance to meet you.
Allah is my benefactor..
Allah is my benefactor..
The weather today is lovely..
I have got your company..
The weather today is lovely..
I have got your company..
Let it be night..
Leave my hand, let me go.
I have found my Juleyt..
Your condition is like that of Romeo.
Allah is my benefactor..
Allah is my benefactor..
Welcome, sir.
One moment.
Come on, darling.
My husband.
Brother..
Juley, my beautiful little sister.
Congratulations.
I was waiting for you.
Brother, this is my husband.
Hello, what a handsome man.
Touch my brother's feet.
Stupid girl, if you wanted him, you should have told me.
I would have got you both married amidst great pomp.
You can have the pomp now also.
Better late than never.
No brother, we are too tired now.
Jaylu, understand now.
Let them have their honeymoon.
Definitely.
- Let us go now.
We could not do anything.
- Doesn't matter.
Come on.
Quickly remove all the tools from in here.
Give me.
Quickly, time is short.
Oh, my God.
Honeymoon doesn't mean that you leave..
..the door open. - then you close the door please.
Tell me if you felt as if a wall was being cut.
Drilling?
On honeymoon, walls are cut only.
Oh, keep it up!
But remember, whatever you do..
..do it with the door closed.
Oh, you please close the door.
Okay, right.
Hello, Ran reporting.
Over.
Operation B successful.
Hello Over.
Operation C begins.
Over and out.
Congratulations!
Follow me.
Before everything, we have to get Dong's secret file..
..which has the names of all his agents in India.
Rakesh, Dong's voice.
Dong's voice.
Yes, sir-.
I have just been informed that they those Indians".
..have entered into the barracks.
You take all your guards from here to behind the barracks.
But sir?
Dong is never wrong.
Get out from here and..
..await my orders.
Captain, reach behind the barracks with your guards.
Okay, Colonel, okay.
Come on, follow me.
Listen Juley, you reach Mrs. D'Costa's house.
We shall also reach there with the secret file.
Yes sir-.
Hurry "P!
Ranveer, I want to tell you something.
I saw that in your eyes without you having to tell me.
Ranveer!
Major, Major, we got the file.
Defence Secretary Iyengar, Dong's agent?
Oh, no!
Rakesh, you transmit this message to India immediately.
Good, my love.
Oh, my darling.
Now not only in this life, but in every life..
..l shall make you my empress.
You have not only found out who is the helper of these..
--Indians like Prince Kao, but also according to my plan--.
..gave them a fake file with fake names.
Sir, those foolish Indians, at that very moment..
..instead of you and Mr. Kapoor sent the names..
..of your enemies to India via their transmitters.
And now, when India will hang patriots like Iyengar..
..taking them to be my stooges, then how the souls..
..of my 2000 men who died in the hospital disaster..
..will find their peace.
Good Cynthia, good.
Sir, I am not the sole deserver of this credit.
There is a part of my confidante in this..
..Jaylu's sister, Juley.
Long live Dong!
General, Indian terrorists are hiding right now..
..in Mrs. D'Costa's house.
An attack there will mean..
..another disaster like the hospital..
..because they still have a lot of ammunition yet.
Jaylu, your sister is very clever.
Till the time..
..they have ammunition it is difficult to kill them..
..so we'll have to do another thing.
Come on Juley.
Your first task when you get the chance.
To swap their real ammunition with this fake ammunition.
Okay.
So that they could be terminated easily.
Okay.
- Thanks and all the best.
Juley, it seems someone has seen us.
You hold the bag behind.
I'll be right back.
- Okay.
Kao uncle, Kao uncle, Juley aunty is a traitor.
Why are you silent?
Speak, speak, speak!
Oh my God!
Young Master, hello, hello..
Oh my God, no!
Vicky!
This cannot be!
This cannot be!
This has happened, Mrs. D'Costa.
This has happened.
The enemy is not anyone else, but our own friend..
..a member of our own party, our Juley.
Yes, she is Cynthia's stooge.
In fact, even your coming here is not your plan..
..but it is a dangerous plan hatched by..
..her and Cynthia.
What are you saying?
Ask her if this is true or not?
This is true that I'm Cynthia's stooge.
In order to take your messages to them..
..l even pretended to befriend you.
But I do not know how Vicky died.
Mrs. D'Costa, please believe me.
Please believe me.
Stop this playacting, you traitor!
We have been deceived in such a bitter manner..
..because we believed you.
Was this the reason..
..why you taught this small child lessons of heroism?
Traitor!
Your deceit has made this little soldier of Dongri-La..
..immortal even after death.
But you have died..
..even when you are alive.
Anyway sir, now what do we do of Juley?
Juley, there is only one punishment of deceit.
Ranveer, Ranveer, listen to me.
Please Ranveer..
Ranveer, what is this you have done?
I tried to tell you before also.
Before I could tell you..
..you did this.
It is true that as per Cynthia's plan..
..l wanted to trap you in Dong's cantonment.
But, since I got your love, since you put vermillion..
..in my head, the pretence of friendship turned into love.
I realised the difference between good and evil.
Dong wanted to attack you here.
But before that..
..he wanted to swap your ammunition with fake ones.
But I thought of duping General Dong.
I will not change your ammunition.
If I'd changed, then this bullet would also have been fake.
So I have shown my loyalty.
You too show your loyalty.
Win this war!
Win this war, Ranveer.
Juley!
Don't stop me, let me go home.
Don't take my hand, let me go now.
Become crazy today..
You will have to pay for Juley's deceitfulness.
This is unfair.
Leave me.
Set..
Aim..
Fire!
Did you see the reward of being loyal to Dong?
Now shall we go under the umbrella?
They have released Cynthia and taken her with them.
Now they can reach the function at any time.
Put your guards at every nook of the cantonment..
..seal all the routes leading to the cantonment.
As soon as you see them, shoot them all.
Shoot them at sight!
General sir, I advise you to cancel the function itself.
This is the new security plan prepared for the mission.
Take a look.
Through this tunnel, we can easily reach the water tank..
..but from there to reach the function ground..
..it will be very difficult.
You do not worry about that.
Let the function begin!
Thanks.
General sir, general sir, there's a big problem.
They were successful in breaking the barrier.
Dong.. you are wrong, isn't it?
Tell me.. you dog.. tell me!
Dong is never wrong.
You are wrong, Dharamsingh.
You think that you are a great spy?
You didn't even think..
The Dong who can come to India and give birth to a duplicate Dong..
..he can prepare his duplicate in Dongrlia too.
The one who is lying half dead there..
..he isn't me, he is the duplicate Dong.
Dongrila's emperor.
The real Dong is here.
Have you brought any bomb or cannon..
..which can reach till the Dong!
Your lame major had a mission..
..to kill Dong today and show the world.
Then show the world.
The annual day is over.
See.
In some time, the sun of India's respect will drown.
You think that you are great by vanquishing..
..just a demonstration of my security?
The real trap of my security is here!
LOOK.
LOOK.
And look at this!
Did you see how Dong changes the air?
You think that you are the peak.
The air is on your side?
It doesn't take much time for the air to change face.
Bomb as much as you want.
They won't reach me.
They will not be able to reach me!
Run!
Run!
There is fire!
Run!
Fire!
Run!
Run.. till where can you run?
Run!
Why are you going back?
Come, you wretch!
Break his bones!
Did you see us Indians?
Did you?
Why?
You were barking like a dog.
What did you say?
India's respect's sun was about to drown?
Your life's sun is about to drown today.
Listen to this before you die.
Just six Indians have shown this.
Think..
If eighty crore get up..
What about you.. even the biggest..
..of despotic rulers will have to run.
Rascal!
Dog!
Did you know the power of Indian soldiers?
Hit him!
After this, Major Krishnarads small".
..army didn't have just Dolly released..
..but it released all the innocent girls..
..and gave them a new life, who were imprisoned by Dong.
Boys.. so you have the top secret file.
Yes.
Did you look at the first page?
ls my name there?
- Yes, sir.
And if that is printed in the papers..
..there will really be a ruckus in the country, isn't it?
Yes.
So, this message shouldn't be printed, isn't it?
Yes, sir-.
Get ready to die.
Nothing personal.
Just business.
If you want to shoot, shoot.
Don't talk.
It's just business.
Nothing personal.
Fatso-.
The traitor.
If Major Krishnarao's force five..
..gave the country of Dong a gift of death..
..the Indian army gave the highest..
..level of to him after his death.
And Dharamsingh got his lost pride.
Now little Ed, mommy and auntie Roseanne
Are going to play bingo.
Becky and Darlene will be looking after you.
Darlene, remember what to do if the baby starts spitting up?
Yeah.
I give him to Becky.
Oh, I'm making a horrible mistake.
Crystal, we'll be fine.
O.k. I left two bottles in the fridge.
And we heat them first.
Don't heat them in the microwave
'Cause I heard it's dangerous for the baby.
Only if the baby's still hanging on to it.
And--and be careful of his soft spot.
He's got a soft spot here.
We better not find anything stuck in that head that's not supposed to be there when we get back.
Don't worry.
Ooh, yes, yes.
Darlene, you help your sister out, or she's going to keep all the money.
O.k. I feed, you wipe.
You got the numbers to the bingo hall and the doctor's service.
Call if you have any questions.
O.k., bye, honey.
We won't be gone too long.
Everything's going to be all right.
Come on, Crystal, don't you think it's time you cut the cord already?
It's important to talk to your children, Roseanne.
They are people, you know.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
N-41.
N-41.
B-11.
B-11.
Oh, man.
Are you sure we're old enough to get in here?
This looks like where people go when they can't play shuffleboard no more.
Ah, you just wait.
Bingo can be real exciting.
N-34.
N-34.
You're messing with us, right?
They got naked male strippers behind the door over there.
Oh, come on, Roseanne.
Let's give it a chance.
Thank you.
Maybe they got cake.
It so happens I know a woman who won $75 here the other night.
Oh, really?
Did she retire or keep going to work every day just like nothing happened?
G-50.
G-50.
Boy, I bet this guy does a mean I-22.
Shh.
O.k., what's the deal?
Cards are $2.00 apiece.
6 Cards minimum.
You're kidding me?
12 Bucks?
What a racket.
Roseanne, please, they know me here.
Oh.
Sorry, sister.
We could've gone to a movie for 5 bucks.
Well, it's for charity.
The money goes to needy families.
Oh, o.k.
Well, then I guess we get reimbursed.
New game.
Straight bingo.
$35 Jackpot.
I-17.
Excuse me.
That's too close.
Too close to what?
My area.
Don't you see?
I'm all set up here.
Sorry!
What's this for?
Aah!
Don't you touch this.
Don't touch anything of mine.
You'll jinx me.
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
I won 200 bucks over at the methodist place last friday, so shut up!
I-17.
Bingo!
I hate new people.
I hear you.
B-5.
Oh, darn.
You know what your problem is?
You only got $2,000 worth of cards there.
I think you need more.
I think maybe you need to go find another seat.
I can't.
I think I'm falling in love with you.
N-32.
N-32.
Coffee.
Ooh, Crystal, you woke me up.
Oh, god, I am so bored.
You know, I think I'm starting to miss my husband.
Hey, I vote we don't let Crystal pick what we do on our nights out anymore.
I'm sorry you're all having such a terrible time.
Oh, Crystal, it's really not that bad.
Oh, yeah, we're just whining and moaning to keep from passing out.
B-14.
Roseanne, if you're not enjoying yourself, you're free to go whenever you like.
No, I can't.
You're my ride.
You never complain when Bonnie or Anne Marie pick what we do, but when it's my turn, you jump all over me.
I'm getting a brownie.
Whoa, what's with her?
Apparently, your friends don't like you very much either.
I'm telling you there's something wrong.
Well, change his diaper again.
I just changed it.
Maybe you did it wrong.
Maybe you gave my little baby a wedgie.
That's not it.
Does his color look right to you?
I don't know.
What color was he when he got here?
What are you doing?
I'm trying to calm him down.
Well, does this calm you down, you moron?
Well, gee, I'm sorry, Becky.
What would you like me to do?
I don't know.
I'm going to call Crystal.
Oh, grow up.
What's going on?
The baby won't stop crying, and he cheesed my shirt.
We tried everything.
Just relax.
I've changed him a hundred times, and I feed him every 15 minutes.
Now you know why you had to change him so much.
He might be warm.
Should we take him to the hospital?
Let the old doctor take a look here.
[Sniffing]
You cutting a tooth there, little Ed?
Yeah, he's teething, that's all.
D.J., see if there's any frozen waffles in the freezer.
O.k.
Crystal's list didn't say anything about frozen waffles.
That's because she doesn't know the secret.
There you go.
Chew on this for a while, little Ed.
Yeah, it's going to make those gums feel better.
Mmm...
Ugh.
He's slobbering.
That's why I use a waffle--
It's got all those built-in drool cups.
You don't need a bib.
Oh, gross.
I can't watch this.
You don't listen to them, little Ed.
You go ahead and dribble.
You're a Conner man.
N-39.
N-39.
Got it.
Got it.
Got it.
Ooh, got it.
O-75.
O-75.
Yep.
Now we're cookin'.
Now we're movin'.
Now we're--
I don't suppose we could do this in silence.
O great spirit of bingo,
I've given you my first-born child.
Now you must give me my number!
N-44.
Ha ha ha ha.
N-44.
Roseanne, pull back, baby.
Oh, I'm just having some fun with Endora here.
Give me that.
Give me that!
I cannot believe the phone at your house is still busy, Roseanne.
Oh, Crystal, don't worry.
Everything's fine.
Either the girls are on the phone with their friends,
Or, you know, they're holding for 911.
I don't find that funny.
Oh, lighten up, Crystal.
He's fine.
He's 9 months old, Roseanne.
I worry about him.
That's what good mothers do.
If you're such a good mother, then why did you leave him with my kids?
B-10.
B-10.
Roseanne, you been marking my cards?
Well, I thought, you know,
Anne Marie was doing it.
She asked you to do it.
Did you get anything?
Well, yeah.
Look at the board.
B-14.
B-14.
I only asked you--
Bingo!
I got bingo!
I got bingo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
All right, everyone hold your cards until we verify the bingo.
Ha!
Where are you going?
I'm changing my seat.
Wait.
I think you're good luck for me.
I'm coming with you.
Get away from me!
I can't stand you!
We have a bingo!
Here's your voucher.
All right.
You collect your money on the way out.
The cashier's at the door.
Great!
50 Bucks!
Happy bingo dance.
O.k., I'm beat.
I'm leaving.
Me, too.
No!
Roseanne, I don't want to play anymore.
You don't have to.
Just sit here and watch me win.
Bye, Roseanne.
Well, Crystal will stay with me then.
Where is she?
Maybe she went to the bathroom again.
Her purse and coat are gone.
I didn't see her leave.
She's my ride.
Why would she leave me?
Maybe that's her little way of ditching you.
Oh, great.
Now I got to quit and find out what the hell's the matter with her.
You take her.
I don't want to.
She's on your way.
She won 50 bucks.
She can take a cab.
One of you is taking me home.
I ain't taking you.
[Knock on door]
Hey, Crystal.
Where's Roseanne?
Still at bingo.
Oh, hi, little Ed.
Did you miss me, honey?
Did you eat?
Did you take a little nap?
Good to see he isn't talking to you, either.
I thought he was snubbing me.
Where's Becky and Darlene?
I'm supposed to pay them.
Pay D.J. He fed little Ed, he played with him,
He even gave him his old bear.
That's wonderful, D.J.
Here's $5.00 for being such a responsible young man.
All right!
Yeah.
Go show your sisters.
Make sure you rub that in real good.
How come you didn't bring Roseanne home with you?
I left early.
How's she going to get home?
I don't care.
Don't tell me you two had a fight.
O.k., Dan, I won't.
You don't have to know anything, so you don't have to do anything about it.
Just like your father.
So was it tequila night down at st.
Benedict's?
Hey!
Why did you leave me down there?
You were in your glory, Roseanne.
I didn't want to interrupt.
Cut the crap, Crystal.
So what's your problem?
Forget it.
I was having a great time down there--
Oh, how about that?
I thought playing bingo was just another one of Crystal's stupid ideas.
After I won 50 bucks, it got funner.
50 Bucks?
Are you going to retire, or will you go to your job tomorrow like nothing happened?
I was just teasing.
That's the way we are.
It's the way you are, always have been.
Ever since high school,
Everything I do is stupid.
Everything I say is stupid.
Even the way I raise my kids is stupid.
You're way overexaggerating now.
When you're not telling me how stupid I am, you're criticizing me or making fun of me, and when you're not doing that you're just ignoring me.
I do not ignore you.
How long did it take before you'd realized that I left the bingo parlor?
O.k.
All right.
I'm sorry, o.k.?
Oh.
Fine.
"I'm sorry."
That's supposed to make up for 20 years.
What was that?
Crystal's mad.
I've never seen her like that, ever.
She yelled at me, and I was being adorable.
you really must have done something to tick her off.
I swear I didn't do anything.
Come on, Roseanne, what did you do?
Dan I did not treat her any different than I always do.
Well, you better go apologize then.
If she had some complaint against the way I've been treating her all these years, how come she waits till now to say something?
I'm easy to talk to.
I listen.
O.k., I'll call her tomorrow and apologize.
That a girl.
How was bingo?
Man, it was incredible.
It was such a rush.
Yeah?
Did you win?
Uh, no.
If Crystal's not returning your calls, then you should see her.
No.
Why should I?
Hey, Louise.
Because you're upset.
No, I'm not upset.
She's the one that's upset.
I've been a very good friend to Crystal ever since the eighth grade.
I've been with her through four husbands.
Hey, Peg.
Yo, Ro.
And when she decided she was getting married to Dan's dad,
I put the entire wedding together, did I not?
Hey, Lloyd.
How do you know these people?
I've been playing the church circuit here.
This here's the best game.
It's got the big pots, and the numbers come fast.
Stick close to me 'cause things could get hairy.
Hairy?
This is the game where you put the bean on the card, right?
Hey!
Arnie, what are you doing here?
I'm going to be the caller.
Ha!
You're kidding me.
No, no.
There's lots of money in bingo.
The problem is all the callers are boring.
I'll make it fun.
I'll become a celebrity.
Then I'll become Mr. Bingo.
Then I'll open my own indian reservation and make a hell of a lot of money.
What do you think about that?
Well, let's start with you're not an indian.
I'll convert.
I just want to thank you for volunteering to do this.
Anything I can do for the community, padre.
I saw the sign outside,
And it only says "bingo."
How are people going to know I'm here?
That man saw you naked.
Shut up.
You think you spent enough money on bingo cards?
I did not come to lose.
You are getting very weird here, Roseanne.
I am not.
What's with all the lighters?
They're just sort of, you know, for luck.
Oh, you're kidding me.
No, everybody does it.
It's just for fun.
It doesn't mean nothing.
It's not like I need them or anything.
You can take one if you want.
Not the yellow one!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to bingo night here at the fabulous St. Benny's.
I'm your host and caller Arnie thomas, reminding you that even though you're in the presence of the savior, don't save your money because it goes to charity.
Just call the numbers.
Coming right up.
But before I call out this number, are there any honeymooners in the crowd tonight?
Being here at bingo reminds me of a funny story.
Let's go!
O.k., all right!
Hey.
I-27!
I-27!
Hell, I only got that on three cards.
Wouldn't it be really funny if we both yelled out "bingo" right now?
Oh, that would be so beyond dumb, Jackie.
Come on, Arnie.
Come on, Arnie.
Come on, Arnie.
B-6!
B-6!
6.
Yeah.
That's better, that's better.
You are scary.
I'm trying to concentrate.
You're obsessed.
Get out of here.
O-70.
O-70.
Just kidding!
It's actually 1-17!
Bingo humor!
[Yelling] [screaming]
I'm working the room!
Excuse me!
I have seen you like this before.
Roseanne, you're addicted.
Oh, please!
No, I'm serious.
You've spent the last five nights at bingo.
So?
When you started smoking again,
You were doing two packs a day in a week.
It's the same thing.
Oh, get out of here.
It's just about having fun.
You're hooked!
Admit it!
Bingo is fun!
No, it's not!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
[Cheering]
O.k., that was fun.
[Knock on door]
Come in.
Hey.
Hello, Roseanne.
Hello, little Ed.
Hello.
Look what you left over at my house
The other day.
That's real nice of you, Roseanne.
Thanks for dropping that by.
Well...
You know, I just--
I didn't want it to look like
I just came over to apologize, you know.
I mean, I--I could've brought your blender back, but it's broken.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I didn't call you back all this time.
Yeah, well, let's not do this anymore, o.k., Crystal?
We've been friends for too long.
Yes, we have.
I was thinking about what you said.
And you're right.
I make fun of you too much.
I won't anymore.
I Promise.
Ha!
Of course you will.
No.
I'm not going to.
I Promise.
Roseanne...
I'm pregnant again.
Is this a test?
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
That's why I got so crazy on you.
My hormones sort of have a mouth of their own.
Well, why didn't you tell me?
'Cause you were being a big, stupid jerk.
I guess that's your hormones talking again, huh?
I can't believe it.
We were using birth control.
And--and I wasn't getting my time of the month since I've been nursing, and all of a sudden, I started getting symptoms,
And...
Why did this happen to me, Roseanne?
Oh, Crystal.
I got a 9-month-old baby and a husband who's never home and a teenage son who's real hard to love a lot of the time.
And look at this place.
How am I going to deal with another baby?
Well...
Maybe this one will be the girl you always wanted.
Maybe.
I wish Ed was around to help a little more.
Well, I think Ed's done enough.
You know, me and Dan are here for you, Crystal, and so is Becky and Darlene, even though they don't kind of know it yet.
I mean, even D.J. Can help out, you know.
Everything will be fine, Crystal.
You'll see.
Thank you, Roseanne.
Ohh...
Want some decaf?
Yeah.
That would be great.
Oh, little Ed, you sit up.
I did try to call you back last night.
Oh, yeah.
I was out playing bingo.
Again?
Yeah.
I've been playing most every night, you know,
But this saturday, that's the big game.
And then that's it.
I'm quitting on sunday.
Monday, for sure.
* Down came the rain and washed the spider out *
* Up come the sun-- **
Hey.
Yo.
Where's Roseanne?
One guess.
Oh, god.
You're kidding!
We were supposed to go to a movie.
It was weird.
We were watching television,
And this commercial for this cereal came on.
The guy talked about all the vitamins it had--
B-1, b-6, b-12...
I turned around, and she was gone.
Dan, we have a problem.
People who get addicted to this type of stuff,
They change.
They become completely different people.
I-18.
I-18.
N-38.
N-38.
That's all I need.
One more number.
N-38.
N... 30... 1!
Ohh!
Grab her.
Hold her.
Hug her.
Tell her that you love her.
It's for your own good, Roseanne.
[Dan] it's o.k., folks.
I only need one more number!
After two days in the wilderness, we have reached the border between Sudan and Ethiopia.
My fear is that our contacts will have found getting here as difficult as we have, but, to my relief, there is a Dr Livingstone.
You must be Graham.
Sorry we're late.
Sorry my trousers are ripped.
We were trying to pull the vehicle out... it was stuck...
He's Graham Hancock, British journalist.
We had the same.
-It's as bad that way?
It's awful.
Really dire.
-So you arrived late too?
We got here at two in the morning and we've just been waiting for you to turn up.
We've got to clear customs on both sides?
You'll have no problem on that side.
There's nobody there.
If we can get going and we have few problems on the Sudanese side, can we get to Gondar?
We can get to Gondar, but it will take us, I would guess, not less than eight hours.
Really?
So we won't?
-That's if we go now.
The problem is driving this road in the dark.
In the dark, you can't see what you're getting into.
How far is the road bad?
-It's bad for about 200 kilometres.
Is that most of the way to Gondar?
-Yes.
I think I'll go home.
I want to go home!
To avoid the war-torn south of Sudan, our route takes us in a wide detour away from 30 degrees - across the highlands of Ethiopia to Gondar, Lake Tana and the capital, Addis Ababa.
Next morning, after a mercifully short night in a village of mud huts, we're on the move.
The landscape is a surprise - lush green meadows and the first mountains we've seen since Norway.
We're here because of a civil war in Sudan, but until four months ago one just as fierce was being waged in Ethiopia.
Not everyone has surrendered.
This lonely countryside provides perfect cover for bandits and privateers.
We're accompanied everywhere by soldiers.
The guns are loaded.
In the villages, there are more obvious signs of war.
The children have not been to school for years.
There's little work.
Shelter is basic and food is scarce.
We stop for a breakfast cuppa with our armed escorts.
Thank you.
The youngest, politest, least aggressive army I've ever seen.
Is anyone ever shot at on these roads?
There's constant incidents on these roads where lone vehicles, particularly at night, are stopped and the vehicle is stolen, sometimes people get killed.
Sometimes they'll attack more than one vehicle.
So it's considered a sensible precaution to send along a few armed guards with a convoy.
Who pays the wages of the guards?
-They draw no salary.
They're a volunteer army.
None of them have any income from it.
They just get food, accommodation and cigarettes.
How old are they?
-I would say not more than 18. 16 to 18.
Those who successfully overthrew the dictatorship were almost all kids of this age.
A year ago, Mengistu was heading the largest army in sub-Saharan Africa, a massive dictatorship, huge security apparatus.
Nobody would have believed he could be removed by a bunch of kids from the hills.
Can you sense when you come into a village that there's a different atmosphere?
Definitely.
I've been here for years and the atmosphere is the most noticeable change - the feeling of relief, that people feel that they're in control of their own lives again.
Ethiopia continues to provide surprises.
I don't think any of us associated the place with floods.
The cool mountain air and the beauty of the scenery is welcome.
It's easy to forget this is not quite the paradise it seems.
Our vehicle becomes separated from the rest.
Though we must wait for them, a roadside stop is highly risky.
Everyone breathes easier when the convoy catches up with us.
Now at least we're moving targets.
We head out of the unstable border country to the comparative safety of the first sizeable settlements.
This is the place where they go.
-Is this where they live?
Around here.
-Nearby.
You getting out?
What will we do without you?
Thanks very much.
Thanks for looking after us.
We got through safely.
(SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE)
Give these men promotion.
Make them sergeants.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
Bye.
Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot.
Bye, guys.
Thank you.
What a fine army.
Thank you very much indeed.
OK.
Thank you.
We'll know who to ask for next time!
Thanks a lot.
Cheers.
They're suddenly happy.
I can understand why.
They can go and eat and sleep.
Everything I want to do!
-Where the air is sensibly cool.
Yeah.
It's rained.
This is significant.
It's just rained.
There's been a thunderstorm.
Hailstones have fallen.
Thank you.
Just giving the weather forecast.
It's the first rain that we've had since northern Norway.
We've been dry too long, especially in the Sudan.
So we go on.
Does that mean we're safe?
We're out of bandit country?
Yes.
There's about 65 kilometres between here and Gondar, and it's safe.
Um...
And er...
Yes, it's all a lie.
It's the most dangerous 65 kilometres of all!
Everyone says, "The next bit of road is fine."
That's where we end up getting hijacked.
-It's been one hell of a journey.
So we go.
Do you want to come?
Gondar.
Once the capital of Ethiopia, Gondar is like somewhere out of a different age.
I'm not surprised to learn that the country works to a different calendar.
It's only 1984 here.
Through the smoke and mist loom the twin pillars of Ethiopian history -
Church and empire.
This is the castle compound.
It was established in 1635 when Gondar became the capital city.
The emperor Fasiladas built the first castle here, but over the next 150 years the successive emperors each built their own massive castle as well.
The tradition of emperors is very old in this country.
It goes back before recorded history.
For the last 750 years, there's been an unbroken line until Haile Selassie in '74.
That must make Ethiopia unique in Africa.
Completely unique.
-And it wasn't colonised, was it?
No.
It's never been colonised.
The Italians tried.
There seems a European influence here.
-There were Portuguese in Ethiopia.
They'd been invited in to help deal with the Muslim threat and they stayed on.
There's a possible Portuguese influence here.
Presumably they were despots?
You could say, almost without exception, that all Ethiopian emperors were despots.
Very dictatorial, very single-minded.
Their word was law.
Was their any attempt to form a constitution?
A constitution was created by Haile Selassie, but it stated that his power was inviolable.
Very clever!
-Yes.
This is Taffara, the unhappiest lion in Africa.
He was owned by Haile Selassie, the former emperor.
He's about 20 years old now.
He's spent most of that in here.
-They didn't get rid of the lion.
The symbol of imperial power, no.
It's really horrible in there.
What a terrible place to keep any animal.
Look at the flies round him.
It's almost a punishment because he was associated with the emperor.
The surrounding mountains have enabled Ethiopia to develop in its own individual way.
There's little to suggest much has changed since the emperors built their castles.
The country has remained traditional, agricultural and, apart from Mussolini's brief invasion in the 1930s, largely cut off from the West.
But not everyone wants to turn their back on the outside world.
Mohamed, you listen to the radio?
-Yes.
Particularly BBC.
The World Service?
-BBC World Service, yeah.
What do you listen to?
I have a great interest to listen to football, particularly England club football.
Do you have a favourite team?
-That is Manchester United.
Yes.
-I love when there's a match!
Did you hear the football last Saturday?
Because of some problems, I didn't hear the football.
So you can't tell me whether my team won?
My team is Sheffield Wednesday.
I know about them.
We beat Manchester United in the League Cup last season.
I was there.
So bad luck!
There's an urgent need I have to attend to before I leave Gondar.
The successful semi-circumnavigator must ensure his equipment is in working order.
Excuse me.
Good morning.
I take my trousers - ripped in action in the Sudan - to a local tailor.
Can you mend that?
Only they've got to last me to the South Pole.
He's having a go straightaway.
Now...
-Beautiful piece of mending.
That is brilliant.
That's about one minute, ten seconds flat.
And it's completely invisible.
-Two birr.
Two birr.
Ethiopian birr.
I'm still on Sudanese money.
A birr is about 50 US cents.
-Is it?
Or 30 pence.
-So this is?
Two of them is about a dollar.
-Two?
Thank you very much.
That's really good, excellent.
Thank you.
Look at that.
Near perfection.
We head south to one of the least known and yet most important places in Africa.
This is Lake Tana, where the Blue Nile rises.
It's a natural reservoir, providing water for Sudan and Egypt.
It's the only lake in Africa where these papyrus reed boats are found.
Their design has been traced back to ancient Egypt.
They look fragile, yet they've been crossing the lake for thousands of years.
The wood is in great demand.
It'll be used for heating, cooking, building and fencing.
In the green highlands round Lake Tana, Graham and I are taken on an expedition.
The countryside is no different from when the Victorians came this way, risking their lives to find the source of the Nile.
I'm risking little more than a clean shirt, but I'm realising my childhood ambition - to be an explorer, to see strange and wonderful things in strange and wonderful countries.
That is incredible.
I've never seen anything like that in my life.
It's only just left the lake, hasn't it?
-That's right.
Lake Tana is the source of the Nile?
-Effectively, yes.
It drains a lot of the mountains round about and most of it pours out down this river.
It's extraordinary, the power.
-You can see how it manages to reach Egypt.
Well worth leaving the North Pole for.
I've never seen anything as powerful as that.
Once on the road south, we're back to reality.
A poor country, exhausted by years of war and misgovernment.
Three days after entering Ethiopia, we have our last sight of the Nile, which we've followed for 2,500 miles.
It makes a spectacular exit in a deep gorge, spanned by a single bridge carrying the road to the capital.
Our safe arrival in Addis Ababa marks the end of the most difficult stretch since the Pole.
We should be feeling pretty pleased with ourselves.
So should Addis.
Four months earlier, Colonel Mengistu and his Soviet-style regime were chased out of the country after 17 years.
The monuments that every Ethiopian was expected to admire are now being taken for scrap.
But there's little sign of any joie de vivre.
The country should be having a ball, but no one seems to have the energy.
Addis Ababa is a city still in shock, unable to comprehend quite what has happened to it.
I suppose it must be depressing to realise that everything you believed in was false.
The statue of Lenin that was the centrepiece of the capital is now lying on the corporation tip.
Discarded.
Redundant.
Determined to be tolerant, the new left-wing government has allowed a demonstration.
It's taking place in the square which Mengistu used only for military parades.
They're angry at plans to partition the country and they're staging the biggest peaceful protest Ethiopia has ever seen.
(GUNFIRE)
Suddenly, there's gunfire and people run.
No one knows what it means, but that's the way the city is.
The only point of stability and continuity seems to be the Church.
On a wet Sunday morning, over a thousand people have come to worship here.
Christianity has continued unbroken in Ethiopia for 1,600 years - all the more remarkable as everywhere else around is Muslim.
(SERVICE RELAYED OVER SPEAKERS)
The rituals of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church have many similarities with the Jewish tradition.
It goes back to the Queen of Sheba.
According to legend, she was an Ethiopian and mother of King Solomon's son.
(CHANTING)
(RHYTHMIC DRUMBEATS)
The "kebero" drum and the silver "sistra" are straight out of the Old Testament.
Next day we're on the move - heading south on the unaccustomed luxury of a metalled road.
But we haven't left the Church behind.
These priests are appealing for funds.
They often collect money by upturning their umbrellas and catching contributions.
I'm riding with Oxfam, which I've supported for years.
Nick Roseveare has promised to show me how my money's being spent.
What can Ethiopia itself do to improve food production?
The policies of the new government are ones which I think will help a lot to get agriculture more efficient.
Something like 90-92% of the population are dependent on agriculture and the vast majority of them simply produce for their own needs.
(PALIN) If they were able to produce a small surplus and sell it at market value, how much would that improve matters?
A lot.
It would take time.
It's not going to happen next year or even in five years, but, progressively, with incentives for people to produce more than they need, eventually Oxfam hopes to do itself out of a job, really.
In the south, drought is not the main problem.
This creek provides water, but the water is tainted - animals use it, vehicles go through it - and it has to be carried over long distances - traditionally the woman's job.
For an outlay of £2,000 - raised in this case by Comic Relief - water now comes direct to this village.
A 90-foot well has been sunk and water pumped up by the simplest technology.
Excuse me.
I'd give that to my own children - and I'd have the beer!
That really is very good.
In theory, the return on this investment is better health and, for the women, extra time and freedom.
My own state of health is currently uneasy, but the hospitality keeps coming.
This is the local bread.
Is it bread?
-It's more like a pancake.
More like a car-seat cover!
So you just tear a bit off...
Very strange texture.
-Bit rubbery.
And dip it in these.
-In the sauce.
What's the least harmful for a man in my delicate metabolic situation?
Potato, if you can bear it.
Do you have to eat with your right hand only here?
People do, but it's not because it's your only clean hand.
It's not such a taboo.
In Sudan and Egypt, it's very bad to touch food with the left hand.
One of the best car-seat covers I've ever had!
Sour, isn't it?
It's pounded, then fermented and then used as a sort of pancake mixture.
Is it particularly Ethiopian?
Uniquely so.
-Uniquely?
They don't export it?
Maybe we could start a teff franchise.
In the busy town of Shashamene, a walk through the streets becomes a major event.
The apathy I saw in Addis has no place here.
As far as the locals are concerned, the circus has come to town.
Behave normally, just carry on, do whatever you're doing and I will too.
There's nothing to do but enjoy it.
Where did you get that?
Oh, there they are.
Can I have one?
Can I have one?
How much?
-25.
I'll continue my gentle walk.
Now...
Ho ho ho.
Mmm.
It's good here.
Hello.
Mr Palin.
Do you want me to?
The end of a long day's travelling and a reminder that even time itself is not the same in Ethiopia as anywhere else.
29th?
One.
-One?
One, '84.
-Oh, it's '84 again.
When the world adopted the Gregorian calendar, Ethiopia got left behind - by seven years and eight months, as it happens.
Outside, by Lake Awasa, it could be 1984 BC for all I care.
It's a place of soothing tranquillity, where limbs are rested, brains cleared and, hopefully, stomachs settled.
Surrounded by all this, the problems of the journey ahead seem unimportant.
It's a short-lived illusion.
Hello?
I'm ringing from Awasa in Ethiopia.
I've just had some bad news.
My friend who was going to meet us at the border...
The Kenyan border at Moyale.
He's been taken ill and he's in hospital, so he won't be able to come and meet us.
Yeah.
Can you hear me?
Is there any chance you could send vehicles to meet us?
It would be the end of this week.
Friday.
Probably Friday morning.
If you can do what you can.
I appreciate that.
We're promised emergency help, but first we must get to the border, 330 miles away.
Nick has returned to Oxfam and we're left to face the realities of travel in Ethiopia.
There are no trains, precious few buses, so it's time to hitch.
You can take us some of the way?
Is that right?
He'll take us...
He says he'll take us as far as he's going.
10 or 15 kilometres from here.
There doesn't seem to be anything else, so we'll take this and see.
OK.
Like the Lord Mayor's Show, isn't it?
Hello!
National Westminster Bank float.
Last seen on the Embankment!
That's a hat.
That's a chapeau.
Whoa!
(BANGING)
Oh, dear.
He's just lost his hat!
That great hat that I liked so much.
Oh, dear.
That's bad.
Would have been a terrible loss.
Tell you what...
Excuse me.
You have this hat.
That's better.
Can I have yours?
Can I have yours?
Your hat?
Where's your hat gone?
Where's his hat?
Fair swaps.
This could take years.
That's right.
I covet this.
My head's too big.
I'm a fashion victim.
Oh...
It's gone!
Well caught at second slip by Roger Mills.
That's it.
Immaculate.
Your head's very small.
Whoa!
It's just not going to stay on.
This stretch of road is almost all that exists of the great Pan-African Highway - a post-colonial dream that never became reality.
Rather like Ethiopian public transport.
A hitch-hiker's nightmare - a hot day, an empty road and 7,000 miles still to go.
Somewhere at the end of the road is the border town of Moyale.
If our vehicles are there, we can embark on the 400-mile run to the equator and Nairobi.
Fortune favours the brave.
11 hours after setting out from Lake Awasa, on our 11th day in Ethiopia, we've almost reached country number ten.
This is Moyale - the frontier town between Ethiopia and Kenya.
We're here thanks to various vehicles - of which this is the most comfortable.
We just hope that the vehicles from AK will be here to meet us.
But at least we're here.
I shall go and have some back surgery immediately.
I never feel comfortable at borders, and there's the fear that there might not be anyone to meet me.
But how could a company with a name like Abercrombie Kent let you down?
Hi, Michael.
I'm glad you could made it.
-I'm pleased to see you.
You got the message?
-Yeah.
Thank goodness.
How's Monty?
-He's much better.
You might be able to see him in Nairobi.
-Good.
Are you Abercrombie or Kent?
-Kabagere.
Mr Abercrombie.
Mr Palin.
-Welcome.
Nice to see you.
You don't know how nice!
So, country number ten.
Shall we go?
Yes.
Let's get everything sorted.
Let's go.
In contrast to their bleak surroundings, the tribes of Northern Kenya love display.
These are the Samburu - the word means "butterfly".
I spent time with them nine years ago making "The Missionary".
Today I'm back in Lerata to see if the roof we built for the school is still there.
They've been told to expect a celebrity.
It's a wonderful welcome... but not for me.
They all love Wendy.
(CHILDREN SHOUT)
Took you a while!
Took your time.
It's the hat, isn't it?
Now you know!
There you are.
Let's go.
Will you show me the school?
I want to see if the roof's still on.
It's still on.
Norman Garwood's work for you.
Let's have a look inside.
Hello.
Good morning.
I last came here...
Hello.
Good morning.
Good morning.
-I'm honoured.
Beautifully done.
You must have been practising.
I was here nine years ago to make a film and during the film, our technicians, our carpenters, put a roof on the school.
I'm glad the roof is still on and it's nice to be here again.
Do any of you know where I came from to make the film?
What country?
Anyone know what country I come from?
-England.
Very good.
What's your name?
-Solomon.
The wisdom of Solomon.
I come from England.
Does anyone know the capital city of England?
London.
-Very good.
Man in the lovely hat there.
I come from London and this time I've come from somewhere different.
I'm going to show you where I've come from on this world.
I've brought my own world with me.
Encourage me.
Say, "Come on!"
OK.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Right.
We did it.
Last time I came, we left a roof and this time I'd like to give something to the school because it's close to my heart.
So I want you to have my globe.
This has been with me round the world and this far down the world.
Would you like this for your school?
-Yes.
It's very useful.
You can look at it and you can also play football with it.
There you are.
That's right!
Oh!
My world!
This way.
Be careful with the world!
I may have left the world behind in Lerata, but I'm also about to leave miles of dirt track.
Where the good road begins, so does old colonial Africa - clustered round Mount Kenya, 1,700 feet high and bang on our halfway mark.
The equator divides the world into two hemispheres.
This is the northern hemisphere and this is the southern hemisphere.
If you drain a sink north of the equator and you watch the water as it drains, you will see that the water always rotates clockwise.
This phenomenon is caused by the rotation of the earth.
The effect is stronger according to how far north or south you are and weaker near to the line.
That's why we have to give some distance from the equator so the rotation can be noticeable.
This is the Coriolis effect.
Peter Muciri has given this lecture every day for six years.
It's delivered in the burnt-out shell of an old hotel.
The equator used to run through the bar.
I bet they floated matches in their beer.
This changes to counter-clockwise now we are in the southern hemisphere.
Now we are right on the equator and as we drain the water there is no rotation - it just drains straight down - and that's how we prove we are on the equator.
It does work.
(WATER TRICKLES)
(WATER TRICKLES)
Nairobi is the centre of the safari business.
Safari is a Swahili word meaning "journey".
Now it's come to mean a journey where animals meet tourists and vice versa.
And a highly competitive business it is too.
Hello.
-Jambo.
I'm going on safari for a few days and I've been told if I come to your shop, I'll get a free "I Love Kenya" sticker.
Definitely.
-OK.
So what is safari gear?
We start from trousers, shirts, jackets, shoes, socks.
Everything.
Bring your own underwear, though.
-No, we've got that as well.
In khaki.
Do you want to start with the jackets?
-Sure, yeah.
Absolutely.
This is called a photojournalist vest.
I'd like to be a photojournalist.
-The pockets are there for films.
Whisky flask there, gin there.
That's fun.
-This is camouflage.
We used to have original camouflage but the government banned it because of the army.
People getting muddled up with soldiers?
This is a zip-off trouser.
You can zip it off and make it into shorts.
I see.
-It's multi-purpose.
And there's this.
-Show me this.
This has the map of Kenya on it.
It's a map as well.
Find your way around.
It's very "Out Of Africa" style.
-Yes.
The uniforms in that movie, we did.
Did you really?
-Yes.
I think the only thing wrong is the hat.
From Nairobi, we descend the eastern rim of the Great Rift Valley - a dramatic 2,000 mile split in the earth's crust, running the length of East Africa.
Wildlife thrives on the valley floor, but we all have one eye on the weather.
It looks as if the rains have broken early.
Maybe this is why it all looks green and cosy - like Surrey with hippos.
In fact, it's the Mara River in Kenya's Masai Mara National Park.
Abercrombie Kent have camping rights here.
Their vehicles - bogged down by rain - have only just arrived.
It's the old-fashioned way to see animals.
No hotels or lodges, just simple tents and canvas showers.
It's authentic and terribly expensive.
The team that brought me down from the border are looking after me -
Kalului the driver and Wendy, who describes herself as "an old colonial hand".
Today they're joined by a few extra helpers.
Let me introduce you to Patrick.
This is Michael Palin.
-Pleased to meet you.
Welcome to the camp, sir.
-A lot of friends.
Patrick, the maître de camp, has safaried with Hemingway, Marshal Tito and Prince Charles.
It's a palace.
This is clearly going to be unlike any other camping holiday I've ever been on.
Thank God.
There's a light here.
Some drinking water.
A match box.
Here's your washing towel.
You can have your washing water here.
Outside bathroom.
-Just to wash your hands.
OK, thank you.
Welcome, sir.
-Thank you very much, Patrick.
(GRUNTING)
Unfortunately, the jacuzzi's already full.
As we're going to be here a day or two, I think I'd better go and introduce myself.
I swear they can understand every word I say.
Their expressions make me feel I know what they're saying too.
"Oh, no.
Not another film crew."
[ Woman ] Theorizing that one could time travel within his own lifetime,
Dr. Sam Beckett stepped into the Quantum Leap accelerator... and vanished.
He awoke to find himself trapped in the past, facing mirror images that were not his own... and driven by an unknown force to change history for the better.
His only guide on this journey is Al, an observer from his own time, who appears in the form of a hologram that only Sam can see and hear.
And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself leaping from life to life, striving to put right what once went wrong... and hoping each time that his next leap... will be the leap home.
[ Woman ] Come on, Dale.
Get movin'.
Let's go, let's go.
Hey, come on.
Wiggle your butt.
I wanna see.
Dale, come on.
Give me a hand here.
D-Dale?
Dale, come on.
Oh, sorry.
Not in my eyes!
God, I'm sorry.
Hey, what's gotten into you, huh?
I guess I can't believe where I am.
That's all.
Oh, my God!
[ Sam ] You can say that again.
[ Woman ] Oh, this is incredible.
Hey, what'd you find there?
"As for anyone who will disturb the tomb of"-
"King Ptah-Hotep. '"
"Death will swallow him."
Oh, boy.
This is definitely the tomb of Ptah-Hotep II.
This is definitely his cartouche.
[ Sam ] I don't believe this.
We're standing in the tomb of Ptah-Hotep.
I've dreamed about this my whole life.
Wait a minute.
Where's the sarcophagus?
Where's Ptah-Hotep?
He's probably in some other chamber.
No.
Somebody beat us to him.
Look at this.
Scratch marks on the floor where the sarcophagus was.
Who's gonna steal a sarcophagus?
Not even a desperate tomb robber.
Well, they do when it's solid gold.
They probably broke it up and took it out in pieces.
That's right.
That is right.
Both the Deir el Bahri and the Ineni Papyrus... both talked about a sarcophagus of solid gold, but everybody thought it was a myth.
W-W-Wait.
The Ineni Papyrus?
Yeah, yeah.
Keller and Hoskins discovered it in 1 963.
Six years from now?
1 863.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I must be confusing it with something else.
Yeah, I'd say " confusion" is the operative word.
Oh.
Oh, damn, look at this.
Oh, yes, this is incredible!
I wish that Ptah-Hotep was here.
He is.
I feel it.
Dale?
Hey, hey, Dale.
Uh-
Come on.
Why don't we give this place another five minutes to air out, huh?
I thought it smelled okay, but, uh- I don't know- maybe it's getting to you.
Let's go, okay?
Come on.
Oh, Dale, Dale.
Hey, we did it.
We found Ptah-Hotep.
I can't believe it.
All right, Dale.
Four more minutes.
[ Camel Snorting ]
Man, what an ugly horse!
What a gorgeous woman!
Ooh, I love shorts, Sam.
Look at that.
Look at that.
It's awesome.
Al?
What?
Huh?
Which tent do you think is mine?
Which tent?
Tent?
Uh, well, I'd say that one with the shaving mirror on it.
Great.
Let's see.
Your name is Dale Conway.
Uh-huh.
You're a professor of archaeology at Kansas State University, and you're here on a- on a dig-
In Egypt.
In-yeah
- Egypt.
In Egypt.
Listen to me.
You're not gonna believe this.
We just found the tomb of King Ptah-Hotep II.
It's incredible!
Go inside.
Go inside.
Uh-
Incredible!
Well, Ziggy says it's unbelievable, because this has never been reported.
Then I didn't just forget about it?
Well, no.
As of 1 999, it's never even been discovered, ever.
Anyway, you're here on an expedition... with one Ginny Will.
Uh, she's a professor of Egyptology at-
Ginny Will from Brown University?
Yeah.
That Ginny Will?
Oh, my- How did y-
She's famous.
I mean, I've read all of her papers.
She's brilliant.
Yeah.
Okay.
Here it comes.
She and Conway disappeared on a dig in 1 957- Wait a second.
that's this dig- and they were swallowed up without a trace.
"As for anyone who will disturb the tomb of King Ptah-Hotep, death will swallow him."
That was one of the inscriptions we found in the tomb.
[ Al ] I'd say he's a man ofhis word.
No.
No.
There are thousands of inscriptions like that in thousands of tombs.
It's just put there to scare the tomb robbers off.
Okay, I'm scared.
Let's go.
No.
Wait.
This is bigger than King Tut.
We can't walk away from this now.
I did a thesis on this guy.
This is a chance of a lifetime.
Well, so's inventing a time machine, but, you know, quit while you're ahead.
All right.
Look, tell me exactly when they disappear.
How much time do we have?
Sometime between now and March 1 5.
That's when the authorities become alarmed, then they start hunting for you.
Well, the way to find out what happened is to stick around.
Oh, sure.
Yeah.
And get swallowed up.
Dale?
Dale, time's up.
You ready?
Yeah.
Uh, I'm sorry.
I'm almost-
I just was practicing what I was gonna say to the press about the tomb and the curse.
Yeah, well, I can just see the headlines now.
They are going to love this.
Yeah, I can see 'em too.
"Genius Has Death Wish.
Nobel Prize Winner is Really a Knucklehead."
Maybe they'll give us enough money for a proper dig.
Oh, and speaking of which-
- Hey, what happened toJerry Lee?
- Uh
- Oh, look at this.
I guess he flew the coop.
Oh, a little birdie?
Oh, that's too bad.
- [ Screams ]
- All right, all right.
Okay.
[ Hisses ] [ Sam ] Don't move.
Don't move.
Careful, Sam.
[ Man ] Effendi, effendi.!
Everything okay?
What happened?
What's the matter?
Why did you scream?
- Why did you scream?
- This is kind of hinky, Sam.
There was a-a cobra here, and it ate Mr. Conway's canary.
The same thing happened to Howard Carter.
It's gone.
It's gone.
He's the guy that discovered the tomb of- King Tut.
That's right.
Mm-hmm.
Conway, effendi, we must leave this place.
It's evil.
I told them about the curse.
No, wait a second.
Wait a second.
There is no curse, okay?
This is all just a coincidence.
Nothing else bad is gonna happen.
[ Vehicle Approaching ]
[ Horn Honking ]
- [ Horn Honking ] - [ Man ] Hello.!
Anybody home?
Ah!
Dr. Will, Dr. Conway, how nice to see you.
[ Ginny ] Dr. Razul.
I see that you changed the location of your campsite.
Imagine my surprise when I found that out- how do you say- the- the- the hard way?
Uh, well, yes, it wasn't really a big move, and we started to run out of time and money, and it was such a long trip back to Luxor, and, well, frankly-
You didn't want to go back and waste your time... filling out endless mountains of paperwork.
Yeah.
I quite agree.
It's frightfully annoying.
Sam, Ziggy says this must be Mustafa el Razul.
He's head of the Department of Antiquities at the Luxor Museum.
They're partners in the dig.
It was with the greatest good fortune... that I saw the smoke this morning, and I decided to follow it.
[ Chuckling ]
It's taken me all day to find you, and now it appears you have found something too.
Ptah-Hotep.
The II.
Is it possible?
Yeah, but it seems that somebody beat us here by about 3,000 years.
[ Scoffs ] Tomb robbers!
They are the bane of our existence!
But Dale thinks he's still here.
And why is that?
I don't know.
I just, uh, got a feeling about it.
Yes.
Let's hope that you are right.
I, uh
- I would like to take a look, with your permission?
Oh, certainly.
We were just going back down.
[ Sam ] Now, if you'll look over here, I think you'll see what I was talking about.
[ Razul ] Mm-hmm.
As you can see, all things point to this being 1 8th Dynasty.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, I tend to agree.
You wouldn't happen to have a better light, would you?
Oh, of course.
Gamal?
[ Men Speaking In Foreign Language ]
[ Al ] Sam?
Sam.!
[ Men Arguing ]
Sam, I don't like it here.
Why don't you go upstairs?
Uh, good idea.
I'll meet you topside.
[ Razul ] Ah.
"Let both record the pureness of my heart. '"
And for a good time, call Nefertiti.
[ Razul Laughing ]
Over here is what we told you about.
Ah, yes. " As for anyone who will disturb... the tomb of King Ptah-Hotep, death will"-
[ Man Screaming ]
[ Al ] Over here, Sam.
In the supply tent.
Damn insects!
Holy terrors, one and all!
He's dead.
Oh, my God.
Allah be merciful.
Sam, it's the curse.
Sam, I'm telling you.
It's the curse of Ptah-Hotep.
It's not the curse.
[ Chuckling ]
Dr. Conway, my dear friend, you are a student of Egypt, but you're not one of its sons.
And until you have heard what I have heard and seen what I have seen,
I would not expect you to believe that such a thing as a curse could be true, but it is.
3 500-year-old dead men don't just get up and walk around.
Not him, my dear boy.
His ka.
That's his spirit body.
I know what it is.
Of course you do, but it could still be standing guard in his tomb, and it's now protecting him.
That would mean that Ptah-Hotep's body is still nearby.
Yes, yes, yes.
Perhaps you are right.
Legend has it that Ptah-Hotep had a diamond scarab... the size of a cow's eye... called the Heart of Ptah-Hotep.
Supposedly he used it to work magic.
Right.
And with it he would one day walk again on earth.
[ Al ] He's already doing it.
Hey, wait a minute.
Ali is dead.
Look, I know that we're on to something amazing here, but I really think that before we do anything, we ought to take care of Ali first.
You're right.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I-
I guess the first thing to do would be to notify his relatives.
It will be my honor to convey his body back to his family.
Thanks.
[ Grunting ]
All right.
You're, uh-You're all set.
I will return as soon as I can.
We'll be here.
[ Engine Starts ]
[ Engine Cranking ]
[ Engine Backfires ]
[ Sighs ]
One of your steering rods is bent.
Damn!
Ptah-Hotep strikes again.
If anybody can fix it, Gamal can.
He is a whiz at this stuff.
Yes, yes, I could fix it, but it will take some time.
As Allah wills.
You know, Sam, did I ever tell you that one time I dated an Egyptian girl?
Mm-hmm.
She thought she was the reincarnation of Cleopatra.
Uh-huh.
But, boy, she had a nice asp.
I- Mmm!
Al, if you can't be helpful, why don't you leave, okay?
Helpful?
I'm being helpful.
Yeah.
I'm keeping you company down here in the tomb of...
King Heebie-Jeebie.
- It's just a room.
- Yeah, it's a room.
Well, how about the canary?
How about Ali?
How about the car?
Those were just coincidences, I suppose?
That's right.
Yeah?
Unless- Unless what?
[ Clears Throat ] They were all planned.
What are you telling me?
You think that Ali was murdered?
Well, a lot of people would do it for a room full of treasure, and that would explain how come everybody disappeared.
They were all murdered!
By whom?
Well, somebody- somebody that got in here and looted the place... and tried to sell it on the black market, or else they used this place as their private piggy bank.
Ziggy says there's a history of tomb robbers that used to do that.
So who's been acting the fishiest lately?
Oh.
Nobody, really.
I mean, Gamal, earlier, when we came down here, he had that little bit of an argument... with Ali about who would get the light, but that wasn't-
Well, that's it.
That's perfect.
He set up the scorpions.
- And I'll bet he invented that whole thing about the steering rod on the car breaking too.
- No.
You didn't see that happen.
No, I didn't see it happen.
But you were there.
You heard the big clunk.
You can find scorpions.
They live around here.
No, no, no.
That's just a coincidence, okay?
Yeah, well, if I were you, I would sleep with my eyes open tonight.
Thank you.
All I'm saying is this place... gives me the willies big time, and I think you should get the hell outta here.
Look, I know this place bothers you, but if you would just help me find... the real burial chamber, you could leave.
I'm a hologram.
I'm not a vampire bat.
Huh?
I can't see in the dark.
If I walk through a wall... or I walk into a dark room, all I see is black.
That's it!
And I'm sure as hell not gonna bump into anything.
Yeah, all right.
Okay.
Oh, great.
What?
Now Ziggy's saying we can't do a spatial comparison search because some chip is acting up.
So, I guess, for the time being, I'm more or less-
Useless.
[ Stammering ] Useless.
I'm sort of suffering from some downtime.
That's all.
[ Sam ] Let me ask you this question.
You're a pharaoh, right?
And you wanna hide this secret entrance.
Where do you hide it?
[ Chuckles ]
You know, there are legends about Egyptian magic... that say that, uh, if you recite the proper incantation... or inscription, you can make invisible objects appear.
No incantations.
I was just kind of thinking everything through out loud.
Yeah.
Look, dinner's ready.
Not hungry.
Thanks though.
Dale.
- Mmm?
- We gotta make nice-nice with the company.
The museum is footing half our bills.
- Okay, I'm-I'm coming up.
- Okay.
Okay, well, in the meantime,
I'm gonna go back and see if Ziggy can dig up some more on your disappearance.
Uh, h-happy hunting.
5,500 years ago,
other men and women... sat around campfires near here,
waiting to bury their great pharaoh.
And now- [ Chuckles ]
And now they're like the grains of sand around us.
It makes one wonder what all our efforts are about.
When I was a kid,
I couldn't believe that there was anything as old as the pyramids.
And all the pharaohs with them.
I mean, reading about 'em and studying about 'em-
I mean, it was- To me, it was very cool.
It's kind of like leaping back in time, you know?
Ajourney to the other side.
Uh, speaking of journeys, how's the car?
One, maybe two more hours.
Mm-hmm.
I will be on my way tomorrow.
[ Camels Snorting ]
They must've smelled something in the wind.
Sam, Ziggy's got a new theory on why everyone disappeared here.
Apparently there's a major sandstorm moving into this area sometime tomorrow, and it's gonna leave everything buried under 50 feet of sand dunes.
So I think you better think about scramming outta here.
Does anyone else feel like there's maybe a sandstorm coming?
No.
It's just the breeze, like every night.
Well, it is.
Now, come on.
Let's talk.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Um-
I'll be right back, okay?
Excuse me.
[ Chattering ]
Al, we can't leave now.
This is a major, major discovery!
This is gonna be a major, major catastrophe.
What are you being so stubborn about this one for?
It's crazy.
Ptah-Hotep was never found.
We can't lose him now.
Well, that's no problem.
Ziggy'll locate it... right after we get this chip business straightened out.
And then, in 1 999, you can- Uh-oh.
I knew it, I knew it.
"Uh-oh," what?
Well, there's a 99.8% chance that Ptah-Hotep's tomb... is gonna be destroyed when they build the Aswân Dam in the '60s.
Okay, so, see, I gotta stay.
Look, I promise you, in the morning, we'll leave with Razul.
But until then, I gotta do everything I possibly can to find Ptah-Hotep.
[ Ginny ] You going back down?
Every minute counts.
All right.
I'll be there in a bit.
I just wanna write up my notes first.
Yeah, okay.
I'll yell if I find anything.
Yeah, you better.
Okay.
I don't know, Al.
Maybe- Maybe I'm overthinking this whole thing.
And this just occurred to you?
[ Sighs ]
I mean, what if the door were hidden in plain sight?
Uh
- Oh.
That'd be like that Edgar Allan Poe story, "The Purloined Letter."
Uh, yeah, whatever.
I mean, what- what if the answer were just-
What if the answer was staring us in the face?
When a pharaoh died, his ka was said to inhabit the burial chamber.
The Egyptians would carve a false door or paint them... on the walls of a nearby chapel or upper chamber... through which the ka could pass to gain access... to the grave offerings of food and drink.
Now, what if this time... the false door was the real door?
[ Al ] Sam, I don't think- You better not-
I wouldn't go in there, Sam.
Sam, are you all right?
Sam?
Unbelievable!
[ Blowing ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Foreign Language ]
Thejack must have slipped.
Gamal?
Ptah-Hotep.
Ptah-Hotep.
Well, at least we know that Gamal isn't the killer.
I-I just heard this thud.
I-
I had no idea.
I was writing my notes in my tent-
I will be very glad to leave this place in the morning.
You will be if Lucrezia Borgia here will let you live that long.
- Al.
- Sam,
I knew it was her all along.
"Al" what?
Or him.
I'll be very glad to help you with the car.
No, no, no, no, no.
I should've been the one under it in the first place.
I will take care of it, thank you.
You'll take care of it the way you took care of Gamal.
I'll bet you pushed the car off the jack.
He did it, Sam.
I can tell from his eyes.
God, this- this is so crazy.
This is just too much!
Of course, if I were the killer,
I might pretend to be really upset just to throw everybody off, in which case, it's her.
Stop it.
What are you talking about?
Ali and Gamal are dead.
They're dead!
Don't you get it?
Nothing is gonna bring 'em back!
Look, I know how you feel.
I feel
- I feel terrible too, but you can't blame yourself.
None of us can blame ourselves, all right?
It was an accident.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oops!
It was an accident.
I accidentally killed everybody.
Oh-ho!
Now I'm stuck with this secret load of secret treasure.
Oh, I'm gonna have to give up my measly poor-paying professorship... and go somewhere and live a life of peace and luxury somewhere else.
[ Chuckles ]
Give her an Oscar, and let's get the hell outta here.
Come on.
I wanna show you something.
Uh, n
- No, Sam.
Come on.
[ Ginny ] Oh, it's incomprehensible.
Not even Tutankhamen or his glory had anything like this.
[ Sam ] The wealth of a kingdom buried with their god.
It would take me a million years to earn this much money.
[ Chuckles ]
But we're gonna share this with the rest of the world, aren't we?
- Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
- It will be the crown jewel of Egypt.
- Let's open it.
- What?
Yeah, come on.
Come on.
W-We've got the room.
Let's do it.
- All right.
Let's do it.
- Yeah!
I'll get the block and tackle.
I understand your enthusiasm, my friend, but we must take our time and do this properly.
Photographs mapping the exact location of the artifacts, not to mention contacting the museum and the government.
I don't have the time.
Look, don't you see, when we go back with Ali and Gamal, there are gonna be a lot of questions, a lot of delays.
And when the word gets out... to the press about what we've found here-
I mean, they're gonna be breathing down our necks.
We're gonna be swamped.
So I would like it if, just for the moment,
we kept this to ourselves, private.
My heart hears you.
Some moments are not meant to be public.
I'll get my camera.
Yeah.
- Ptah-Hotep intact.!
- [ Chuckles ]
Incredible!
You can say that again.
Sam, did I tell you that... this place gives me the heebie-jeebies?
- Only about a million times.
- Yeah, well, now you know.
Yeah, well, if you don't wanna be here, you can go, you know?
Yeah, well, no.
I wanna, you know, watch your back, and-
Anyway, I wouldn't wanna miss a one-of-a-kind of any kind.
- Yeah, well, suit yourself.
- [ Ginny ] Dale, I got another crowbar.
Great.
How we doing?
Uh,just about ready.
Good, good, good.
The breeze is picking up a little.
Perhaps a sandstorm is approaching after all.
Yeah, uh, Sam, Ziggy says the sandstorm will be here in 1 5 hours.
All right.
Now, that's it.
Draw upon 'em.
Now, I'm gonna pry open the lid, okay?
When I do, I'm gonna yell " pull."
You guys pull like crazy.
We'll see what happens.
Ready?
One, two, three, pull.!
Again.!
All right, all right.
All right.Just hold on.
Okay, ready?
One, two, three, pull!
One more time.
One, two, three, pull.!
It is magnificent!
- [ Sam ] It's incredible.!
- It's even more amazing than the sarcophagus.
- Wow.
- I gotta get my camera.
Well, so far, so good.
- [ Ginny ] Oh.!
Damn it.!
- What?
What?
I gotta go get more flashbulbs.
I'll be right back.
All right.
Well, hurry up.
We stay.
What do you say we pull out the pins?
Yes, the pins.
[ Ziggy Beeping ]
Uh-oh, Sam.
Ziggy's revising the E.T.A. for the sandstorm.
It's speeding up apparently.
It should get here in about 1 2 or 1 3 hours.
After that, it's sayonara.
[ Sam ] Yeah.
Well,just another pin or two here, and we'll be ready to open her up.
All set.
Great.
Okay, here we go.
Ready on three.
One, two, three.!
- [ Grunting ]
- Come on.
You got it.
Go.
[ Razul Laughing ]
The Heart of Ptah-Hotep.
[ Explosion ]
What on earth?
I got it.
[ Sam ] Oh, my God!
[ Al ] I bet I know what happened.
[ Sam ] Oh, no!
No, Dale!
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Ali and Gamal are in there!
It's too late, Doctor!
It's not too late!
It's too late!
This is-This is like some horrible nightmare.
I know how this started, Sam.
She started this fire... just before she came back after reloading her camera.
- I don't believe that.
- I know, my friend.
It is too much tragedy to understand.
Unless-
Unless it's the curse.
It's not the curse!
It's the curse!
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's not the curse!
Look, a spark from the fire blew over there and landed on the tent, okay?
The kerosene that was in the tent for the lanterns caught on fire.
Kaboom!
That's what happened, all right?
Okay?
Of course!
Of course!
Ziggy says the odds... against all that stuff that's happened happening as a coincidence is 40,000-to-1 .
It's not the curse.
I can't tell you- Yes, it is.!
All right.
I'll prove it to you once and for all it's not the curse.
Dale?
Dale!
Come on!
Dale, what are you doing?
All right.
Now, listen.
I'm gonna prove to you once and for all- both of you- that this is nothing more than an ordinary mummy, okay?
Now, if Ptah-Hotep's ka is still guarding this place, Oh, Dale.
what could make him angrier than someone stealing his Heart?
No, Dale-
See?
You see?
Nothing happened.
[ Clanging ]
[ Rumbling, Crackling ]
Let's get out of here.
Oh, boy.
All right.
[ Both Grunting ] [ Sam ] Too heavy.
We need a longer lever.
A really long lever.
Just take a little rest, and then try it again.
You'll get it.
[ Both Panting ]
Come here.
Give me a hand.
Come on.
[ Grunts ] No, it's no use.
I guess we're stuck here.
Sam, the thing you gotta do now is you gotta be cool.
That's the first thing you learn as a pilot... is you gotta keep a level head when those warning lights go off.
[ Pounding ] [ Yells ]
[ Razul ] Dr. Will.!
Dr. Conway.!
[ Sam ] In here.!
Hello.!
[ Pounding Continues ]
Hey, we're in here!
We're in here!
Hello.!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, we're fine!
Yes!
Can you see a way to move this block?
No!
He's not an engineer.
He doesn't know.
How long till the sandstorm?
What?
What are you talking about?
[ Sam ] How long till the sandstorm hits?
[ Ginny ] Huh?
What?
You got about 1 2 hours.
So, Mustafa, he could go to the nearest town and maybe come back just in time with help.
Dr. Razul,you have to go and get help.!
- Do you understand?
- Yes!
Yes!
I will go get help!
Don't worry!
I will get you out!
He's on his way.
Yeah.
Oh, let's hope that steering rod holds.
Yeah.
Well, Sam, uh, Ziggy says that you got plenty of air in here.
You got at least two days' worth of air.
But, of course, you'd better get out of here before then, because you'll be buried under 50 feet of sand dunes.
[ Chuckling ]
- Sorry.
- [ Sam ] Come on.
Let's, uh, see if there's a back door to this place, huh?
Yeah.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Oh, boy, I hate to say it.
But sitting here looking at these walls makes me a little claustrophobic.
It's hardly a good trait for an archaeologist, huh?
Maybe this'll take my mind off of it.
[ Chuckles ] That's-That's funny, isn't it?
A claustrophobic archaeologist.
[ Chuckles ]
She probably saw the walls closing in on her, the poor kid.
That'd be the frosting on the curse, wouldn't it?
Walls closing in?
The room getting smaller and smaller... and smaller... till you couldn't, uh, move or breathe or anything?
[ Clicks Tongue ] Uh, Sam?
[ Clears Throat ] Sam, I think I'm gonna, uh, go back... and-and get with Ziggy and see... if we can find something on tomb design there...
Okay.
or maybe something on how to get around the booby traps in here, you know.
Okay.
Yeah.
But I'll be back, Sam.
I'll be right back.
You know, you can-you can count on that.
[ Clears Throat ]
Gooshie, open the imaging chamber door.
What do you mean you can't?
What's wrong with the backups?
What's back with the wrong-up- What's wrong with the backups?
No, he-Well, he says there's kind of a gridlock with the signals through the door... that were maybe caused by that chip that malfunctioned and set off a chain reaction.
Well, I guess until they figure it out, then you're gonna be-
You're just gonna be stuck here a little while.
- Huh?
What?
- I just said, uh, at least things can't get any worse.
[ Chuckles ] Well, there's the optimist.
[ Sighs ] [ Sighs ]
You know, uh, there was a point there, and, well, it was just for a second.
What?
You're gonna hate me for saying this.
What?
I thought that you might be behind all the stuff that was happening.
Me?
Yeah, well, I know, I know.
It sounds crazy, but- [ Chuckles ] the gold, the glory.
A lot of people have done a lot more for a lot less.
Yeah.
Well, for awhile, I thought it was you.
Me?
Uh-huh.
Just for a second.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Sighs ]
- Okay, let's pretend you're Ptah-Hotep, okay?
- Mm-hmm.
And-And you really believe that you're gonna come back to life.
And you also really believe that there's a good chance... that tomb robbers are gonna break into your tomb.
So what do you do?
[ Sighs ]
You put out some bait.
Yeah, and we get the trap like the proverbial rat.
Right.
But, eventually, you wanna get outta here too, right?
Uh-huh.
So you build a back door.
We already thought of that.
Or you build it so that you can reopen the trap.
Either way, you need a key.
Probably.
Hopefully.
Maybe.
Where do you keep your keys?
I keep mine in my purse.
I keep mine in my pock-
Or, in this case,
in the mummy.
[ Ginny ] God, this is incredible.
He's far better preserved than Seti I. Or Yuya.
Yeah, well, yippee, Sam.
Find the key.
You gotta get outta here.
You know, it's odd.
There-There are no incision marks on the body.
And there are no canopic jars either for the organs.
It's like he figured he was gonna walk around again, and he wanted to keep everything with him, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But where is the key?
[ Ziggy Beeping ]
The sandstorm is coming, Sam.
We gotta move!
[ Sam ] I know it's here somewhere.
Well, Sam, that's not a key.
"May Nephthys and Isis"- "Guide my way."
Nephthys and Isis.
[ Sam ] Hold this.
Yeah.
It's moving.
Sam, the hands are opening it.
Dale,you did it.!
You did it.!
Here, let me
- Let's get outta here while it's resetting, huh?
Come on.
[ Al ] Sam.!
[ Chuckling ] Well, well, well.
[ Ziggy Beeping ]
Well, that was a quick trip.
Actually, I had every intention of going, but then I thought... perhaps things would work out a great deal better for me if I just... stayed.
I think you mean " richer," don't you?
Sam, I knew it was him all along.
That is so crass-sounding, but, yes.
So you killed Ali and Gamal.
Now you're gonna kill us.
[ Laughing ] My dear Dr. Will, I have never killed anyone in my life.
I actually thought it was either you or Dr. Conway who had dispatched with the others.
Perhaps they were just accidents after all, huh?
Which is all about to change now.
A king's ransom could let one live like a prince... for a very long time.
And with the Heart of Ptah-Hotep, well-
I think it's time we go inside, huh?
Stall him until me and Ziggy can figure something out.
Two questions, Dr. Conway.
What set off the booby trap?
And, uh, however did you get out of here?
Just stall, Sam, stall.
I haven't got anything on here yet.
Well, sometimes it's not a good idea to tempt fate twice.
But if you really want to know, we, uh, took out the Heart... and then put it back.
Thank you, Dr. Conway.
I hope you appreciate your accommodations.
[ Rumbling ]
You did it, Sam.
Great!
You did it!
You okay?
You sure?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Get this.
No matter how hard you try, you
- I mean, Dale- and Ginny- You sure you're all right?
never find the tomb of Ptah-Hotep again.
What about Razul?
Uh, I got nothin' on him.
Nothin'.
Dr. Will, Dr. Conway, I can't get the Heart back in.!
- We can't-We can't just leave him in there.
- Please, you must help me get out!
Sam, that sandstorm's gonna be here any second.
All right, all right.
Go to the back wall.
Now, this is weird.
You know that chip... that opens the imaging chamber door, it didn't fail.
Look for Nephthys and Isis.
The whole thing was caused by a new program that Ziggy just got-
[ Sighs ] from Egypt.
All right!
I've found them!
[ Sam ] Put your hands on their faces.
Yes?
And push.
It's working!
Dr. Razul!
Dr. Razul!
[ Razul Screaming ]
- We've gotta get in there.
- Don't look at me.
Dr. Razul, what is happening?
Al, go!
No, you can't get through here.
Go!
Okay.
[ Screaming Continues ]
I really don't like this.
He's killing him.
Ptah-Hotep is killing him.
What?
[ Screaming Stops ] [ Rumbling ]
Better get outta here, Sam.!
[ Rumbling Continues ]
We gotta go.
Come on.
Come on!
No, what are you doing?
What about Razul?
He's dead.
Go.
Ptah-Hotep killed him.
Go!
Go!
Go!
So, what did the cop say?
Probably said you should get yourself a day job.
[ Audience Chuckling ]
[ Chuckling ] Hey, buddy, what did you do?
Escape from a home for the comedically stunted... or just the hopelessly stupid, huh?
* [ Rim Shot ]
Stay with me, will ya, Davey?
Uh, yeah.
Well, this cop said that-
He was hauling you in.
He was hauling me in.
And-And I was- Naked.
Naked.
And then-
Hiding in the bushes.
Hiding
- Hiding in the bushes.
And, uh, well- And you were holding this sheep, and then you said-
Oh, boy?
* [ Rim Shot ]
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Woody's a married man, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, what a lucky guy.
Indeed, he is.
There's nothing like wedded bliss.
Plus, he's got that wedding ring.
Now, that is a real babe magnet.
Please, it's an old wives' tale.
Not so.
Yeah?
Oh, it's been scientifically proven that women are more attracted to married men.
The whole notion is ridiculous.
Look, I'll...
I'll prove it to you.
You see those two attractive young females over there?
I'll go over and hit on them relentlessly, all the while displaying my wedding ring.
See how long it takes them to give me the cold shoulder.
Hi.
You two ladies need some company?
Oh, sure, I'm married, but, uh, you know, I'm not dead.
(laughing)

Oh, great.
(laughing) Sign here, please.
Hey, fellas, listen up, you know how
I've been trying to hustle up more business for the bar?
Well, I think this baby's just the ticket.
Cheers is now the proud owner of a blood pressure tester.
(laughing)
That's... that's great, Sammy.
I think we ought to get some velvet ropes outside to handle the lines.
No, no, come on, will you?
Lighten up here, this could be fun.
What the hell is this?
They sent me a slot machine.
Well, I lived kind of a sheltered girlhood, but offhand,
I'd say this looks like a Gametime model 36X with remodelled sprockets, triple-action tumblers.
"The Big Boy".
(Rebecca sighs)
A slot machine.
(gasps)
I've never played one of these, but I've always wanted to.
Hey, hey, come on, no, don't... don't do that, please, it's illegal.
This is the last thing this bar needs.
I'm gonna call and tell them to take it back.
It's just as well, Rebecca.
These are the devil's own machines.
They systematically rob you of your cash and your dignity, one nickel at a time.
Allow me to demonstrate.
Oh, hey, come on, Frasier, don't do that.
No, relax, Sam.
This is merely for educational purposes.
Good-bye, nickel.
(coin clanging)
(bell ringing, coins clanging)
(chortling)
Free money!
The doctor is hot!
(laughing)
Excuse me, sir.
I represent a market research company.
We're doing a survey.
Oh, I'm really not interested.
Thanks.
Okay.
How about you, sir?
Okay.
We're looking for volunteers to taste several brands of beer.
Uh, excuse me, Paul, we were having a conversation here.
You were saying?
Uh, uh, well, if you're available, just come to this address at 2:00 this afternoon.
2:00, sure.
Hey, listen, uh, uh, what exactly do I do?
Well, you'll be in a room with several other volunteers, and you'll be tasting several varieties of beer.
We'll pay you for your time.
Excuse me, sir.
This is gonna sound like an odd question, but... by any chance, were you born in a manger?
You've been selected to take part in this study due to your ages and your drinking preferences.
Norm, there seems to be a typo here on your average beer intake.
Wow.
Now, gentlemen,
I'd like you to each take a sip from sample A and give me your impressions.
Ray, what do you think?
Would you serve this beer in your home?
Yeah, sure.
And Chuck?
Very tasty, uh...
Good after-taste, too.
And Norm.
I don't know.
Didn't you just drink some?
Yeah, but it wasn't in my mouth long enough to really taste it.
Hold it in your mouth a little longer.
Try savouring it for a second, and then swallow it.
This is great.
Wow, does anyone else know about this savouring thing?
Now try to describe the taste.
Ah... well, it's kind of, um, sweet, but, uh, kind of tangy, too.
You know what I mean?
Yeah... very observant.
Yeah.
What about sample B?
It's kind of tart.
Actually, I thought it was kind of sweet.
NORM:
No, no, fellas.
It's really...
it's... it's more of a smoky thing.
Right again.
Yeah.
That's the new mash that they're using.
You're amazing, Norm.
What about, uh, sample C?
Let's see.
Now, this one misses for me, okay?
Mm-hmm.
It's like the carbonation is... is fighting the flavour, and the flavour is losing.
This is really getting too easy for me.
You want to challenge me a bit here?
Okay.
Let's try samples
D through V.
Oh, D through V.
Now, hang on a second.
I may need to cleanse my palate.
Do you have any pizza?
Oh, Carla, you're not supposed to be playing that- it's illegal.
So is watering drinks.
Good luck to you.
(bell ringing, coins clanging)
(whooping)
Come to mama.
(sighs):
Come on, come on, come on.
Darn it, this machine hates me!
Say, uh, Rebecca, uh, can I give it a try?
Go ahead, Paul.
It's obviously empty.
(bell ringing, coins clanging)
Hey, hey.
Wow.
Nine nickels.
Hey, I wonder, if those chicks over there saw me win, huh?
Yeah, Paul.
I'm sure the lack of that 45 cents is what kept you out of that ménage.
Come on... come on.
Be there, be there.
Damn!
What is wrong with this machine?
Frasier won, Paul won, Carla won.
Maybe it just hates women.
Afternoon, everybody.
CROWD:
Norm!
What's the story, Norm?
Boy meets beer.
Boy drinks beer.
Boy gets another beer.
In this performance, the role of the boy will be played by Norm Peterson.
Sammy, I want you to pour a round for the house and put it on my tab.
Ooh.
Oh!
Oh, thank you.
What's the occasion there, big guy?
Well, I think I got a job.
Hey, all right, Normie.
CLIFF:
Stand back, I'll take care of this.
All right, mister, I don't know what pod you crawled out of... but you're not welcome in our world.
Now, go in peace and give us our Normie back.
Seriously, remember that beer tasting survey group?
Turns out they value my opinion so much, they want me to try out at the brewery.
CLIFF:
All right.
Who'd have thought I have a knack for something?
Okay, now, listen up, you.
This is my last nickel.
Now, I'm not asking for a lot.
I-I just want you to hit, just once.
Please... for me.
(crying)
Why do you hate me?
Becs.
What?
Come here.
What do you want?
(whispering):
You are acting crazy.
You're standing there talking to a machine, pretending like it cares who's feeding it nickels.
It doesn't have anything against you personally.
You're right.
Thank you.
And why are you whispering?
I don't want it to hear me talking to you.
(machines humming)
Pardon me, uh, are you Mike?
Hey, you must be the new guy, Norm?
Yeah, hi.
Yeah, I'll be your supervisor.
Oh, great.
I was, uh, looking over your sample comments, and, uh, well, must say they're very impressive.
Thank you.
Uh, now, remember, this is just a trial, but I think you're gonna do great.
Thanks, sir.
Uh, the job's very simple.
You'll drink random samples of beer off the line and give us your opinion.
That's it.
(both chuckling)
Well, uh... you ready to see the brewery, Norm?
Oh, I've been ready for 43 years, sir.
(machines humming)
You'll be sampling beer and submitting your comments to the master brewer who will evaluate them, and in turn, he'll...
Are you... are you crying, Norm?
Nah, just got something in my eye there.
I'll get you a Kleenex.

NORM:
Hey, Mike.
Look, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna knock off for lunch, okay?
Yeah, sure.
You had a great first week, Norm.
(laughs):
You don't have to tell me, sir.
It was the happiest week of my life.
Here you go, Norm.
Huh?
What's this?
It's your pay-check.
Oh, no, sir, I couldn't.
No, no, absolutely not, not for this.
Go ahead, take it!
Really?
You've earned it.
You know, you were right about that timer being off on number three tank.
That's, uh...
that's something our computer should have picked up a long time ago.
Well, sir, a computer can't love.
As far as I'm concerned, the job is yours.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
There's-There's just one more thing.
Yeah?
It's, uh... it's mostly a formality...
Yeah.
But, uh, well, you have to meet with Mr. Hoffmeyer, the president of the brewery.
Now, if Hoffmeyer likes you, well, you're all set.
What kind of guy is he?
Oh, he's... a bit of a tough cookie, but, uh, if you take your work seriously, you'll do just fine.
Okay.
Well, I'd be glad to meet the guy.
Good.
Listen, if you don't mind right now,
I've been tasting beer all morning, okay?
So, I'm just gonna take a break, change my clothes and go over to Cheers and hoist a few.
(laughs):
You're, uh...
You're kidding, right?
Yeah.
These clothes will be fine.
Come on.
Big money.
Come on.
Big money.
Oh, show me I'm not a loser.
Can't believe you're still playing this thing.
Sam, I have pulled that handle 578 times, and this machine has given me nothing.
Well, may... maybe it's broken.
Let me try it here.
Give me that.
(coins clinking, bell dinging)
No.
No.
It's you, all right.
Come on.
Big money.
I hate to see her beating herself up like that.
Yeah, I agree.
If there was just some way that she could win, even once.
It might serve to break her fatalism and bolster her self-esteem.
Plus, maybe then I'd get a shot, 'cause I am hot, hot, hot!
Well, there must be some way we can fix that machine so you can win just one time.
Now you're good at this stuff, Carla.
Can't you rig it?
Why should I?
Well, because she'd feel better about herself, you know, maybe even feel happy.
No, really.
Why should I?
Because there's a $20 bill in it for you.
Deal.
(chuckles)
I'd have done it for ten.
No wonder you're going out of business.
Afternoon, everybody.
ALL:
Norm!
A little busman's holiday, Norm?
No.
None of those fancy drinks for me, Sammy.
Just give me a beer.
See this, boys?
Huh?
An actual pay-check.
Oh.
Tell you what, Sammy.
Earning a salary does something for a guy's self-esteem.
For the first time in years,
I'm actually making an honest living.
Oh, look at that.
This says Norm Peterman.
That's 'cause Norm Peterson is still drawing unemployment, thank you.
Well, Norm, I must say I've never seen you look happier or-or more fulfilled.
NORM:
Well, thanks, Fras.
I still don't have the job officially yet.
I got to meet the president of the brewery.
But I tell you what
- I feel like I've found my calling.
Yeah, that's a wonderful feeling, isn't it?
Yeah.
You know, I remember the first day I decided to go into the healing arts.
Yeah, just the thought of helping my fellow man... it gave me a sense of purpose, a mission in life.
(rhythmic beeping)
Oh.
Oh, surprise, surprise!
Mrs. Davis.
"I had a bad childhood."
Join the club, sister!
I'm all out of nickels.
Does anybody have a nickel?
Hey, hey, where's that, uh, tip jar of Carla's?
No.
REBECCA:
Well, I would pay her back.
Going a little bit overboard here, aren't you?
After all, it's just a silly little machine.
It's not a silly machine, Norman.
It is...
It is a metaphor for life.
It is.
Everybody gets to pull the handle, and sometimes they win, and sometimes they lose.
But I always lose.
I pull the handle, and I get cherry, lemon,
(voice breaking):
Bell!
Rebecca, has it ever occurred to you that maybe the reason you always lose is because you think you're going to lose?
Oh, don't give me that crap!
I tried that positive thinking stuff, and I knew it wouldn't work, and sure enough, it didn't!
You are over-analysing things.
You got to live in the moment.
Take life as it comes, okay?
You start thinking too much, everything falls apart.
Norm, how do you not think too much?
You're-You're getting ready for the biggest interview of your life!
Yeah.
If I were you, I would be a nervous wreck.
You know, I had a shot at my dream job.
Yeah?
And I-I did really, really well.
And then it came time for me to meet the big boss, and I choked.
I went in, and-and I complimented him, and then I realized, "Oh, God, I'm kissing up."
So I took back the compliment, and then it looked like I was insulting him.
So then I started telling jokes, and they were really bad.
And then...
And-And then, the next thing I knew,
I was singing, "Knick knack paddy whack" song.
And I was just singing and singing at the top of my lungs.
And I just kept burying myself deeper and deeper.
And I lost my dream job.
And when I walked out of that House of Pancakes, I felt two inches tall.
Well, Rebecca, that's about the most depressing thing
I've ever heard in my life.
Hey, don't...
Norm, don't listen to me.
It'll just bring you down.
Yeah.
And you know what?
I've been a jinx my entire life, but that's me.
That isn't you.
You're gonna do great.
Thanks.
Good luck.
Well, thanks a lot, Rebecca.
And for what it's worth,
I don't think you're a jinx, all right?
(quietly):
Thanks.
(laughs)
Ah, Norm.
Mr. Hoffmeyer's on his way.
Uh, now remember, this is just a formality.
He's heard all kinds of good things about you, and, well, I'm sure that as soon as he meets you, uh, you'll be a permanent part of this brewery.
You seem a little nervous.
Are you, Norm?
No.
No.
MIKE:
Oh, Mr. Hoffmeyer,
I'd like you to meet our star taster, Norm.
Norm, Mr. Hoffmeyer.
Norm, I hear you're doing excellent work for us.
Thank you very much, sir.
(sighs)
Nice pants.
(chuckles)
I can't believe I just said that.
Look, I'm not trying to kiss up, sir.
I take back what I said about those pants, okay?
Not that they're not nice pants.
I mean, of course they are.
They're-They're-They're great pants, you know.
I just don't want you to think that all I'm doing is looking at your pants.
I'm also looking at your face, sir, and-and your shirt, your tie, all of which are lovely.
Like a manly kind of lovely.
You know what I mean?
Good Lord, I'm not making much sense, am I, sir?
Let me just start all over again.
Hello.
My name is Norm Pants.
Ooh!
Yay.
That didn't come out right, either, did it?
(laughs):
I'm gonna laugh about that one tonight, sir.
And I'm sure you will, too, when you take those pants off tonight.
Not that I'm thinking about you taking your pants off, sir!
Nothing could be further from the truth!
I mean, well, now, don't get me wrong.
You know, it's not like I would be grossed out if you took your pants off.
Go ahead, run around naked for all I care!
After all, you'll do whatever you want to do.
You're Mr. Hoffmeyer, for crying out loud!
Oh, come on, lighten up, will you?
!
Why are you such a sourpuss?
Come on.
What's it going to take to put a smile on that face, huh?
♪ With a knick knack paddy whack, give a dog a bone ♪
♪ This old man came rolling home!
♪
Sorry about the job there, Norm.
Oh, don't worry about it, Cliff.
What are you going to do?
I had my dream job for a week, and I lost it.
But you've got to look on the...
on the bright side, you know.
I mean, somebody could walk up to me tomorrow, tap me on the shoulder, say,
"Hey, we want you to sample various types of pretzels."
You know?
Or-Or-Or pizza.
Could happen.
Maybe, big guy.
Well, I did it.
I rigged the machine.
The next person who pulls that handle is going to be up to their knees in nickels.
All right, now, don't you feel good?
I mean, doesn't it make you feel happy to know you did something for a fellow human being?
Isn't that what life's really all about?
You don't have my 20 bucks, do you, Sam?
It's been kind of a slow week, honey.
I...
Now, wai-wai-wait.
REBECCA:
Norm.
I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am about this afternoon.
Rebecca, for the hundredth time, please relax.
It wasn't your fault.
I did it myself.
I choked under pressure.
Well, I felt so guilty that I went out and got us this quart of ice cream.
Hmm.
Mmm.
(laughs)
This is what we losers do, Norm.
We just drown our sorrows in ice cream.
But you know what?
Huh?
At least we're not alone.
We have each other.
You're not going to kiss me again, are you?
'Cause I still have to drive home.
Oh!
Hey, look at that.
These are nickels, I guess, huh?
Say, why don't you, uh, play the slot machine one more time?
Because I will lose.
Where have you been all week?
No.
You know, I feel good about this.
Why-Why-Why don't you give it one more shot?
No.
Oh, come on!
What's it gonna take for you to understand that I will never win?
All right, fine, fine.
Come on.
Everybody step up while
Lady Luck thumbs her nose at Rebecca Howe.
(bell rings)
I got my nickel back.
I thought that thing was supposed to pay off.
It's been paying off all week.
I guess it's empty.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry?
This has never happened to me before.
I broke even.
I've never broken even before.
I'm not a loser.
I'm a break-evener.
Norm is a loser.
See him eating his ice cream?
You know what this means?
It means that my life isn't so terrible.
It's...
It's so-so!
(Rebecca laughs)
Isn't this great?
!
Hey, guys, did Rebecca call me a loser?
I'm afraid so, Norm.
Good.
I thought she said, "Leave me some."
- Your help means a lot to us, Bruce.
- What you do means a lot to this city.
I wish we could do more.
Lately, things haven't been going well.
Thanks.
What do you mean?
I can't prove it, but I'm positive people are disappearing:
Transients, regulars old faces I miss seeing.
Then a month ago, a volunteer, Dan Riley, disappeared.
Something's very wrong.
- You've talked to the police?
- Yes, but the police are busy.
And homeless people disappearing is not big news.
Hey, buddy, you looking for a job?
Maybe.
What kind of job?
You'll like it.
It's long-term employment.
Hey, Riley.
Oh, boy.
Hey, stranger.
You okay?
I think so.
Where am I?
Well, opinions differ, but we all agree.
It ain't Miami.
Don't mind him.
Every chain gang has a comedian.
I'm Dan Riley, and he's Salvo Smith.
So, what's your name, pal?
I don't know.
What is this?
If it's moving, it's a rat.
If not, it's a cooked rat.
Why aren't these lowlifes working?
They have to eat, sir.
I have to eat.
They have to work.
From now on, they'll bring me twice the gold ore.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
We recruited some new men.
You bums better start busting butt or you'll all end up like him.
No!
Please!
I ain't done nothing!
No!
Please!
Please!
Please!
Please!
Now get to work, or you'll all roast.
Rise and shine.
It's a beautiful d...
That's odd.
Only vampires loathe daylight more than Batman.
I wonder what's keeping him.
How you holding up?
Okay, I guess.
Remember anything yet?
I'm beginning to wonder if I ever will.
You can't give up hope.
Down here it's all we've got to hang on to.
I guess you're right.
So, what brought you here?
I was one of Gotham City's unemployed.
Now I got a job.
Lucky me.
I was a steamfitter at the Gotham Navy Yard.
I did volunteer work at the Dock Street Rescue Mission.
One night, three guys jumped me.
I wound up here.
My family must be going out of their minds.
Rescue Mission.
Cave-in!
Are you okay?
Where's Salvo?
I'm over here, taking five.
Hang on.
We'll get you out.
Take your time.
It's the first break I've had all day.
Does this happen often?
Too often.
No, I'm sorry, sir.
Mr. Wayne was called out of town.
If you call back on Friday...
The Studebaker's gone.
I'd better activate the tracking device.
The Bowery.
Dock Street Rescue Mission.
I've never seen such lazy scum.
Now that was real funny.
Throw him in the box!
You can't.
It'll kill him.
That's the idea.
Now do it!
I got him!
Come on!
We'll see how they like the oven.
You really cleaned their clocks.
You did pretty good yourself.
Maybe you used to be some kind of fighter.
I don't know.
I just don't know.
My son, he's gonna be 6 on April 7.
Or 7 on April 6.
What's it matter?
I'll never see him again.
Hang on, Riley.
We'll make it.
Remember what you told me?
You can't lose hope.
I can't take it anymore!
I lost my family!
My family!
My family!
My family!
My family!
Riley, you've got to pull it together.
We're getting out of here.
Yeah, right.
You're the one who's losing it.
Stop him!
Stop him, or you'll all rot in the mines!
There he is.
We got him now.
He's gone into Box Canyon.
There's no way out.
Look!
Up there!
- This must be the place.
Bring us down.
- Negative.
But Master Bruce is down here.
We have to land.
Impossible.
Area too confined.
Land, you bucket of bolts.
Your funeral.
Oh, dear.
Get us down!
Caution.
Rocks.
Son of a gun.
Watch your step.
I claim this land for Spain.
Master Bruce.
Hurry up with that gravy!
If those fools let that prisoner escape, I'll eat them alive.
A bat!
A giant bat!
Horrible!
What are you babbling about?
What bat?
Right here.
There it is!
Batman!
Shoot him!
After him, you fools!
After him!
$ 1000 to the man who bags that bat.
There he is!
Split up and fan out.
Kill the lights!
We'll find out if this bat can see in the dark.
Look out!
I think he went this way.
Pete, where are...?
Help!
Help!
Hodges, Kirk, Paur!
Are you okay?
Not exactly.
Stop him!
No!
Leave me alone!
We've got to get out of here.
Stop.
We'll be killed.
Stop, and we will be.
Don't let me drown!
When you taste the prison food, you'll wish I had.
You can stay at our place until you get back on your feet.
Thanks, Riley.
Maybe this time, we can find some work that pays.
It'll be tight, but you're welcome too.
Thanks, but I...
Are we ready, Master Bruce?
Master Bruce?
Bruce Wayne.
WayneTech Enterprises.
If you'd like a job, I can probably help.
Hit me, Riley.
Hit you?
Why?
Maybe I'll lose my memory and wake up a millionaire too.
[ENGLISH]
TV ANNOUNCER:
Another outbreak of violence...
The perpetrator is believed to be a mutant.
FOSTER FATHER:
She's one of them, Martha.
FOSTER MOTHER:
How could you register her with that Mutant Control Agency?
FOSTER FATHER:
Just hope the neighbors never find out our beautiful Jubilee is a mutant.
SENTINEL:
Initiate capture.
Release her!
Storm, Mistress of the Elements commands you.
Gambit'll help you.
-Who are you?
-Cyclops.
Jean, I knew the existence of the X-Men would be revealed to the public one day, but not like this.
GAMBIT:
There you are, Wolverine!
JUBILEE:
What is this weird place?
(LAUGHING)
Professor Xavier is our leader and he has named us the X-Men.
Jubilee.
She's gone.
XAVIER:
That ID photograph is from the Mutant Control Agency registration files.
Storm will take three X-Men in with her.
Wolverine and Beast and Morph.
CYCLOPS:
I just wish I knew what was happening in there.
You look nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.
I just wish I knew what was happening in there.
If that was me in there, you wouldn't have to worry.
We got trouble.
(EXCLAIMS)
(GUNS COCKING)
WOLVERINE:
Hold up!
(SNIFFING)
I smell gun oil.
Guards!
They're on to us!
And I used to wonder how she acquired her nom de guerre!
Keep them away from the building.
Remember, no humans are to be harmed.
Watch yourselves as well.
GAMBIT:
How about you tell them not to harm us?
We're under attack!
Report to the guard room immediately!
So long, suckers!
(MORPH LAUGHING)
(GUARDS CLAMORING)
It looks like clear sailing from here.
We must destroy every registration file in this area.
The computer is all yours, Beast.
My pleasure.
No mutant name shall remain.
STORM:
We must destroy the hard files as well.
It's locked.
Unlocked.
BEAST:
As Archimedes said when he discovered the principle of displacement,
"Eureka."
GYRICH:
Wake up!
Wake up!
I want to ask you some questions, Jubilee.
I want to know about the mutants who helped you at the mall.
I don't know anything.
Why are you doing this to me?
I haven't done anything!
I'm just a kid.
GYRICH:
You've already made life miserable for your foster parents.
And as your mutant powers grow, you'll become a danger to everyone around you.
It's not my fault!
I can't help the way I was born!
You can help, Jubilee.
You can help us identify the most dangerous mutants of all.
GAMBIT ON TAPE:
Don't mess with the X-Men.
Don't mess with the X-Men.
Who are these so-called X-Men?
Gyrich!
Why did you bring that mutant here?
Who is she?
Just a random name from the files.
A test to see how easy it will be to capture the rest of them.
I thought we agreed not to strike the mutants until we had 1OO Sentinels!
Well, you're building them too slowly, Trask.
Aren't I paying you enough?
What are you waiting for?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Gyrich here.
Eliminate those mutants immediately!
Trouble at the Agency.
(EXCLAIMS)
Come on, boys.
Let's all go for a little moonlight swim.
Don't get a moon-burn!
You wanna play with Gambit?
Here!
Take a card!
House wins!
Storm, we got trouble out here!
Move it before someone gets hurt.
Cyclops, understood.
Okay, we're done.
That's the last of the mutant files.
Let's go, Beast!
"Though I am always in haste, I am never in a hurry."
John Wesley.
In mere moments the files shall be no more!
My apologies, Beast.
We have no time for poetry.
Storm to Cyclops.
Mission accomplished.
We are coming out.
Understood.
Everyone to the Blackbird.
Gambit, blow that fence.
Halt!
Put your hands up!
(SCREAMING)
-ROGUE:
Come to mama.
-Put me down, you flying freak!
ROGUE:
Whatever you say, sugar!
First we charge the card, then we blow it up!
Life don't get much better than this.
After you, mon ami.
Come on, move it!
We're missing dinner.
Didn't I tell you?
Clear sailing all the way.
WOLVERINE:
Hey, Tin Woodsman!
I'm sending you back to Oz in pieces.
Wolverine!
Pull back!
(SCREAMS)
-What's wrong, Jean?
-It's Morph.
Can't you feel it?
Morph?
I don't sense anything.
(BLACKBIRD APPROACHING)
(SOBBING)
WOLVERINE:
Cyclops!
I know how you feel about it, Wolverine, but... (GRUNTS)
You know nothing, little man!
Next time, I use these!
I've taken enough from you.
Let's do it!
Let's see how tough you are when you ain't giving orders.
Cyclops!
Wolverine!
Stop it!
Soldier boy here left them behind.
For all we know, Morph and Beast may still be alive.
Beast is.
What about Morph?
(CRYING)
He's gone, mon ami.
(SNARLING)
Cowards, all of them!
Wolverine!
-Tell Cyclops I made him a convertible.
-What happened isn't his fault.
Wolverine!
It's not your fault, either.
WOLVERINE:
Morph.
Beast.
Wolverine!
Pull back!
Morph?
No!
(SCREAMING)
-Beast!
-I'll get him!
(GRUNTS)
It's adamantium-tasting time, boys!
(WOLVERINE SCREAMING)
Five-card stud.
Jacks or better to open.
Come on, Rogue!
Cyclops, give them an eyeful.
ROGUE:
Uh-oh!
Let's fly!
Cyclops, move your butt!
CYCLOPS:
Wolverine, we've got to pull back.
Cyclops!
We are being overwhelmed.
We must retreat.
Come on, Wolverine!
Let's go!
Eat dirt, Cyclops.
X-Men don't cut and run.
I'm going back for Beast and Morph.
-We can't help them.
-Maybe you can't, Junior, but I can.
I won't let you throw your life away!
Come back here!
I go where I wanna go.
Sorry.
Not this time, sugar!
Gotta be careful to pull out enough of your energy to stop you without hurting you.
Morph.
Beast.
Don't leave them.
I'll avenge you, my friend.
I swear it!
GUARD 1:
Send help!
We have one of the mutant intruders cornered.
GUARD 2:
Hold it right there!
SENTINEL:
Stand aside, human.
We will remove the surviving mutant.
You were sent here to help, not take over.
This is my prisoner, robot.
Morph!
He's gone.
-I want to ask you some questions.
-Another time.
It's your funeral.
I'll be back.
And now the President of the United States.
My fellow Americans.
Last night, several renegade mutants attacked the headquarters of the federal Security Agency.
This attack was foiled with the help o fexperimental robot policemen called Sentinels.
Sentinels.
And now a reply to the President's speech by Senator Robert Kelly.
KELLY:
The incidents at the New Salem Mall and the Mutant Control Agency...
Why don't you shut that garbage off?
Why don't you get out of here, fur-face?
This here's our table.
I'll bet.
Yeah.
Right.
-I don't think you heard me, runt.
-Come on, big man.
The fuzz ball's a mutant!
Get out of my place.
We don't want your kind around here!
Yeah, why don't you go back to the freak show?
I go where I wanna go.
Wolverine.
Drop it.
I need to talk to you.
MAN:
Butt out, four eyes.
You wouldn't hit a man with glasses, would you?
So take them off.
Stop!
Put them back on.
Please.
If you're here to apologize for running out on Beast, save your breath.
I don't apologize for command decisions.
How would you like to locate the Sentinels' home base?
When and where?
You wanted to see me, Madam President?
PRESIDENT:
I wanted to congratulate you and Dr. Trask.
I also wanted to tell you to stop all activities involving your privately-run mutant registration program.
Why?
Those mutants were willing to sacrifice their lives to destroy your files.
Did they have good reason to be threatened?
The fool.
They're all fools!
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Gyrich here.
Is he still there?
FOSTER FATHER:
I'll keep him here as long as I can, Mr. Gyrich.
-Soda?
-Thank you.
He thinks Jubilee's been kidnapped by those things the President talked about.
-Those giant Sentinels.
-What?
But why would anyone do something like that?
Because people fear what they don't understand.
Look, you have to get out of here now.
They said we should call them if anyone came asking about Jubilee.
You've done nothing wrong.
You just want to help her.
And you have.
-Surrender, mutant.
-Of course.
Not!
(EXCLAIMS)
Sentinel 14 damaged by unknown mutant.
Returning to base for repairs.
(EXCLAIMS)
-I have the Sentinel on radar.
-CYCLOPS:
Let's go get him.
ROGUE:
This chicken's going home to roost.
GYRICH:
Start packing, Trask.
TRASK:
What?
The President has canceled the government support of mutant registration.
The Sentinel program may be next.
We're moving the operation overseas.
(SENTINEL APPROACHING)
(MACHINE SHUTTING DOWN)
All right!
Can't those things watch where they're going?
Whatever happened, I hope it keeps those slime balls busy.
Time to blow this joint.
GYRICH:
What...
What's that?
Get out of my way!
Look out!
Stop her!
Uh-oh!
Wrong way!
SENTINEL:
Halt, mutant.
Oh, no.
I just wanna go home!
CYCLOPS:
Jubilee!
Duck!
Come on, Trask!
Our work is just beginning.
You miss me, petite?
(GAMBIT CHUCKLES)
I reckon so.
You all ought to learn how to behave.
This one's for you, Morph!
-CYCLOPS:
Is that all of them?
-Ain't that enough?
JUBILEE:
You guys are the best foster parents I ever had.
But Professor Xavier's school, it's the best place for people like me.
You will come to visit us, won't you?
Does a mall babe eat chili fries?
CYCLOPS:
Jean.
Back there with Beast and Morph, do you think I did the right thing?
JEAN:
You did what you had to do.
So did they.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Martha and Carl Brodie, mother and son.
No one's seen them since Tuesday.
The car is a Trans Am, blue with yellow pinstriping.
California license: 2CLG592.
No one's seen that since Tuesday, either.
God, I just hope nothing horrible happened to them.
They were so close!
Ma'am, please, step back.
Sheriff, what do you think happened?
I don't know, but somebody sure doesn't like cats.
Shit!
Looks like the place has been empty for a hundred years.
Well, it hasn't.
What the hell was that?
Jesus!
It's a little girl.
What's that in her hair?
A rose.
["Sleepwalk" by Santo Johnny plays]
Tanya.
- Hi.
- Shh.
He can't hear us.
Shit!
Come on.
He'll be back.
You always get 'em sooner or later.
Dance with me.
- I don't wanna dance.
- Sure, you do.
You'll love this one.
Come on.
What's for dinner?
Roast chicken and cranberry dressing.
Pumpkin pie for dessert.
- Going anywhere tonight?
- To the movies maybe.
With a friend?
With a special friend?
All by my lonesome.
Don't ask your mother.
Well, actually, there's a girl that works there.
I thought I might ask her out.
Oh, you might?
She's pretty too.
Is she nice?
I don't know.
I guess I'll find out, won't I?
Jealous?
Concerned.
Right.
Concerned.
Mm-hmm, concerned.
Should I be jealous?
Do you like that?
Oh, Mother.
["Do You Love Be" by The Contours plays on headphones]
- You scared me.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
Oh, no.
I'll take that.
Charles Brady.
- Thanks for the help, Charles Brady.
- Don't mention it.
Could I get a popcorn and a medium Mr. Pibb, please?
Yes.
I'm very embarrassed.
Am I blushing?
You look good in red, Tanya.
How'd you know my name?
English, period four, Creative Writing.
Mr. Fallows, the weird and terrible.
Oh, you're the new guy.
From Ohio?
Paradise Falls.
Popcorn.
Go ahead.
You mean free?
Thanks.
I don't suppose you'd like a ride home after work tonight, would you?
My dad picks me up.
- Nice dad.
- Yeah.
Besides, what would your girlfriend say if you gave the popcorn girl a ride?
No girlfriend.
I'm new in town, remember?
Thanks.
I'll see you in class.
Oh, wait!
Welcome to Travis.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, my God!
Hi!
I'm okay.
How's my girl?
I'm good, Dad.
Good.
Fasten your seat belt.
Tanya.
It's my son, officer.
Cat?
Having himself one hissy fit, I'll tell you.
I'm sorry, officer.
It's late, but this allergy is so severe.
Yeah, I know.
I got one too.
Mine's to the I.R.S.
Y'all have a good night.
Thank you, officer.
It just ignored the trap.
It was right by the window.
It's okay.
It's gone now.
I'll set some more traps in the morning.
Did you bring me anything?
Anything special in mind?
Am I beautiful?
You're always beautiful, Mother.
So, did you ask this mystery girl out?
What kind of a girl would go out with a guy she just met?
Not a very nice one, I suppose.
- Another one?
- Goddamn cats.
Don't swear, Mother.
Just you make sure you ask her out tomorrow.
What's her name?
Tanya Robertson.
Is she nice?
She's nice.
I'm sure of it.
She's pure.
Good.
I'm famished, Charles.
Famished!
" They were sleepwalkers, hiding in human robes.
Feeding on virtue.
Loving to feed, feeding to breed.
So, in the end, they ran.
In the end, Robbie and his mother always had to run.
For one night, the men would come in their old cars... men with lights and guns.
And to the boy and his mother... their curses and their screams of rage always sound the same.
Like the laughter of cruel gods.
The time of happiness... too brief to be anything but golden, had run out."
Very good, Charles.
Very good.
Your teachers in Ohio must have been sorry to lose such a creative young man.
I beg your pardon, Mr. Fallows?
Isn't that where you transferred from?
Ohio?
Oh, yes.
Yes, it is.
Hey.
Shit!
I suggest that next time you keep your hands to yourself, Mr. Crawford.
Yes, sir.
Asshole.
All right, any thoughts on Mr. Brady's Sleepwalkers?
Miss Robertson?
I liked it.
You liked it?
It was different.
I thought it was very sad.
Sad?
Why?
Because they were always driven away.
Because they were such outsiders.
I think Miss Robertson might be on to something.
Now, we all understand that a story... has to have a beginning, a middle and an end, right?
But that's like saying a box has four sides.
Actually, Mr. Fallows, a box has six sides.
Busted!
You've actually talked to him?
Yeah, he's nice.
Real nice.
- I'm serious!
- I can see that.
Well, what happened?
Did he ask you out or anything?
Nothing specific, just a maybe.
We just talked at the theater.
That's all you would've done anyway.
What a waste!
Well, excuse me, but what would you have done?
Everything.
Everything!
Well, I may have plans of my own... and they just might include Homeland.
Yeah, right.
I can just see you in the back seat at Homeland.
You guys!
Tanya, you gotta admit, your dad's gonna be there.
- I can just see it.
- My dad's not gonna be there.
Hi.
Charles, hi.
Charles, do you know Jeanette and Carrie?
This is Charles Brady.
- Hi.
- We are in the same class, Tanya.
Oh.
Can I give you a ride home?
I mean, all of you?
No, we've got a ride.
But why don't you go, Tanya?
Okay, see you later.
I also wanted to thank you.
For what?
For what you said in class.
I mean, you really nailed it.
No, you did, so thank you.
I think I know how they feel, the...
What are they called?
- Sleepwalkers.
- Sleepwalkers.
At least sometimes I feel that different.
- Madam.
- This yours?
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.
Whoa!
You know, some people use a door.
- Really?
- Yes.
- I heard that somewhere.
- Did you?
Mom?
Mom?
She must be shopping or something.
Let's go upstairs.
Okay.
- Thanks for the ride home.
- Anytime.
Oh, wow!
These are interesting.
My mom does gravestone rubbings.
Pretty morbid, huh?
- No, I like 'em.
- You do?
Yeah.
My room.
Oh, you have a lot of pictures.
Yeah, it's kind of a hobby.
Oh, these are great!
Really nice.
- Makes you want to...
- What?
Oh!
Just really get a good look at these kind of places.
You know, things that we never really see.
My favorite picture's over there.
Which one?
That one.
I like rocks.
You do?
You know, I'd really like to see how you see a photograph before you take it...
I mean, you don't even know me, but...
Well, actually, I was gonna shoot at Homeland tomorrow if...
- Well, if you want to come.
- What's Homeland?
- Oh, it's... it's an old graveyard.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's neat.
- I love old graveyards.
- Sweetheart...
- Mom!
I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't know you had company.
This is Charles Brady.
This is my mom.
He gave me a ride home.
Oh, that's nice.
Very nice to meet you.
Likewise.
Well, we should go.
We were just going.
So we'll do that tomorrow?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- I'll walk you out.
- Okay.
So you two are going out tomorrow?
Yes.
Tanya's gonna show me...
Homeland.
Oh, really?
You see, I do rubbings too.
Not quite as fine as yours... but I figure there must be some old slate gravestones out there.
Yes, as a matter of fact... in the old section near the woods.
Tell me, Charles, do you use powder or stick?
I use stick.
Usually a number five.
Really?
Don't you find that a little hard?
Yeah, but, I'm clumsy.
You know, powder's so messy.
- Tell me, Charles, where do you live?
- 66 Wicker Street.
- Your father, what does he do?
- He's dead, Mrs. Robertson.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It was a long time ago.
Well, the Brands will be coming to dinner tomorrow night.
So be back by 5:00, okay?
- Okay.
- She will be.
How'd you know all that stuff?
I learned it a long time ago, from my mom.
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.
Mr. Fallows!
Hi.
Hello, Charles.
Checking out your new environment?
Boring, isn't it?
Disneyland for cows.
But for human beings?
Well, I like it.
It's kind of peaceful.
Reminds you of Ohio, I suppose?
Yeah, well, you know...
No, actually, I don't, Charles.
I don't know.
And you don't, either.
There is no Paradise Falls in Ohio.
Your transcripts are also fakes.
Clever fakes, but fakes.
Anything to say?
- You're mistaken.
- Oh, no, I'm not.
But you are, Charles, if you think you can wiggle out of this.
I don't know who you are, but I know you're not who you say you are.
If this is blackmail, Mr. Fallows, I think you've picked the wrong guy.
This car is the only expensive thing I've got.
I'm kind of sentimental about it.
I don't think I can sell it.
- Ow!
- Sit still till I'm through with you.
Your generation is so mercenary, Charles.
Money this, money that.
Well, money is not the only medium of exchange.
You're right.
People really should learn to keep their hands to themselves.
Here's yours.
I'm sorry!
Come on, boy.
Get the bad guy for Daddy.
You know you want him.
Get this bad guy.
There you go.
There you go, Clovis.
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy.
Get the bad guy.
Get the bad guy.
Get the bad guy.
Come on, Clovis.
Here we go.
Get that motherfucker!
All right!
Good boy, Clovis!
Yeah, that's a good boy.
Huh, Clovis?
Well, Clovis...
Looks like we found ourselves a goddamn speedster.
Unit Three calling home.
You in there, Laurie?
Come on.
Andy, what you up to?
Bye.
Got ourselves one lawless perpetrator heading east out here on Gray Road.
- Copy.
- Copy.
Need any help?
Bye.
No.
I think I can handle this one all by myself.
What the...
Jesus!
Oh, shit!
Jesus, no!
- Everybody okay?
- Go get him!
Son of a bitch.
Report, Unit Three.
Need a location.
I'm out on Pond Road, Laurie, still in pursuit.
Bastard almost ran down a little girl!
I think he tried to run her down.
I think he's playing with me!
Get me some backup!
Bye.
Pull over!
Pull over, motherfucker!
Pull over!
What the fuck?
What's going on out there, Andy?
Please respond!
Not now, Laurie.
Christ, Clovis!
What's he got in there?
A supercharger?
I lost him.
How in the hell did I do that?
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me, you fucking cat!
Shit, Clovis.
I know just how you feel.
Can I tell you something, Ira?
It's kind of weird, but...
Horace, if you laugh, I'm gonna break your jaw.
What is it?
You know how I told you I couldn't see him because of how fast we were going?
- Yeah.
- Well, that wasn't entirely true.
How's that?
Well, we were both doing 90.
I pulled right up beside him.
We might as well have been standing still!
So you did get a look at him.
Well, no, no, I didn't.
'Cause see... he didn't have no face.
Andy, you got plenty of sick time comin'.
Horace, shut your pie hole.
I mean his face, it was like a blur!
Like...
Shit, I don't know.
Maybe you got some grit in your eye.
Makes 'em water.
Yeah, I guess maybe that could've been it.
Andy, do me a favor.
When you do get this stampeder... just leave that part out when you talk to the county prosecutor, okay?
Anything else, Andy?
Anything at all?
Yeah, there was something.
Clovis here got a good look at him, and he didn't like him.
He didn't like him one little bit.
And it was the other guy too.
He didn't like Clovis!
It was like he was scared of him.
Scared of a cat!
I'm gonna look for this guy on my way home... and I'm gonna find him.
I'm gonna find him!
- You didn't get it?
- No.
- Why didn't you get anything?
- I just couldn't.
What about the girl?
It wasn't the right time.
Tomorrow.
I'll get it tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I'm starving, Charles!
I need it, and you have to get it for me!
Oh, my poor baby!
What happened?
What always happens, Mom?
Someone saw you?
The deputy had a cat.
Maybe for a second or two.
- He won't believe what he saw.
- No, he probably won't.
Somebody will find the teacher that I dumped in the woods.
It's already started again, Mom!
- Don't worry.
Don't worry.
- But I have to feed you.
- You'll see her tomorrow.
- What if something happens to me?
You'll starve!
We haven't even seen another sleepwalker.
- Oh, we aren't the last.
- You don't know that.
Yes, I do!
I can feel the others.
You'll feed tomorrow.
And then you'll feed me, and then we will leave.
Nothing's gonna happen.
We just have to take care of each other.
Okay.
Remember, honey, I want you home by 5:00.
Make sure Charles understands that, okay?
Yes, Mommy.
I'll be sure to pack extra didies too.
- Nobody loves a smart-ass, Tanya.
- She is smart, dear.
And I'm smart enough to know this is her first date with the new boy in town.
We do understand each other, don't we, Tan?
You know, Mom, I think we do.
Good. 5:00?
5:00.
- Bye, darlin'.
- Bye, Dad.
- Have a good time, honey.
- I hope so!
Are we awful?
Terrible.
God, I've become my mother.
Well, you met this kid.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's terrific.
He's utterly charming.
- Does it have to be her?
- You care more for her than for me?
You know better than that.
Why are you being such a bitch?
Because I'm hungry!
You cannot be in love with this girl, Charles.
Charles.
[Doorbell Chimes]
I'll get it.
You stay here.
I love you, Mom.
Do you?
[Doorbell Chimes]
Hi.
I know you were supposed to pick me up, but I was nearby.
Yeah, Tanya...
Oh, this is a bad time.
Nonsense.
I'm so glad you came by.
Thank you.
Well, we really ought to go.
The light for Tanya's pictures...
Will be just fine for hours yet.
Come in, Tanya.
I have something for you.
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.
I won't keep you long.
I know young people have to run and play.
Wow!
Charles said you were nice, and he was right.
He usually is.
Oh, well, thank you.
Charles is very nice himself.
You have a very beautiful home, Mrs. Brady.
Wow.
These are beautiful figurines.
Oh, they've been in the family for a long time.
You probably wouldn't believe how long.
Mom, we really ought to be going.
Soon, Charles.
Soon.
Just a second, dear.
This is beautiful.
Mmm, nice car.
Where's the Trans Am?
Oh, it's in the shop.
The Mustang belongs to...
His mother.
Wow!
Those all your cats?
There's a lot of'em.
Oh, they're strays, but we'll get rid of them.
We're good at getting rid of pests.
There.
It finishes you somehow.
Thank you.
That's very sweet.
Oh, sweets to the sweet, I always say.
Right, Charles?
Go on now, you two.
You'll lose the light.
Mrs. Brady, it was really nice to meet you.
Oh, very nice to meet you.
- This way.
- Thank you, ma'am.
This is it.
It's really beautiful here.
And so are you, Tanya.
Thank you, Charles.
Well, I better get these out of the way right off.
Your mother's gonna want to know some rubbing went on out here.
Me too, Charles.
Hey, wait up!
Charles?
Charles?
Oh, hold it.
Come on.
Hey, Clovis.
Hey, Clovis, what's up?
You catching a nap?
There comes Johnny with his pecker in his hand
He's a one-balled man and he's off to the rodeo
What are you looking at?
Oh, very nice.
Gotcha.
Oh, very nice.
Smile pretty.
Oh, very nice!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry.
No sorries.
Charles.
Do you really feel alone, like the characters in your story?
'Cause I do.
I know.
It's wonderful to feel... to feel like you're really with someone.
- Together.
- I think we better...
Charles, shh.
You don't know me, Tanya.
But I want to.
Ow!
A little slower.
But I thought we understood each other, Tanya.
I couldn't breathe.
Isn't this the excitement you were talking about, Tanya?
You're right.
We do understand each other, Tanya.
See, this is just how we live, Tanya.
It doesn't have to hurt!
Don't you get it, Tanya?
I need you.
I need you to live!
Oh, God!
Please don't kill me!
Tanya.
I don't think you're entering into the spirit of this.
Why don't you just think of yourself as lunch?
Charles?
Peek-a-baby!
I lied!
It does have to hurt!
Feed me, Tanya.
Mother's hungry.
Just look at this shirt!
My mother's gonna kill me!
Get off me!
Get off!
Stay away from me!
Now, Tanya, when exactly did I lose your trust?
Help me!
Somebody help me!
So allemande left and allemande right
Come on, you fuckin'turkey Get your right foot right
Get off the stage you fucking jerk
You know you piss me off
Well, well... hold the phone!
Hold the phone.
- All right.
- Help me!
Please.
Somebody help!
Oh, my God.
Get me out of here!
He's trying to kill me!
- Calm down.
Tell me what happened.
- He's right behind me!
- We'll get him.
- No, you don't understand.
One thing at a time, sweetheart.
Does this guy have a name?
His name is Charles, but he's not human.
His face changed.
Get in the car!
Lock it!
- We have to go.
Please.
- Just calm down.
No.
We both have to go.
Calm down, okay?
Everything's gonna be all right.
Cop kebab.
Isn't this fun?
I don't believe you fired a warning shot, Officer.
Now, where were we, Tanya?
Oh, my God.
Unit Three, Unit Three, state your 20, come on.
Hello?
Somebody help me, please!
Andy, get with the program.
Bye.
Somebody help me, please!
A policeman is dead!
Please!
Please, please come.
Please.
Please come.
Charles.
My face is so hot.
I'm sorry, Mom.
I tried.
I really, really tried.
It was the cat.
You were right.
We've only got each other.
That doesn't matter.
Save your strength.
- How bad is it?
- You'll be okay, honey.
But I'm afraid they'll be coming for us soon.
- We can go, Mom.
I'll be okay.
- No.
We've got to stay here until you're stronger.
But I want you to help me.
Try to make yourself dim.
Will you do that for me, honey?
Go on.
Try.
I can't, Mom.
I can't do it.
It's all right.
I'll do it for both of us.
There's the car and the traps.
I'll take care of you.
Buddy.
Buddy.
I ain't taking the rap on this.
I lock this place up every night.
It's not my fault if every pervert...
- weirdo, horny kid...
- Talk to someone in charge.
I'm busy.
Buddy.
Listen.
It's not my fault if every horny kid, weirdo, pervert comes in here.
I lock this place up.
I don't need this action.
Don't talk to me.
Talk to the sheriff.
- Sheriff.
Hey.
- Not now.
Okay, his name is Charles Brady, formerly of Paradise Falls... now living at 66 Wicker Street.
And the rest of it, including the make and color of the car.
We came in a red car.
And it was older.
But it wasn't the Trans Am.
He took me home in a Trans Am.
It was blue.
And he left here in one.
Ok.
Listen to me!
I know I sound crazy.
You're not getting the point.
Charles isn't human.
Excuse me, miss.
Sheriff, I need to document these bruises.
All right.
- Do you have to do this now?
- It'll just take a sec.
Don't worry.
Could you turn your head, please?
Thanks.
And the other way, please?
Did somebody find my camera?
I took his picture in my camera.
Yes!
Develop that film, you'll have his picture.
- Get on it ASAP.
- Yeah, sure.
This is Officer Rayburn.
He's gonna run you home.
I'll have to come over later tonight and ask you a few more questions.
Are you sure his name is Charles Brady?
That's what he said.
- Do you think he was telling the truth?
- I don't know.
He was...
He was very charming.
Take her home.
Excuse me.
Sheriff?
Yeah.
- Will you bring the cat this evening?
- What for?
The cat saved my life.
Ok.
Thank you.
Do her parents know a class one assault did not occur?
Do you mean she managed to avoid being raped by the bastard?
Yes.
Ok.
- Don't let her out of your sight.
- Yepper.
Here.
Drink some cold water.
It'll make you feel better.
I'm dying, Mom.
No.
My boy is not going to die.
Not ever!
They're coming.
I'm going to make us dim.
I can do it.
But you have to keep perfectly quiet.
I love you.
Quiet, Charles.
It can still be all right.
I'm scared.
Charles Brady, if you're in there, come out with your hands open and empty.
So scared, Mom.
I have to do us.
Keep still.
Dim.
Open up, Brady!
I'm in no mood to be polite!
Police!
Hands up!
Ira, Soames, there's nothing in the kitchen.
I told you to wait on my word.
I thought you gave it.
- A lot of cats.
- I can see that, dickhead.
Aw, shit.
What a Polish fire drill.
Get out of there!
Get back in the damn car.
Now!
Move!
Move!
Move!
Move, move!
What?
There's a cold draft.
Use one right now, could you?
I'd like to set up checkpoints in and out of town.
The perp's history by now, Ira.
He killed one of my men.
Look.
All you got is a hysterical girl with a very vivid imagination.
- What about the cats?
- What about 'em, Ira?
That little girl needs a good smack on the butt.
And if her mama and daddy won't do it...
I'll happily volunteer.
Stay away from her, Soames.
This is the best meal I've had since my wife passed on.
If Ira found out, he'd kill me.
It was already made, Deputy.
There's one more ear of corn here.
Would you like it?
Yes, ma'am.
She's been up there an awfully long time, honey.
- Do you think...
- She's taking a nice, hot bath.
She just needs to get clean.
[Knocking]
Honey, is everything okay?
I'm just getting out.
Your mother's keeping supper warm for you.
Honey?
Thanks, Daddy.
I just thought I would lie down for a little while.
Could you call me when the sheriff gets here with the cat?
Yeah, I will.
I love you, honey.
I love you, too, Daddy.
What was that?
Who's there?
Identify yourself.
Police officers.
Maybe it was the wind.
It was not the fucking wind.
You're right.
That was not the fucking wind.
[Doorbell Chimes]
- Who could that be?
- Let me take a peek.
State police.
Probably Soames.
Hope he don't think he's gonna question her before Ira gets here.
I'll get this.
Hi, I'm Mary Brady, Charles' mother.
- Charles couldn't come himself.
- Donald, who is it?
I'll take care of it.
Just stay in the kitchen.
Look, Mrs. Brady...
But I know he wanted you to have these flowers.
Donald!
You have a lovely home, Mrs. Robertson.
I've had lovely homes too.
We never stay long, though.
Hey!
You stay away from them!
You just call your daughter for me.
- What?
- My son is badly hurt.
He may be dying.
Your daughter tried to kill my Charles.
Good!
I hope he dies.
I hope you both die.
I hope you both die and rot in hell!
He's my son, my only son!
Daddy?
Mom?
Mom?
Daddy?
Oh, my God.
Daddy.
Get off me!
- This is how they came from the camera?
- That's it.
So was the camera moving?
No.
See.
The background and the clothes are in focus.
Laurie, would you get that damn thing?
Look at the collar.
Sheriff's Department.
- Where's Ira?
- What's going on out there?
There's a woman here.
She says she's the Brady kid's mother.
- I think she killed Don Robertson.
- Slow down, Horace.
There's blood everywhere!
No vegetables... no dessert.
Those are the rules.
- Horace!
- What's going on here?
Come on, Horace.
Answer the phone.
Are you there?
Answer the damn phone!
Get that woman over there to safety.
Hold it right there!
Put her down.
Put the girl down.
- Give me back my daughter!
- Put her down!
Get Soames!
Every man he has!
Castle Rock too!
Put her down!
Drop the gun, lady!
Now!
[Screaming]
Hello, dear.
- Where are you taking me?
- To see Charles, dear.
Let go of me!
Get in here, you bitch!
Oh, my God!
My beautiful Charles, Mommy's home.
See what Mommy's brought you.
He's dead.
Look at him.
He's dead.
No!
He's not dead!
He's sleeping.
Can't you see he's sleeping?
You know what I bet he'd love to do?
You'd like to dance.
Wouldn't you, my darling?
["Sleepwalk" by Santo Johnny plays]
That's his favorite song.
Did you know that?
I said, did you know that?
Yes.
He's a wonderful dancer.
But you don't have to take my word for it.
You can see for yourself.
What?
Dance with him.
- Dance with...
- With Charles.
Dance with my son.
Relax.
He's a wonderful dancer.
He'll lead.
There!
That's it.
Dance.
Clovis?
Yes!
Now, Charles!
Now!
Good.
Good, Charles.
Feed.
Suck her dry!
Stop!
You're killing him!
Die!
Tanya!
Get out of there!
Go!
Holy shit!
- Wait a minute!
- No!
Come on!
We got to go!
Come on, damn it!
Charles was dead, wasn't he?
He was dead, yes!
Let's go!
Hey, Mom!
Sheriff!
God, help me!
Sheriff!
You killed my son!
My only son!
Clovis.
It's just you and me, Clovis.
Just you and me.
["Boadicea" by Enya plays]
What's happened here?
Martha and Carl Brodie, mother and son.
No one's seen them since Tuesday.
The car is a trans am, blue with yellow pinstriping.
California license: 2clg592.
No one's seen that since Tuesday, either.
God, I just hope nothing horrible happened to them.
They were so close!
Ma'am, please, step back.
Sheriff, what do you think happened?
I don't know, but somebody sure doesn't like cats.
Shit!
Looks like the place has been empty for a hundred years.
Well, it hasn't.
What the hell was that?
Jesus!
It's a little girl.
What's that in her hair?
A rose.
Tanya.
- Hi.
- Shhh.
He can't hear us.
Shit!
Come on.
He'll be back.
You always get 'em sooner or later.
Dance with me.
I don't wanna dance.
Sure you do.
You'll love this one.
Come on.
What's for dinner?
Roast chicken and cranberry dressing.
Pumpkin pie for dessert.
Going anywhere tonight?
To the movies, maybe.
With a friend?
With a special friend?
All by my lonesome.
Oh, don't ask your mother.
Well, actually, there's a girl that works there.
I thought I might ask her out.
Oh, you might?
She's pretty too.
Is she nice?
I don't know.
I guess I'll find out, won't I?
- Jealous?
- Concerned.
Right.
Concerned.
Mm-hmm, concerned.
Should I be jealous?
Do you like that?
Oh, mother.
?
Do you love me?
?
Do you love me?
?
Do you love me, baby?
?
Do you love me?
?
Do you love me?
?
Do you love me?

Oh, work it out, baby?

Work, work?
I'm gonna drive you crazy?
?
Work, work?
Uh, just a little bit slow now?
?
Work?
?
I can mash potato?
?
I can mash potato?

I can do the twist?

I can do the twist?

Tell me, baby?

Do you like it like this?
Do you like it like this?

Watch me now...?
Aaah!
Oh!
You scared me.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Oh, no.
I'll take that.
Charles Brady.
Thanks for the help, Charles Brady.
Don't mention it.
Could I get a popcorn and a medium Mr. pibb, please?
Yes.
I'm very embarrassed.
Am I blushing?
- You look good in red, Tanya.
- How'd you know my name?
English, period four, creative writing.
Mr. fallows, the weird and terrible.
Oh, you're the new guy.
From Ohio?
Paradise falls.
Oh.
Popcorn.
Go ahead.
You mean... free?
Shhh.
Thanks.
I don't suppose you'd like a ride home after work tonight, would you?
Um, my dad picks me up.
Mmm, nice dad.
Yeah.
Besides, what would your girlfriend say...
If you gave the popcorn girl a ride home?
No girlfriend.
I'm new in town, remember?
Thanks.
I'll see you in class.
Oh, oh, wait!
Um... welcome to Travis.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, my God!
Hi!
I'm okay.
How's my girl?
I'm good, dad.
Good.
Fasten your seat belt.
Tanya.
It's my son, officer.
- Cat?
Having himself one hissy fit, I'll tell you.
I'm sorry, officer.
It's late, but this allergy is so severe.
Yeah, I know.
I got one too.
Mine's to the I.R.S.
Y'all have a good night.
Thank you, officer.
It just ignored the trap.
It was right by the window.
It's okay.
It's gone now.
I'll set some more traps in the morning.
Did you bring me anything?
Anything special in mind?
Am I beautiful?
You're always beautiful, mother.
So...
Did you ask this mystery girl out?
What kind of a girl would go out with a guy she just met?
Not a very nice one, I suppose.
Another one?
Goddamn cats.
Don't swear, mother.
Just you make sure you ask her out tomorrow.
What's her name?
Tanya robertson.
Is she nice?
She's nice.
I'm sure of it.
She's pure.
Good.
I'm famished, Charles.
Famished!
"They were sleepwalkers, hiding in human robes.
"Feeding on virtue.
"Loving to feed, feeding to breed..
"So, in the end, they ran.
"In the end, Robbie and his mother always had to run.
"For one night, the men would come in their old cars,
"men with lights and guns.
"And to the boy and his mother,
"their curses and the screams of rage always sound the same.
"Like the laughter of cruel gods.
"The time of happiness,
"too brief to be anything but golden, had run out."
Very good, Charles.
Very good.
Your teachers in Ohio must have been sorry to lose such a creative young man.
I beg your pardon, Mr. fallows?
Isn't that where you transferred from?
Ohio?
- Oh, yes.
Yes, it is.
- Hey.
Psst.
Aw, shit!
I suggest that next time, you keep your hands to yourself, Mr. Crawford.
Yes, sir.
Asshole.
All right, any thoughts on Mr. Brady's "sleepwalkers"?
- Miss robertson?
- I liked it.
- You liked it?
It was different.
I thought it was very sad.
Sad?
Why?
Because they were always driven away.
Because they were such outsiders.
I think miss robertson might be on to something.
Now, we all understand that a story...
Has to have a beginning, a middle and an end, right?
But that's like saying a box has four sides.
Actually, Mr. fallows, a box has six sides.
Busted!
Ahh!
Ah!
Ah!
Ahhhhh!
I'm just kidding.
You actually talked to him?
Yeah, he's nice.
Real nice!
I'm serious!
I can see that.
Well, what happened?
Did he ask you out of anything?
Nothing specific, just a maybe.
We just talked at the theater.
That's all you would've done anyway.
What a waste!
Well, excuse me, but what would you have done?
Everything.
Everything!
Well, I may have plans of my own, and they just might include homeland.
Oooh!
Yeah, right!
I can just see you in the back seat at homeland.
You guys!
Tanya, you gotta admit, your dad's gonna be there.
I can just see it.
My dad's not gonna be there.
- Hi.
- Charles... hi.
Charles... um, do you know Jeanette and Carrie?
This is Charles Brady.
Hi.
We are in the same class, Tanya.
Oh.
Can I give you a ride home?
Uh, I mean all of you.
Um... no, we've got a ride.
But why don't you go, Tanya?
Okay, see you later.
I, uh...
I also wanted to thank you.
For what?
For what you said in class.
I mean, you really nailed it.
No, you did, so thank you.
I think I know how they feel, the, um... what are they called?
Sleepwalkers.
Sleepwalkers.
At least sometimes I feel that different.
Look!
Madam.
This yours?
Do you like it?
Yeah.
Whoa!
You know, some people use a door.
Really?
Yes.
I heard that somewhere.
Did you?
Mm-hmm.
Mom?
Mom?
She must be shopping or something.
Mmm.
Let's go upstairs.
Okay.
Thanks for the ride home.
Anytime.
Oh, wow!
These are interesting.
Oh.
My mom does gravestone rubbings.
Pretty morbid, huh?
No, I like 'em.
You do?
My room.
Oh, you have a lot of pictures.
Yeah, it's kind of a hobby.
Oh, these are great!
Really nice.
Makes you want to...
what?
Oh!
Just really get a good look at these kind of places.
You know, things that we never really see.
My-my favorite picture's over there.
Which one?
Uh... um.... that one.
I like rocks.
You do?
You know, I'd really like to see...
How you see a photograph before you take it, and...
I mean, you don't even know me, but... well, um, actually, I was gonna shoot at homeland tomorrow if... well, if you want to come.
What's homeland?
Oh, it's a... it's an old graveyard.
Really?
Yeah, it's neat.
I love old graveyards.
Sweetheart, I...
mom!
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
I-I didn't know you had company.
Oh, this is Charles Brady.
This is my mom.
Charles.
Um, he gave me a ride home.
Oh, that's nice.
Charles.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Likewise.
Well, we should go.
We were just going.
Um, so we'll do that tomorrow?
Yes.
Okay.
I'll walk you out.
Okay.
So you two are going out tomorrow?
Yes.
Uh, Tanya's gonna show me...
Homeland.
Shhh.
Oh, really?
You see, I do rubbings too.
Not quite as fine as yours, but I figure there must be some old slate gravestones out there.
Uh, yes, as a matter of fact, in the old section near the woods.
Tell me, Charles, do you use powder or stick?
I use stick.
Usually a number five.
Really?
Don't you find that a little hard?
Yeah, but, uh, I'm clumsy.
You know, powder's so messy.
Tell me, Charles, where do you live?
66 wicker street.
- Your father, what does he do?
- He's dead, Mrs. robertson.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It was a long time ago.
Well, um, the brands will be coming to dinner tomorrow night.
So be back by 5:00, okay?
Okay.
She will be.
How'd you know all that stuff?
I learned it a long time ago, from my mom.
See you tomorrow.
Okay.
?
It's a monster it's a monster?
?
It's a monster it's a monster?
?
Can't you see it's a monster?
?
It's a monster?
Mr. fallows!
Hi.
Hello, Charles.
Checking out your new environment?
Boring, isn't it?
- Disneyland for cows.
- But for human beings?
Well, I like it.
It's kind of peaceful.
Reminds you of Ohio, I suppose?
Yeah, well, you know... no, actually, I don't, Charles.
I don't know.
And you don't, either.
There is no paradise falls in Ohio.
Your transcripts are also fakes.
Clever fakes, but fakes.
Anything to say?
You're mistaken.
Oh, no, I'm not.
But you are, Charles, if you think you can wiggle out of this.
I don't know who you are, but I know you're not who you say you are.
If this is blackmail, Mr. fallows, I think you've picked the wrong guy.
This car is the only expensive thing I've got.
I'm kinda sentimental about it.
I don't think I can sell it.
Ow!
Sit till I'm through with you.
Your generation is so mercenary, Charles.
Money this, money that.
Well, money is not the only medium of exchange.
You're right, Mr. fallows.
People really should learn to keep their hands to themselves.
Here's yours.
I'm sorry!
Come on, boy.
Get the bad guy for daddy.
You know you want him.
Get this bad guy.
There you go.
There you go, clovis.
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy.
Get the bad guy.
Get the bad guy.
Get the bad guy.
Come on, clovis.
Here we go.
Get that motherfucker!
All right!
Good boy, clovis!
Yeah, that's a good boy.
Huh, clovis?
Well, clovis, looks like we found ourselves a goddamn speedster.
Unit three calling home.
You in there, Laurie?
Come on.
Andy, what you up to?
Bye.
Got ourselves one lawless perpetrator heading east out here on gray road.
Copy?
Copy.
Need any help?
Bye.
Nah.
I think I can handle this one all by myself.
What the...
Jesus!
Oh, shit!
Jesus, no!
Everybody okay?
Go get him!
Son of a bitch.
Report, unit three.
Need a location.
I'm out on pond road, Laurie, still in pursuit.
Bastard almost ran down a little girl!
I think hetried to run her down!
I think he's playing with me!
Get me some backup!
Bye.
Pull over!
Pull over, motherfucker!
Pull over!
What the fuck?
What's going on out there, Andy?
Please respond!
Not now, Laurie.
Christ, clovis!
What's he got in there?
A supercharger?
I lost him.
How in the hell did I do that?
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me, you fucking cat!
Shit, clovis.
I know just how you feel.
Can I tell you something, ira?
It's kind of weird, but, uh...
Horace, if you laugh, I'm gonna break your jaw.
What is it?
Well, you know how I told you I couldn't see him because of how fast we were going, right?
Yeah.
Well, that wasn't entirely true.
- How's that?
- Well, we were both doing 90.
I pulled right up beside him.
We might as well have been standing still!
- So you did get a look at him.
- Well, no, no, I didn't.
'Cause... see...
He didn't have no face.
Andy, you got plenty of sick time comin'.
Horace, shut your pie hole.
I-I-I mean his face!
It was like a... a blur!
Like... shit, I don't know.
Maybe you got some grit in your eye.
Makes 'em water.
Yeah, I guess maybe that could've been it.
Andy, do me a favor.
When you do get this stampeder, just leave that part out when you talk to the county prosecutor, okay?
Anything else, Andy?
Anything at all?
Yeah, there was something.
Clovis here got a good look at him, and he didn't like him.
He didn't like him one little bit.
And it was the other guy too.
He didn't like clovis!
It-it was like he was scared of him.
Scared of a cat!
Hmm.
I'm gonna look for this guy on my way home, and I'm gonna find him.
I'm gonna find him!
Oh!
You didn't get it?
No.
Why didn't you get anything?
I just couldn't.
What about the girl?
It wasn't the right time.
Tomorrow.
I'll get it tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I'm starving, Charles!
I need it, and you have to get it for me!
Oh, my poor baby!
What happened?
- What always happens, mom?
- Someone saw you?
The deputy had a cat.
Maybe for a second or two.
He won't believe what he saw.
No, he probably won't.
Somebody will find the teacher that I dumped in the woods.
It's already started again, mom!
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
But I have to feed you.
You'll see her tomorrow.
What if something happens to me?
You'll starve!
We haven't even seen another sleepwalker.
Oh, we aren't the last.
You don't know that.
Yes, I do!
I can feel the others.
You'll feed tomorrow.
And then you'll feed me, and then we will leave.
Nothing's gonna happen.
We just have to take care of each other.
Okay.
Remember, honey, I want you home by 5:00.
Make sure Charles understands that, okay?
Yes, mommy.
I'll be sure to pack extra didies too.
Nobody loves a smart-ass, Tanya.
She is smart, dear.
And I'm smart enough to know this is her first date with the new boy in town.
We do understand each other, don't we, tan?
You know, mom, I think we do.
Good.
Five o'clock?
Five o'clock.
Bye, darlin'.
Bye, dad.
Have a good time, honey.
I hope so!
Are we awful?
Terrible.
God, I've become my mother.
Well, you met this kid.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's terrific.
He's utterly charming.
Does it have to be her?
You care more for her than you do for me?
You know better than that.
Why are you being such a bitch?
Because I'm hungry!
You cannot be in love with this girl, Charles.
Charles!
I'll get it.
You stay here.
I love you, mom.
Do you?
Hi.
Um, I know you were supposed to pick me up, but I was nearby.
Yeah, Tanya, um... oh.
Oh, this is a bad time.
Nonsense.
I'm so glad you came by.
Thank you.
Well, we really ought to go.
The light for Tanya's pictures... will be just fine for hours yet.
Come in, Tanya.
I have something for you.
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.
I won't keep you long.
I know young people have to run and play.
Wow!
Charles said you were nice, and he was right.
He usually is.
Oh, well, thank you.
Charles is very nice himself.
You have a very beautiful home, Mrs. Brady.
Mm-hmm.
Oh!
These are beautiful figurines.
Oh, they've been in the family for a long time.
You probably wouldn't believe how long.
Uh, mom, we really ought to be going.
Soon, Charles.
Soon.
Just a second, dear.
This is beautiful.
Mmm, nice car.
Where's the trans am?
Oh, it's in the shop.
The mustang belongs to... his mother.
Wow!
Those all your cats?
There's a lot of 'em.
Oh, they're strays, but we'll get rid of them.
We're good at getting rid of pests.
There.
It finishes you, somehow.
Thank you.
That's very sweet.
Oh, sweets to the sweet, I always say.
Right, Charles?
Go on now, you two.
You'll lose the light.
Um, Mrs. Brady, it was really nice to meet you.
Oh, very nice to meet you.
This way.
Thank you, ma'am.
Uh, this is it.
It's really beautiful here.
And so are you, Tanya.
Thank you, Charles.
Well, I better get these out of the way right off.
Your mother's gonna want to know some rubbing went on out here.
Me too, Charles.
Hey, wait up!
Charles?
Charles?
Oh!
Oh, hold it.
Come on.
Hey, clovis.
Hey, clovis, what's up?
You catching a nap?
?
There comes Johnny with is pecker in his hand?
?
He's a one-balled man and he's off to the rodeo?
What are you looking at?
Hmm?
Oh, mmm, very nice.
Gotcha.
Oh, very nice.
Smile pretty.
Oh, very nice!
Ahhh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, my God!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry.
No sorries.
Charles?
Do you really feel alone like the characters in your story?
'Cause I do.
I know.
It's wonderful to feel... to feel like you're really with someone.
Together.
I think we better...
Charles... shhh.
You don't know me, Tanya.
But I want to.
Ow!
Mmm, a little slower.
But I thought we understood each other, Tanya.
I couldn't breathe.
Isn't this the excitement you were talking about, Tanya?
You're right.
We do understand each other, Tanya.
See, this is just how we live, Tanya.
No!
Tanya!
It doesn't have to hurt!
Don't you get it, Tanya?
I need you.
I need you to live!
Oh, God!
Please don't kill me!
Tanya, I don't think you're entering into the spirit of this.
Why don't you just think of yourself... as lunch?
Charles?
Peek-a-baby!
I lied!
It does have to hurt!
Feed me, Tanya.
Mother's hungry.
Just look at this shirt!
My mother's gonna kill me!
Get off me!
Get off!
Stay away from me!
Now, Tanya, when exactly did I lose your trust?
Help me!
Somebody help me!
?
So allemande left and allemande right?
?
Come on, you fuckin' Turkey get your right foot right?
?
Get off the stage you fucking jerk?
?
You know you piss me off?
Well, well...
Hold the phone!
Hold the phone!
All right.
- Help me!
- Please somebody help... help!
Oh, my God!
Help me, please!
Get me out of here!
He's trying to kill me!
Okay, calm down.
Tell me what happened.
He's right behind me!
Look, we'll get him!
You don't understand.
He's trying to kill me!
This guy have a name?
His name is Charles Brady.
He's not human!
His face changed!
Face changed?
Get in the car.
Lock it.
Yes!
Please!
No, we both have to go, please.
Look, just calm down.
No, no, wait!
No!
We both have to go!
Calm down, okay?
Everything's gonna be all... please, no!
Cop kebab!
No!
No!
Isn't this fun?
No!
No!
No!
Off me!
Get off me!
Get off me!
Oh!
I don't believe you fired a warning shot, officer.
Oh, my God!
Now... where were we, Tanya?
Oh, my God.
Unit three, unit three.
State your twenty.
Come on.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, help me, please!
Somebody help me!
Andy, get with the program.
Bye.
Hello?
Oh, God.
Help!
Somebody help me, please!
I'm at homeland, and the policeman is dead!
Please!
Please!
Please come!
Oh, God.
Please.
Please come.
- Oh.
- Oh!
Charles!
My face is so hot!
Oh, God!
I'm sorry, mom.
I tried.
I really, really tried.
It was the cat.
It was the kitty.
You were right.
We've only got each other.
Shh, shh, shh.
That doesn't matter.
Save your strength.
- How bad is it?
- Well, you'll be okay, honey.
But I'm afraid they'll be coming for us soon.
We can go, mom.
I'll be okay.
No.
We've got to stay here until you're stronger.
But I want you to help me.
Try to make yourself dim.
Will you do that for me, honey?
Go on.
Try.
I can't, mom.
I can't do it.
Oh!
It's all right.
I'll do it for both of us.
There's the car and the...
The traps!
Shh!
I'll take care of you.
Hey, buddy.
Buddy.
I ain't taking the rap on this.
I lock this place up every night.
It's not my fault if every pervert, weirdo, horny kid... go talk to someone in charge.
I'm busy.
Buddy.
Yeah?
Listen.
It's not my fault if every horny kid and weirdo, pervert comes in here.
I lock this place up.
I don't need this action!
Okay, talk to the sheriff.
I checked it six or seven times.
Sheriff, hey.
Not now.
Okay.
His name is Charles Brady, formerly of paradise falls, now living at 66 wicker street.
And the rest of it... including the make and color of the car.
Okay, well, we, we came in a red car.
And it was older.
But it wasn't a trans am.
See, he took me home in a trans am.
It was a blue trans am, and he left here in one.
- Okay.
- Listen to me!
I know I sound crazy!
You're not getting the point!
Charles isn't human.
Excuse me, miss.
Sheriff, I need to document these bruises.
All right.
Do you have to do this right now?
Yeah.
It'll just take a sec.
Don't worry.
Could you...
Just turn your head, please?
Thanks.
And the other way, please.
Oh, my God.
My camera.
Did somebody find my camera?
I took his picture in my camera.
Yes!
Develop that film.
You'll have his picture.
Get on it, a.S.A.P.
Yeah, sure.
This is officer raeburn.
He's gonna run you home.
I'll have to come over later tonight and ask you a few more questions, all right?
Okay.
Are you sure his name was Charles Brady?
That's what he said.
Do you think he was telling the truth?
I don't know.
He was...
he was very charming.
Take her home.
Excuse me.
- Um, sheriff?
- Yeah.
Will you bring the cat when you come this evening?
What for?
- The cat saved my life.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Do her parents know a class one assault did not occur?
You mean, do they know she managed to avoid being raped by the bastard?
Yes.
Okay.
Horace.
Don't let her out of your sight.
Yepper.
Here.
Drink some of this nice cold water.
It'll make you feel better.
I'm dying, mom.
No.
My boy is not going to die!
Not ever!
They're coming.
I'm going to make us dim.
I can do it.
But you have to keep perfectly quiet.
I love you.
Quiet, Charles.
It can still be all right.
I'm scared.
Charles Brady, come out with your hands open and empty.
I'm so scared, mom.
Shh.
I have to do us.
Keep still.
Dim.
Open up, Brady.
I'm in no mood to be polite!
Police!
Hands up!
Ira.
Soames.
There's nothing in the kitchen.
I told you to wait on my word.
I thought you gave it.
A lot of cats.
Well, I can see that, dick-head.
Brody, can you handle it?
Come on.
Give it a push.
Oh, shit.
What a Polish fire drill.
Get out of there!
Get back in the damn car!
Now!
Move!
Move!
Move!
Move!
Move!
What?
Cold draft.
Use one right now, could you?
I'd like to set up a couple of checkpoints in and out of town.
The perp's history by now, ira.
He killed one of my men.
Look.
All you got is one hysterical little girl with a very vivid imagination.
What about the cats?
What about 'em, ira?
Listen.
That little girl needs a good smack on the butt.
And if her mama and daddy won't do it...
I'll happily volunteer.
Stay away from her, soames.
Hmm.
This is the best meal I had since my wife passed on.
Boy, if ira found out, he'd kill me.
Well, it was already made, deputy.
Uh, there's one more ear of corn here.
Would you like it?
Well...
well, yes, ma'am.
She's been up there an awfully long time, honey.
Do you think we should... she's taking a nice hot bath.
She just needs to get clean.
Honey, is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm just getting out.
Your mother's keeping supper warm for you.
Honey?
Um... thanks, daddy, um...
I just thought I would, uh, lie down for a little while.
Could you call me when the sheriff gets here with the cat?
Yeah, I will.
I love you, honey.
I love you too, daddy.
What was that?
Who's there?
Identify yourself.
Police officers.
Maybe it was the wind.
It was not the fuckin' wind.
You're right.
That was not the fucking wind.
Who could that be?
Let me take a peek.
State police.
Probably soames.
Hope he don't think he's gonna question her before ira gets here.
I'll get this.
Hi, I'm Mary Brady, Charles' mother.
- Charles couldn't come himself.
- Donald, who is it?
I'll take care of it, Helen.
Just stay in the kitchen.
- Look, Mrs. Brady... - but I know he wanted you to have these flowers.
Donald!
Donald?
You have a lovely home, Mrs. robertson.
I've had lovely homes too.
We never stay long.
Hey!
You stay away from 'em!
If you'd just call your daughter for me.
- What?
- My son is badly hurt.
He may be dying.
Your daughter tried to kill my Charles.
Good!
I hope he dies!
I hope you both die!
I hope you both die and rot in hell!
He's my son!
My only son!
Daddy?
Mom?
Mom?
Daddy?
Oh, my God.
No!
No!
No!
Get off me!
What have you done?
This is how they came out on the camera?
That's it.
Hmm.
So was the camera moving or... no.
See?
The background and the clothes are in focus.
Hmm.
Laura, would get that damn thing.
Take a look at the collar.
Mm-hmm.
Travis sheriff's department.
Where's ira?
Horace?
What's going on?
There's a woman here.
She said she's the Brady kid's mother.
- I think she killed don robertson.
- Slow down.
There's blood everywhere!
No vegetables, no dessert.
Those are the rules.
Horace!
What's going on there?
Hello, Horace?
Come on, Horace.
Answer the phone.
Are you there?
Horace?
Answer the damn phone!
Horace!
That woman over there, see?
Hold it, right there.
Put her down.
- Put the girl down.
- Give me back my daughter!
Put her down!
Oh!
Get soames!
Every man he has!
Castle rock too!
Put her down!
Drop the gun, lady... now!
Hello, dear.
What's happening?
Where are you taking me?
To see Charles, dear.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Get back!
Let go of me!
Get in here, you bitch!
Oh, my God.
No!
Charles, my beautiful Charles!
Mommy's home.
See what mommy's brought you?
He's dead.
Look at him.
He's dead.
No!
He'snotdead!
He's sleeping.
Can't you see he's sleeping?
You know what I bet he'd love to do?
You'd like to dance, wouldn't you, my darling?
That's his favorite song.
Did you know that?
I said, did you know that?
No.
Yes.
He's a wonderful dancer.
But you don't have to take my word for it.
You can see for yourself.
What?
Dance with him.
Dance with...
with Charles.
Dance with my son.
Relax.
He's a wonderful dancer.
He'll lead.
No!
There!
That's it.
Dance.
Clovis?
No, no!
No!
No!
No!
Yes!
Now, Charles!
Now!
Good!
Good, Charles.
Feed.
- Suck her dry!
- No!
Stop!
You're killing him!
Die!
- No!
- Tanya, get out of there!
No!
Help me!
Go!
No!
Oh, my God!
Holy shit!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
No!
Now!
Now!
We've gotta go!
No!
Come on!
Wait!
Damn it!
Charles was dead, wasn't he?
Yes, he was dead!
Yes!
Let's go!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Hey, mom!
Sheriff!
No!
No!
Oh, come on!
Oh, God, help me!
Sheriff!
Oh, God.
You killed my son!
My only son!
Clovis.
It's just you and me, clovis.
Just you and me.
The end...
Martha and Carl Brody, mother and son.
No one's seen them since Tuesday.
The car is a Trans Am, blue with yellow pinstriping.
California license, ZCLG592.
No one's seen that since Tuesday either.
I hope nothing horrible happened to them.
They were so close.
Ma'am.
Ma'am, please, step back.
Sheriff?
What do you think happened?
I don't know, but somebody sure doesn't like cats.
Shit.
Looks like the place has been empty for 100 years.
Well, it hasn't.
What the hell was that?
Jesus.
It's a little girl.
What's that in her hair?
A rose.
Tanya.
- Hi.
- Shh!
He can't hear us.
Shoot.
Come on.
It'll be back.
You always get them sooner or later.
Dance with me.
I don't wanna dance.
Sure you do.
You love this one.
Come on.
What's for dinner?
Roast chicken and cranberry dressing.
Pumpkin pie for dessert.
Going anywhere tonight?
To the movies maybe.
With a friend?
With a special friend?
Ah, all by my lonesome.
Oh.
Don't ask your mother.
Well, actually there's a girl that works there.
I thought I might ask her out.
Oh, you might?
She's pretty too.
Is she nice?
I don't know.
I guess I'll find out, won't I?
Jealous?
Concerned.
Right.
Concerned.
Mm-hm.
Concerned.
Should I be jealous?
Do you like that?
Oh, Mother.

Oh!
You scared me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no.
I'll take it.
Charles Brady.
Thanks for the help, Charles Brady.
Don't mention it.
Could I get a popcorn and a medium Mr. Pibb, please?
Yes.
I'm very embarrassed.
Am I blushing?
You look good in red, Tanya.
How'd you know my name?
English, period four, Creative Writing, Mr. Fallows, the weird and terrible.
Oh, you're the new guy.
From Ohio?
Paradise Falls.
Popcorn.
Go ahead.
You mean, free?
Shh.
Heh.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
I don't suppose you'd like a ride home after work, would you?
Um, my dad picks me up.
Nice dad.
Yeah.
Besides, what would your girlfriend say if you gave the popcorn girl a ride home?
No girlfriend.
I'm new in town, remember?
Thanks.
I'll see you in class.
Oh, uh, wait.
Um...
Welcome to Travis.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, my God.
Hi.
I'm okay.
How's my girl?
I'm good, Dad.
Good.
Fasten your seat belt.
Tanya.
It's my son, officer.
A cat?
Yup.
Had himself one hissy fit, I'll tell you.
I'm sorry, officer.
It's late, but this allergy is so severe.
Yeah, I know.
I got one too.
Mine's to the IRS.
Y'all have a good night.
Thank you, officer.
It just ignored the trap.
It was right by the window.
It's okay.
It's gone now.
I'll set some more traps in the morning.
Did you bring me anything?
Anything special in mind?
Am I beautiful?
You're always beautiful, Mother.
So did you ask this mystery girl out?
What kind of a girl would go out with a guy she just met?
Not a very nice one, I suppose.
Another one?
Goddamn cats.
Don't swear, Mother.
Just you make sure you ask her out tomorrow.
What's her name?
Tanya Robertson.
Is she nice?
She's nice.
I'm sure of it.
She's pure.
Good.
I'm famished, Charles.
Famished.
They were sleepwalkers, hiding in human robes, feeding on virtue.
Loving to feed, feeding to breed.
So in the end, they ran.
In the end, Robbie and his mother always had to run.
For one night, the men would come, in their old cars, men with lights and guns.
And to the boy and his mother, their curses and their screams of rage always sound the same, like the laughter of cruel gods.
The time of happiness, too brief to be anything but golden, had run out."
Very good, Charles.
Very good.
Your teachers in Ohio must've been sorry to lose such a creative young man.
I beg your pardon, Mr. Fallows?
Isn't that where you transferred from?
Ohio?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Hey.
Psst.
Ah, shit!
I suggest next time you keep your hands to yourself, Mr. Crawford.
Yes, sir.
- Asshole.
- All right.
Any thoughts on Mr. Brady's "Sleepwalkers"?
Miss Robertson?
I liked it.
You liked it?
It was different.
I thought it was very sad.
Sad?
Why?
Because they were always driven away.
Because they were such outsiders.
I think Miss Robertson might be on to something.
Now, we all understand that a story has to have a beginning, a middle and an end.
Right?
But that's like saying a box has four sides.
Actually, Mr. Fallows, a box has six sides.
Busted.
I'm just kidding.
You've actually talked to him?
Yeah, he's nice.
Real nice.
I'm serious.
I can see that.
Well, what happened?
Did he ask you out or anything?
Nothing specific.
Just a maybe.
We just talked at the theater.
- That's all you would've done anyway.
What a waste.
Well, excuse me, but what would you have done?
Everything.
Everything.
Well, I may have plans of my own and they just might include Homeland.
Ooh.
Yeah, right.
I can just see you in the backseat at Homeland.
Tanya, you gotta admit, I mean, your dad's gonna be there.
My dad's not gonna be there.
Your dad--
Hi.
Charles.
Hi.
Charles.
Um, do you know Jeanette and Carrie?
This is Charles Brady.
Hi.
We are in the same class, Tanya.
Oh.
Can I give you a ride home?
I mean all of you?
Um...
No, we've got a ride.
But why don't you go, Tanya?
Okay, see you later.
I also wanted to thank you.
For what?
For what you said in class.
I mean, you really nailed it.
No, you did.
So thank you.
I think I know how they feel, the--
What are they called?
Sleepwalkers.
Sleepwalkers.
At least sometimes I feel that different.
Madam.
This yours?
You like it?
Yeah.
Whoa!
You know, some people use a door.
Really?
Yes.
Did you?
I heard that somewhere.
Mm-hm.
Mom?
Mom?
She must be shopping or something.
Let's go upstairs.
Okay.
Thanks for the ride home.
Any time.
Ah, wow, these are interesting.
My mom does gravestone rubbings.
Pretty morbid, huh?
No, I like them.
You do?
Yeah.
Eww.
My room.
Oh, you got a lot of pictures.
Yeah, it's kind of a hobby.
Oh, these are great.
Really nice.
Makes you want to, uh...
What?
Oh.
Just really get a good look at these kind of places.
You know, the things that we never really see.
My favorite picture's over there.
Which one?
Uh...
Whew.
Um...
That one.
I like rocks.
You do?
I'd really like to see how you see a photograph before you take it.
I mean, you don't even know me, but...
Well, actually, I was gonna shoot at Homeland tomorrow, if...
Well, if you wanna come.
What's Homeland?
Oh, it's an old graveyard.
Really?
Yeah.
It's neat.
I love old graveyards.
Sweetheart-
- Oh.
Mom.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't know you had company.
Oh, this is Charles Brady.
This is my mom.
Charles.
He gave me a ride home.
Oh, that's nice.
Charles.
Very nice to meet you.
Likewise.
Well, we should go.
We were just going.
So we'll do that tomorrow?
Yes.
Okay.
I'll walk you out.
Okay.
So you two are going out tomorrow?
Yes.
Tanya's gonna show me, um...
Shh.
Homeland.
Oh, really?
You see, I do rubbings too.
Not quite as fine as yours, but there must be old slate gravestones out there.
Uh, yes.
As a matter of fact, in the old section near the woods.
Tell me, do you use powder or stick?
I use stick.
Usually a number five.
Don't you find that a little hard?
Yeah, but I'm clumsy, you know, and powder's so messy and everything.
Tell me, Charles, where do you live?
66 Wicker Street.
And your father?
What does he do?
He's dead, Mrs. Robertson.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It was a long time ago.
Well, the Brands will be coming to dinner tomorrow night, so be back by 5, okay?
Okay.
She will be.
How'd you know all that stuff?
I learned it a long time ago from my mom.
See you tomorrow.
Okay.

Mr. Fallows.
Hi.
Hello, Charles.
Checking out your new environment?
Boring, isn't it?
Disneyland for cows, but for human beings?
Well, I like it.
It's kind of peaceful.
Reminds you of Ohio, I suppose?
Yeah, well, you know--
No.
Actually, I don't, Charles.
I don't know and you don't either.
There is no Paradise Falls in Ohio.
Your transcripts are also fakes.
Clever fakes, but fakes.
Anything to say?
You're mistaken.
Oh, no, I'm not.
But you are, Charles, if you think you can wiggle out of this.
I don't know who you are, but I know you're not who you say you are.
If this is blackmail, Mr. Fallows, you've picked the wrong guy.
This car's the only expensive thing I got.
I'm kind of sentimental about it.
I don't think I can sell it.
Ow!
Sit still till I'm through with you.
Your generation is so mercenary, Charles.
Money this, money that.
Well, money is not the only medium of exchange.
You're right.
People should learn to keep their hands to themselves.
Here's yours.
I'm sorry!
Come on, boy, get the bad guy for Daddy.
You know you want it.
Get this bad guy.
Come on.
Here you go, here you go.
Here you go, Clovis.
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy, get the bad guy.
Get the bad guy.
Get the bad guy.
Come on, Clovis.
Here we go.
Get that motherfucker.
All right.
Good boy, Clovis.
Yeah, that's a good boy.
Oh, Clovis.
Well, Clovis, looks like we found ourselves a goddamned speedster.
Unit 3 calling home.
You in there, Laurie?
Come on.
Andy, what you up to?
Bye.
Got ourselves one lawless perpetrator heading east out here on Gray Road.
Copy?
Copy.
Need any help?
Bye.
No.
I think I can handle this one all by myself.
What the--?
Jesus.
Oh, shit!
Jesus, no!
- Is everybody okay?
- Go get him.
You son of a bitch.
Report, Unit 3.
Need a location.
I'm out on Pond Road, Laurie, still in pursuit.
Bastard almost ran down a little girl.
I think he tried to run her down.
And I think he's playing with me.
Get me some backup.
Bye.
Pull over!
Pull over, motherfucker!
Pull over!
What the fuck?
What's going on out there, Andy?
Please respond.
Not now, Laurie.
Christ, Clovis, what's he got in there?
A supercharger?
I lost him.
How in the hell did I do that?
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me, you fucking cat.
Shit, Clovis.
I know just how you feel.
Can I tell you something, Ira?
It's kind of weird, but, uh...
Horace, if you laugh, I'm gonna break your jaw.
What is it?
I told you I couldn't see him because of how fast we were going.
Yeah.
That wasn't entirely true.
How's that?
We were both doing 90.
I pulled beside him.
We might have been standing still.
So you did get a good look at him.
No, no, I didn't.
Because...
You see...
He didn't have no face.
Andy, you got plenty of sick time coming.
Horace, shut your piehole.
I mean, his face, it was like a blur, like...
Shit, I don't know.
Maybe you got some grit in your eye.
Makes them water.
Yeah, I guess maybe that could've been it.
Andy, do me a favor.
When you do get this stampeder, just leave that part out when you're talking to the county prosecutor, okay?
Anything else, Andy?
Anything at all?
Yeah.
There was something.
Clovis here got a good look at him.
He didn't like him.
He didn't like him one little bit.
And it was the other guy too, he didn't like Clovis.
It was like he was scared of him.
Scared of a cat.
Hm.
I'm gonna look for this guy on my way home, and I'm gonna find him.
I'm gonna find him.
You didn't get it?
No.
Why didn't you get anything?
I just couldn't.
What about the girl?
It wasn't the right time.
Tomorrow.
I can get it tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I'm starving, Charles.
I need it, and you have to get it for me.
Oh, my poor baby.
What happened?
What always happens, Mom.
Someone saw you?
The deputy had a cat.
Maybe for a second or two.
He won't believe what he saw.
No, he probably won't.
Somebody will find the teacher that I dumped in the woods.
It's already started again, Mom.
Don't worry.
Don't worry But I have to feed you.
You'll see her tomorrow.
What if something happens to me?
You'll starve.
We haven't even seen another sleepwalker.
Oh, we aren't the last.
You don't know that.
Yes, I do.
I can feel the others.
You'll feed tomorrow, and then you'll feed me and then we'll leave.
Nothing's gonna happen.
We just have to take care of each other.
Okay.
Remember, I want you home by 5.
Make sure Charles understands that, okay?
Yes, Mommy, and I'll be sure to pack extra didies too.
Nobody loves a smart-ass, Tanya.
She is smart, dear.
And I'm smart enough to know this is her first date with a new boy in town.
We do understand each other, don't we, Tans?
You know, Mom, I think we do.
Good, 5:00?
Five o'clock.
Bye, darling.
Bye, Dad.
Have a good time, honey.
I hope so.
Are we awful?
Terrible.
God, I've become my mother.
Well, you met this kid.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's terrific.
He's utterly charming.
Does it have to be her?
You care more for her than you do for me.
You know better than that.
Why are you being such a bitch?
Because I'm hungry.
You cannot be in love with this girl, Charles.
Charles.
I'll get it.
You stay here.
I love you, Mom.
Do you?
Hi.
I know you were supposed to pick me up, but I was nearby.
Yeah, Tanya, uh...
Oh.
Oh, this is a bad time.
Nonsense.
I'm so glad you came by.
Thank you.
We ought to go.
The light for Tanya's pictures...
Will be just fine for hours yet.
Come in, Tanya.
I have something for you.
You do?
Mm-hm.
I won't keep you long.
I know young people have to run and play.
Wow.
Charles said you were nice.
He was right.
He usually is.
Oh, thank you.
Charles is very nice himself.
You have a very beautiful home, Mrs. Brady.
Mm-hm.
Oh...
Wow, these are beautiful figurines.
They've been in the family for a long time.
You probably wouldn't believe how long.
Mom, we really ought to be going.
Soon, Charles.
Soon.
Just a second, dear.
This is beautiful.
Mm.
Nice car.
Where's the Trans Am?
It's in the shop.
The Mustang belongs to-- His mother.
TANYA:
Wow.
Are those all your cats?
There's a lot.
Oh, they're strays, but we'll get rid of them.
We're good at getting rid of pests.
There.
It finishes you somehow.
Thank you.
That's very sweet.
Oh, sweets to the sweet, I always say.
Right, Charles?
Go on now, you two.
You'll lose the light.
Um, Mrs. Brady, it was really nice to meet you.
Oh, very nice to meet you.
This way.
Thank you, ma'am.
Uh, this is it.
It's really beautiful here.
And so are you, Tanya.
Thank you, Charles.
I better get these out of the way right off.
Your mother's gonna wanna know some rubbing went on out here.
Me too, Charles.
Hey, wait up!
Charles?
Charles?
Oh!
Oh, hold it.
Come on.
Hey, Clovis.
Hey, Clovis, what's up?
You catching a nap?
# There comes Johnny With his pecker in his hand #
# He's a one-balled man And he's off to the rodeo #
What are you looking at?
Hmm?
Ah.
Ooh, very nice.
Gotcha.
Oh, very nice.
Smile pretty.
Oh, very nice.
Ah!
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, my God.
Sorry.
No sorries.
Charles, do you really feel alone like the characters in your story?
Because I do.
I know.
It's wonderful to feel...
To feel like you're really with someone.
Together.
Look, I think we better-- Charles.
Shh.
You don't know me, Tanya.
But I want to.
Ow.
A little slower.
But I thought we understood each other, Tanya.
I couldn't breathe.
Isn't this the excitement you were talking about?
You're right.
We do understand each other, Tanya.
See, this is just how we live, Tanya.
No!
Tanya.
It doesn't have to hurt.
Don't you get it, Tanya?
I need you.
I need you to live.
Oh, God, please don't kill me.
Tanya, I don't think you're entering into the spirit of this.
Why don't you just think of yourself as lunch?
Tanya.
Charles?
Peek a baby!
I lied.
It does have to hurt.
Feed me, Tanya.
Mother's hungry.
Just look at this shirt.
My mother's gonna kill me.
Get off me.
Get off.
Stay away from me.
Now, Tanya, when exactly did I lose your trust?
Help me!
Somebody help me!
# So allemande left and allemande right #
# Come on, you fucking turkey Get your right foot right #
# Get off the stage, you fucking jerk You know #
# You piss me off #
Well, well...
Hold the phone.
Hold the phone.
All right.
Help me!
Please somebody help!
Help!
Oh, my God.
Get me out of here.
He's trying to kill me.
Calm down.
Tell me what happened.
He's right behind me.
We'll get him.
You don't understand.
He's trying to kill me.
This guy have a name?
Charles Brady.
He's not human.
His face changed.
Get in the car.
Lock it.
Lock it.
No, we both have to go, please.
Look, just calm down.
No, no, wait.
No, we both have to go.
Calm down, okay?
Please, no.
Everything's gonna be all--
Cop kebab!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Isn't this fun?
No!
Get off!
Get off me!
Get off me!
I don't believe you fired a warning shot, officer.
Aah!
Oh, my God.
Now, where were we, Tanya?
Oh, my God.
Unit 3, Unit 3, state your 20.
Come on.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Help me, please.
Somebody help me.
Andy, get with the program.
Bye.
Hello?
Oh, God.
Hello?
Somebody help me, please.
I'm at Homeland.
The policeman is dead.
Please.
Please, please come.
Oh, God.
Please.
Please come.
Charles.
My face is so hot.
Come on.
I'm sorry, Mom.
I tried.
I really, really tried.
It was the cat.
It was the kitty.
You were right.
We've only got each other.
Shh, shh, shh.
It doesn't matter.
Save your strength.
How bad is it'?
Well, you'll be okay, honey.
But I'm afraid they'll be coming for us soon.
We can go, Mom.
I'll be okay.
No.
We've got to stay here until you're stronger.
But I want you to help me.
Try to make yourself dim.
Will you do that for me, honey?
Go on.
TY
I can't, Mom.
I can't do it.
It's all right.
I'll do it for both of us.
There's the car and the traps and...
Shh, shh, shh.
I'll take care of you.
Hey, buddy.
I ain't taking the rap on this.
I lock this place up every night.
It's not my fault if every pervert-- Don't talk to me.
Go talk to someone in charge.
I'm busy.
Buddy.
Yeah?
Listen.
It's not my fault if every horny kid and weirdo, pervert comes in here.
I lock this place up.
I don't need this.
Okay, don't talk to me, talk to the sheriff.
Yeah, I'll get right on it.
Get that...
That's impossible.
Sir, I checked it six or seven times.
Sheriff, hey Not now.
Okay.
His name is Charles Brady, formerly of Paradise Falls, now living at 66 Wicker Street.
And the rest of it, including the make and color of the car.
Okay, we came in a red car.
And it was older.
But it wasn't-- It wasn't the Trans Am.
See, he took me home in a Trans Am.
It was a blue Trans Am.
And he left here in one.
Okay.
Listen to me.
I know I sound crazy.
You're not getting the point.
Charles isn't human.
Excuse me, miss.
Sheriff, I need to document these bruises.
All right.
Do you have to do this now?
It'll just take a sec.
Don't worry.
Could you just turn your head, please?
Thanks.
And the other way, please.
Oh, my God.
My camera.
Did somebody find my camera?
I took his picture in my camera.
Yes.
Develop that film.
You'll have his picture.
Get on it ASAP.
Yeah, sure.
This is Officer Rayburn.
He's gonna run you home.
I'll have to come over later tonight and ask you more questions, all right?
Okay.
Are you sure his name was Charles Brady?
That's what he said.
Do you think he was telling the truth?
I don't know.
He was...
He was very charming.
Take her home.
Excuse me.
Um, sheriff?
Yeah?
Will you bring the cat when you come this evening?
What for'?
The cat saved my life.
Okay.
Thank you.
Do her parents know assault did not occur?
Do they know she managed to avoid being raped by the bastard?
Yes.
Okay.
Horace.
Don't let her out of your sight.
Yupper.
Here.
Drink some of this nice cold water.
It'll make you feel better.
I'm dying, Mom.
No.
My boy is not going to die.
Not ever!
They're coming.
I'm going to make us dim.
I can do it.
But you have to keep perfectly quiet.
I love you.
Quiet, Charles.
It can still be all right.
I'm scared.
Charles Brady, if you're in there, come out with your hands open and empty.
I'm so scared, Mom.
Shh.
I have to do us.
Keep still.
Dim.
Open up, Brady!
I'm in no mood to be polite!
Police!
Hands up!
Ira, Soames, there's nothing in the kitchen.
I told you to wait on my word.
I thought you gave it.
There's a lot of cats.
Well, I can see that, dickhead.
Come on.
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.
- Help him up.
- What a Polish fire drill.
Get out of there!
Get back in the damn car.
Now.
Move.
Move!
Move!
What?
It's a cold draft.
Use one right now, could you?
I'd like to set up a couple of checkpoints in and out of town.
The perp's history by now, Ira.
He killed one of my men.
Look, all you got is one hysterical little girl with a very vivid imagination.
What about the cats?
What about them, Ira?
That little girl needs a good smack on the butt.
And if her mama and daddy won't do it,
I'll happily volunteer.
Stay away from her, Soames.
Hm.
This is the best meal I had since my wife passed on.
Boy, if Ira found out, he'd kill me.
Well, it was already made, deputy.
There's one more ear of corn here.
Would you like it?
Well, uh...
Well, yes, ma'am.
She's been up there an awfully long time, honey.
Do you think we should--?
She's taking a nice hot bath.
She just needs to get clean.
Okay.
Honey, is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm just getting out.
Your mother's keeping supper warm for you.
Honey?
Um...
Thanks, Daddy.
Um...
I just thought I would lie down for a little while.
Could you call me when the sheriff gets here with the cat?
Yeah, I will.
I love you, honey.
I love you too, Daddy.
What was that?
Who's there?
Identify yourself.
Police officers.
Maybe it was the wind.
It was not the fucking wind.
You're right, that was not the fucking wind.
Who could that be?
Let me take a peek.
State police.
Probably Soames.
Hope he don't think he's gonna question her before Ira gets here.
I'll get this.
Hi.
I'm Mary Brady, Charles' mother.
Charles couldn't come himself.
Donald, who is it?
I'll take care of it, Helen.
Just stay in the kitchen.
Look, Mrs. Brady...
I know he wanted you to have these flowers.
Donald!
Donald?
You have a lovely home, Mrs. Robertson.
I've had lovely homes too.
We never stay long though.
Hey.
You stay away from them.
If you'd just call your daughter for me.
What?
My son is badly hurt.
He may be dying.
Your daughter tried to kill my Charles.
Good.
I hope he dies.
I hope you both die.
I hope you both die and rot in hell!
He's my son.
My only son.
Daddy?
Mom?
Mom?
Daddy?
Oh, my God.
Daddy.
No!
Get off!
Get off me!
What have you done?
- This is how they came out?
- That's it.
So was the camera moving or...?
No.
See?
The background and the clothes are in focus.
Laurie, would you get that damn thing?
Take a look at the collar.
Mm-hm.
Travis Sheriff's Department.
Where's Ira?
What's going on?
There's a woman here.
She said she's the Brady kid's mother.
She killed Don Robertson.
Slow down, Horace.
There's blood everywhere!
No vegetables, no dessert.
Those are the rules.
Horace!
What's going on?
Hello, Horace?
Come on, Horace.
Answer the phone.
Are you there?
Horace ?
Answer the damn phone!
Horace!
Get that woman over there to safety.
Hold it, right there.
Put her down.
Put the girl down.
Give me back my daughter!
Put her down!
Get Soames, every man he has.
Castle Rock too.
Put her down!
Drop the gun, lady.
Now!
Hello, dear.
What's happening?
Where are you taking me?
To see Charles, dear.
No!
No!
No!
Come on.
No!
Let go of me!
Get in here, you bitch.
Oh, my God.
Charles.
My beautiful Charles, Mommy's home.
See what Mommy's brought you.
He's dead.
Look at him.
He's dead.
No!
He's not dead!
He's sleeping.
Can't you see he's sleeping?
You know what I bet he'd love to do?
You'd like to dance, wouldn't you, my darling?
That's his favorite song.
Did you know that?
I said, did you know that?
No.
Yes.
He's a wonderful dancer.
But you don't have to take my word for it.
You can see for yourself.
What?
Dance with him.
Dance with...
With Charles.
Dance with my son.
Relax.
He's a wonderful dancer.
He'll lead.
- No!
- There.
That's it.
Dance.
Clovis?
No.
No.
No.
No!
No!
No!
Yes.
Now, Charles.
Now.
Good.
Good, Charles.
Feed.
Suck her dry.
No!
Stop!
You're killing him!
Die!
- No!
- Tanya, get out of there!
No!
Help me!
Go!
No!
Holy shit.
Wait, wait, wait!
No!
No!
Come on!
We've gotta go!
Come on!
Damn it.
Wait.
Charles was dead, wasn't he?
He was dead, wasn't he?
Wasn't he?
He was dead!
Yes!
Let's go!
No!
No!
No!
IRA:
Hey, Mom!
Sheriff!
No.
Oh, come on!
Oh, God, help me!
God, help me!
Okay.
You killed my son!
My only son!
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Clovis.
It's just you and me, Clovis.
Just you and me.
Martha and Carl Brodie, mother and son.
No one's seen them since Tuesday.
The car is a Trans Am, blue with yellow pinstriping.
California license: 2CLG592.
No one's seen that since Tuesday, either.
God, I just hope nothing horrible happened to them.
They were so close!
Ma'am, please, step back.
Sheriff, what do you think happened?
I don't know, but somebody sure doesn't like cats.
Shit!
Looks like the place has been empty for a hundred years.
Well, it hasn't.
What the hell was that?
Jesus!
It's a little girl.
What's that in her hair?
A rose.
Tanya.
- Hi.
- Shh.
He can't hear us.
Shit!
Come on.
He'll be back.
You always get 'em sooner or later.
Dance with me.
- I don't wanna dance.
- Sure, you do.
You'll love this one.
Come on.
What's for dinner?
Roast chicken and cranberry dressing.
Pumpkin pie for dessert.
- Going anywhere tonight?
- To the movies maybe.
With a friend?
With a special friend?
All by my lonesome.
Don't ask your mother.
Well, actually, there's a girl that works there.
I thought I might ask her out.
Oh, you might?
She's pretty too.
Is she nice?
I don't know.
I guess I'll find out, won't I?
Jealous?
Concerned.
Right.
Concerned.
Mm-hmm, concerned.
Should I be jealous?
Do you like that?
Oh, Mother.
- You scared me.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
Oh, no.
I'll take that.
Charles Brady.
- Thanks for the help, Charles Brady.
- Don't mention it.
Could I get a popcorn and a medium Mr. Pibb, please?
Yes.
I'm very embarrassed.
Am I blushing?
You look good in red, Tanya.
How'd you know my name?
English, period four, Creative Writing.
Mr. Fallows, the weird and terrible.
Oh, you're the new guy.
From Ohio?
Paradise Falls.
Popcorn.
Go ahead.
You mean free?
Thanks.
I don't suppose you'd like a ride home after work tonight, would you?
My dad picks me up.
- Nice dad.
- Yeah.
Besides, what would your girlfriend say if you gave the popcorn girl a ride?
No girlfriend.
I'm new in town, remember?
Thanks.
I'll see you in class.
Oh, wait!
Welcome to Travis.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, my God!
Hi!
I'm okay.
How's my girl?
I'm good, Dad.
Good.
Fasten your seat belt.
Tanya.
It's my son, officer.
Cat?
Having himself one hissy fit, I'll tell you.
I'm sorry, officer.
It's late, but this allergy is so severe.
Yeah, I know.
I got one too.
Mine's to the I.R.S.
Y'all have a good night.
Thank you, officer.
It just ignored the trap.
It was right by the window.
It's okay.
It's gone now.
I'll set some more traps in the morning.
Did you bring me anything?
Anything special in mind?
Am I beautiful?
You're always beautiful, Mother.
So, did you ask this mystery girl out?
What kind of a girl would go out with a guy she just met?
Not a very nice one, I suppose.
- Another one?
- Goddamn cats.
Don't swear, Mother.
Just you make sure you ask her out tomorrow.
What's her name?
Tanya Robertson.
Is she nice?
She's nice.
I'm sure of it.
She's pure.
Good.
I'm famished, Charles.
Famished!
"They were sleepwalkers, hiding in human robes.
Feeding on virtue.
Loving to feed, feeding to breed.
So, in the end, they ran.
In the end, Robbie and his mother always had to run.
For one night, the men would come in their old cars... men with lights and guns.
And to the boy and his mother... their curses and their screams of rage always sound the same.
Like the laughter of cruel gods.
The time of happiness... too brief to be anything but golden, had run out."
Very good, Charles.
Very good.
Your teachers in Ohio must have been sorry to lose such a creative young man.
I beg your pardon, Mr. Fallows?
Isn't that where you transferred from?
Ohio?
Oh, yes.
Yes, it is.
Hey.
Shit!
I suggest that next time you keep your hands to yourself, Mr. Crawford.
Yes, sir.
Asshole.
All right, any thoughts on Mr. Brady's Sleepwalkers?
Miss Robertson?
I liked it.
You liked it?
It was different.
I thought it was very sad.
Sad?
Why?
Because they were always driven away.
Because they were such outsiders.
I think Miss Robertson might be on to something.
Now, we all understand that a story... has to have a beginning, a middle and an end, right?
But that's like saying a box has four sides.
Actually, Mr. Fallows, a box has six sides.
Busted!
You've actually talked to him?
Yeah, he's nice.
Real nice.
- I'm serious!
- I can see that.
Well, what happened?
Did he ask you out or anything?
Nothing specific, just a maybe.
We just talked at the theater.
That's all you would've done anyway.
What a waste!
Well, excuse me, but what would you have done?
Everything.
Everything!
Well, I may have plans of my own... and they just might include Homeland.
Yeah, right.
I can just see you in the back seat at Homeland.
You guys!
Tanya, you gotta admit, your dad's gonna be there.
- I can just see it.
- My dad's not gonna be there.
Hi.
Charles, hi.
Charles, do you know Jeanette and Carrie?
This is Charles Brady.
- Hi.
- We are in the same class, Tanya.
Oh.
Can I give you a ride home?
I mean, all of you?
No, we've got a ride.
But why don't you go, Tanya?
Okay, see you later.
I also wanted to thank you.
For what?
For what you said in class.
I mean, you really nailed it.
No, you did, so thank you.
I think I know how they feel, the...
What are they called?
- Sleepwalkers.
- Sleepwalkers.
At least sometimes I feel that different.
- Madam.
- This yours?
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.
Whoa!
You know, some people use a door.
- Really?
- Yes.
- I heard that somewhere.
- Did you?
Mom?
Mom?
She must be shopping or something.
Let's go upstairs.
Okay.
- Thanks for the ride home.
- Anytime.
Oh, wow!
These are interesting.
My mom does gravestone rubbings.
Pretty morbid, huh?
- No, I like 'em.
- You do?
Yeah.
My room.
Oh, you have a lot of pictures.
Yeah, it's kind of a hobby.
Oh, these are great!
Really nice.
- Makes you want to...
- What?
Oh!
Just really get a good look at these kind of places.
You know, things that we never really see.
My favorite picture's over there.
Which one?
That one.
I like rocks.
You do?
You know, I'd really like to see how you see a photograph before you take it...
I mean, you don't even know me, but...
Well, actually, I was gonna shoot at Homeland tomorrow if...
- Well, if you want to come.
- What's Homeland?
- Oh, it's... it's an old graveyard.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's neat.
- I love old graveyards.
- Sweetheart...
- Mom!
I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't know you had company.
This is Charles Brady.
This is my mom.
He gave me a ride home.
Oh, that's nice.
Very nice to meet you.
Likewise.
Well, we should go.
We were just going.
So we'll do that tomorrow?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- I'll walk you out.
- Okay.
So you two are going out tomorrow?
Yes.
Tanya's gonna show me...
Homeland.
Oh, really?
You see, I do rubbings too.
Not quite as fine as yours... but I figure there must be some old slate gravestones out there.
Yes, as a matter of fact... in the old section near the woods.
Tell me, Charles, do you use powder or stick?
I use stick.
Usually a number five.
Really?
Don't you find that a little hard?
Yeah, but, I'm clumsy.
You know, powder's so messy.
- Tell me, Charles, where do you live?
- 66 Wicker Street.
- Your father, what does he do?
- He's dead, Mrs. Robertson.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It was a long time ago.
Well, the Brands will be coming to dinner tomorrow night.
So be back by 5:00, okay?
- Okay.
- She will be.
How'd you know all that stuff?
I learned it a long time ago, from my mom.
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.
Mr. Fallows!
Hi.
Hello, Charles.
Checking out your new environment?
Boring, isn't it?
Disneyland for cows.
But for human beings?
Well, I like it.
It's kind of peaceful.
Reminds you of Ohio, I suppose?
Yeah, well, you know...
No, actually, I don't, Charles.
I don't know.
And you don't, either.
There is no Paradise Falls in Ohio.
Your transcripts are also fakes.
Clever fakes, but fakes.
Anything to say?
- You're mistaken.
- Oh, no, I'm not.
But you are, Charles, if you think you can wiggle out of this.
I don't know who you are, but I know you're not who you say you are.
If this is blackmail, Mr. Fallows, I think you've picked the wrong guy.
This car is the only expensive thing I've got.
I'm kind of sentimental about it.
I don't think I can sell it.
- Ow!
- Sit still till I'm through with you.
Your generation is so mercenary, Charles.
Money this, money that.
Well, money is not the only medium of exchange.
You're right.
People really should learn to keep their hands to themselves.
Here's yours.
I'm sorry!
Come on, boy.
Get the bad guy for Daddy.
You know you want him.
Get this bad guy.
There you go.
There you go, Clovis.
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy.
Get the bad guy.
Get the bad guy.
Get the bad guy.
Come on, Clovis.
Here we go.
Get that motherfucker!
All right!
Good boy, Clovis!
Yeah, that's a good boy.
Huh, Clovis?
Well, Clovis...
looks like we found ourselves a goddamn speedster.
Unit Three calling home.
You in there, Laurie?
Come on.
Andy, what you up to?
Bye.
Got ourselves one lawless perpetrator heading east out here on Gray Road.
- Copy.
- Copy.
Need any help?
Bye.
No.
I think I can handle this one all by myself.
What the...
Jesus!
Oh, shit!
Jesus, no!
- Everybody okay?
- Go get him!
Son of a bitch.
Report, Unit Three.
Need a location.
I'm out on Pond Road, Laurie, still in pursuit.
Bastard almost ran down a little girl!
I think he tried to run her down.
I think he's playing with me!
Get me some backup!
Bye.
Pull over!
Pull over, motherfucker!
Pull over!
What the fuck?
What's going on out there, Andy?
Please respond!
Not now, Laurie.
Christ, Clovis!
What's he got in there?
A supercharger?
I lost him.
How in the hell did I do that?
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me, you fucking cat!
Shit, Clovis.
I know just how you feel.
Can I tell you something, Ira?
It's kind of weird, but...
Horace, if you laugh, I'm gonna break your jaw.
What is it?
You know how I told you I couldn't see him because of how fast we were going?
- Yeah.
- Well, that wasn't entirely true.
How's that?
Well, we were both doing 90.
I pulled right up beside him.
We might as well have been standing still!
So you did get a look at him.
Well, no, no, I didn't.
'Cause see... he didn't have no face.
Andy, you got plenty of sick time comin'.
Horace, shut your pie hole.
I mean his face, it was like a blur!
Like...
Shit, I don't know.
Maybe you got some grit in your eye.
Makes 'em water.
Yeah, I guess maybe that could've been it.
Andy, do me a favor.
When you do get this stampeder... just leave that part out when you talk to the county prosecutor, okay?
Anything else, Andy?
Anything at all?
Yeah, there was something.
Clovis here got a good look at him, and he didn't like him.
He didn't like him one little bit.
And it was the other guy too.
He didn't like Clovis!
It was like he was scared of him.
Scared of a cat!
I'm gonna look for this guy on my way home... and I'm gonna find him.
I'm gonna find him!
- You didn't get it?
- No.
- Why didn't you get anything?
- I just couldn't.
What about the girl?
It wasn't the right time.
Tomorrow.
I'll get it tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I'm starving, Charles!
I need it, and you have to get it for me!
Oh, my poor baby!
What happened?
What always happens, Mom?
Someone saw you?
The deputy had a cat.
Maybe for a second or two.
- He won't believe what he saw.
- No, he probably won't.
Somebody will find the teacher that I dumped in the woods.
It's already started again, Mom!
- Don't worry.
Don't worry.
- But I have to feed you.
- You'll see her tomorrow.
- What if something happens to me?
You'll starve!
We haven't even seen another sleepwalker.
- Oh, we aren't the last.
- You don't know that.
Yes, I do!
I can feel the others.
You'll feed tomorrow.
And then you'll feed me, and then we will leave.
Nothing's gonna happen.
We just have to take care of each other.
Okay.
Remember, honey, I want you home by 5:00.
Make sure Charles understands that, okay?
Yes, Mommy.
I'll be sure to pack extra didies too.
- Nobody loves a smart-ass, Tanya.
- She is smart, dear.
And I'm smart enough to know this is her first date with the new boy in town.
We do understand each other, don't we, Tan?
You know, Mom, I think we do.
Good. 5:00?
5:00.
- Bye, darlin'.
- Bye, Dad.
- Have a good time, honey.
- I hope so!
Are we awful?
Terrible.
God, I've become my mother.
Well, you met this kid.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's terrific.
He's utterly charming.
- Does it have to be her?
- You care more for her than for me?
You know better than that.
Why are you being such a bitch?
Because I'm hungry!
You cannot be in love with this girl, Charles.
I'll get it.
You stay here.
I love you, Mom.
Do you?
Hi.
I know you were supposed to pick me up, but I was nearby.
Yeah, Tanya...
Oh, this is a bad time.
Nonsense.
I'm so glad you came by.
Thank you.
Well, we really ought to go.
The light for Tanya's pictures...
Will be just fine for hours yet.
Come in, Tanya.
I have something for you.
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.
I won't keep you long.
I know young people have to run and play.
Wow!
Charles said you were nice, and he was right.
He usually is.
Oh, well, thank you.
Charles is very nice himself.
You have a very beautiful home, Mrs. Brady.
Wow.
These are beautiful figurines.
Oh, they've been in the family for a long time.
You probably wouldn't believe how long.
Mom, we really ought to be going.
Soon, Charles.
Soon.
Just a second, dear.
This is beautiful.
Mmm, nice car.
Where's the Trans Am?
Oh, it's in the shop.
The Mustang belongs to...
His mother.
Wow!
Those all your cats?
There's a lot of'em.
Oh, they're strays, but we'll get rid of them.
We're good at getting rid of pests.
There.
It finishes you somehow.
Thank you.
That's very sweet.
Oh, sweets to the sweet, I always say.
Right, Charles?
Go on now, you two.
You'll lose the light.
Mrs. Brady, it was really nice to meet you.
Oh, very nice to meet you.
- This way.
- Thank you, ma'am.
This is it.
It's really beautiful here.
And so are you, Tanya.
Thank you, Charles.
Well, I better get these out of the way right off.
Your mother's gonna want to know some rubbing went on out here.
Me too, Charles.
Hey, wait up!
Oh, hold it.
Come on.
Hey, Clovis.
Hey, Clovis, what's up?
You catching a nap?
There comes Johnny with his pecker in his hand
He's a one-balled man and he's off to the rodeo
What are you looking at?
Oh, very nice.
Gotcha.
Oh, very nice.
Smile pretty.
Oh, very nice!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry.
No sorries.
Do you really feel alone, like the characters in your story?
'Cause I do.
I know.
It's wonderful to feel... to feel like you're really with someone.
- Together.
- I think we better...
Charles, shh.
You don't know me, Tanya.
But I want to.
Ow!
A little slower.
But I thought we understood each other, Tanya.
I couldn't breathe.
Isn't this the excitement you were talking about, Tanya?
You're right.
We do understand each other, Tanya.
See, this is just how we live, Tanya.
It doesn't have to hurt!
Don't you get it, Tanya?
I need you.
I need you to live!
Oh, God!
Please don't kill me!
I don't think you're entering into the spirit of this.
Why don't you just think of yourself as lunch?
Peek-a-baby!
I lied!
It does have to hurt!
Feed me, Tanya.
Mother's hungry.
Just look at this shirt!
My mother's gonna kill me!
Get off me!
Get off!
Stay away from me!
Now, Tanya, when exactly did I lose your trust?
Help me!
Somebody help me!
So allemande left and allemande right
Come on, you fuckin'turkey Get your right foot right
Get off the stage you fucking jerk
You know you piss me off
Well, well... hold the phone!
Hold the phone.
- All right.
- Help me!
Please.
Somebody help!
Oh, my God.
Get me out of here!
He's trying to kill me!
- Calm down.
Tell me what happened.
- He's right behind me!
- We'll get him.
- No, you don't understand.
One thing at a time, sweetheart.
Does this guy have a name?
His name is Charles, but he's not human.
His face changed.
Get in the car!
Lock it!
- We have to go.
Please.
- Just calm down.
No.
We both have to go.
Calm down, okay?
Everything's gonna be all right.
Cop kebab.
Isn't this fun?
I don't believe you fired a warning shot, Officer.
Now, where were we, Tanya?
Oh, my God.
Unit Three, Unit Three, state your 20, come on.
Hello?
Somebody help me, please!
Andy, get with the program.
Bye.
Somebody help me, please!
A policeman is dead!
Please!
Please, please come.
Please.
Please come.
My face is so hot.
I'm sorry, Mom.
I tried.
I really, really tried.
It was the cat.
You were right.
We've only got each other.
That doesn't matter.
Save your strength.
- How bad is it?
- You'll be okay, honey.
But I'm afraid they'll be coming for us soon.
- We can go, Mom.
I'll be okay.
- No.
We've got to stay here until you're stronger.
But I want you to help me.
Try to make yourself dim.
Will you do that for me, honey?
Go on.
Try.
I can't, Mom.
I can't do it.
It's all right.
I'll do it for both of us.
There's the car and the traps.
I'll take care of you.
Buddy.
Buddy.
I ain't taking the rap on this.
I lock this place up every night.
It's not my fault if every pervert...
- weirdo, horny kid...
- Talk to someone in charge.
I'm busy.
Buddy.
Listen.
It's not my fault if every horny kid, weirdo, pervert comes in here.
I lock this place up.
I don't need this action.
Don't talk to me.
Talk to the sheriff.
- Sheriff.
Hey.
- Not now.
Okay, his name is Charles Brady, formerly of Paradise Falls... now living at 66 Wicker Street.
And the rest of it, including the make and color of the car.
We came in a red car.
And it was older.
But it wasn't the Trans Am.
He took me home in a Trans Am.
It was blue.
And he left here in one.
Listen to me!
I know I sound crazy.
You're not getting the point.
Charles isn't human.
Excuse me, miss.
Sheriff, I need to document these bruises.
All right.
- Do you have to do this now?
- It'll just take a sec.
Don't worry.
Could you turn your head, please?
Thanks.
And the other way, please?
Did somebody find my camera?
I took his picture in my camera.
Yes!
Develop that film, you'll have his picture.
- Get on it ASAP.
- Yeah, sure.
This is Officer Rayburn.
He's gonna run you home.
I'll have to come over later tonight and ask you a few more questions.
Are you sure his name is Charles Brady?
That's what he said.
- Do you think he was telling the truth?
- I don't know.
He was...
He was very charming.
Take her home.
Excuse me.
Sheriff?
- Will you bring the cat this evening?
- What for?
The cat saved my life.
Thank you.
Do her parents know a class one assault did not occur?
Do you mean she managed to avoid being raped by the bastard?
Yes.
- Don't let her out of your sight.
- Yepper.
Here.
Drink some cold water.
It'll make you feel better.
I'm dying, Mom.
My boy is not going to die.
Not ever!
They're coming.
I'm going to make us dim.
I can do it.
But you have to keep perfectly quiet.
I love you.
Quiet, Charles.
It can still be all right.
I'm scared.
Charles Brady, if you're in there, come out with your hands open and empty.
So scared, Mom.
I have to do us.
Keep still.
Dim.
Open up, Brady!
I'm in no mood to be polite!
Police!
Hands up!
Ira, Soames, there's nothing in the kitchen.
I told you to wait on my word.
I thought you gave it.
- A lot of cats.
- I can see that, dickhead.
Aw, shit.
What a Polish fire drill.
Get out of there!
Get back in the damn car.
Now!
Move!
Move!
Move!
Move, move!
What?
There's a cold draft.
Use one right now, could you?
I'd like to set up checkpoints in and out of town.
The perp's history by now, Ira.
He killed one of my men.
Look.
All you got is a hysterical girl with a very vivid imagination.
- What about the cats?
- What about 'em, Ira?
That little girl needs a good smack on the butt.
And if her mama and daddy won't do it...
I'll happily volunteer.
Stay away from her, Soames.
This is the best meal I've had since my wife passed on.
If Ira found out, he'd kill me.
It was already made, Deputy.
There's one more ear of corn here.
Would you like it?
Yes, ma'am.
She's been up there an awfully long time, honey.
- Do you think...
- She's taking a nice, hot bath.
She just needs to get clean.
Honey, is everything okay?
I'm just getting out.
Your mother's keeping supper warm for you.
Honey?
Thanks, Daddy.
I just thought I would lie down for a little while.
Could you call me when the sheriff gets here with the cat?
Yeah, I will.
I love you, honey.
I love you, too, Daddy.
What was that?
Who's there?
Identify yourself.
Police officers.
Maybe it was the wind.
It was not the fucking wind.
You're right.
That was not the fucking wind.
- Who could that be?
- Let me take a peek.
State police.
Probably Soames.
Hope he don't think he's gonna question her before Ira gets here.
I'll get this.
Hi, I'm Mary Brady, Charles' mother.
- Charles couldn't come himself.
- Donald, who is it?
I'll take care of it.
Just stay in the kitchen.
Look, Mrs. Brady...
But I know he wanted you to have these flowers.
You have a lovely home, Mrs. Robertson.
I've had lovely homes too.
We never stay long, though.
Stay away from them!
Call your daughter.
- What?
- My son is badly hurt.
He may be dying.
Your daughter tried to kill my Charles.
Good!
I hope he dies.
I hope you both die.
I hope you both die and rot in hell!
He's my son, my only son!
Daddy?
Mom?
Oh, my God.
Daddy.
Get off me!
- This is how they came from the camera?
- That's it.
So was the camera moving?
No.
See.
The background and the clothes are in focus.
Laurie, would you get that damn thing?
Look at the collar.
Sheriff's Department.
- Where's Ira?
- What's going on out there?
There's a woman here.
She says she's the Brady kid's mother.
- I think she killed Don Robertson.
- Slow down, Horace.
There's blood everywhere!
No vegetables... no dessert.
Those are the rules.
- Horace!
- What's going on here?
Come on, Horace.
Answer the phone.
Are you there?
Answer the damn phone!
Get that woman over there to safety.
Hold it right there!
Put her down.
Put the girl down.
- Give me back my daughter!
- Put her down!
Get Soames!
Every man he has!
Castle Rock too!
Put her down!
Drop the gun, lady!
Now!
Hello, dear.
- Where are you taking me?
- To see Charles, dear.
Let go of me!
Get in here, you bitch!
Oh, my God!
My beautiful Charles, Mommy's home.
See what Mommy's brought you.
He's dead.
Look at him.
He's dead.
No!
He's not dead!
He's sleeping.
Can't you see he's sleeping?
You know what I bet he'd love to do?
You'd like to dance.
Wouldn't you, my darling?
That's his favorite song.
Did you know that?
I said, did you know that?
Yes.
He's a wonderful dancer.
But you don't have to take my word for it.
You can see for yourself.
What?
Dance with him.
- Dance with...
- With Charles.
Dance with my son.
Relax.
He's a wonderful dancer.
He'll lead.
There!
That's it.
Dance.
Yes!
Now, Charles!
Now!
Good.
Good, Charles.
Feed.
Suck her dry!
Stop!
You're killing him!
Die!
Tanya!
Get out of there!
Go!
Holy shit!
- Wait a minute!
- No!
Come on!
We got to go!
Come on, damn it!
Charles was dead, wasn't he?
He was dead, yes!
Let's go!
Hey, Mom!
Sheriff!
God, help me!
Sheriff!
You killed my son!
My only son!
It's just you and me, Clovis.
Just you and me.
Martha and Carl Brodie, mother and son.
No one's seen them since Tuesday.
The car is a Trans Am, blue with yellow pinstriping.
California license: 2CLG592.
No one's seen that since Tuesday either.
God, I just hope nothing horrible happened to them.
They were so close!
Ma'am, please, step back.
Sheriff?
What do you think happened?
I don't know, but somebody sure doesn't like cats.
Shit!
Looks like the place has been empty for 100 years.
Well, it hasn't.
What the hell was that?
Jesus!
It's a little girl.
What's that in her hair?
A rose.
Tanya.
Hi!
He can't hear us.
Shoot!
Come on!
It'll be back.
You always get them sooner or later.
Dance with me.
I don't want to dance.
Sure you do.
You love this one.
What's for dinner?
Roast chicken and cranberry dressing.
Pumpkin pie for dessert.
You going anywhere tonight?
To the movies maybe.
With a friend?
With a special friend?
All by my lonesome.
Don't ask your mother.
Actually there's a girl that works there.
I thought I might ask her out.
You might?
She's pretty, too.
Is she nice?
I don't know.
I guess I'll find out, won't I?
Jealous?
Concerned.
Right.
Concerned.
Concerned.
Should I be jealous?
Do you like that?
Mother.
-You scared me.
-I'm sorry.
No.
I'll take that.
Charles Brady.
-Thanks for the help, Charles Brady.
-Don't mention it.
Could I get a popcorn and a medium Mr. Pib, please?
Yes.
I'm very embarrassed.
Am I blushing?
You look good in red, Tanya.
How'd you know my name?
English.
Period 4, Creative Writing, Mr. Fallows, the Weird and Terrible.
You're the new guy from Ohio?
Paradise Falls.
-Go ahead.
-You mean, free?
Thanks!
I don't suppose you'd like a ride home after work tonight, would you?
-My dad picks me up.
-Nice dad.
Besides, what would your girlfriend say if you gave the popcorn girl a ride home?
No girlfriend.
I'm new in town, remember?
Thanks.
I'll see you in class.
Wait!
Welcome to Travis.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Hi!
I'm okay.
How's my girl?
-I'm good, Dad.
-Good.
Fasten your seat belt.
It's my son, Officer.
A cat?
Had himself one hissy fit, I'll tell you.
I'm sorry, Officer.
It's late, but this allergy is so severe.
Yeah, I know.
I got one, too.
Mine's to the IRS.
Y'all have a good night.
Thank you, Officer.
It just ignored the trap.
It was right by the window.
It's okay.
It's gone now.
I'll set some more traps in the morning.
Did you bring me anything?
Anything special in mind?
Am I beautiful?
You're always beautiful, Mother.
So, did you ask this mystery girl out?
What kind of a girl would go out with a guy she just met?
Not a very nice one, I suppose.
-Another one?
-Goddamn cats.
Don't swear, Mother!
You make sure you ask her out tomorrow.
What's her name?
Tanya Robertson.
Is she nice?
She's nice.
I'm sure of it.
-She's pure.
-Good.
I'm famished, Charles.
"It was sleepwalkers, hiding in human robes...
"...feeding on virtue.
"Loving to feed, feeding to breed.
"So, in the end, they ran.
"In the end, Robbie and his mother always had to run.
"For one night, the men would come in their old cars...
"...men with lights and guns.
And to the boy and his mother...
"...their curses and their screams of rage always sound the same...
"...
like the laughter of cruel gods.
The time of happiness...
"...too brief to be anything but golden, had run out."
Very good, Charles.
Very good.
Your teachers in Ohio must have been sorry to lose such a creative young man.
I beg your pardon, Mr. Fallows?
Isn't that where you transferred from?
Ohio?
Yes, it is.
Shit!
I suggest that next time, you keep your hands to yourself.
Yes, sir!
Asshole.
Any thoughts on Mr. Brady's Sleepwalkers?
Miss Robertson?
I liked it.
You liked it?
It was different.
I thought it was very sad.
Sad?
Why?
Because they were always driven away.
Because they were such outsiders.
Miss Robertson might be on to something.
We all understand that a story has to have a beginning, a middle, and an end.
But that's like saying a box has four sides.
Actually, Mr. Fallows, a box has six sides.
Busted!
You've actually talked to him?
-Yeah, he's nice.
-Real nice.
-I'm serious!
-I can see that!
Well, what happened?
Did he ask you out or anything?
Nothing specific.
Just a maybe.
We just talked at the theatre.
-That's all you would've done, anyway!
-What a waste!
Excuse me, but what would you have done?
-Everything!
-"Everything!"
I may have plans of my own, and they just might include Homeland.
I can just see you in the back seat at Homeland!
Tanya, you gotta admit.
Your dad's gonna be there!
-I can just see it.
-My dad's not gonna be there!
Hi!
Charles?
Hi!
Do you know Jeanette and Carrie?
This is Charles Brady.
-Hi!
-We are in the same class, Tanya.
Can I give you a ride home?
I mean all of you?
No, we've got a ride, but why don't you go, Tanya?
See you later!
I also wanted to thank you.
For what?
For what you said in class.
You really nailed it.
No, you did.
So, thank you.
I think I know how they feel, the...
-What are they called?
-Sleepwalkers.
At least sometimes I feel that different.
-Madame.
-This yours?
-Do you like it?
-Yeah.
Some people use a door.
-Really?
-Yes.
-I heard that somewhere.
-Did you?
Mom?
Mom?
She must be shopping or something.
Let's go upstairs.
-Thanks for the ride home.
-Any time.
These are interesting.
My mom does gravestone rubbings.
Pretty morbid, huh?
No, I like them.
-You do?
-Yeah.
My room.
You have a lot of pictures.
Yeah, it's kind of a hobby.
These are great!
Really nice.
Makes you want to...
What?
Just get a good look at these kind of places.
The things that we never really see.
My favourite picture's over there.
Which one?
That one.
I like rocks.
You do?
I'd really like to see how you see a photograph before you take it.
You don't even know me, but...
Actually, I was going to shoot at Homeland tomorrow if you want to come.
What's "Homeland"?
It's an old graveyard.
-Really?
-lt's neat.
I love old graveyards.
-Sweetheart...
-Mom!
I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't know you had company.
This is Charles Brady.
This is my mom.
He gave me a ride home.
That's nice.
-Charles.
-Very nice to meet you.
Likewise.
We should go.
We were just going.
So we'll do that tomorrow?
Yes!
I'll walk you out.
So, you two are going out tomorrow?
Yes.
Tanya's gonna show me Homeland.
Oh, really?
I do rubbings, too.
Not quite as fine as yours but I figure there must be some old slate gravestones out there.
Yes.
As a matter of fact, in the old section near the woods.
Tell me, do you use powder or stick?
I use stick!
Usually a No. 5.
Really?
Don't you find that a little hard?
Yeah, but I'm clumsy.
You know, powder's so messy and everything.
Tell me, Charles, where do you live?
66 Wicker Street.
And your father?
What does he do?
He's dead, Mrs. Robertson.
-I'm sorry.
-lt was a long time ago.
The Brands will be coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Be back by 5:00, okay?
She will be.
-How'd you know all that stuff?
-I learned it a long time ago from my mom.
See you tomorrow.
Mr. Fallows!
Hi!
Hello, Charles.
Checking out your new environment?
Boring, isn't it?
Disneyland for cows, but for human beings?
I like it.
It's kind of peaceful.
Reminds you of Ohio, I suppose?
Yeah, well, you know.
No!
Actually, I don't, Charles.
I don't know, and you don't either.
There is no Paradise Falls in Ohio.
Your transcripts are also fakes.
Clever fakes, but fakes.
Anything to say?
-You're mistaken.
-Oh, no, I'm not.
But you are, Charles, if you think you can wiggle out of this.
I don't know who you are, but I know you're not who you say you are.
If this is blackmail, Mr. Fallows, I think you've picked the wrong guy.
This car is the only expensive thing I've got.
I'm sentimental about it.
I don't think I can sell it.
Sit still till I'm through with you!
Your generation is so mercenary.
Money this, money that...
Money isn't the only medium of exchange.
You're right.
People really should learn to keep their hands to themselves.
Here's yours.
I'm sorry!
Come on, boy!
Get the bad guy for daddy!
You know you want it!
Get this bad guy!
Come on.
Here you go!
Come on, boy!
Get the bad guy!
Here we go!
Get that motherfucker!
Good boy, Clovis!
Looks like we found ourselves a goddamned speedster!
Unit 3 calling home.
You in there, Laurie?
Andy!
Whatcha up to?
Bye.
Got ourselves one lawless perpetrator heading east on Gray Road.
Copy?
Copy.
Need any help?
Bye.
I think I can handle this one all by myself.
What the...?
Jesus!
Shit!
Jesus, no!
-ls everybody okay?
-Go get him!
-You son of a bitch!
-Report, Unit 3.
Need a location.
I'm out on Pond Road, still in pursuit!
Bastard almost ran down a little girl!
I think he tried to run her down!
I think he's playing with me!
Get me some back up!
Bye!
Pull over!
Pull over, motherfucker!
Pull over!
What the fuck?
What's going on out there, Andy?
Please respond!
Not now, Laurie.
Christ, Clovis!
What's he got in there?
A supercharger?
I lost him.
How in the hell did I do that?
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me, you fucking cat!
Shit, Clovis.
I know just how you feel.
Can I tell you something?
It's kind of weird, but...
Horace, if you laugh, I'm gonna break your jaw!
What is it?
I told you I couldn't see him because of how fast we were going, right?
-That wasn't entirely true.
-How's that?
We were both doing 90!
I pulled right up beside him!
-We might as well have been standing still!
-So you did get a good look at him.
No, no, I didn't!
'Cause see he didn't have no face.
Andy, you got plenty of sick time coming.
Horace!
Shut your pie hole.
I mean, his face!
It was like a blur!
Like...
Shit, I don't know!
Maybe you got some grit in your eye.
Makes them water.
I guess maybe that could have been it.
Andy?
Do me a favour.
When you do get this stampeder leave that part out when you're talking to the County Prosecutor, okay?
Anything else, Andy?
Anything at all?
Yeah.
There was something.
Clovis, here, got a good look at him and he didn't like him.
He didn't like him one little bit!
And it was the other guy, too, he didn't like Clovis!
It was like he was scared of him.
Scared of a cat!
I'm gonna look for this guy on my way home and I'm gonna find him.
I'm gonna find him.
-You didn't get it?
-No.
Why didn't you get anything?
I just couldn't.
What about the girl?
It wasn't the right time.
Tomorrow.
I'll get it tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I'm starving, Charles!
I need it, and you have to get it for me!
My poor baby!
What happened?
What always happens, Mom.
Someone saw you?
The deputy had a cat.
Maybe for a second or two.
-He won't believe what he saw.
-No, he probably won't.
Somebody will find the teacher that I dumped in the woods.
It's already started again, Mom!
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
-But I have to feed you!
-You'll see her tomorrow.
What if something happens to me?
You'll starve!
We haven't even seen another sleepwalker.
-We aren't the last.
-You don't know that!
Yes, I do!
I can feel the others.
You'll feed tomorrow.
And then you will feed me, and then we will leave.
Nothing's gonna happen.
We just have to take care of each other.
Remember, I want you home by 5:00.
Make sure Charles understands that, okay?
Yes, Mommy, and I'll be sure to pack extra didies, too!
Nobody loves a smart ass, Tanya.
She is smart, and I'm smart enough to know it's her first date with the new boy.
We do understand each other, don't we?
You know, Mom, I think we do.
Good. 5:00?
5:00.
-Bye, darlin'.
-Bye, Dad.
Have a good time, honey!
Are we awful?
Terrible.
God, I've become my mother.
You met this kid.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's terrific!
He's utterly charming.
Does it have to be her?
-You care more for her than you do me.
-You know better than that.
Why are you being such a bitch?
Because I'm hungry!
You cannot be in love with this girl.
I'll get it.
You stay here.
I love you, Mom.
Do you?
I know you were supposed to pick me up, but I was nearby.
This is a bad time?
Nonsense!
I'm so glad you came by.
Thank you.
We really ought to go.
The light for Tanya's pictures...
Will be fine for hours yet.
Come in, Tanya.
I have something for you.
You do?
I won't keep you long.
I know young people have to run and play.
Charles said you were nice, and he was right.
He usually is.
Thank you.
Charles is very nice himself.
You have a very beautiful home.
These are beautiful figurines.
They've been in the family for a long time.
You probably wouldn't believe how long.
Mom, we really ought to be going.
Soon, Charles.
Just a second, dear.
This is beautiful.
Nice car!
-Where's the Trans Am?
-lt's in the shop.
-The Mustang belongs to...
-His mother.
Those all your cats?
There's a lot of them.
They're strays, but we'll get rid of them.
We're good at getting rid of pests.
That finishes you, somehow.
Thank you.
That's very sweet.
"Sweets to the sweet," I always say.
Right, Charles?
Go on now, you two, you'll lose the light.
Mrs. Brady, it was really nice to meet you.
Very nice to meet you.
-This way.
-Thank you, ma'am.
This is it.
It's really beautiful here and so are you.
Thank you, Charles.
I better get these out of the way right off.
Your mother's gonna want to know some rubbing went on out here.
Me too, Charles.
Hey, wait up!
Charles?
Hold it!
Come on.
Hey, Clovis!
What's up?
You catching a nap?
"There comes Johnny with his pecker in his hand
"He's a one ball man And he's off to the rodeo"
What are you looking at?
Nice.
Gotcha!
Smile pretty.
Very nice!
I'm sorry!
Sorry!
No sorries.
Do you really feel alone like the characters in your story?
'Cause I do.
I know.
It's wonderful to feel like you're really with someone.
Together.
Look, I think we better...
You don't know me, Tanya.
But I want to.
A little slower.
I thought we understood each other.
I couldn't breathe!
Isn't this the excitement you were talking about?
You're right!
We do understand each other.
This is just how we live, Tanya!
It doesn't have to hurt!
Don't you get it, Tanya?
I need you.
I need you to live!
Oh, God!
Please don't kill me!
I don't think you're entering into the spirit of this!
Why don't you just think of yourself as lunch!
Peek-a-baby!
I lied!
It does have to hurt!
Feed me, Tanya!
Mother's hungry!
Just look at this shirt!
My mother's gonna kill me!
Get off me!
Get off!
Stay away from me!
When exactly did I lose your trust?
Help me!
Somebody help me!
"Allemande left, allemande right
"Come on you fuckin' turkey Get your right foot right
"Get off the stage, you fucking jerk
"You know you pissed me off"
Hold the phone!
All right.
Help me!
Please, somebody help!
Get me out of here!
He's trying to kill me!
He's right behind me!
-He's behind me!
-We'll get him!
-You don't understand!
-One thing at a time.
-This guy have a name?
-lt's Charles Brady!
He's not human!
His face changed!
His face changed?
Get in the car!
Lock it!
-We both have to go!
Please?
-Just calm down!
-No, wait!
We both have to go!
-Calm down, okay?
Everything's gonna be all right.
-Cop kabob!
-No!
Isn't this fun?
I don't believe you fired a warning shot.
Where were we, Tanya?
Oh, my God!
Unit 3, Unit 3.
State your 20.
Come on.
Hello?
Help me, please!
Somebody help me!
Andy, get with the program!
Bye.
Oh, God!
Hello?
Somebody help me, please?
I'm at the Homeland, and the policeman is dead!
Please?
Please come!
Please!
Please come!
Charles!
My face is so hot!
I'm sorry, Mom, I tried.
I really, really tried.
It was the cat, it was the kitty.
You were right.
We've only got each other.
That doesn't matter.
Save your strength.
How bad is it?
You'll be okay, honey, but I'm afraid they'll be coming for us.
We can go, Mom.
I'll be okay.
We've got to stay here until you're stronger.
But I want you to help me.
Try to make yourself dim.
Will you do that for me, honey?
Go on, try.
I can't, Mom.
I can't do it.
It's all right.
I'll do it for both of us.
There's the car, and the traps!
And the...
I'll take care of you.
Buddy?
I ain't taking the rap on this.
I lock this place up every night.
It's not my fault if every pervert, weirdo, horny kid...
Go talk to someone in charge.
I'm busy!
Buddy?
It's not my fault if every horny kid, and weirdo pervert, comes in here.
I lock this place up.
I don't need this action!
Don't talk to me, talk to the Sheriff.
-Sheriff?
-Not now!
His name is Charles Brady, formerly of Paradise Falls now living at 66 Wicker Street.
And the rest of it, including the make and colour of the car?
We came in a red car.
And it was older.
But it wasn't the Trans Am.
See, he took me home in a Trans Am.
It was a blue Trans Am.
And he left here in one.
Listen to me!
I know I sound crazy!
You're not getting the point!
Charles isn't human!
Excuse me, Miss.
Sheriff, I need to document these bruises.
Do you have to do this now?
It'll take a sec.
Don't worry.
Could you just turn your head?
Thanks.
And the other way, please?
Oh, my God!
My camera!
Did somebody find my camera?
I took his picture in my camera!
Yes!
Develop that film!
You'll have his picture!
Get on it, ASAP.
This is Officer Raeburn.
He's gonna run you home.
I'll have to come over later tonight and ask you a few more questions.
-Are you sure his name was Charles Brady?
-That's what he said.
-Do you think he was telling the truth?
-I don't know.
He was very charming.
Take her home.
Excuse me.
Sheriff?
Will you bring the cat when you come this evening?
What for?
The cat saved my life.
Thank you.
Do her parents know a class one assault did not occur?
You mean, do they know she managed to avoid being raped by the bastard?
Yes.
Horace?
-Don't let her out of your sight.
-Yapper.
Drink some of this nice cold water.
It'll make you feel better.
I'm dying, Mom.
No!
My boy is not going to die!
Not ever!
They're coming!
I'm going to make us dim!
I can do it, but you have to keep perfectly quiet!
I love you.
Quiet, Charles.
It'll be all right.
I'm scared.
Charles Brady?
If you're in there, come out with your hands open and empty!
I'm so scared, Mama.
I have to do us.
Keep still.
Dim.
Open up, Brady!
I'm in no mood to be polite!
Police!
Hands up!
Ira?
Soames.
There's nothing in the kitchen.
I told you to wait on my word!
I thought you gave it.
-A lot of cats.
-I can see that, dickhead!
Shit.
What a Polish fire drill.
Get out of there!
Get back in the damn car!
Now, move!
Move!
What?
Cold draft.
Use one right now, could you?
I'd like to set up a couple of checkpoints in and out of town.
The perp's history by now, Ira.
He killed one of my men!
All you got is one hysterical little girl with a very vivid imagination.
-What about the cats?
-What about them, Ira?
That little girl needs a good smack on the butt!
And if her mama and daddy won't do it I'll happily volunteer.
Stay away from her, Soames!
This is the best meal I've had since my wife passed on.
Boy, if Ira found out, he'd kill me.
It was already made, Deputy.
There's one more ear of corn here.
Would you like it?
Yes, ma'am.
She's been up there an awfully long time.
She's taking a nice hot bath!
-She just needs to get clean!
-I know.
Honey?
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm just getting out.
Your mother's keeping supper warm for you.
Honey?
Thanks, Daddy.
I just thought I would lie down for a little while.
Could you call me when the Sheriff gets here with the cat?
Yeah, I will.
I love you, honey.
I love you too, Daddy.
What was that?
Who's there?
Identify yourself!
Police officers!
Maybe it was the wind?
It was not the fucking wind.
You're right, that was not the fucking wind.
-Who could that be?
-Let me take a peek.
State Police.
Probably Soames.
Hope he don't think he's gonna question her before Ira gets here.
I'll get this.
Hi, I'm Mary Brady, Charles' mother.
Charles couldn't come.
Donald, who is it?
I'll take care of it!
Just stay in the kitchen!
Mrs. Brady...
I know he wanted you to have these flowers.
Donald!
Donald!
You have a lovely home, Mrs. Robertson.
I've had lovely homes, too.
We never stay long, though.
You stay away from them!
-lf you'd just call your daughter for me.
-What?
My son is badly hurt.
He may be dying.
Your daughter tried to kill my Charles!
Good!
I hope he dies!
I hope you both die!
I hope you both die and rot in hell!
He's my son!
My only son!
Daddy?
Mom?
Oh, my God!
Daddy?
Get off me!
What have you done?
-This is how they came out of the camera?
-That's it.
So, was the camera moving, or...
No.
The background and the clothes are in focus.
-Laurie, would you get that damn thing?
-Take a look at the collar.
Travis Sheriff's Department.
-Where's Ira?
-What's going on there?
There's a woman here!
She says she's Charles' mother.
I think she killed Don Robertson!
-Slow down, Horace.
-There's blood everywhere!
No vegetables, no dessert.
Those are the rules.
What's going on here?
Hello, Horace?
Come on, Horace!
Answer the phone!
Are you there?
Answer the damn phone!
Get that woman over there to safety.
Hold it!
Right there!
Put her down!
-Put the girl down.
-Give me back my daughter!
Put her down!
Get Soames, every man he has!
Castle Rock, too!
Drop the gun, lady!
Hello, dear.
What's happening?
Where are you taking me?
To see Charles, dear.
Get in here, you bitch!
Oh, my God!
Charles!
My beautiful Charles!
Mommy's home!
See what Mommy's brought you?
He's dead!
Look at him, he's dead!
No!
He's not dead!
He's sleeping.
Can't you see he's sleeping?
You know what I bet he'd love to do?
You'd like to dance wouldn't you, my darling?
That's his favourite song.
Did you know that?
I said, did you know that?
Yes.
He's a wonderful dancer.
But you don't have to take my word for it!
You can see for yourself!
What?
Dance with him.
-Dance with...?
-With Charles.
Dance with my son.
Relax!
He's a wonderful dancer.
He'll lead.
There!
That's it!
Dance!
Clovis?
Yes!
Now, Charles, now!
Good, Charles!
Feed.
Suck her dry!
-Stop!
You're killing him!
-Die!
Tanya!
Get out of there!
Go!
Holy shit!
We've got to go!
-Come on!
-Wait!
Charles was dead, wasn't he?
He was dead!
Yes!
Let's go!
Hey, Mom!
Sheriff!
You killed my son!
My only son!
It's just you and me, Clovis.
Just you and me.
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
E-leven and holding.
Hey, that's a personal best.
Uh-huh.
What's going on?
We're trying to count how many
Spanish peanuts Cliff can... fit up his nose.
(nasally):
And, uh, 11's the limit.
I know my nostrils.
Let's see, now, who had 11?
Uh, Norm Peterson.
Hey.
Oh, yes,
I know Cliffie's nostrils.
Here you go, Norm.
Thank you.
Cliff, are you crazy?
You've really been stuffing peanuts up your nose?
That's dangerous.
You could puncture your sinuses, you can even get brain damage.
Oh, come on, I've been doing this kind of stuff for years.
It's no big deal.
Yeah, Cliffie, but, uh, but never 11, pal.
Uh, yeah, you're right, Norm.
Uh, hey, uh, Rebecca,
I'm gonna mosey into the poolroom and, uh, pry some of these out.
Give me the corkscrew, will you?
Thank you.
Hey, Norm, that's quite a little sum of money you've got there.
Yeah, well...
Maybe you'd like to apply some of this to your bar tab.
(laughing)
That's very good.
(chuckles)
You know, you're starting to fit in here.
That's great.

(door opens)
Sam, let me have a Scotch.
Oh, make it a double.
Oh, what the hell?
Just pound me over the head with the bottle.
Whoo!
Tough day, huh?
No, I'm not unwinding, Sam, I'm, I'm bracing up.
You see, Lilith's mother is coming up from the city for our fifth wedding anniversary, meeting me here.
I thought I'd come in a little early and... marinate.
Yeah, mother-in-laws, man, they're tough.
Oh, she's demanding, Sam.
She's unreasonable, cold, sarcastic, bitter.
Nothing is to her liking ever.
Yeah, we know.
What's her mother like?
Ah, I suppose it's wrong of me to blame Betty for all our problems.
I'm sure I'm not the way she wants me to be either.
Well, how does she want you to be, Dr. Crane?
Well... dead.
The thing that really drives me crazy is the unrelenting tension between Lilith and her mother.
You know, Lilith just holds it all in, she has to unload it somewhere, and guess who gets to listen to it endlessly.
Apparently me, Dr. Crane.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, yes, thanks.
Guess what.
I just won this radio contest.
I get a weekend trip for two to Atlantic City, all expenses paid.
Oh, congratulations.
Who are you going to take?
Uh, I don't know.
I just moved to Boston and I don't know a soul.
Yeah, yeah, I heard, I heard.
Oh, thanks very much.
That's incredible.
I can't believe that.
Hey, guys, guess what.
I just won a radio contest.
You're kidding.
I did, too.
Really?
Yeah, you know, Atlantic City, free trip, the whole works.
That's the same here.
Really?
Isn't that incredible?
Well, it, it could be.
Only problem is I don't know who to take, you know, two tickets and everything.
I wonder what I should do.
About what?
You have kind of a short attention span, don't you?
Well, I like that, I like that.
(mumbling indistinctly)
We're talking about my two tickets and...
Oh, yeah, you know, I've got the same problem.
Yeah, uh, well, you know what we ought to--
I'm Sam, by the way.
Oh.
Sam, I'm Debbie.
Hi, Debbie, uh... maybe we should, you know, instead of wasting four tickets, we should just use yours and go together.
That's a super idea.
Yeah, all right.
Hey, guys, I'm off to Atlantic City.
Boy, those Japanese that say we've lost our ingenuity and the ability to get the job done ought to come to Cheers and have a gander at Sam Malone.
Sammy.
Yeah.
I'd like you to take this, uh, Cliff nostril money and put it on black 17 at the roulette table.
Black 17-- you got it, pal.
Okay, we're ready.
But, now, what are we going to do with your tickets?
Oh, I'll probably just, uh, give them away to some strangers.
Oh, I'd do that, too, but I don't know any strangers.
This is going to be a great weekend.
Uh, how come, uh, black 17, Norm?
Oh, uh, well, 17 is 'cause, uh,
Vera and I were married on the 17th.
Oh.
And black is because Vera and I were married on the 17th.
Another one, Dr. Crane?
Um, no thanks, Woody.
Uh, one ought to do it.
(door opens)
Mother and I have arrived, Frasier.
Hit me, Woody, need some juice.
Thanks for helping me with my bags, Frasier, but I see you've got that big, heavy drink to lug around.
Hello, Betty.
So this is where you spend all of your time, while my grandson crawls around in open stairwells and electrical outlets.
Well, actually, Frederick is walking now.
If my daughter had any sense, so would she.
Is there a bathroom around here?
Oh, yes, Mother, right down that hallway there.
Frasier, I have to thank you.
You seem to be trying harder than usual to be pleasant to my mother.
Want to tell me what the hell is going on?
Well, darling, for the past few months,
I've been agonizing over what to give you for our fifth wedding anniversary, and, uh, I thought about jewelry, a trip, a car.
But this... this cost me even more.
"I promise not to fight with Betty during her visit."
Happy anniversary, my love.
It's very thoughtful, Frasier.
Exactly how do you intend to pull that off?
Well, I've been working at this for some time now and whatever Betty says,
I shall let this smile be my umbrella.
Well, get ready to smile.
My mother has never gotten over being upset about missing our wedding.
She wants us to renew our wedding vows on Saturday.
But, darling, I...
I think the whole idea is just... wonderful.
(door opens)
Hey, waitress, you want to turn up the heat in here?
I am not a fish stick.
Or maybe I should ask someone who can reach the thermostat.
Hey, hey.
Lady, you can't just waltz in here, insult people, and start ordering everyone around.
Why not?
'Cause that's my job.
I would have thought your job was to live under a bridge.
Yeah?
Well, unless you want some bridgework, you just better shut up!
Look, she rattled me, okay?
Betty, I-I think it's terribly sweet that you want us to reenact our wedding, but... have you given any thought to a... a little cocktail party?
I-I think that might be more pleasant and perhaps a bit more intimate.
Well, you're wrong.
Very wrong.
You couldn't be more wrong if your fanny was screwed on backwards.
That wrong, huh?
Thanks for dropping me off, Debbie.
NORM:
Hey, Sammy, how'd it go in Atlantic City?
You get lucky?
Yeah, you bet I did.
So, uh, how much you win?
Not a cent.
I'll call you tomorrow, all right?
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay, bye.
Bye.
Sammy?
Huh?
Huh?
CLIFF NORM (high-pitched):
Huh?
Huh?
So, you remember to put that, uh, 50 bucks down on that black 17, buddy?
Yeah, you know, about that Norm...
Yeah?
...you know, the strangest thing happened.
I put all your money...
Right.
...on black 17.
And lost, right?
No, no, no, it hit, it hit.
It hit?
!
All right!
But Debbie got so excited, she started jumping up and down and... and by the time, she was finished, I, uh...
I, uh, had accidentally let your winnings ride.
I could kill you!
You did that?
And it hit again.
Whoa!
What are the odds on that?
Pretty damned steep, buddy.
(laughs) I don't believe it!
(overlapping shouting)
All right!
Sammy!
I'm rich!
I'm rich!
Look at this.
(whooping)
All right!
Sam, Sam, Sam?
What, what, what, what...?
Now that Norm's come into all this money, don't you think it's time that somebody reminds him that he has a pretty hefty bar tab?
Oh, sweetheart, he's my friend.
I can't mention that.
He'll come through.
I don't know, Sam.
Hey, hey, trust me, trust me.
I've known the guy for a long time.
He'll do the right thing.
Sammy, this calls for a celebration.
Let's have a round on me, okay?
(crowd chatter) NORM:
Drinks for everybody!
Sammy, put it on my tab, please.
Sam?
Sam?
Now, about the cake-- do you like butter cream?
Yes, Mother.
Good, because that's what I ordered.
Now, how about flowers?
I like roses.
Do you like cascading lilies?
Sort of.
Good!
Because that's what I ordered.
Now... why don't you go and learn your vows?
I've written them out.
And I'm going to go call the caterer.
Looking at Frasier's friends,
I know I'm going to need to order more.
I don't know what.
Just more.
She's written vows?
Yes.
Apparently with the recurring phrase
"shiftless alcoholic."
Darling, for the hundredth time, why are we going through with this ridiculous wedding re-enactment?
Because every time
I try to say "no," it comes out "yes."
My behavior is solely to please my mother.
Why does she always try to turn me into something I'm not?
Maybe, deep down, she always wanted a girl.
Hey.
Hey, rich guy, mind if I do a little reading here?
Oh.
Oh, Sammy, my tab.
Tab?
Oh!
Thought it was the Yellow Pages here.
Yeah.
Boy, we've had that thing a long time, haven't we?
Sure have, buddy.
Look at that, we go all the way back to when we didn't even know your name.
"Skinny guy at the end of the bar."
Yep.
Yep.
It's gotten awfully big.
Kind of a disgrace, really.
That it is, Norm.
That it is.
NORM:
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
Since I've come into all this money,
I'm gonna buy you a new book.
Whenever I'm in her presence,
I revert to being a little girl again.
But you're not.
You're a grown woman.
You have a successful career and you're well respected in your field.
Now, darling, you must go over there to your mother, look her in the eye, and, for God's sake, tell her that we're not going to reenact our damn wedding!
You're right, Frasier.
Incidentally, why do you always refer to it as our "damn wedding"?
One hurdle at a time, Lilith.
Now, I'll be with you all the time.
I'll be your support.
Lean on me.
Is anyone else hot in here?
Say, waitress, do you mind?
I'm not a rotisserie chicken.
Yeah?
Well, you... you look like one.
Sam.
Huh?
I just gotta take a couple of days sick leave.
Mother,
Frasier and I have spoken, and there's something I have to tell you about my wedding.
Oh, I just can't wait to see my little girl married.
I am so sorry I missed it the first time!
I can't wait either, Mommy.
Come along.
We've got a lot to do.
I'll be right there, Mommy.
A lot of help you were, you spineless bastard.
All that money, huh?
Yeah.
Sure will come in handy.
Yeah.
You could probably pay off all your outstanding debts, huh?
If I had any, Sam.
Not me.
Own my own house, own my own car, no plastic, do not believe in debt.
So I'm beginning to find out.
Rebecca Howe?
Why yes.
And who are you, stranger?
You wouldn't remember me.
I was a customer here many years ago.
I had a couple of beers and couldn't pay for them and this bar was kind enough to run me a tab.
Two beers?
And you did not pay for them?
That's right, Miss.
And I'll tell you why.
Shortly after that, I committed a crime of passion and was sent to Devil's Island for life.
Oh, my!
Go on, stranger.
For years, rotting in those cells,
I was kept alive by but one thought, the knowledge that I owed a debt to Cheers.
So under the light of a tropic moon, I escaped and fashioned a crude raft with vines and coconut husks.
The rest is unimportant.
Suffice it to say, here's three dollars.
God bless you, stranger.
Norm, did you hear that?
How could anyone help but hear that?
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
Could you keep it down?
I'm trying to watch some TV over here!
How could you even think that someone would be stupid enough to take a hint like that?
Miss Howe, here's that dollar I borrowed for lunch yesterday.
You know you could have come right out and told me instead of having that guy come all the way here from Devil's Island.
Sam, let me have a quick one, will you?
I'm showing Betty the sights.
Oh, yeah?
Where is she?
Well, I gave her a little shove into Filene's Basement and yelled "Sale!"
With any luck, she'll be trampled to death.
Your wife's waiting for you up there.
Oh.
Oh, hello, dear.
You caught me.
I'm hiding.
Yeah, well, this is as good a place as any.
This is where I always come to hide from my problems.
I mean, my-my work problems, of course.
You know, my-my domestic life is just, well...
Things are looking up, Frasier.
I've been researching the problem of how to deal with an overbearing mother.
I think you'll be delighted to learn that I've hit upon the perfect course of action.
Oh, darling, how exciting!
A breakthrough!
What's the plan?
To acquiesce totally.
Yes, I'm going to let my mother run roughshod over me.
It's time to cut our losses.
I'm at the third from final turn in the maze and unbeknownst to me, the researcher has removed the cheese.
Your analogies always bring it home, dear.
Yeah, still can't get your mother off your back, huh?
It's very difficult for me to relate to.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
Ma and I don't have any problems.
You know, in fact, most people find it's hard to tell that we're even related.
Folks down at Club Med are very surprised when they find out we're mother and son.
Shocked even.
You know, Dr. Sternin-Crane, I always heard that you should tell your mother exactly how you feel.
Is that what you do, Woody?
Yeah, right, like I want a whopping.
Well, thank you very much, Woody.
I appreciate that.
You know, I have another idea.
Thank you very much, Woody.
I appreciate that.
You didn't let me tell you the idea yet.
Woody, in certain company, when someone says,
"Thank you very much.
I appreciate that."
It means, "I don't thank you.
I don't appreciate that.
And I want you to shut your mouth."
Oh, thank you very much,
Dr. Sternin-Crane.
I appreciate that.
(doorbell rings)
So glad you could come, Sam.
Oh, thank you.
The gift table's over there.
We were, uh, supposed to bring gifts?
Don't give it a second thought...
Mr. Trump.
Hey, man, I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize we were supposed to bring gifts.
Oh, that's all right, Sam.
Your presence here is more than enough.
Paul, you scamp, is this a toaster oven?
So you see, that's why Shamu cannot really be considered a killer whale.
Hello, I'm Dr. Bramwell, a colleague of Frasier's.
I couldn't help overhearing your conversation.
You must be one of his patients.
No, no...
I'm one of his friends, uh, Cliff Clavin.
Oh, well, then I wouldn't be poaching if I...
Well, uh... here's my card.
Huh.
Uh, thank you.
Thank you very much.
That's the third one I got tonight.
I must have a sign on my back or something.
Sam, there's Norm.
This might be a good chance No, no.
to ask him about the bar tab.
Come on...
You can do it.
This is not-- he'll get upset.
No, he won't get upset.
This is the last place in the world he'd make a scene.
Just be discreet.
Norm.
Norm, Sam wants to ask you about your bar tab.
Oh.
(laughs)
I, it's just, you know, she thinks, you know, you came into some money, that maybe it'd be appropriate, you know, to pay off some of your bar tab.
Well, sure, if I had any money left.
Wait a minute, you spent all-- every cent?
Yeah.
What the heck, you know, easy come, easy go, Sammy.
It was found money, I figured, so why not do something that I always wanted to do with it.
So, I went down, and I bought a boat.
Isn't it a beauty?
I can't believe that, man.
What?
You spent it?
Hah...
After all those years of me carrying you while you were unemployed?
!
Well... yeah, but...
You're my friend?
I-I listen to all your stupid little comments every day?
I-I let you run up the largest bar tab in history, and then you come into some money and you tell me you don't pay me back?
You-you spend it on a stupid boat?
!
Well, I hope you and the stupid boat sink!
You big deadbeat!
Sammy, I, I bought the boat for you.
See, it's, it's the Mayday Malone, see?
I mean, thank you.
You know, I know how bad you felt when your boat sank and, well, it's something I always wanted to do, big guy.
Oh, man.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
Yeah.
Hey, listen, about that bar tab...
Yeah, I know...
I've broken it down into 36 easy payments.
Now I want you to stand up straight when you're out there.
All eyes will be on you.
Yes, Mommy.
And for heaven's sake, speak up.
I want to hear every word clearly.
(louder):
Yes, Mommy.
Not now, when you're out there.
(knocking)
May I see the bride before the ceremony?
Oh, no, Frasier.
I don't want you to see me like this.
Oh, nonsense, dear.
Oh, my Lord.
Is this my Lilith, so... so beautiful?
"Beautiful"?
And your hair.
It's so gorgeous.
My face is beautiful?
My hair is gorgeous?
What's next, I have a cute, little caboose?
Watch your mouth, Lilith.
You know how much I hate this.
I wouldn't have put this horrid paint on my face or worn this atrocious hairdo if my mother weren't emotionally blackmailing me into doing so.
"Blackmailing" you?
How could you?
!
Shut up, Mother!
It's bad enough I have to be your little girl,
I don't have to be his, too.
Now, for once in your life, keep your mouth shut and butt out!
(crying)
I'm sorry, Mother.
Oh, no.
It's so beautiful!
I said the same thing to my mother on my wedding day.
The tears, the unhappiness...
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
(knocking)
Uh, Fras, you going to be much longer?
'Cause I hit that punch bowl kind of hard.
Are you going to be all right, Mother?
Yes, I'm fine.
I want to be ready when they ask if anybody objects.
I've written it all out.
We love you, too, Betty.
Frasier, I apologize for yelling at you.
Now be honest.
Didn't you say that I was beautiful and gorgeous only to force a catharsis?
Guilty as charged.
Then help me get this junk off my face.
("Wedding March" begins)
Oh, darling.
We don't seem to have time for that right now.
As much as I hate it, you'll have to keep it on.
Oh.
Now listen, let's go out there and say our "I do's" and then I'll haul your cute, little caboose up to the bedroom.
Thank you, Frasier.
("Wedding March" continues)
Oh, the hell with the "I do's."
That's hysterical!
Really?
She told you that?
Donald Trump bounced an $82 check at The Gap.
- He did not.
Honey, please.
- That's hysterical.
What you have is a sickness-- people who need to be late.
- I gotta go.
Paul's getting mad.
- Nice.
Blame me.
Okay, call me later, all right?
That's perfect.
- Say hi to Henry.
Bye.
- I don't understand.
Why can't you just call a person back?
It's not that hard.
You say, "I'm walking out the door.
Call you later."
- How you doing?
It'sJoel.
- It's a quarter to 9:00.
How was Bermuda?
He ate conch.
I'm walking out the door.
I'll call you later.
How do you like being married?
Isn't it great?
Tell me why
I love you like I do
Tell me who
Can start my heart as much as you
Tell me all your secrets and I'll tell you most of mine
They say nobody's perfect Well, that's really true this time
I don't have the answers
I don't have aplan
But I'm mad about you, baby
So help me understand
What we do
You can whisper in myear
Where we go
Who knows what happens after here
Let's take each other's hand
As we jump into the final frontier
I'm mad about you, baby
Yeah
I'm mad about you
Nice.
Very, very nice.
A lot of movies are saved in the editing room.
Be specific.
A lot of your movies are saved in the editing room.
You're saying it's your editing and not my direction that makes this film work?
- I did not say that.
- Then what are you saying?
What I'm saying is, we're a snip or two shy ofgreatness.
- Know who used to say that?
- Would it be Alfred Hitchcock?
That's right.
You know what else Alfred Hitchcock used to say?
I think he said, "My goodness.
I'm a fat, fat man."
- You know, he used to be thin.
- Oh, Hitchcock was thin, now?
That's right.
When I first worked with him, he was wiry.
We used to kid him.
We used to say, "Hitch, baby--"
- Stop it right there.
- What?
First of all, you did not call him "Hitch."
I most certainly did.
That was his nickname.
- When did you work with him?
- Afternoon.
Always in the afternoon.
Hitch was not a morning person.
Slumlord, reels three and four.
And what did you think?
Well, the rats were underlit.
They looked like squirrels.
Excuse me.
I can't agree with you at all.
Squirrels don't walk like that.
Squirrels scurry.
Rats stalk.
Yeah, but when they're underlit, they look like they're scurrying.
You know, it would really tickle the hell out of me... one time you came in here and said something nice.
Look, I became your assistant because I know you're very talented.
I could have taken thejob with Scorsese.
- You know Martin Scorsese?
- Yeah.
I ke introduced me.
Stop it.
- Stace.
- Selb.
Selby.
Gee, it's almost noon.
Your old man's working you pretty late?
Yeah, he slipped a disk, so I figured I'd give myselfthe afternoon off.
You'll never guess who I ran into this morning.
-Who?
-I n a million years, you'll never guess.
Then why go through this?
J ust tell me.
I'm at Papaya King... on 72nd.
I turn around.
Who do I run into?
- Don Ho.
- That's your guess?
You asked me to guess, I went with Hawaiian balladeer Don Ho.
You wanna tell me, or are we gonna do this all day?
Who did you see?
Lynne Stoddard.
Get out of here!
How do you know?
Like 1 2 million people-- from a distance--
- Are you sure it was her?
- This is what I'm trying to askyou.
It was her, and she looks exactly the same.
Really?
You talked to her?
Did she mention-
- You must have talked about college.
At any point did she say anything at all--
Did she say anything about him?
Yeah, I talked to her.
I told her you're doing the documentaries.
- I told heryou got married.
- Why would you tell her that?
- Why wouldn't I tell her that?
- Because that makes me less eligible.
You are less eligible.
Yeah, but as far as she's-- Look, if I'm--
You see, a married person likes to feel that there's always a chance... ofthem getting back together with any ofthe people they've ever been with.
This is what I'm trying to say.
I know what you mean, Murray.
First time I saw her, I did the same thing.
Why do we live in this city?
Because it's where our apartment is currently located.
I've been waiting for this moment all day.
Me too.
What's Murray watching?
I don't know, but he's watching way too much TV these days.
- Is that you?
- Huh?
Oh, that--
Yeah, that's me... like circa 1 975.
Are those sideburns or headphones?
Honey, it was a very unattractive decade.
Who's the broad?
You know, she's somebody I went to college with.
You're smelling her hair.
Well, it was the '70s.
I smelled a lot of hair.
Fine.
Why are you making a big deal out ofthis?
- I'm hanging up my coat.
- You're being so silly about this.
You really are.
Where do you want me to put it, the floor?
Lynne Stoddard, okay?
That's her name.
Lynne Stoddard.
You satisfied?
Selby ran into her at Papaya King.
That's the end ofthe story.
Geez!
- What are you, jealous?
- Why would I bejealous?
Because Selby's a single guy, gets to have sex with different girls.
Why would you even say something like that?
To hurt me?
So who was she?
You gotta know every little thing?
Yeah.
If I tell you everything now... then we're gonna have nothing left to talk about when we're old.
So let me do this-- just sprinkle my stories in slowly.
So then when you're 70, you will know everything.
I promise.
Deal?
Deal.
Did you sleep with her?
I can't believe your sister can't find one laundromat in her neighborhood.
- She likes doing her laundry here.
- No kidding.
- Be nice.
- I am nice.
I'm very nice.
- She won't bring any detergent.
- Here we go.
She won't.
She'll just use mine, like she does every time.
Never asks.
Never offers to buy more.
I mean, she has a job.
- She can afford to buy detergent.
- This goes back to when you were kids.
It's just like when we were kids.
She did this every time.
I can't listen to this anymore.
J ust say something to her.
- What am I gonna say?
- "Lisa, stop using my detergent."
She's too sensitive.
We say anything, she'll never do her laundry here again.
Hey, let's not risk that.
You know, your door man sneezed all over me.
I n his country, that is considered a sign ofaffection.
- Is he married?
- You want us to introduce you?
I don't know.
He's affectionate.
- I'd love to see him without the hat.
- Come on.
Let's go.
- Paul.
- Hey, Selby.
What's going on?
Hey, I'm down here at Riff's with guess who.
Lynne!
Lynne Stoddard?
My Lynne Stoddard?
Not anymore.
Listen, why don't you come down, you meet us for a drink... you pick up the check and you get lost?
Hold it.
Did she suggest this?
I mean, tell me exactly.
How did my name come up?
Well, she saw you after class crossing the quad.
She thought you were real cute.
When she said my name, was there like a certain inflection?
No, there was no inflection.
Was there a certain tone?
Yes, there was a tone.
There was a dial tone before I called you... and there's gonna be another one when I hang up.
I don't know.
You know what?
I think it would be a big mistake.
I'll be right there.
I can't believe this.
The guy dumps you, and you still do his laundry?
Okay, this is it.
This is the last load.
I'm not even gonna fold it.
Great.
Nice to see you're setting limits.
You were right.
I'm gonna go call him.
Sweetie, Selby called.
I'm gonna go meet him for a beer.
- Why doesn't hejust come up here?
- I think he's with somebody.
Lynne, okay?
He's with Lynne Stoddard.
- I didn't say anything.
- But you were thinking.
- How do you know what I was thinking?
- Did I just meet you?
Go play with Selby, all right?
You're bugging me.
- You won't be annoyed if I go?
- No.
I just said go.
All right.
You want to come?
No, I don't want to come.
Do you want me to come?
No, I don't want you to come.
I thinkyou should, though.
You're unbelievable.
Ifyou come with me, we'll live a lot longer.
If I go without you, then I'm gonna have to come back... and tell you everything that I said and everything she said.
You still won't think I'm telling you everything.
This wayyou'll be there and you'll know.
Know what?
Whateveryou would have grilled me about when I come back.
Enough already.
I'm going.
Really?
You're gonna go?
I think I should go.
Don't you think?
I thinkyou should.
But we really should go now.
- They're waiting.
- I gotta change.
No, you look great, really, just the wayyou are.
- What is that?
- What?
You never wear cologne.
Did you ever think, maybe I'm wearin' it foryou?
You're so pathetic.
So when are you gonna get married, Selby?
I'm tired of being single.
I'm ready to put myself on the line... but it's just so hard to meet a woman that wants to make a commitment.
Selby?
I would have introduced you, but I've forgotten her name.
There she is.
I mean "they." There they are.
I meant to say "there they."
Look at you!
Boy.
You look great!
You lookjust the same.
Better.
You look even better.
Not that you didn't look great in college, but now you just--
- You lookjust wow.
You look great.
- Thanks.
Hi, I'm the house mother over at Paul's dorm.
- How are you?
- Sorry.
This isJamie.
Lynney.
Sit down.
Everybody sit down.
So you still have that long, flowing-hair thing going, huh?
She always had hair.
Her hair always flowed.
To where?
You ever been here?
It's a great place.
We come here all the time.
It's just great for whateveryou want.
For meeting people... for eating food, whatever.
- They even serve breakfast here now.
- Can you get omelettes?
- Pretty sure.
- Nobody cares.
Do you know that Lynne is a hotshot attorney?
-Get out of here!
-I'm a junior partner at Sweeney Fuller.
I rememberyou took the incomplete in Poli Sci.
Oh, God.
Now here you are, a lawyer in a big-time firm.
That is so funny.
Jamie's in PR.
Regional account manager, right?
Shut up.
Who wants what?
Mrs. Buchman.
Martini.
- Since when?
- Straight up.
- Paul?
- A beer.
I'll come with you.
Ow!
What is that for?
Regional account manager?
- I'm a regional vice-president.
- Really?
- And you forgot to introduce me.
- I didn't forget to introduce you.
Ifyou just let me get my bearings.
Your bearings?
Yes, my bearings.
I'm under a lot of pressure here.
I got Selby, I got her.
I'm talking to you about omelettes.
- There's a lot of pressure for me.
- You asked me to come.
Yeah, but what are the chances you were gonna sayyes?
Right?
Then it turns out he loses the mailbox key.
Oh, God.
Whatever happened to Terry Bees?
- We saw him.
- On 34th Street.
You know what he does?
He sells those big corks ofsouvlaki.
He sells those to all the 8th Avenuejoints.
- Is there any money in that?
- He didn't do it for the money.
Oh, God.
Souvlaki is like lamb?
Souvlaki is mostly lamb, isn't it?
I think that's what it is.
It's lamb.
- I love lamb.
- Lamb is delicious.
We never have lamb.
What are you doing?
You're eating the poor girl's French fires.
Have some ofyour own.
- The French fries here are very good.
- But they have no lamb.
Would you excuse me?
You should really stay away from me right now.
You're mad because I sampled the fried potato ofanother woman?
That's right, Paul.
I'm mad about the French fries.
- Is there a problem with the fries?
- No!
- I can't believe you!
- That I'm talking to another woman?
That you made me come down here and watch it.
- Watch what?
- You drooling down memory lane.
I cannot win with you.
You always say we never go out during the week.
Oh, my God, I hate you!
Kids, look, you're embarrassing me.
Let's go talk, you and I.
- Look, I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.
I'm surprised it tookyou so long.
You showed great restraint.
I'm not good at this.
I've never met one of Paul's old girlfriends before.
- What do you mean?
- It's okay.
I saw him smell your hair.
What?
I n the park by the car, in that movie.
Oh, God, I forgot about that.
But Paul and I were never boyfriend and girlfriend.
Does he know that?
No, I mean, we may have pulled an all-nighter once or twice... but we werejust friends.
I mean, that's what friends did in the '70s.
God, this is bringing me back.
So you don't think of Paul as the one that got away?
Oh, hardly!
No, I mean Paul's a sweetheart.
He is, but I was madly in love... with this grad student-- Ken something.
Oh, God, I was so nuts about that guy.
I once felt like that about a guy.
You ever wonder where he is now?
He's at the bar, probably talking about you.
I'm just remembering the way she used to say my name.
Paul.
She would go, "Paul."
As opposed to "Paul."
Can I askyou something?
There's four million women in this city.
Why do you gotta go out with one ofthe few that I have seen naked?
Excuse me, but isn't that your wife over there?
- What does that mean?
- Let it go.
You went out with her once in college.
Big deal.
So she's yours forever?
I'm a bad friend because I wanna go out with her?
All ofthose things.
Lynne was a very big thing in my life.
What isn't a big thing in your life?
I wrote an entire book of poems to her.
Big deal!
Everything rhymes with "Lynne."
I don't know what it is.
It's painful.
I'm haunted by this relationship.
It's the ghost of Lynne.
With supple breasts that you can never touch again.
You know what?
I can live with that as long as you don't touch 'em.
On a scale ofone to ten, how big an ass did I make of myselftonight?
Seventy-three.
Okay, so I got a little obsessive.
I see that now.
I'm over it.
- You think Lynne was a little distant?
- Oh, my God.
Seriously, it seemed like I was happier to see her than she was to see me.
So?
So she meant something to me at one time and now I mean nothing to her?
- You're so blind.
- Blind?
She was threatened.
- She was?
- Come on.
She has this thing with you in college.
She comes to meet you for a drink.
You bring along your beautiful wife.
What do you think?
I like how you can soothe me and get in a little plug foryourself.
When you were talking to her, did she say anything?
You know, I'm really getting tired ofdiscussing this.
I said I was obsessing.
You really want me to tell you everything she said verbatim?
Yeah, I do.
Sort of like a transcript.
All right.
The truth is--
What?
The truth is what?
The truth is that she was madly in love with you.
And I'm not sure she's over it.
Really?
Really.
You see, okay.
Okay, okay.
'Cause she was so standoffish.
She's wounded.
I think so.
- I'm like a source of pain for her.
- You can do that to people.
Boy, I'll tell ya, I'm glad I saw her, but believe me... you have nothing to worry about.
I know.
( theme music playing )
YESTERDAY WE ALL WENT TO THE COAST
FOR THE ANNUAL FISHMONGER'S PARADE.
HOWEVER, WHEN WE GOT THERE,
WE FOUND THAT THE ALLIED INVASION
HAD ALREADY STARTED.
OUR, UH-
- OUR FLOAT
WAS COMMANDEERED BY THE RETREATING GERMANS,
AND I HAD TO RIDE A TANDEM BACK TO NOUVION
DRESSED AS KING NEPTUNE,
WITH EDITH, AS VENUS UNADORNED BEHIND.
THAT IS, BEHIND ME ON THE BIKE.
UNFORTUNATELY,
MY WINKLES GOT CAUGHT IN THE CHAIN
AND I WAS FORCED TO HITCHHIKE BACK HERE
TO WELCOME THE TOMMIES...
OR THE YANKEES,
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE BOILED BEEF AND CARROTS,
AND HAMBURGERS ON THE MENU.
OH, RENE,
IS IT NOT WONDERFUL?
SOON WE SHALL BE FREE.
OH, IT MAKES ME WANT TO THROW MY ARMS AROUND YOU
AND KISS YOU PASSIONATELY.
LET US WAIT UNTIL THE ALLIES ACTUALLY ARRIVE
AT THE CAFE, EDITH.
THEN WE CAN CELEBRATE.
I HAVE THE CHAMPAGNE ALL READY.
SOON THE CORKS WILL BE POPPING,
THERE WILL BE HUGS AND KISSES
AND TEARS WILL FLOW.
AND THEN...
I WILL SING AS I HAVE NEVER SUNG BEFORE.
JUST THE THOUGHT OF WHAT YOU DESCRIBE
MAKES MY EYES WATER UNCONTROLLABLY.
MY STEW AND DUMPLINGS WILL GIVE THE TROOPS STRENGTH
FOR THEIR LONG MARCH TO BERLIN.
WITH YOUR DUMPLINGS INSIDE OF THEM,
THEY WILL BE LUCKY TO GET PAST THE BUS STOP.
GOOD MOANING.
GOOD MOANING.
I HAVE SPLONDID NOSE.
THE BROTISH AND THE YONKEES
ARE HEADING THIS WOO.
I HAVE A MOP.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE A LEAK?
OH, A MAP!
THE BROTISH ARE HERE,
AND THE YONKEES ARE HERE.
LOOK, RENE, THEY ARE ONLY AN INCH AWAY.
EDITH, THIS IS A LITTLE MAP.
IT WILL TAKE THEM DAYS TO GET TO NOUVION.
BUT EVEN SO, IT IS OBVIOUS
THAT THE AMERICANS WILL GET HERE FIRST.
OH, WE MUST MAKE THEM WELCOME WHEN THEY ARRIVE.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?
MAMMA HAS SOME RECORDS OF AMERICAN MUSIC UPSTAIRS.
I COULD GO AND GET THEM.
A FEW WORDS OF YONKEE WOULD BE A HILP.
COULD YOU TEACH US?
WELL, OF CURSE.
HAVE YOU GOT ANY BOBBLE GOM, CHOM?
AND BIDDY, CAN YOU SPARE A DOOM?
GET THE RECORDS, EDITH.
RENE, I MUST SPEAK TO YOU URGENTLY.
IT WILL HAVE TO BE QUICK.
I SOO YOU'RE STILL HAVING A BIT OF NICKY
WITH YOUR BOORMAID.
THAT IS NONE OF YOUR BOSNESS.
BOG OFF.
WHAT IS IT?
RENE, YOU PROMISED TO MARRY ME
WHEN THE INVASION STARTED.
NO, I SAID WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER,
WHICH MEANS WHEN THE ALLIES ACTUALLY ARRIVE
HERE AT THE CAFE.
THEN WILL YOU MARRY ME?
YOU HAVE MY WORD AS A HERO OF FRANCE.
OH, AND YOU DESERVE
NOTHING LESS THAN A HERO'S REWARD--
ME.
- OH.
- OOOOH!
( knocking )
SOMEBODY IS AT THE WINDOW.
- HELLO!
- HELLO!
OH MY GOD, NOT THEM!
THE BRITISH AIRMEN HAVE COME BACK.
THEY DON'T SEEM VERY PLEASED TO SEE US, CARSTAIRS.
I SAY, ANY CHANCE OF SHELTERING US
UNTIL OUR CHAPS CAN PICK US UP?
WE WERE SHOT DOWN TOWING IN A GLIDER.
( machine gun sound )
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I DO NOT SPEAK A WORD OF THEIR LANGUAGE.
I DON'T THINK HE UNDERSTANDS.
YOU BE THE GLIDER, AND I'LL TOW YOU.
HE'LL SOON GET THE GIST.
( airplane sound )
( machine gun sound )
OH, OH!
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
THEY ARE EITHER SPEAKING HINDUSTANI
OR DOING A FERTILITY DANCE.
( sputtering, crashing sounds )
I THINK IT IS A FERTILITY DANCE.
RENE, MICHELLE WANTS TO SPEAK TO YOU AT ONCE.
OH NO--
NOT THE BRITISH AIRMEN AGAIN.
I THINK SHE REMEMBERS US.
MICHELLE CAN SORT THIS OUT.
I THINK WE'RE GETTING THROUGH.
ABOUT TIME.
THESE FROGGIE PEASANTS ARE DAMNED SLOW ON THE UPTAKE.
GOOD GRIEF!
WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?
WHY NOT ASK THEM?
I SAY, CHAPS,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
ADVANCE GLIDER SQUADRON SHOT DOWN.
NEED A PLACE TO HOLE UP FOR A WHILE.
THEY WERE SHOT DOWN.
YOU WILL HAVE TO HIDE THEM, RENE.
NO.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
AM I HIDING THESE TWO IDIOTS HERE.
BUT IF YOU TURN THEM OUT,
THEY COULD GET CAUGHT.
THEY COULD POINT THIS PLACE OUT TO THE GERMANS.
AND WE SHALL ALL BE IN THE YOU-KNOW-WHAT, UP TO HERE.
( mutters ) UP TO THERE.
OH, ALL RIGHT.
MIMI, YVETTE, TAKE THEM DOWN INTO THE CELLAR.
LOOK, RENE, I HAVE FOUND THE RECORDS--
- HELLO.
- HELLO.
NO.
IN FRONT OF MY VERY EYEBALLS,
HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF.
WE WILL BE HISTORY IF WE DO NOT HIDE THESE TWO.
DOWN YOU GO, CHAPS.
YOU'LL BE QUITE SAFE IN THE CELLAR.
- OH, JOLLY GOOD.
- CHEERIO.
THAT IS INCREDIBLE.
HOW ON EARTH DID-- ?
THERE IS NO TIME TO EXPLAIN NOW.
I HAVE SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU.
LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY,
I SHALL SAY THIS ONLY ONCE.
WE INTEND TO BLOW UP THE GERMAN AMMUNITION DUMP
OUTSIDE THE TOWN.
MONSIEUR ALPHONSE AND I ARE GOING OUT IN HIS HEARSE
WHICH IS LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES.
WE WILL GO TO THE TOP OF THE HILL,
WHICH OVERLOOKS THE AMMUNITION DUMP.
WE WILL LET THE HEARSE ROLL DOWN THE HILL
ONTO THE DUMP, BLOWING IT SKY HIGH.
BUT YOU TOLD ME IT WAS A PIECE OF CAKE.
WE ARE ON THE SPINNING WHEEL OF FATE.
FATE CAN TAKE A FLYING JUMP AT A ROLLING DOUGHNUT.
RENE, YOU MUST GO WITH MICHELLE.
WHAT?
YOU ARE A HERO OF THE RESISTANCE.
PEOPLE WILL CALL YOU ARE A COWARD
IF YOU REFUSE,
AND YOUR STATUE WILL NOT BE ERECTED IN THE SQUARE.
PEOPLE WILL SPIT AT YOU IN THE STREET.
- TCH!
- COWARD.
I WILL GO.
PERFECT.
I MUST BE OFF MY ROCKER.
GOOD LUCK, RENE.
AND WHEN YOU RETURN,
I WILL GIVE YOU A NIGHT TO REMEMBER.
EITHER WAY, IT IS A SUICIDE MISSION.
( yelling ) GENERAL VON--
GENERAL VON KLINKERHOFFEN.
THERE WILL BE NO RETREAT,
AND NO SURRENDER.
NOT WHILE I AM GARRISON COMMANDER.
WE WILL HOLD THIS TOWN TO THE LAST MAN
AND THE LAST BULLET.
WILL WE BE THE LAST MEN?
VERY LIKELY.
TAKE THIS.
ANYONE CAUGHT DESERTING THEIR POST
WILL BE SHOT.
AH!
I HAVE PUT A GUARD ON YOUR FRONT DOOR.
I'M NOT STAYING HERE FOR THE LAST STAND.
WHAT DO WE DO?
WHAT DO WE DO?
TIE MY LONG-JOHANNS TO THE BALCONY
AND WE WILL CLIMB DOWN.
YOU SHOULD WASH THESE BY HAND.
THE QUALITY IS TOO GOOD TO SEND TO THE LAUNDRY.

RENE!
DID YOU SUCCEED IN BLOWING UP
THE AMMUNITION DUMP?
NO.
BUT WE DID GET A BIG VAN OF VEGETABLES.
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
WE MUST GO UPSTAIRS AND RADIO LONDON.
HERE, MIMI, YOU TAKE THESE
AND PUT THEM IN THE KITCHEN.
YVETTE, LOOK AFTER ON THE BAR.
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MICHELLE?
SHE HAS GONE TO TELL MONSIEUR ALPHONSE
WHERE HIS HEARSE IS.
AND WHERE IS IT?
EVERYWHERE.
SHH!
Leclerc:
AAH!
THE KNOBS, THE FLASHING KNOBS.
TAKE YOUR BROMIDE.
SHUT UP, YOU SILLY OLD FOOLS.
'ALLO, LONDON.
THIS IS NIGHTHAWK CALLING.
ARE YOU RECEIVING ME?
OVER.
Hello, Nighthawk.
This is London, receiving you loud and clear.
What is your message?
Over.
WE HAVE FAILED TO BLOW UP THE AMMUNITION DUMP,
AND WE ARE VERY UNPOPULAR WITH THE GREENGROCER.
OVER.
Do not worry, Nighthawk.
British commandos will be with you shortly.
They will take care of everything.
Over and out.
WELL,
THAT IS THE LAST MESSAGE I AM SENDING.
FOR ME THE WAR IS OVER.
YOU ARE RIGHT, RENE.
I KNEW IT ALL ALONG.
YOU ARE A RESISTANCE FIGHTER.
HE'S NOT JUST A RESISTANCE FIGHTER.
HE IS NIGHTHAWK.
SHUT UP, YOU SILLY OLD BAT.
AS THE WAR IS NEARLY OVER,
WE WILL TURN A BLIND EYE.
JUST GIVE US THE PAINTING OF THE FALLEN MADONNA
SO WE CAN ESCAPE AND SELL IT.
BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT IS.
I GLUED IT BETWEEN TWO OF MY MENUS,
AND NOW I CANNOT FIND IT.
OH, COLONEL, WITHOUT THE PAINTING
I FEAR THE GAME IS UP.
AND THE BRITISH COMMANDOS WILL BE HERE VERY SHORTLY,
SO UP YOURS.
OH NO, NOT THE COMMANDOS,
THEY ARE SUCH ROUGH FELLOWS.
CAN'T WE SURRENDER TO SOMEBODY ELSE?
WHAT ABOUT THE BRITISH AIRMEN IN THE CELLAR?
EDITH!
THE BRITISH AIRMEN?
ARE THEY STILL HERE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?
WELL, ON AND OFF, YES.
GRUBER, WE WILL SURRENDER TO THE BRITISH AIRMEN.
WHAT A RELIEF.
I'VE ALWAYS GOT ON RATHER WELL WITH AIRMEN.
I SAY, CARSTAIRS, SOMEONE'S COMING.
DAMN, IT'S THE JERRIES.
WE WISH TO SURRENDER TO YOU.
THEY'RE GOING TO SHOOT US.
THE SWINE.
I DON'T THINK THEY UNDERSTAND US, COLONEL.
GRUBER, I'VE JUST HAD AN IDEA.
WHY DON'T WE TAKE THEIR UNIFORMS,
AND ESCAPE IN DISGUISE?
TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES.
WHAT'S HE SAYING?
SORRY, OLD BOY, DON'T SPEAK A WORD OF THE LINGO.
MY GOD, WHAT'S HE DOING?
THIS COULD BE A GOOD A MOMENT
TO QUOTE THE GENEVA CONVENTION.
I THINK HE JUST WANTS OUR CLOTHES, FAIRFAX.
WHAT A RELIEF.
FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT I WAS BACK AT ETON!
THE CURSED BRITISH AND AMERICANS
ARE ONLY HOURS AWAY.
VON SMALLHAUSEN?
REVEAL THE MIDGET SUBMARINE.
YES, HERR FLICK.
IT LOOKS LIKE TWO BATHS PUT TOGETHER.
YOU HAVE A KEEN EYE, HELGA.
IT IS TWO BATHS PUT TOGETHER.
VON SMALLHAUSEN HAS SPENT THE LAST YEAR
DIGGING A TUNNEL FROM HERE
TO THE OLD BOATHOUSE ON THE RIVER.
ONCE AT SEA, MY UNCLE HEINIE'S SUBMARINE
WILL PICK US UP AND TAKE US TO SOUTH AMERICA.
YOU WILL LIE DOWN INSIDE IT, HELGA,
WITH YOUR NOSE IN THE PLUGHOLE.
I WILL LIE ON TOP OF YOU,
AND PEDAL ALL THE WAY TO THE COAST.
ON SECOND THOUGHTS, I THINK I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES
WITH THE BRITISH.
VERY WELL.
VON SMALLHAUSEN,
OPEN THE SECRET TUNNEL.
YES, HERR FLICK.
HERR FLICK, WILL YOU BE LEAVING ME MY SHARE
OF THE 10 MILLION FRANCS?
NO.
BUT YOU MAY HAVE THIS AS A MOMENTO.
THE MISSING BOOBY
FROM THE PAINTING OF THE FALLEN MADONNA.
CHEAPSKATE.
( crowd cheering )
MIMI, GET THE CHAMPAGNE OUT.
OH, RENE,
DO I LOOK ALL RIGHT FOR THE COMMANDOS?
YOU NEVER LOOKED BETTER.
OH, WELCOME, GOOD TO SEE YOU!
MY DEAR FRIEND.
MAJOR TWISTLETON-SMYTHE,
FIVE COMMANDO, BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES.
MY SECOND-IN-COMMAND, CAPTAIN STARKINGTON.
THIS TOWN IS NOW UNDER ALLIED CONTROL.
WHAT DOES HE SAY, RENE?
DO NOT ASK ME.
I'VE ARRANGED TO TAKE THE FORMAL GERMAN SURRENDER IN HERE.
BUT FIRST, I WANT TO SPEAK TO ONE REENY ARTOYS,
ALIAS NIGHTHAWK OF THE RESISTANCE.
RENE, HE MENTIONED YOUR NAME.
I AM RENE ARTOIS.
THIS MUST BE THE CHAP, SIR.
GIVE ME THE MEDAL, STARKERS.
REENY ARTOYS...
IN RECOGNITION OF YOUR DARING WORK FOR THE RESISTANCE,
I'M EMPOWERED BY HIS MAJESTY, KING GEORGE,
TO AWARD YOU THE M.B.F. MEDAL.
OR "MAGNIFICENT BROTHER OF FRANCE."
OH, THANK YOU!
DON'T TELL HIM IT REALLY STANDS FOR
"MAD BLOODY FROG."
OH MY GOD!
NO, NO!
I SAY, STARKERS, WHO ARE THESE TWO?
THEY LOOK LIKE BRITISH AIRMEN, SIR.
MUST BE FAIRFAX AND CARSTAIRS,
THE TWO WHO WERE SHOT DOWN.
DAMN GLAD TO SEE YOU, CHAPS.
OOOH, WAFFLE WAFFLE WAFFLE WAFFLE WAFFLE.
RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH.
I'M GENERAL VON KLINKERHOFFEN,
COMMANDING OFFICER OF THE NOUVION GARRISON.
TO AVOID THE UNNECESSARY
LOSS OF LIVES OF MY MEN,
I NOW FORMALLY SURRENDER TO YOU.
LUCKY YOU SPEAK A LITTLE JERRY, SIR.
YES, ISN'T IT?
I ACCEPT YOUR SURRENDER.
( German accent ) WHERE ARE THE OTHER OFFICERS OF THE GARRISON?
UNFORTUNATELY, I'M THE--
GOOD GOD.
COLONEL VON STROHM!
LIEUTENANT GRUBER!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
STAND TO ATTENTION!
THESE ARE MY OFFICERS.
IMPERSONATING BRITISH AIRMEN!
THIS MAY WELL BE HELD AGAINST YOU.
SORRY, OLD BOY, DON'T SPEAK A WORD OF THE LINGO.
NICE TRY.
WHERE ARE WE, VON SMALLHAUSEN?
BY MY CALCULATION, ONLY THIS WALL
DIVIDES US FROM THE RIVER.
EXCELLENT.
VON SMALLHAUSEN, GET INTO THE BATH.
YES, HERR FLICK.
GOODBYE, HELGA.
YOU MAY GIVE ME ONE LAST KISS,
BEFORE YOU PUSH US THROUGH THE WALL
AND INTO THE RIVER.
FORGET THE KISS,
BUT I SHALL BE PLEASED TO GIVE YOU THE PUSH.
ALL WE NEED ARE THE LOCAL GESTAPO OFFICERS,
AND WE WILL HAVE EVERYONE IN THE BAG.
PRIVATE GEERHART!
GENERAL?
!
I HAVE TO ANNOUNCE THAT UPON YOUR ORDERS,
I HAVE CAPTURED HERR FLICK AND VON SMALLHAUSEN
TO TURN OVER TO THE BRITISH.
THIS IS NOT THE RIVER, VON SMALLHAUSEN.
THESE LOOK LIKE GESTAPO OFFICERS.
THEY ARE.
A VERY JUNIOR ONE.
I'M A CADET.
ALL GERMANS WILL BE HELD
IN THE TOWN JAIL FOR THE TIME BEING.
TAKE 'EM AWAY, CHAPS.
GOODBYE, RENE.
HOW I WISH WE'D BEEN ON THE SAME SIDE.
PUT IN A KIND WORD FOR ME.
I WILL DO MY BEST, LIEUTENANT.
ME, TOO.
TELL THEM I'M A PUSSYCAT, REALLY.
MIMI, YVETTE, DRINKS FOR THE OFFICERS.
AND NOW FOR SOME ENTERTAINMENT.
I REMEMBER ONE BRITISH SONG THAT I HEARD ON THE RADIO.
EDITH, EDITH, NO, PLEASE.
THIS ISN'T A BAD LITTLE PLACE.
I THINK WE'LL BILLET OURSELVES HERE
FOR A DAY OR TWO.
NOW LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.
OHHH,
WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.
STILL, AT LEAST FOR US, THE WAR IS OVER.
SO IS YOUR SINGING CAREER.
BUT RENE,
WE STILL HAVE EACH OTHER.
THE PRICE OF VICTORY IS ALWAYS HIGH.
MY GOODNESS,
MY DEAR HELGA.
NOUVION HAS HARDLY CHANGED AT ALL.
OH, LOOK, HUBERT,
THERE'S A STATUE OF RENE.
HOW HANDSOME HE WAS.
I WONDER IF--
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS--
HIS CAFE IS STILL HERE.
LET US GO AND SEE.
WAIT FOR US HERE, ERICH.
YES, SIR.
EVEN TO THE SMELL OF GARLIC,
HOW IT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES.
WE WERE SO YOUNG.
SURELY MY EYES DECEIVE ME.
NO, IT-

HOW HAS HE DEFIED THE YEARS?
I AM WEAK WITH SHOCK.
WELCOME TO CAFE RENE.
WOULD YOU LIKE A TABLE?
RENE?

AND THIS IS HELGA, NOW MY WIFE.
AH, I THINK IT IS MY FATHER YOU WANT.
YOU ARE THE SON OF RENE?
YES, I BEAR HIS PROUD NAME.
OHHH,

STILL ALIVE?
( weakly ) GO, GO, GO.
LOOK, RENE, A CAR.
WE HAVE VISITORS.
THAT CHAUFFEUR LOOKS VERY FAMILIAR.
NO, NO, IT CANNOT BE.
IT IS!
COLONEL VON STROHM.
SURELY NOT.
RENE,
IT'S YOU!
OH, COLONEL.
WHO'S THIS?
OH, IT IS MY WAITRESS, YVETTE.
SHE IS THE ONLY ONE STRONG ENOUGH
TO PUSH MY CHAIR.
OH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, COLONEL?
WE'VE COME BACK TO REVIVE OLD MEMORIES.
WE?
HERR GRUBER--
LIEUTENANT GRUBER, YOU KNEW?
IS HERE WITH HIS WIFE, HELGA.
THEY'RE WITH ME.
LIEUTENANT GRUBER!
MARRIED?
HE BECAME A MILLIONAIRE ART DEALER AFTER THE WAR.
I'M HIS CHAUFFEUR.
THEY HAVE SIX GROWN UP CHILDREN.
SIX...
I NEVER KNEW HE HAD IT IN HIM.
MIMI!
YVETTE!
WILL NO ONE HEAR THE CRIES OF AN OLD WOMAN?
SHUT UP, YOU OLD BAT.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
LIEUTENANT GRUBER IS BACK.
I OVERHEARD RENE TALKING TO HIM
AS I CAME UP THE STAIRS.
NO?
!
NO.
OH, I MUST GO DOWN AND TALK WITH HIM.
HERE, HELP ME ON WITH MY DRESSING GOWN.
PAPA!
PAPA, THERE ARE SOME OLD FRIENDS HERE TO SEE YOU.
YOU ARE LOOKING WELL, OLD FRIEND.
LIEUTENANT, I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE MY EYES.
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE
MARRIED MADAME EDITH.
HE NEVER GOT ROUND TO IT.
BUT HE HAS PROMISED TO MARRY ME,
AS SOON AS WE FIND
THE MISSING PORTRAIT OF THE FALLEN MADONNA
WITH THE BIG BOOBIES.
THEN WHOSE LITTLE BOY IS--
AN ORPHANED BABY, LEFT ON THE DOORSTEP.
I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS HIS FATHER.
TO SPARE HIM THE SHAME.
OF COURSE.
KIND AS ALWAYS.
I SEE THEY HAVE ERECTED A STATUE TO YOU, RENE.
( all scream )
WHAT IS THIS?
THE PAINTING OF THE FALLEN MADONNA.
SO THAT IS--
THAT IS WHERE IT WENT.
STILL IN THE MENU IN WHICH I HID IT.
SO THAT IS WHERE IT WENT.
IF ONLY WE HAD
THE MISSING BOOBY.
STRANGELY ENOUGH,
I STILL HAVE IT.
HERR FLICK GAVE IT TO ME
WHEN THE INVASION BEGAN.
I HAVE CARRIED IT AROUND FOR YEARS,
AS A MEMENTO.
HERE IT IS.
WHAT A REUNION.
Gruber:
THIS PAINTING IS NOW WORTH MILLIONS.
THEN LET US GO BACK INTO THE CAFE
AND PUT IT TOGETHER.
I WILL FIND US A BUYER
THROUGH MY INTERNATIONAL AUCTION HOUSE.
THIS WILL STUN THE ART WORLD,
EVEN MORE THAN MY MARRIAGE.
PERHAPS WE COULD ALL SHARE
IN THE GOOD FORTUNE.
HELGA,
LIEUTENANT, COLONEL,
IS IT REALLY YOU?
HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
MY GOODNESS, MADAME EDITH!
( engine revs )
WHAT IS THAT?
RENE IS IN MY CAR.
WHO'S WITH HIM?
THAT DAMNED WAITRESS.
WE HAVE THE PAINTING, YVETTE.
WE'LL HEAD FOR SPAIN,
SELL IT AND START A NEW LIFE TOGETHER.
OH, RENE, AT LAST!
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
THEY ARE TAKING MY CAR.
AND THEY HAVE THE PAINTING.
RENE!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT SERVING GIRL?
YOU STUPID WOMAN.
CAN YOU NOT SEE, I AM ELOPING?

Last week on Married With Children:
Al and Bud were being hunted by killers from two different towns each wanting to kill them in their respective villages.
Bud was warned by some new friends.
You will die in the morning.
And if things aren't bad enough, their only hope of rescue is Kelly.
Marcie and Jefferson have sought salvation elsewhere.
Bad Americans.
And for you Buck fans...
Would it have killed them to pay an extra dollar so I could eat?
And now, Married With Children continues.
Hang them high Hang them high
Hang them till they thirst and die
Hang them high Hang them high
Hang them till they thirst and die
I welcome you all here on this wonderful Lower Uncton afternoon to witness the deaths of the hated Bundy males.
Their excruciating deaths will usher in a new era of prosperity and sunlight on this peaceful village.
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Listen to them, Peg.
They're chanting "Al, Al, Al." Just like my old Polk High School days.
These people have been so nice.
During my speech I'm throwing in an old football story.
Why don't you tell them about your 3.25 an hour?
That'll wow them.
You're just jealous because I'm a god here.
Watch this.
How do you like that, babe?
They'll stop screaming when you lower your arms, Al.
Most people do.
Heavy is the head that wears your mother, son.
Dad, don't you sense there's something wrong here?
I'm not talking about the ghosts who danced around my room removing their heads and telling me to get out.
I mean, haven't you noticed it's daytime and yet there's no sun?
Time to go.
Sorry, madam, no women allowed.
Well, thank God they don't have that attitude in Paris.
Son, I could die a happy man right now.
Al Bundy, have you any words for the assembled villagers here?
My people today I feel like the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
As you know, I played high school football.
I was great.
And I know you kids out there would like to be just as great as I was but beware.
There's a killer out there.
A temptation.
It infests your country the same as mine.
It'll eat up your money and your will to live.
I know you've heard about it before, but you can't hear about it enough.
Kids, please just say no to marriage.
Dad, I've got a gut feeling they're gonna kill us.
I'm trying to talk here, son.
- Football builds men.
- Enough of this football drone.
Kill them!
Kill them.
Kill them.
Kill them.
Kill them.
Son, I'm beginning to think you were right.
Forsooth, woodsmen, spare those men.
Fear not, Daddy, there's no business like show business.
Hi-yo Silverware, away!
Well, I just saved your worthless hides and I think I deserve a hearty "Good job, Kelly, thank you."
You might have gotten a nice thank you if you didn't say we'd travel faster if we lightened the load then unhitched the horse.
Well, he did go faster, didn't he?
So should we, because here they come.
Kill the Bundys!
Kill the Bundys!
Kill the Bundys!
Kill the Bundys!
Kill the Bundys!
Kill the Bundys!
Kill the Bundys!
Kill the Bundys!
They've stopped.
We must be safe.
Well, we are safe.
A man told me to bring you here.
What man?
That man holding a gun and pointing it at us with a whole load of townspeople.
Don't worry, Al.
Whatever happens, I'll be right by your side.
The women are free to go.
We only want to kill the men.
Have a nice life, Al.
I hope your death is less painful than your life.
Bye, Daddy.
Hey.
Come over to our side.
Your death will be quicker.
No.
Come to our side.
At least we won't eat you afterwards.
That is an ugly rumor started by people who are jealous.
Besides, it's dark over here.
We couldn't tell.
It's hard to know what we're eating.
- Why aren't they killing us, Dad?
- I don't know, son.
We must be on the borderline.
Right, then.
I'll settle this.
Now then, come over here or your wife and daughter are through.
You fool, that didn't work with the other Bundys, either.
All right, we'll just wait them out.
Thank you.
It was really nice meeting you.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thanks for such a good time.
Now, you really must come to America and experience our theatre.
Jefferson, come on.
I'm sick of the theatre, Marcie.
Let's go get something to eat.
There's a place across the street.
The Whipped Puppy.
Sounds good to me.
Now listen, I have wired my mother for money but this was the only address I had so I guess we'll just have to sit and wait.
But that could take hours.
What are we gonna do in the meantime?
Bad Americans?
Bad Americans.
Dad, I just want to say it was brave of you to say:
"Take me and let the boy go free."
I didn't say that, son.
Don't you think it would be a good time to do it?
Why would I say that?
What better way to die than with my only son?
I love you, Dad.
Yeah, right.
But I feel this is the right time for a final father-son chat.
Great.
Much better than my dream of dying in the saddle.
Don't make me push you off the borderline.
I won't be able to die in peace until I've been able to pass down the accumulated wisdom of my lifetime.
So listen, son, and listen good.
Never mind.
We're getting nowhere.
Let's just beat them with clubs and see which side they collapse on.
Oh, no.
What if one of them fell your side and one of them fell our side?
Be in a fine pickle then, wouldn't we?
I'm sure we could work out something mutually beneficial.
Oh, right.
We have them killed on your side and you promise to share.
But you won't, will you?
You can't trust a light-dweller.
- Moon people.
- Sun people.
Maybe we're taking rather a narrow view of this.
Maybe we should be looking at it from the point of view of true entrepreneurs.
All right, look, it's the grave of the Bundy whose death ended a 400-year-old curse.
That's gotta be worth a little bit.
- Custard sales.
- Right.
Banners.
"My Dad saw Al Bundy killed and all I got was this lousy T-shirt" T-shirts.
I love it.
- Partners.
- Partners.
Peace has been found after all these years.
Kill them.
Wait, wait, guys, before you shoot, I just want to say one thing.
The blond over there is a boy.
Come on.
It's not that dark over here, lad.
Well, excuse me.
While we're all in such a jovial mood, may I offer just a little suggestion?
See, I think a great idea would be pretending to have killed the last Bundy.
Yes, well, I'm sure something could be worked out.
I mean, we're not barbarians.
We're not the French.
Well, I demand vengeance.
Shamus McBundy insulted my great-great-great-grandmother and I want revenge.
Hey, I'll buy you an Orange Julius in London, buddy.
That's a brilliant idea.
Okay.
Igor, you kill the big one and in a typical rush of English bloodlust we all kill the rest of them.
Wait a second.
That's not fair.
I was once a mighty athlete and I demand to go out like a man.
All right.
What about a medieval joust?
Just think of the promotional possibilities.
Buttons.
Fanny packs.
Videotapes for the spectators.
Hey, Igor.
Before you kill him, try and do something funny with him.
Then we can sell a separate wacky blooper reel.
Oh, Al, do it.
I love those.
A medieval joust it is then.
They will fight to the death in Upper Uncton.
Why Upper Uncton?
Well, we could hardly film ever in your village, now could we?
Was that another "dark" crack?
Let's not get testy.
We've got a man to kill.
- Al, I'm afraid.
- Don't worry, babe.
This Igor don't look too tough to me.
Well, it's not him I'm worried about.
They're gonna be filming and I left my bright-sun makeup in the castle.
And you guys thought you were cursed.
I can't believe my life depends on Dad's ability to joust.
Well, it's better that than his ability to earn a living.
And besides, who says Igor's any good at this jousting stuff?
So long, Tiny Toon.
Come on, Al.
It's time to go.
What could that man be doing in there?
I think he's getting into his battle gear.
Let's joust.
Al, honey, before your death I mean, certain victory there's really something that I must say to you.
What is it, babe?
Do you have our return tickets?
You know, just in case you lose them during your victory dance.
Don't worry about me, babe, I played high school football.
Besides, if I should die it will comfort me greatly to know you'll be stuck here for life.
Wish me luck, kids.
What good would it do?
Pumpkin, what do you have to say?
Daddy's dying.
Well, that's comforting.
Let the tournament commence.
Pennants.
Get your Igor pennants.
Get your "I saw Al Bundy die" T-shirts.
Here you are, sir, one for the lady wife.
Here you go.
A couple for the kiddies.
Lovely, smashing.
That's it.
Ladies and gentlemen let's get ready to rumble!
Welcome to the thumping in Upper Uncton.
On my left five-time all-European undefeated jousting champion going by the name of Igor "The Truth" Deathshire.
And on my right from the Windy City of Chicago USA Al "Stink-foot" Bundy.
When I say begin, begin.
Begin.
Go back to England, Igor.
- I can't look.
How's he doing?
- He's doing great.
What do you mean, Dad's doing great?
Dad?
I thought you meant Igor.
Okay.
Enough Rope-a-Dope.
Let's rock.
Now for the death blow.
Next time you play a man's game, wear a man's uniform.
And the next time you insult an American make sure he didn't play high school football.
Now let's rock.
You stink, Bundy.
You did it!
You did it!
It was so great.
- Oh, Al.
- Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do.
What do we do now?
Well, I suppose we'll just have to flip a coin to see which side we kill him on.
Look, it's the sun.
It's coming out over Lower Uncton.
The curse must have been lifted when Bundy defeated Igor.
Hooray for Al Bundy!
Oh, Al.
This is terrible.
We've always prospered as a tourist attraction.
"The town next to the land of darkness." Now we have nothing.
What about us?
I mean, now you can see.
Look.
We've got no crops.
There's no paint on the stores.
We're just a couple of little burgs in the middle of nowhere.
We can't sell any T-shirts now.
We can't even sell the bloody video we made.
He's ruined everything, he has.
- Let's kill him.
- Why not?
Let's kill the whole bloody lot of them.
Vacation's over.
Thank your father, kids.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks, Dad.
Americans coming through.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse us.
- Americans coming through.
- Move.
- Excuse us.
Excuse us.
- Move.
- Excuse us.
- Excuse me, pardon me.
Americans coming through.
Excuse us...
Oh!
- Hi, you made it.
- Hi.
- So how did you enjoy London?
- Oh, it was great, Peggy.
We managed to take in a lot of... theatre.
Oh, my goodness.
Someone has switched our luggage and given us many erotic forms of punishment.
But rather than hold these good people up, we'll be glad to pay the duty.
Do you have anything to declare?
Yes.
My husband is an idiot.
- Come on, kids.
- Mom, what happened to Dad?
He got caught stealing a hotel towel.
Like he'll ever use it.
- What do you think they'll do to him?
- Oh, please, it's a hotel towel.
What can they do?
What are you in for?
Stole an ashtray from the Ritz.
- You?
- Towel from the Savoy.
- What do they feed you in here?
- Bread and water.
Then it's truly the best vacation I've ever had.
Last week on Married With Children:

- Excuse me, pardon me.
Americans coming through.
Excuse us...
Oh!
- Hi, you made it.
- Hi.
- So how did you enjoy London?
- Oh, it was great, Peggy.
We managed to take in a lot of... theatre.
Oh, my goodness.
Someone has switched our luggage and given us many erotic forms of punishment.
But rather than hold these good people up, we'll be glad to pay the duty.
Do you have anything to declare?
Yes.
My husband is an idiot.
- Come on, kids.
- Mom, what happened to Dad?
He got caught stealing a hotel towel.
Like he'll ever use it.
- What do you think they'll do to him?
- Oh, please, it's a hotel towel.
What can they do?
What are you in for?
Stole an ashtray from the Ritz.
- You?
- Towel from the Savoy.
- What do they feed you in here?
- Bread and water.
Then it's truly the best vacation I've ever had.
They say that the god of space created the stars.
If so, then we humans... no, the origin of life itself... who created that?
Does everything come into existence only from destruction?
If so, then humans need to fight on forever.
Because of that, I wonder how many short-lived lives have disappeared in this space.
Enemy fleet sighted ahead of us.
Distance: 2800.
The entire fleet is around 15,000 strong.
The Aristocratic Alliance's fleets are approaching.
Distance is 2500.
1500 until our effective range.
Vetti-sama.
Your orders please.
I could see it.
Pardon?
Our victory.
As of now, I will be commanding in Vetti-sama's stead.
All ships, prepare for battle.
Prepare to fire!
Fire!
First and Second Fleet, prepare to commence battle on the port side.
All gun turrets, turn to port!
Fire!
Launchers armed.
Good.
All gun ports, fire!
The third and fifth warships have taken damage.
The flagship has taken a direct hit aft and has caught fire.
The enemy's Third Fleet has been sunk.
It's just as we had planned.
Change target to Korreli.
A-An enemy squadron has been spotted approaching from the port side!
The enemy's First and Fifth Fleet have been completely wiped out.
The Third and Seventh Fleets have started evacuating, too.
We will drive the enemy fleets back.
All ships, move ahead!
Fire, fire, and show no mercy!
Enemy ships are retreating.
The Fourteenth Fleet has been sunk.
Our last line of defense has been breached.
Your Excellency, make a decision.
Fireworks...
Set off the fireworks.
That's the sign of surrender.
Damn you, Vetti.
Bastard, you still call yourself an aristocrat?
!
During the last twenty years, where have the Aristocratic Alliance been leading us?
Using their prerogative as aristocrats, they lined their own pockets and squandered away precious resources.
However, thanks to your heroic actions, we have vanquished those who have become corrupted and evil!
However, I don't think the galaxy will recover by itself.
Everything depends on everyone's efforts.
It will rely on our nation, and its people!
Why is this so?
It's because the future of our galaxy exists only within us.
And today, right here,
I will declare the establishment of a new empire which will unite the galaxy.
But, I understood.
This was not the dawn of peace, only the beginning of yet another era of disorder.
In order to open up this enclosed world, the era needed a savior.
The same goes for me as well.
In the beginning there was the God of the Black Cross.
God created the Earth and the Heaven.
The Earth was shapeless, empty and engulfed in pitch darkness.
God said, "Let there be light."
That light sundered the darkness.
He named it "day" where light shined throughout and named it "night" where light was absent, in turn creating dusk and dawn.
That was the first day of creation.
Like the love that the God of the Black Cross offers us, we offer thee our love.
If thou fail to abide by our teachings, thou shalt no longer receive our love.
We abide by the teachings of the God of the Black Cross, and thus, we are loved by him.
Like the love we offer thee, thou need'st but learn to love others.
Now, in accordance with our old customs,
I shalt hold a wedding ceremony.
From this endless darkness, we beckon to thee.
Our wish is for thee to hear our voice.
I hope that thine voice will be the voice that brings about our wish.
Even as thou lay thine eyes on the various vices, we hope that thou art able to stand firm.
We are anticipating the appearance of the savior.
Due to those words, we have regained hope.
The anticipation our soul has for the savior is stronger then the anticipation for tomorrow, for the hero who shall protect thee, will protect thee from now, till eternity...
By custom, please leave proof of the Nerkia and Rodnay rule here.
Finally, the time has come for the weaving skills that we, the people of Nerkia, possess to be used together with the wool that the people of Rodnay possess.
How long have I been waiting for this day?
Bask in the light of happiness that the cross radiates.
Tonight, the two of you shall get together for a promise that shall last forever.
Any objection?
If you don't have any objections, please reply by remaining silent.
Then, commence the ritual of kissing.
Objection!
The time has arrived!
Ye must know.
Ye must know that for ye prosperity, the people have cried for many years.
Ye must know about the blood they shed, their tears and their pain.
Bishop, what are you saying?
Be silent!
We are...
The People's Army, I am Michel Volban!
All troops, head forth!
To the comrades I love,
I came here in order to tell you the truth.
Listen to me if your heart is willing.
In the past, the self proclaimed Emperor, Vetti Sfolza once said,
"The future of our galaxy exists only within us."
But the thing that lurks in his heart, is the unsatisfied desire that he has intoxicated himself with.
We won't kill you unless you resist.
Allowing aristocrats who are the minority to grow fat and ugly, yet letting the rest of the people die as slaves... who hopes for that?
Please surrender quickly.
I love the galaxy.
For that reason, I will win freedom back!
Everybody, we'll defeat the aristocrats with our own hands!
The ports and residential areas are now under our control.
Good.
We've secured the power part as well.
I see.
Thanks for everything.
They're weaker than I thought.
It's strange...
I have just received a report.
We, the People's Army have gained complete control over Nerkia and Rodnay.
But comrades.
I didn't come here to release you.
We can't force and drag you to be part of this chaotic battle.
However if you are willing to fight with us as comrades, then comrade, I'll promise... that we'll forge a future that coexists with your bravery!
Michel, Michel, Michel...
That was impressive, Michel-sama.
You must be tired.
Yes, thank you.
Th-This is...
This is bad!
A fleet from the Holy Imperial Forces is approaching!
What?
The first wave of attacks was successful.
Makone-sama, your orders please.
Don't disturb me while I'm having dinner, just do whatever you think is appropriate.
Yes, sir.
Ready the main battery.
Target:
Nerkia-Rodnay.
Fire!
Th-This is different from what they said!
Don't damage our territories.
Fireworks, the fireworks!
Crimson Virginia, grant me power.
Michel-sama, please hurry.
Yes.
Silua, what are you doing?
Ah... yes.
Everyone, meet up with the main force!
Indeed, it was a trap.
Theodoric!
Huh?
It's bad, its an ambush by the Imperial Forces.
What!
Did our strategy leak out?
Those who are available, please use these ships to engage in the upcoming battle!
Yes!
Launch immediately!
Our ship will go as well!
Leave the main dish alone.
If anything happens to Michel, I'll be punished!
Fire!
Why?
Why aren't they attacking my ship?
How weak.
It disgusts me to hear this nonsense about a savior.
The enemy fleet is trying to surround our ship.
So this is what it's all about...
Mi-Michel-sama.
There's a bracelet at three o'clock!
What?
There's a transmission from Michel!
"The main force is to return to headquarters."
Is that a joke?
We should be helping!
Yes.
Please wait.
We can't be annihilated here.
As Michel says, let's run.
Are you saying to leave Michel stranded?
Those bastards are targeting me.
I will be a decoy.
What can a single person do?
I have a plan.
Okay.
Everybody, we are going to leave this area at full speed!
Yes!
The main force of the People's Army have started escaping.
Leave it alone.
Our only target is Michel.
Michel-sama.
I have received the last transmission from the main force.
"Return alive."
We shall lure the enemy fleet into the bracelet!
The enemy's ship is now quiet.
They seem to intend to surrender.
If they had intentions to do that, wouldn't it be better if they had done that from the start.
Ma-Makone-sama.
It's bad!
A bracelet is approaching!
Maintain position!
Don't go against the stream!
Quickly, do something!
Jean!
Jean!
Hang in there, Jean.
Are you okay?
Yes, Michel-sama.
Silua.
I am fine.
Turn around!
180 degrees!
Retreat at full speed!
We can't.
Due to the crash earlier, the engine is...
What?
There's a transmission from the enemy.
Surrender quickly or we will sink your ship.
They're mistaken if they think they can escape.
Tell them,
"If you can safeguard the lives of the others, I will surrender."
I won't do that!
You are the savior of the People's Army.
That's right!
Even if you surrender, this ship will still be attacked.
Let's fight, Michel-sama.
Don't!
It's useless to continue fighting.
Then, I will go with you.
Me, too.
Be quick...
The both of you, I hope that you can understand.
Let this be my last act of selfishness.
Michel-sama...
Michel-sama!
Michel-sama!
It's the signal of surrender.
Good judgement.
I shall see for myself the true character of the person that Vetti-sama wishes to recruit.
Is this the end?
As I thought, a savior is necessary for the People's Army.
Not me, but a real savior.
A shooting star?
Makone-sama!
It was the encounter with you.
That was when everything started.
Creo.

Get out of here and don't come back.
He hates it when I save his life, because I never let him forget it.
[Luke] Jumper.
Jumper.
The Daltons.
Right now I'd say the Daltons are the least of your problems.
Snakebite.
Bingo.
And if you're waiting for me to suck out the poison, forget it.
Luke.
Luke.
Come on Luke.
We'll get through this together.
Oh, and I was worried that today was gonna be boring.
(piano music)
(gasp)
Excuse me.
I don't know what I get so worried about.
I'm sure he's fine.
He's a grown man, he can certainly take care of himself.
I mean, for heaven's sakes, his name is Lucky Luke.
That must be for a reason, although, when you start bragging about your luck, that's when bad things start happening.
But even if he isn't lucky, I am, and since I'm waiting for him,
I guess that means nothing bad will happen to him.
(slam)
Spilled salt, spilled salt.
Uh...
You throw it over your shoulder.
(crash)
I'm fine.
He's fine.
Nothing bad will happen because, we are both lucky people.
(pained grunt)
Is being hit by a horseshoe bad luck?
It is for you, I'm a lawyer.
Well boys, looks like we lost him for good this time.
Joe, I'm getting sort of worried about Lucky Luke.
Well don't be.
Nowhere in sight.
I know, that's why I'm worried.
He always catches us by now.
I wonder what's happened to him.
Yeah, should have nabbed us a while ago.
Where is he?
Maybe we should go back and make sure he's okay.
What are you, stupid?
This one of your trick questions?
We ain't going back to make sure he's okay.
Although something doesn't seem quite right.
Probably got some kind of trap set.
Anybody got any bright ideas?
Why do I even bother asking?
All right, here's the plan.
We'll double back, and see what kind of trap he's setting for us.
Come on, boys.
Yahh!
Water.
Water.
Water's not the problem.
What we need is a snakebite antidote.
It's no use.
I can't make it.
Try to get up, Luke.
It's up to you now, Jolly.
Head back to town, and try to get help.
No, horse always stays with his cowboy.
You gotta go.
It's the only way you can help me.
I guess I better do as he says.
But I sure hate to leave him out here alone.
[Luke] Go, Jumper.
Come on.
(mystical flute music)
♫ Whoopie kay yo kay yay
(horses galloping)
Well well.
What do we have here?
Did we get bitten by a snake?
Well, looks like Lucky Luke ain't so lucky after all.
Now a snakebite.
Snakebite could be a mighty painful way to die.
I ever tell you boys the time I saw a fellow die of a snakebite?
Lots of time, Joe.
Yeah.
Well, Luke never heard it.
(cruel chuckle)
Anyway.
This fellow I knew got himself bitten by a snake.
A rat, I believe.
And there we were.
Out in the middle of nowhere.
Not unlike your current situation.
(cruel chuckle)
So anyway.
We had no antidote.
We had nothing.
And all I could do, was sit there and watch him die.
Three hours.
Six hours.
12 hours.
Painful?
Oh lordy.
Pretty soon he was begging me to take him out of his misery.
But I didn't do it.
You know why?
Sure, Joe.
We must have heard this story 100 times.
You didn't do it cause,
I'll tell ya!
I didn't shoot him cause it was more fun
But I'm not gonna do that to you, Luke.
You know why?
Cause I respect you.
Oh, we've gone head to head a few times.
But I'm a big enough man to admit that sometimes you got the best of me.
Heck, Joe, more than sometimes.
We figured it out.
Shut up!
So out of respect to you,
and out of respect to our relationship,
I'm gonna take you out of your misery right now.
[Averall] Wait just a darn minute!
Now what!
?
You don't just go shooting a man like that.
In cold blood.
[Joe] Sure I can.
I do it all the time.
Well, yeah, when it's a fair fight.
When he can stand up.
You don't shoot a man when he's down.
That'd be like shooting him in the back.
He does that a lot too.
Who favors for that?
Well, you ain't gonna do it to Lucky Luke.
Less you're prepared to shoot me too.
What, what is this?
My birthday?
He's got a point, Joe.
[William] Ain't really sporting.
Well he's gonna die anyway.
Why can't I get a little fun out of it?
Cause it just ain't fair.
And Momma always taught us we can be as crooked as we wanted, as long as we was fair.
(frustrated grunt)
Fine.
I ain't gonna shoot him.
But I ain't gonna help him either.
And neither are you, if you know what's good for you.
Come on boys, let's get out of here.
I can think of at least one town where us Daltons are gonna be real welcome.
See you on the other side, cowboy.
Come on!
(mumbling)
Sorry.
Maybe things will turn out all right anyway.
(birds cawing)
(faint singing)
Would you look at that?
Horse comes into town without a rider, and nobody thinks of giving him a hand.
I'm not just anybody's horse.
Let's try Lotta's place.
Is there a horse interpreter in the house?
I must look awful.
Look how he's looking at me.
Lotta.
There's a horse out there.
Yes Otto, there's lots of horses out there.
Yes, I know, but I think that one wants to come inside.
Is he over 21?
I don't know, how old is Luke's horse?
Luke's horse?
Morning everyone.
Morning Lotta.
Jolly Jumper, it is you.
What's wrong, has something happened to Luke?
(stomp)
One word?
(two stomps)
Two syllables.
First syllable, sounds like, shakes?
Sounds like shakes?
(chatter)
You're gonna bake a cake?
Don't be stupid, how can a horse bake a cake?
How can a horse play charades?
Like I'm doing, dummy.
Snakes.
(cheering)
Okay, Jolly, second syllable.
(confused grunt)
Second syllable, Jolly.
Second syllable, Jolly.
This is the good part.
Apple!
Uh, hungry!
Fruit!
Bite!
Good Lotta.
You guys aren't much help.
Say, she's really good at this.
It's plain she and the horse have played this game before.
Aw, shut up.
Snakes bite, snakes bite, snakebite!
You got it.
Luke's been bitten by a snake?
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
(cheering)
Excuse me, Lotta.
My public awaits.
(applause)
That's very decent of you.
Thank you.
Aw, you shouldn't.
All right, I got one for you now.
Wait a minute!
This is no game, Luke is in danger.
Old Luke's always in danger, that's his job.
First syllable?
He needs our help.
We gotta find him.
No ma'am, it ain't our place to go tromping on through the desert.
Especially with them Daltons still on the loose.
(agreeing chatter)
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
After all Luke has done for this town?
Simon, remember when you couldn't pay your rent, and that evil landlord kidnapped your daughter Pauline and tied her to the railroad tracks?
Didn't Luke get her back?
Yeah.
And Billy!
Remember when you wanted to marry Pauline, and the evil sawmill owner got jealous and tied her to that log?
Luke saved her just before the buzzsaw got her, didn't he?
And everybody.
Remember when Pauline lost her pet puma and we all had to look for it because it was killing chickens, and Luke finally found it up in a tree and rescued it, even though it nearly clawed him to pieces?
(agreeing chatter)
And everybody.
Remember how Luke finally had to ask Pauline to leave town because of all the trouble she was causing?
(agreeing chatter)
All right, everybody, go gather supplies, and meet back here in 15 minutes.
I'll go get the doctor.
(agreeing chatter)
Nice people.
But a little dense.
(tense music)
You said we was escaping, Joe.
I said I got big plans for us.
There it is.
This here is sweet revenge.
Sign says Daisy Town, Joe.
Yeah, Sweet Revenge is about 40 miles.
North of here, just outside of Sour Grapes, Wyoming.
Will you boys wise up?
Lucky Luke is dead.
We can't pass this golden opportunity.
No, we passed Golden Opportunity about 12 miles back.
Right after Silver Lining, Utah.
Will you boys listen to me?
Lucky Luke is dead, there ain't now law in Daisy Town no more.
So who's gonna stop us from taking over?
(sinister laugh)
Come on!
Yahh!
(gunshots)
(panicked screaming)
Jolly, it's the Daltons.
You better hurry, go!
(bird cawing)
(faint singing)
This is a stick up.
Give us your money!
This is a stick up.
Give us your gold.
This is a stick up.
Give us a break.
It's like taking candy from a baby.
(baby crying)
Say Joe, this stuff's getting kind of heavy to carry around.
We oughta find a safe place.
To put it all.
I suppose you're right.
But where?
This town's got crooks running wild in the streets.
Well, that's all the banks, stores, and businesses worth robbing.
And now the people.
Aw Joe, we ain't never gonna,
Be able to rob everyone.
Oh, we will.
If we do it by the alphabet.
Starting with A.
A is for...
Averell!
Well, all I got's my lucky rabbit foot and about 12 cents.
(knocking)
Aeford?
[Aeford] Yes.
Stick 'em up, ma'am.
Oh, yes of course.
Mrs. Abbot told me to be expecting you.
Wipe your feet.
Wipe your feet, boys.
(chatter)
All right!
Where do you people think you're going?
Well it's bingo night, over in Golden Opportunity.
Yeah?
Well what's with all the ropes, saddles and stuff?
Um...
Go return home!
There ain't gonna be no bingo today.
(disappointed chatter)
All right!
Is an Arnold Preston here?
You're next on our list.
Fine, saves us a trip to your house.
Come on boys.
Let this be a warning to you, Lotta.
Don't try to trick me.
I'll be keeping my eye on you.
Let me tell you something, Joe.
Somebody blew their nose in your bandana.
What are you all looking at, go away!
Nah, that don't look right to me.
Don't Dalton have an O in it?
Yeah.
That's better.
Give it a little more.
Just put a little more there.
Color it in there.
That's it.
I like it.
I really like it.
Bushwack, Bushwack, here's your last chance to redeem yourself, boy.
Your master Luke is in danger.
No one can save him but us.
You recognize this?
Go, find!
Good boy.
(speaking in foreign language)
Give me my shirt back, you, you stupid dog.
You melted my shirt.
(bird cawing)
(drum beat)
(chanting in foreign language)
That horse would follow me anywhere.
Sorry, Jumper.
Lotta.
There was so much I wanted to tell you.
So much I left unsaid.
Fool.
What good is a sheriff who goes and gets himself killed?
(bell ringing)
Yes, stranger?
What can I get you?
You can get me Luke's badge.
Who are you?
I've come to take his place.
No one can take Luke's place, mister.
He was one of a kind.
(laughter)
One of a kind?
Look in the graveyard.
There are lots of his kind.
Where's your sense of decency?
This badge ought to be retired, out of respect for Luke.
Luke already got everything he deserved.
(bell ringing)
(door creaking)
[White Fawn] Don't.
Don't.
Don't go.
[Luke] I have to.
I always go off into the sunset.
Not this time.
Not this sunset.
What should I do?
You must wake up.
You must wake up.
You must wake up.
(birds cawing)
(faint singing)
Now, follow my direction.
Before making the injection, be sure to clean the skin to prevent infection.
Well how will I know if there's an infection from the injection?
Oh well, check his complexion.
Close inspection of the skin in the section of the injection will help in the detection of any infection.
We got some business with Dr. Zeus.
If there is infection, it will need immediate correction for Luke's protection, otherwise he will have no recollection of the injection.
I stick this in his arm?
A common misconception.
The snakebite antidote injection must go directly into his hind section.
Use your discretion.
I have no objection.
Come on.
By gum that's everybody.
Yeah.
New in town?
[Man] Why yes.
Just got in this morning.
Ooh.
Get it all, get it all.
(chuckling)
Snakebite antidote?
Agh!
Warned you once, Lotta.
Luke won't be needing any of your help just now.
And just to be sure, I'll hang on to this.
Now don't fret too much.
We'll get you out of here real soon.
Say maybe, a week.
(laughter)
(bird cawing)
(faint singing)
(sinister laughter)
I am not that kind of girl.
[Man In Black] Oh, I've heard that before.
Take your hands off her.
Oh.
For for a second there I thought it was someone to be reckoned with.
But I guess it's just old Lucky Luke.
Ghost of his former self.
I said take your hands off her.
Don't you get it, pal?
You're a ghost!
(laughter)
(soothing, mysterious music)
Red on black.
Heart on spade.
That's how the game is played.
(cough)
Nine on three, draw again.
It's the only way I'll win.
(cough)
You need a lozenge?
Me?
Oh no.
I just thought we could uh, you know, chat.
Chat?
Carry on a conversation?
Converse?
Converse?
Talk, Averell.
Talk?
Oh, sure.
I can do that.
What do you want to talk about?
Why don't you tell me how you escape from jail cells?
Well, let's see.
One time, we tricked a guard into coming near the cell.
And then, we hit him over the head with a frying pan and stole his key!
(laughter)
You should have heard the clank.
Frying pan, that's clever.
Say, I'd like to fry up some bacon and eggs.
You think you could bring me that skillet over there?
Clang!
Clang.
Clank!
(clang)
Clong?
Ow.
What were you doing?
There was a fly on your head.
I was trying to kill it.
Did you get it?
No, I missed.
Oh, here.
Let me try.
(clang)
Oh, where's the long arm of the law when you need it?
Oh.
Bushwack, Bushwack, come here boy.
Come here, come on, help me.
Help me get the key so I can find Luke.
Come on boy!
Thanks Bushwack.
Thanks heaps.
Excuse me.
Come on, let's go find Luke.
Let's rob the bank again.
We can't, Joe.
They ain't got no money no more.
We got it all.
[Averell] Joe, Joe!
[Joe] Now what?
Lotta escaped.
She's gone, Joe.
Plum gone.
[Joe] You were supposed to be guarding her, lame brain!
She overpowered me.
Wasn't fair, Joe.
She used her wits.
[Jack] She gonna go get Luke?
We better hightail it out of here, Joe.
Hoy.
Wait just a hide second.
We're the only ones who know where Luke is, right?
[Dalton Brothers] Yep.
We're the only ones who got the antidote, right?
[Dalton Brothers] Yep.
So we got nothing to worry about.
Luke is gone.
Gone, gone.
[Jumper] He's gone.
He must have dragged himself somewhere and the dust storms buried the trail.
Oh Luke.
How you must be suffering.
(joyous laughter)
Luke, Luke.
What am I looking at?
You speak English?
Yes.
And you should not speak at all.
You need your strength.
What's your name?
White Fawn.
Now be quiet, and drink this.
This is an ancient healing potion, with remarkable restorative powers.
It's been handed down for countless generations.
What do you call it?
Chicken soup.
Oh.
That's enough for now.
You must rest.
He is strong, which has brought him this far.
But what he needs, we can not give him.
[Salesman] Hotcakes, hotcakes, get your hotcakes here.
There you are, thank you.
There you go ma'am, have your hotcake, thank you very, very much.
Don't be shy, step right up.
Hotcakes, hotcakes, thank you, thank you.
Hotcakes, get your hotcakes here.
Hotcakes, get your hotcakes here.
[Joe] We're the ones who are supposed to break the laws, not you!
[Dalton Brothers] Yeah.
Let me explain it to you, real slow like.
If there ain't nobody here to enforce the law, then there ain't no laws.
So until I see a sheriff's badge on your lily livered chest, which I don't,
I'm gonna hock my wares from this very spot.
So bug off!
Can't you see how good I'm going here?
Come on you kids, get out here, get out of here.
What we need is a new sheriff.
Our own sheriff.
[Averell] Sure Joe, that'd work.
But who would be dumb enough to want the job?
This is great!
Sheriff.
Are you sure I got the most votes?
Averell, it was a landslide!
Now you know what to do, don't you?
Sure.
I'm sheriff.
I,
[Joe, William, And Jack] Uphold the law.
Terrific.
Now some folks who are gonna rob the banks say in five minutes, you know what to do, right?
Right.
I uphold the law.
Good boy.
This is gonna be just like old times.
Now we're gonna go out for a little walk.
You just might want to swing by the bank in a few minutes.
Come on boys, let's go.
(contented sigh)
[Joe] In the bag.
Mr. Dalton, this money is all from your account.
You only need to fill out a withdrawal slip.
Joe Dalton never filled out a withdrawal slip.
All right you varmints.
Freeze!
This is just like old times.
Mr. Dalton, your passbook.
And gift, for opening an account.
Six crystal goblets.
I don't want an account.
Crystal goblets.
Us Daltons don't take no bribes.
Boys, let's get out of here.
I'm the law in this town, and I say halt.
Or I'll shoot.
(laughter)
Come on boys.
(gunshot)
What in the sam hill are you doing?
You're not supposed to shoot at us!
You're supposed to threaten us to make it look more real like.
Joe, I was only upholding the law.
(frustrated grunt)
I never thought I'd live to see the day when I'd say this.
But we need Lucky Luke back.
It just ain't the same without him.
I hope we're just not too late, boys.
Come on.
[Jack] Snakebite like that would have killed any ordinary man by now.
[Joe] Luke ain't an ordinary man.
He's out there somewhere.
We gotta find him.
How?
Same way he always finds us.
Track him.
(laughter)
What's so funny?
I've done plenty of tracking in my day.
It's not that.
We just realized the irony of the situation.
Irony?
How Luke needs us as much as we need him.
It's sort of like the Hindu wheel of life.
What goes around,
Comes around.
Fitting together like the Chinese symbols of Yin.
And Yang.
You know, I've often thought about how good and evil, they're just opposite sides of the same coin.
Definitely.
One can't exist,
Without the other.
(gunshot)
You keep flapping your lips like that, and you're gonna end up with a mouthful of dust.
Daltons!
Let's go before they spot us.
Bushwack!
(dog barking)
Bushwack.
Whoa, dumb dog.
Move dog, Bushwack, wow, ow, wow!
(dog whimpering)
You should have never skipped town without my okay, Lotta!
I know you're out there.
No good following us.
Yeah, we're lost too.
Don't tell her that.
Come out of your hiding place.
Ollie ollie oxen free.
You don't come out, I'm gonna shoot the dog.
You got a deal.
You ain't really gonna shoot Bushwack, are ya Joe?
Don't be stupid.
I kill Luke's dog, that'll be the end of us for sure.
I'm gonna start counting.
One.
(dog barking)
Two.
Bye Bushwack.
(gun cocking)
Three.
(dog whimpering)
Wait!
I'm here!
Shucks.
I knew it!
You and the horse, come out with your hands up.
[Jumper] That'd be a neat trick.
Well Lotta.
I'm glad to see you came around to my way of thinking.
[Lotta] I never thought you could do it, Joe.
You mean shoot the dog?
No, I mean count to three.
You know, you boys won't find Luke without the help of me and Bushwack here.
That animal's so dumb he couldn't find meat in a butcher's shop.
You're wrong there.
Oh I am, am I?
Well if Bushwack is so terrific, how come you ain't found Luke yet?
Who says I ain't found him?
I've got his horse, don't I?
Hey, don't drag me into this.
Yeah.
Luke specially trained Bushwack, to work only under his command.
Only he and I know the secret word that unleashes Bushwack's superior sniffing ability.
Well, what is this secret word?
[Lotta] First, give me the antidote.
What for?
Cause I found Luke, but I can't cure him.
You can cure him, but you can't find him.
If you give me the antidote,
I'll find him and cure him.
Why don't you give us the dog?
That way we can find Luke, and we can cure him.
Cause you still need the secret word.
Tell me that secret word!
Shoot me and you'll never know it.
Then I'll shoot the dog again.
Shoot the dog and the secret word will be darn near worthless!
Dagnabbit, I gotta shoot somebody!
I'm leaving.
Hold it.
How about if we join up together?
And that way, nobody has to give each other nothing.
Nuh-Uh.
We left Luke to die a slow, horrible death.
We gotta find him first, get back on his good side.
I'll tell you what.
You give me the antidote, and I'll give you Bushwack.
And I'll whisper the secret word into his ear.
That way it'll be an even exchange.
That's fair.
[Joe] A deal.
Bushwack, scram.
Scram!
[Joe] After him!
Don't let him out of your sight!
Good going, Lotta.
I just hope I haven't outsmarted myself.
Does that smoke tell you anything?
Hang on Luke, hang on Luke.
No, not to me.
To life.
Your life is precious, and you must fight for it.
♫ Being on my own so
♫ I'm singing the lonesome cowboy blues
That's my song.
(wind blowing)
Your life is precious, and you must fight for it.
(triumphant music)
(breaking guitar strings)
(crash)
(chanting in foreign language)
(gunshot)
(rumbling)
(objects falling)
(explosion)
(horse neighing)
(laughter)
(pained grunts)
Can I give you a lift out of town?
Luke, thank goodness you're alive.
Well, a sheriff who dies too easy isn't much use to anybody.
I suppose I should give you this.
Agh!
Lotta?
Thank goodness you're alive.
Where'd the princess go?
She was here a minute ago.
Luke, you had us all worried sick.
Wandering around the desert half dead.
[Averell] There he is, there he is.
You sure that just ain't another shirt?
No Joe, it's really him this time.
It's him, it's him, it's Luke!
Luke, we found you first!
Lotta wanted to leave you to die, but we talked her into coming to look for you.
Luke is glad that you fellows took the time and effort to come rescue him.
And he'd like to say just three words to you all.
You're under arrest.
Silver spoon.
Tracy, silver cup.
Smith, clock.
Caroline, silver servers.
Mrs. Ruthdeer, land.
(piano music)
[Man] Hey, it's Lucky Luke.
Hey chief, I'm gonna pull your hat off.
(celebrating chatter)
The usual?
I sure don't want anything unusual.
So who's this princess, what's her name?
Wide Load?
White Fawn.
I'd kind of like to find her.
Yeah, I bet you would.
To thank her.
I never got the chance.
She and the other Indian girls, they left without a trace.
The other Indian girls, hmm.
Sounds like you had one heck of a nice dream.
White Fawn was real.
That other stuff I told you about, the dark sheriff, the cemetery,
Oh phooey Luke, that tribe of Indian maidens is one of the oldest myths around.
Cooked up by some lonely cowboys.
Here, I found something for you.
I took this from the library.
See for yourself.
You must have heard this story 1,000 times.
A story has to start some place.
She saved my life out there.
I saved your life out there, Luke.
When I found you, you were all bundled up in a blanket like a baby.
You could hardly move.
And where'd the blanket come from?
Huh?
Where'd this come from?
Oh, that old thing?
Uh, you lost that on one of our picnics.
I've been meaning to return it.
How'd you know I had that?
Well I'm sure that there must be a sensible reason behind all this.
I mean after all, people don't just vanish into thin air.
Do they?
♫ Of all the lonesome cowboys in the west
♫ I figure I've got to be the loneliest
♫ I wanna ride the greens
♫ Where there's lots of elbow room
♫ Hear the wind blow free
♫ And smell the sagebrush bloom
♫ Gotta be on my own
♫ So I'm singing my lonesome cowboy blues
♫ Yes I'm the lonesomenest cowboy
♫ That I know
♫ But when it comes to courting and such
♫ I move real slow
♫ Met a pretty girl
♫ And she do get hitched the other day
♫ My voice gets so upset
♫ We rode the other way
♫ I gotta be on my own
♫ So I'm singing my lonesome cowboy blues
♫ Some folks think it's heaven
♫ In a hotel with their

This extraordinarily powerful weapon was used by the Earl of Smothingham in the famous siege of Devon Castle.
[SNORING]
[CLEARS THROAT]
Michelangelo, wake up.
Wha-
- Huh?
Is it over yet?
I hope I didn't spoil the gentlemen's little nap.
Uh, no problemo, dude.
I can sleep through anything.
Oh, don't mind him.
Go on with your lecture, it's very interesting.
Ahem.
Very well.
As I was saying...
Oh, this is mondo boring.
I gotta get outta here.
There's my ride.
Come on, Michelangelo, stay for a little history, huh?
No way, amigo.
As far as these English castles go,
I'm history.
It was April 13th, 1572, at 2:00 in the morning, or perhaps it was 2:30 in the morning.
Cowabunga!
I say, what's he doing?
Aw, he just caught an early flight.
DONATELLO:
Hey, this Duke of Earl Hotel is pretty nice, huh, guys?
RAPHAEL:
It's alright.
But one hotel sewer is pretty much like another.
That's what you think.
Room service, governor.
Thanks.
Sewer room service?
I'm impressed.
I'll have to pass on the pizza, guys,
I'm heading down to Oxford to tape an interview with a famous British historian.
So long, April.
See ya at the end of the show.
SPLINTER:
Welcome back, my students.
And how was your historical tour?
Pretty bogus, sensei.
If I never see another old building it'll be just fine by me.
You should take more of an interest in history, Michelangelo.
Remember, the seeds of tomorrow are contained in the apple core of yesterday.
I've always said that.
Well, let's catch a little modern history on the tube.
Like some cartoons.
Officials at Greenwich Observatory announced that the most advanced atomic clock in the world, capable of accuracy to the millionth of a second, has gone on display.
Wow.
I'd love to go see it.
Hey, you guys want to come along?
Sure, dude.
As long as it's not in an old building.
[♪♪♪]
Watch out for the laser-beam alarm system.
What lasers?
The ones you're about to step in.
MICHELANGELO:
Oh, those lasers.
Great.
The switch is across the room.
Never fear, Michelangelo is here.
Ta-da!
DONATELLO:
The alarm is off.
Good work, Michelangelo.
[BEEPING]
You know, this is a real, state-of-the-art device.
[WHIRRING]
Whoa.
Hang on.
Whoa!
No more fish and chips pizza for me.
DONATELLO:
Look at this place.
Everything has changed.
Look, gas lamps on the wall.
Great, another old building.
[BRITISH ACCENT] I'll take that.
MICHELANGELO:
Who's that?
He's got the atomic clock.
Hey, come back here, you.
I'll stop that dude.
Fools.
You dare to interfere with Professor Moriarty?
DONATELLO:
Look out, smoke bomb!
Yes.
[ALL COUGHING]
RAPHAEL:
Ow, my foot.
I hate it when they do that.
Hello, hello, hello, what's all this now?
LEONARDO:
That man is getting away with the atomic clock.
And just who might you be?
Oh, we're the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
This here's the Observatory.
We can't have turtles--
Turtles?
MICHELANGELO:
Whoa, gnarly whiskers, dude.
[YELPS]
I always said you had a face only a mother turtle could love.
Did you see the way he was dressed?
Never mind him, we've got to get the atomic clock back.
[♪♪♪]
Now we've got him.
Stop.
Stop, I say.
He's headed for the carriage, Holmes.
RAPHAEL:
The clock thief has got help.
DONATELLO:
I'll stop them.
By Jove?
I say.
He's getting away.
Out of the way.
Oh, no, you don't.
Not bad for a turtle.
Not bad for a skinny Englishman.
[GROANING]
My ankle.
Better luck next time, Mr. Holmes.
[SNICKERING]
MICHELANGELO:
Bummer.
He got away.
Did he say, Holmes?
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you nitwit.
And you just kept him from capturing Professor Moriarty, the most dangerous criminal in all of Europe.
Get real, weirdly dressed dudes, this is 20th century.
This is the 19th century.
1890 to be precise.
No way.
This is some kind of trick.
Wait a minute, guys, think about it.
When we were in the observatory everything changed, the gas lamps, the watchman's clothes, and all this.
Who could pull such a trick?
Somehow we're in the 19th century.
Uh, I hate to bother you dudes with stupid questions.
That never stopped you before.
But if we're in the 19th century, how are we going to get home?
It was have happened just before Moriarty grabbed the atomic clock, when everything kind of swirled around.
You are pursuing Moriarty as well?
My apologies, gentlemen--
Uh, mutant turtles, I believe.
Originally:
[SPEAKS IN LATIN]
A very successful mutation.
Talking turtles.
Incredible.
You're really Sherlock Holmes?
Oh.
I'm honored.
Thanks, old chap, but I'm afraid we've no time for pleasantries.
Moriarty is plotting something monstrous and you may be the very fellows to help me unravel his plan.
Would you fellows care to join me in a cup of tea?
Sure, if you think we'll all fit.
Ha-ha-ha.
I know it's an old joke, but I couldn't resist.
Wow, 221B Baker Street.
A humble house, but mine own.
Come in.
Those will be the last guests you'll ever have, Mr. Nosy Holmes.
Truly awesome crumpets, dude.
Only-- Only, what, Michelangelo?
Well, they'd be totally bodacious with a little tomato paste and cheese.
HOLMES:
Time to move the bust again, Dr. Watson.
WATSON:
Righto, Holmes.
What's he doing that for?
[BRITISH ACCENT] Elementary, my dear Michelangelo.
[NORMAL VOICE] Anyone looking at the window will think that Mr. Holmes is sitting there.
Very good, Leonardo.
Since I've been on Professor Moriarty's trail there have been several attempts on my life.
And Moriarty uses a nasty weapon he calls an air-gun cane.
Silent, but deadly.
Goodbye, Mr. Holmes.
[LAUGHS]
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
I wonder who that could be at this hour.
Lestrade, what a surprise.
Well, I see you have company, Mr. Holmes.
Marvelous deduction.
Come in.
Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard, of course.
We know all about you.
You were in Sherlock Holmes and the Spiderwoman.
A primo flick, compadre.
Trust me, Lestrade and tell my friends about Professor Moriarty.
Well, the professor has been stealing scientific equipment from all over Europe.
And rumor in the underworld is he's going to make something to steal the 20th century.
With the shape it's in, maybe we ought to let him have it.
Earlier this evening he tapped the power of a lightening storm to travel to your time to steal this atomic clock of yours.
[WHISTLES]
This dude is clever.
How'd he know about it if it hasn't been invented yet?
Principle was known by the early 19th century.
I'll bet Moriarty just figured out where and when it would be, waited for the right moment and grabbed it.
I had planned to go to Oxford to search for his hideout while Watson assisted Lestrade here in London.
But now I need help.
No problemo, dude.
We're your turtles.
[♪♪♪]
The air-gun cane.
Down, everyone.
[THUD]
There.
He's gone.
Mondo bummer.
Make no mistake, my green allies,
Moriarty is a cruel and implacable foe.
[TRAIN CHUGGING]
Professor Moriarty used to teach science here at Oxford.
I'll bet his hideout is near the Oxford Science Museum.
That way he has access to the scientific equipment he needs.
[BELLS TOLLING]
There they go.
Those thugs.
After them!
What are you scoping out, amigo?
That one tough got covered with soot on the train roof too.
I'm following his trail of soot.
If I'm right that's the Science Museum over--
Air-gun cane!
There he goes.
Down that alleyway.
Where's he go?
LEONARDO:
Here are some fresh footprints.
Our man must have gone in here.
Well, let's go.
LEONARDO:
Hm.
Now to find a secret entrance to Professor Moriarty's lab.
How do you know it's got a secret entrance?
Raphael, all these villains have secret entrances to their hideouts.
It's in their contracts.
Gee, this makes me homesick for the sewers.
This wall is the secret entrance.
How do you know?
[BRITISH ACCENT] Elementary, my dear Raphael.
[NORMAL VOICE] The groove marks indicate that this wall is slid over it.
And I'll bet there's latch right here.
Elementary, my dear--
Yeah, we know, we know.
MORIARTY:
Welcome, my green friends.
Moriarty.
My compliments to Holmes, instead of bloodhounds he uses talking turtles.
Enough chitchat, professor.
Hand over that atomic clock.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
You see, this clock is the final component for my time machine.
You're crazy.
No one can change history.
Oh, but you're wrong.
When I'm through Holmes will never have been born and I will rule the world.
Cheerio, chaps.
Quick, outside.
Look at that telephone.
And that truck.
We're in our own time again.
[CROWD]:
Hail!
Whoa, sounds like a rock concert.
Let's go check it out.
MAN [OVER PA]:
All hail the Emperor of the World.
Emperor of what?
His Imperial highness, Moriarty the First.
[CHEERING]
This is the 20th century, all right.
And it belongs to Moriarty.
[CHEERING]
Don't look now, dudes, but we're in the wrong 1991.
CROWD:
Hail Moriarty.
Hail Moriarty.
LEONARDO:
He did it.
He changed history.
DONATELLO:
Well, it's time to change it right back.
I think he heard that.
Seize those traitors.
Halt and be punished.
Let's get out of here.
[♪♪♪]
Split up, they can't get far.
Hey, dudes, over here.
[YELLING]
Oh, don't worry, we won't say, have a nice trip.
[ZAPPING]
Any bright ideas, glorious leader?
Yes, run faster.
[RUMBLING]
MICHELANGELO:
Now what, amigos?
LEONARDO:
Jump!
They'd done for.
Let's report in.
[PANTING]
Being a turtle comes in handy.
Yeah, it doesn't mean you have to like it.
APRIL [BRITISH ACCENT]:
Psst.
Over here.
Hurry, before the troopers come back.
Look, dudes, it's April.
But not the April we know.
This is not our world, remember?
RAPHAEL:
Thanks for saving us...
April.
How do you know my name?
Well, we met in another time.
How come you're helping us?
Anyone running from Moriarty's troopers has to be a friend.
Even someone green.
Come and meet more of those opposed to Moriarty's rules.
Another secret passage?
This is becoming a regular spy story.
[BRITISH ACCENT] Stop there.
Let April go, go, go.
Relax, guys, they're friends.
How can anyone such a disgusting shade of green be a friend?
Fellows, I'd like you to meet--
We know, Vernon, Vernon.
How is it possible?
VERNON:
You better explain yourselves, and quick, quick, quick.
We'd be glad to, but it's a long story.
Is this gonna be a flashback?
Nah, just a dissolve.
So our only hope of getting back to our 1991 is to find Moriarty's time machine.
You're in luck then, we know where it is.
Way to go, dude, we can use some good news.
Emperor Moriarty keeps the time machine on display at the Imperial Science Museum.
We know a secret way in.
APRIL:
It's right above us.
The Science Museum's up there.
[RUMBLING] Is it an attack?
Uh, my stomach.
I've got a humongous case of the munchies.
What did he say?
He's hungry.
I'm afraid all I have is an apple.
MICHELANGELO:
Well, pizza would be better, but thanks.
[CHOMPING]
Mondo delicioso, April.
No sense leaving any evidence for Moriarty's troopers to track us with.
I have to warn you, if we succeed you and your friends may never exist.
Well, it'll be worth it just to rid the world of Emperor Moriarty.
Besides, we all know one another in your time.
[CAMERA FLICKERING]
[BEEPING]
So far so good.
Donatello, what do we have to do?
Well, we crank up Moriarty's time machine, go back to our own time, and stop Moriarty before he grabs the clock.
Sounds simple to me.
Ha-ha-ha.
And how do you turtles like my future?
About as much as you're going to like yours, Moriarty.
I knew you'd try to get my time machine.
I've been expecting you.
[CLANGING]
First, I'm going to have some fun with you.
Then you can spend the rest of your lives chopping stone for my pyramids.
Chop this, Buzzard-Breath.
[YELPS]
[♪♪♪]
[GRUNTS] You fight well, turtle.
Because I have right on my side.
Don't you just love the way he says those lines?
I'll hold them off, amigo, you get to the time machine.
Right.
[BEEPING]
I did it.
Now what?
Any time now, Donatello.
No.
Stop.
Look out!
[WHIRRING]
Nice save, Leonardo.
Ah, thank goodness.
The atomic clock is safe.
Clock, schmock, we're safe.
Phew.
Totally awesome trip, dudes.
But is that dude, Moriarty, out of the picture, or what?
I'll take that.
Professor Moriarty.
I think that's, "or what?"
[♪♪♪]
[GRUNTS]
Get off, you're squashing me.
Good, let us know when you're nice and flat.
Where'd he go?
He must have been pulled back to his own time.
Did he get the clock?
No way, dudes.
Good work, Michelangelo.
Sherlock Holmes would have been proud of you.
He'd have been proud of us all.
Hello, hello, hello.
How come he never says hello to me?
[CLOCK BEEPING] Oh, no, not again.
There you are, my students.
[NORMAL VOICE] Hi, we've been wondering where you were.
Actually, it's more like when we were.
This sounds interesting.
I think I'll make a tape of this story.
An apple core?
What on earth is this doing in my bag?
That's not possible.
You see, my students, the seeds of tomorrow are contained in the apple core of yesterday.
TURTLES:
Ah, no!
What on earth got into them?
Perhaps they had too much time on their hands.
[♪♪♪]
Welcome to rookie school.
The Gauntlet is a lifeguard obstacle course.
It will be the ultimate pass/fail test.
If I don't make the jump,
I don't graduate rookie school.
You're gonna be rookie of the year, you're just gonna have to go through me.
Ourjob is to weed out the ones who don't have what it takes.
It's also to help the ones who have what it takes, but don't know it yet.
What's the matter, Brody?
Can't make it?
Just need an excuse to lose, huh?
I think you're afraid to win.
I'm not afraid of anything.
Then show me.
KMF-295 requesting immediate backup.
What's your 20, Mitch?
Off Tower 18, all available units.
Rescue One requesting backup.
Rescue Two en route.
Nice save, Mitch.
A bag, okay, it's a bag, very funny.
You got us all the way out here for a bag?
Argh!
Hey, Dad.
What are you writing?
Dad, why don't you come out of the Stone Age and get a computer like all the other writers?
I've written ten novels and 18 movies on this machine, Matt.
Not about to abandon it now.
Well, maybe I should have been born a machine.
Mathieu, tu sais ton pere ne veut pas que tu fasses la motociclette avec des shorts.
Peut-etre je peut changer mes vrai jambes pour des jambes mécaniques.
Please, Matthew, be careful!
Don't... say a word.
Hey, any of us would have done the same thing, Mitch.
You'd better believe it.
Hey, better to be safe than sorry.
I'm drowning!
Help me!
Me, too!
I'm drowning!
Very funny.
Yep.
It's in a great location just across from the beach, spacious, and the best part is:
I can afford it.
I don't need to get a roommate.
That's great!
I just got a place, too, and here... is to living alone.
No one to criticize you, antagonize you...
Borrow your clothes, eat your food.
I'll toast to that.
- Here's to living alone... whoo!
- To living alone.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God.
They're never gonna let Mitch live this one down.
I mean, they could at least clean up after themselves.
I mean, we don't have a maid around here.
Could have fooled me.
Hey, Summer.
Hey, loosen up with that thing.
You're not gonna drown in the sand.
I'm just so nervous.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Yeah, my father is on my case again.
He says I never finish anything I start.
I swear the day I graduate rookie school,
I'm going to take this rescue can and shove it right up his typewriter.
Looks like you lucked out to beat me in the qualifying swim, Brody.
Congratulations.
I got to tell you, I don't think luck's going to get you through this time, pal.
You want to be rookie of the year, you're just gonna have to go through me.
You're such a tortoise in the water, Clint.
I'll swim right around you.
Hey, Mitch.
Mitch!
Morning.
Guido, how are you?
I'm a-gonna swim for you.
I've been day and night practicing in the water.
Just look at this body, huh, and look at these muscles, huh?
So many of them, all in one place, huh?
Guido, I appreciate your enthusiasm,
- but I got a lot of guys...
- Yeah, yeah, b-but...
But I have what it is you need, Mitch, so use me, use me till I am all of me used up.
I might be able to use you in some other capacity if you're interested.
Am I interested?
Does a lifeguard wear his red shorts?
Thanks.
Morning.
Good morning.
Welcome to rookie school.
Last year 16,934 people were able to go home from the beach because L.A. County lifeguards saved their lives.
The record for rescues in one day by one lifeguard is 78.
Someone's life may depend on what you learn here, so pay attention.
Everything you do from this moment forward will be observed and evaluated.
If you fail a written examination or physical drill, you will be dismissed.
Those of you who are not dismissed, or who don't quit during the next two weeks of intense training will be drafted to work on various beaches.
The one who is voted Rookie of the Year will be able to select his or her own beach.
You're learning about lifesaving techniques, lifesaving equipment,
C.P.R., mouth-to-mouth resuscitation first aid, but what we can't teach you is responsibility.
Hello.
Did I say something funny?
Uh, no, sir.
Um, sorry.
It was my fault.
I said something to her.
Why don't you share it with the rest of us?
I was just wondering which of you would, uh... be my partner to learn mouth-to-mouth.
Mister?
Uh, Brody.
Matt Brody.
Mr. Brody, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is not kissing.
A lifeguard may have to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a 250-pound truck driver or a two-year-old child.
It is not a situation where one chooses a partner.
This is not "The Dating Game. "
Is that clear?
The Gauntlet is a lifeguard obstacle course.
You'll run it twice.
First time for fun, just to get the feel of it.
The second time will be at the completion of rookie school.
It will be the ultimate pass/fail test.
Summer!
Summer.
Hi.
I'm C.J.
Yeah.
I guess everybody knows who I am now... the only who didn't make the pier jump.
You're not the first rookie to be terrified up there, and you definitely won't be the last.
Yeah, well, what difference does it make?
If I don't make the jump, I don't graduate rookie school.
You'll make the jump.
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
You don't know what it's like to look down at the water and...
Feel like it's 100 miles away?
Your heart's beating so loud that you can't hear the waves crashing below?
Summer, I was the only one in my rookie class who couldn't make the pier jump the first time out.
Yeah, well, so how did you finally do it?
I decided that I wanted it more than I was afraid of it.
And when that final jump came,
I just imagined that there was someone down there who would drown if I didn't, so I did.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
C. J!
How did you get the key to my apartment?
"Your" apartment?
Yeah.
I rented this place from an old boyfriend of mine, Mark...
Harris?
!
You know him?
Know him?
I dated him.
He rented this apartment to me last week.
I gave him first and last two weeks ago.
So?
So I leased this apartment before you did.
Well...
"I have taken possession, and possession is nine-tenths of the law.
Okay, if you want to get technical.
Consider this possession.
C.J. " Nam myo ho renge.
Nam myo ho renge.
Nam myo ho renge.
Nam myo ho renge.
Nam myo ho renge.
Nam myo ho renge.
Nam myo ho renge.
Nam myo ho renge.
Nam myo ho renge.
Nam myo ho renge.
Look what you made me do.
Oh, you shouldn't be using salt.
I like salt.
It makes you bloat.
Do I look bloated to you?
I'm in too serene a state to engage in a bloat debate.
You realize this isn't working, don't you?
I mean, we've been involuntary roommates for a week now,
And I'm starting to break out in hives!
Well, maybe it's because you don't eat right.
Here, try some of this.
No, thank you.
I can hardly stand to watch "you" drink it.
Stephanie, your system is polluted.
You should at least chant with me.
I don't want to chant with you, and I certainly don't want to have to keep picking up after you.
Then why do you keep doing it?
Because I hate wet clothes draped over chairs and doors to dry.
New invention, C. J:
Laundromats.
Washers, dryers.
Use them.
Do you know what dryers do?
Dryers send out all kinds of bad elements into the air, not to mention the waste of electricity.
You know, I have a great book on saving the environment.
I think you should read it.
How about one on saving my sanity?
Salt causes hypertension, you know.
Then move to the victim's head.
Check airway.
Take a deep breath, seal off the nose and deliver two full lung inflations one to one-and-a-half seconds in duration.
Then move back to the chest.
Locate proper hand position and begin 15 cardiac compressions.
How do you learn this word-for-word?
Ah, I just have one of those memories.
You know, I never realized you had to learn so much to be a lifeguard.
Mm-hmm.
Do you want something to drink?
Yeah, give me one of those smart drinks, and make it a double.
Just try to visualize the whole page in your mind's eye.
"Then move to the victim's head... "
The beach "is" beautiful in the morning, isn't it?
I'm Aaron Brody, Matthew's father.
And you are?
Summer Quinn.
It's nice to meet you.
Summer... what an enchanting name.
Huh...
And why does a beautiful young lady like you want to become a lifeguard?
Well, actually, Mr. Brody, I...
Please.
Call me Aaron.
Well, lifeguarding is something
I think I would be good at, and I really need the money.
Do you live alone?
Support yourself?
No, I live with my mom.
We just moved out here from Pittsburgh.
We've always kind been a, you know, a two-income family.
So your parents are divorced.
Well, that's awful.
What happened?
Dad, knock it off.
Don't answer him.
Matt, I think your dad was just trying to be polite.
No, he was just trying to probe you for material.
Everyone he meets is just research for one of his novels or scripts.
Lay off my friends, okay?
My son is uncomfortable with honest dialogue.
Matt, I think we'd better get to the pool.
Go ahead.
I'll see you there.
Don't get too attached to my son.
He has a problem with commitment.
It "was" a pleasure meeting you, Summer.
Class starts at 10:00, okay, Matt?
That demonstration was to show you what it's like when a killer riptide turns the bottom of the ocean into a sandstorm.
Sometimes you can't even see the submerged victim.
Question:
What would you do in a rescue under a pier if a wave was about to slam you and your victim up against a piling?
Clint?
Put my body between the victim and the piling.
The opposite.
Put the victim between you and the piling, because if "you" get hurt, you both might drown.
Lieutenant.
This is your life's blood on the beach and in the ocean.
Take it with you everywhere.
When you approach a victim, you must... offer them the can first.
If the victim approaches you, you must block and parry.
Take the can.
You're late, Mr. Brody.
I'm sorry.
Is that what you'd say if you were late to a rescue and somebody drowned?
Peut-etre, si c'était toi.
I understand French, Mr. Brody.
Get in the pool.
There's not one of you
I can't totally dominate in the water, not one of you who could threaten my life with mere strength, because I know how to protect myself and the life of my victim.
Rescue me.
Learn these lessons here and now, before your life and your victim's life is on the line.
Thank you for illustrating my point so well.
You were a little rough on him.
Our job is to weed out the ones who don't have what it takes.
It's also to help the ones who have what it takes but don't know it yet.
You know you have everything inside of you to be a great lifeguard.
How in the hell do you know what I have inside of me?
Because when you run you let it out, when you swim, you let it out.
Matt, you've got the potential of beating every other rookie in that school.
Don't let Lieutenant Holden beat you.
Lieutenant Holden?
Apparently she knows everything, right?
You could learn a lot from her.
Yeah, I just did.
I did out there.
I learned that I don't want to be a lifeguard anymore.
"The Subjugation of Pleasure,
Part One:"
To fully understand the revolutionary nature
Oh, Leonard.
Of the marriage of myth and lies,
Oh, that feels "so" good.
...the erogenous zones of the '90s are more closely linked...
Oh, yes to emotion.
Oh, my God, that feels so good.
...than what is traditionally thought of as erotica...
It is in the human touch, caress, stroke, and tickle that the source of new pleasure can be found.
When we embrace each other, we no longer need to be tied to desperate groping.
Today, we can, with confidence, massage the arms or stroke the foot and derive far more pleasure than is obtainable...
Um...
I'll just go to my room.
...sensual areas that remain so fixated upon in the American psyche.
Leonard, I enjoyed our evening very, very much.
Oh, great.
You inspire me.
I'll fall asleep listening to your tape.
Sweet dreams, Leonard.
Stephanie, red means stop.
What would you be doing right now if I didn't come home when I did, huh?
I mean, right this second, what...
Listen to me, he is incredible.
I met him at a book signing, and I thought he was a total nerd.
He is.
It doesn't matter.
He is the sexiest man I have ever met.
At dinner he was explaining to me the erogenous myth and its relationship to neglected areas of the female anatomy.
What do you mean "areas"?
I mean, like which ones?
Well, if you didn't come home when you did, he probably would have worked his way all the way down to my hand.
Where did he start?
My upper arm.
Your upper arm?
Well... lucky for you I came home when I did.
I mean, we wouldn't have wanted him to get all the way down to your fingers on the first date, now, would we?
So did you guys bring home anything?
I'm starving.
Whoa.
Mmm-mm.
Hello.
Who authorized the purchase of a new blackboard?
Desks?
Chairs?
What's going on here?
It's not new.
I take the old and make it look new.
Oh, I spent day and night working, and polishing and cleaning and cleaning, and polishing and cleaning and cleaning just to make it look beautiful for you.
Guido, thank you.
Oh, the pleasure...
she's all mine.
Well, keep up the good work.
Well... congratulations to those of you who made it to this last day of rookie school.
Your last test will be the Gauntlet.
It will be harder than the first time you ran it.
The dummies will be heavier and farther out in the water.
The run will be longer, and the pier jump higher but I know you can do it.
You've worked hard these last two weeks, really hard.
So go out there and go get 'em.
Hmm.
May I help you?
Yeah, my name is Lieutenant Mitch Buchannon.
I'm looking for Matt Brody.
Well, that makes two of us.
Matthew didn't come home last night.
Please, come in.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
As you probably know, Matt's attending rookie school
- Mm-hmm.
- And... well, he had a little problem with one of our other lieutenants yesterday, and he ran off.
Matthew has a difficult time with authority.
He's... sensitive boy.
Well, I think Matthew needs to accept responsibility for himself, for his own behavior.
And you believe that becoming a lifeguard will help him develop that?
Absolutely.
When you're responsible for the safety of thousands of people on the beach you have to be responsible.
And if you're incapable of responsibility, you'd be putting those people's lives in danger.
Mr. Brody...
I believe in Matt.
Given half a chance,
I think he could start believing in himself.
Do you have any idea where I might find him?
I'd sure like to talk to him.
Yes.
Off getting in trouble somewhere.
He may have gone surfing.
His board was missing this morning.
Thank you.
Matt, wait up.
How did you find me?
I just came from your house.
I had a little talk with your parents.
My father gives new meaning to the phrase "family man," doesn't he?
He thinks you're a quitter.
What do you think?
I think you're afraid to win.
I'm not afraid of anything.
Then show me.
Show your dad.
Show yourself.
Why is my being a lifeguard so important to you?
Because you remind me of a young hothead I once knew who had a problem with his dad.
Eddie Kramer?
No.
This one was about a foot taller.
The Gauntlet starts in an hour!
With or without you.
Okay, today you're on the Gauntlet against the clock.
There will be a staggered start... two minutes between each group.
Damn it.
Go ahead.
Okay, group one, go to the starting line.
Good luck, Kate.
I'm sorry I'm late again, Lieutenant Holden.
It will never happen again.
Join group two.
Thank you.
All right, let's go.
Jump!
Summer!
Summer, jump!
Everyone's passing you.
Jump.
Summer, take my hand.
We'll jump together.
- No, I can't do this.
- Yes, you can; come on.
Come on.
What's the matter, bro?
You can't make it?
Just need an excuse to lose, huh?
Come on, don't let him win.
You could beat him.
I'm not jumping without you.
Look, if I can't do this by myself,
I don't deserve to make it.
Look, we'll do it together.
We'll jump together.
Okay?
On three.
One... two... three.
Now, go get Clint!
Go!
Okay, listen up, let's go.
We all know you're anxious to hear where you'll be working this summer.
And as you know, there are 18 of you, and there are only 13 positions open.
The selections were based on competitive results, test scores, and attitude.
Lieutenant Holden?
Thank you.
The assignments are as follows:
Zuma:
Reilley and Johnson.
Topanga:
Beggs and Dowling.
Manhattan:
Kreiger and Peterson.
Huntington:
Hagar and Dwyer.
And Baywatch:
Lewiston and Quinn.
Lieutenant Buchannon will announce the Rookie of the Year.
Of the six of you remaining,
I'm sorry, but five will have to wait until next summer, but I would like to thank everybody for making this possibly the best rookie school in L.A. County lifeguard history.
As you all know, tradition states the Rookie of the Year gets his or her choice of where they work.
This year, that choice goes to...
Matthew Brody.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, Matt.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.
- Your unselfish support of Summer on the pier showed us a lot.
That's what lifeguarding is all about:
Being there for each other, backing each other up.
Yeah, I learned that.
So, which beach would you like to represent?
Well, if it's okay, um...
I'd like to work here at Baywatch.
Got it.
Thank you.
You apprenticeship starts tomorrow.
Don't be late.
Hey, I'll be early.
Just be on time.
Okay.
Mmm.
Hey, what about Guido?
Guido!
I forgot about Guido.
Guido, Lieutenant Holden and I agree that in light of all the unauthorized things you've been doing around here...
Without our knowledge...
You are charged with... or shall I say, in charge of all the maintenance duties on the beach.
That is, if you want to be our official maintenance engineer.
Engineer?
!
Oh, Lieutenant Mitch, you mean the responsibility?
You think I have it?
Oh, and Lieutenant Holden.
Guido.
A "thank you" would be quite sufficient, Guido.
Engineer...
"Next on" Baywatch:
Welcome to rookie school.
The Gauntlet is a lifeguard obstacle course.

I think you're afraid to win.
I'm not afraid of anything.
Then show me.
KMF-295 requesting immediate backup.
What's your 20, Mitch?
Off Tower 18, all available units.
Rescue One requesting backup.
Rescue Two en route.
Nice save, Mitch.
A bag, okay, it's a bag, very funny.
You got us all the way out here for a bag?
Argh!
Hey, Dad.
What are you writing?
Dad, why don't you come out of the Stone Age and get a computer like all the other writers?
I've written ten novels and 18 movies on this machine, Matt.

What would you do in a rescue under a pier if a wave was about to slam you and your victim up against a piling?
Clint?
Put my body between the victim and the piling.
The opposite.
Put the victim between you and the piling, because if "you" get hurt, you both might drown.
Lieutenant.
This is your life's blood on the beach and in the ocean.
Take it with you everywhere.
When you approach a victim, you must... offer them the can first.
If the victim approaches you, you must block and parry.
Take the can.
You're late, Mr. Brody.
I'm sorry.
Is that what you'd say if you were late to a rescue and somebody drowned?
Peut-etre, si c'était toi.
I understand French, Mr. Brody.
Get in the pool.
There's not one of you
I can't totally dominate in the water, not one of you who could threaten my life with mere strength, because I know how to protect myself and the life of my victim.
Rescue me.
Learn these lessons here and now, before your life and your victim's life is on the line.
Thank you for illustrating my point so well.
You were a little rough on him.
Our job is to weed out the ones who don't have what it takes.
It's also to help the ones who have what it takes but don't know it yet.
You know you have everything inside of you to be a great lifeguard.
How in the hell do you know what I have inside of me?
Because when you run you let it out, when you swim, you let it out.
Matt, you've got the potential of beating every other rookie in that school.
Don't let Lieutenant Holden beat you.
Lieutenant Holden?
Apparently she knows everything, right?
You could learn a lot from her.
Yeah, I just did.
I did out there.
I learned that I don't want to be a lifeguard anymore.
"The Subjugation of Pleasure,
Part One:"
To fully understand the revolutionary nature
Oh, Leonard.
Of the marriage of myth and lies,
Oh, that feels "so" good.
...the erogenous zones of the '90s are more closely linked...
Oh, yes to emotion.
Oh, my God, that feels so good.
...than what is traditionally thought of as erotica...
It is in the human touch, caress, stroke, and tickle that the source of new pleasure can be found.
When we embrace each other, we no longer need to be tied to desperate groping.
Today, we can, with confidence, massage the arms or stroke the foot and derive far more pleasure than is obtainable...
Um...
I'll just go to my room.
...sensual areas that remain so fixated upon in the American psyche.
Leonard, I enjoyed our evening very, very much.
Oh, great.
You inspire me.
I'll fall asleep listening to your tape.
Sweet dreams, Leonard.
Stephanie, red means stop.
What would you be doing right now if I didn't come home when I did, huh?
I mean, right this second, what...
Listen to me, he is incredible.
I met him at a book signing, and I thought he was a total nerd.
He is.
It doesn't matter.
He is the sexiest man I have ever met.
At dinner he was explaining to me the erogenous myth and its relationship to neglected areas of the female anatomy.
What do you mean "areas"?
I mean, like which ones?
Well, if you didn't come home when you did, he probably would have worked his way all the way down to my hand.
Where did he start?
My upper arm.
Your upper arm?
Well... lucky for you I came home when I did.
I mean, we wouldn't have wanted him to get all the way down to your fingers on the first date, now, would we?
So did you guys bring home anything?
I'm starving.
Whoa.
Mmm-mm.
Hello.
Who authorized the purchase of a new blackboard?
Desks?
Chairs?
What's going on here?
It's not new.
I take the old and make it look new.
Oh, I spent day and night working, and polishing and cleaning and cleaning, and polishing and cleaning and cleaning just to make it look beautiful for you.
Guido, thank you.
Oh, the pleasure...
she's all mine.
Well, keep up the good work.
Well... congratulations to those of you who made it to this last day of rookie school.
Your last test will be the Gauntlet.
It will be harder than the first time you ran it.
The dummies will be heavier and farther out in the water.
The run will be longer, and the pier jump higher but I know you can do it.
You've worked hard these last two weeks, really hard.
So go out there and go get 'em.
Hmm.
May I help you?
Yeah, my name is Lieutenant Mitch Buchannon.
I'm looking for Matt Brody.
Well, that makes two of us.
Matthew didn't come home last night.
Please, come in.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
As you probably know, Matt's attending rookie school
- Mm-hmm.
- And... well, he had a little problem with one of our other lieutenants yesterday, and he ran off.
Matthew has a difficult time with authority.
He's... sensitive boy.
Well, I think Matthew needs to accept responsibility for himself, for his own behavior.
And you believe that becoming a lifeguard will help him develop that?
Absolutely.
When you're responsible for the safety of thousands of people on the beach you have to be responsible.
And if you're incapable of responsibility, you'd be putting those people's lives in danger.
Mr. Brody...
I believe in Matt.
Given half a chance,
I think he could start believing in himself.
Do you have any idea where I might find him?
I'd sure like to talk to him.
Yes.
Off getting in trouble somewhere.
He may have gone surfing.
His board was missing this morning.
Thank you.
Matt, wait up.
How did you find me?
I just came from your house.
I had a little talk with your parents.
My father gives new meaning to the phrase "family man," doesn't he?
He thinks you're a quitter.
What do you think?
I think you're afraid to win.
I'm not afraid of anything.
Then show me.
Show your dad.
Show yourself.
Why is my being a lifeguard so important to you?
Because you remind me of a young hothead I once knew who had a problem with his dad.
Eddie Kramer?
No.
This one was about a foot taller.
The Gauntlet starts in an hour!
With or without you.
Okay, today you're on the Gauntlet against the clock.
There will be a staggered start... two minutes between each group.
Damn it.
Go ahead.
Okay, group one, go to the starting line.
Good luck, Kate.
I'm sorry I'm late again, Lieutenant Holden.
It will never happen again.
Join group two.
Thank you.
All right, let's go.
Jump!
Summer!
Summer, jump!
Everyone's passing you.
Jump.
Summer, take my hand.
We'll jump together.
- No, I can't do this.
- Yes, you can; come on.
Come on.
What's the matter, bro?
You can't make it?
Just need an excuse to lose, huh?
Come on, don't let him win.
You could beat him.
I'm not jumping without you.
Look, if I can't do this by myself,
I don't deserve to make it.
Look, we'll do it together.
We'll jump together.
Okay?
On three.
One... two... three.
Now, go get Clint!
Go!
Okay, listen up, let's go.
We all know you're anxious to hear where you'll be working this summer.
And as you know, there are 18 of you, and there are only 13 positions open.
The selections were based on competitive results, test scores, and attitude.
Lieutenant Holden?
Thank you.
The assignments are as follows:
Zuma:
Reilley and Johnson.
Topanga:
Beggs and Dowling.
Manhattan:
Kreiger and Peterson.
Huntington:
Hagar and Dwyer.
And Baywatch:
Lewiston and Quinn.
Lieutenant Buchannon will announce the Rookie of the Year.
Of the six of you remaining,
I'm sorry, but five will have to wait until next summer, but I would like to thank everybody for making this possibly the best rookie school in L.A. County lifeguard history.
As you all know, tradition states the Rookie of the Year gets his or her choice of where they work.
This year, that choice goes to...
Matthew Brody.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, Matt.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.
- Your unselfish support of Summer on the pier showed us a lot.
That's what lifeguarding is all about:
Being there for each other, backing each other up.
Yeah, I learned that.
So, which beach would you like to represent?
Well, if it's okay, um...
I'd like to work here at Baywatch.
Got it.
Thank you.
You apprenticeship starts tomorrow.
Don't be late.
Hey, I'll be early.
Just be on time.
Okay.
Mmm.
Hey, what about Guido?
Guido!
I forgot about Guido.
Guido, Lieutenant Holden and I agree that in light of all the unauthorized things you've been doing around here...
Without our knowledge...
You are charged with... or shall I say, in charge of all the maintenance duties on the beach.
That is, if you want to be our official maintenance engineer.
Engineer?
!
Oh, Lieutenant Mitch, you mean the responsibility?
You think I have it?
Oh, and Lieutenant Holden.
Guido.
A "thank you" would be quite sufficient, Guido.
Engineer...
HANDSOME SIBLINGS Jue dai shuang jiao
According to legend, the 2 Sovereigns reappear every 18 years.
A strong and valorous person is selected to perpetuate the line of the emblem of justice and its legendary techniques.
He becomes the Sovereign of Justice then for one 18 years period.
The supreme techniques are the technique of Frozen Jade and the Sword of the Couple.
We are the Seven Pirates of the Yellow River.
Bring us something to eat and drink.
And give us all your money.
The women, on the ground.
The men, get out.
Help us, landlord!
Give up!
Where did they go?
My brothers...
Run!
- I am hungry.
- No question!
I want to eat fresh hands and feet.
I also want hot hearts and livers.
They are only vulgar robbers.
They are dirty and smell extremely.
I will brush my the teeth afterwards.
If you eat them, everyone will know that you are Lee the Man-eater, one of the Ten Criminals.
So restrain yourself.
They will also know that you are To Qiu-qiu, my accomplice.
They will be frightened.
What happend to him?
- He was so scared that he died.
- That's not good.
Right.
Stay alive, please.
Don't die.
This means fresh flesh for me.
I am the Insane Lion, one of the Ten Criminals.
So egoistic!
You started without me.
You had promised me to leave the nose.
It's dirty and so little to eat.
Looks like an ear.
I will clean it.
Take these arms and eat...
Is he hungry?
He drools...
And one less.
He believed that it was an arm!
Man-eaters don't exist.
What idiots!
The Palace of Hua?
21 millions intended for the victims of the flood were entrusted to eighty voluntary escorts.
You were responsible for two hundred miles for the safety of the convoy.
But in the Valley of the Tiger, you massacred 276 soldiers, and 164 members of the convoy to steal the money.
And the 470 thousand victims of the flood died of hunger.
Do you deserve to live?
I am innocent.
The Two Devils are the culprits.
Do they form part of the group of the Ten Criminals?
Of course.
Then they deserve death.
They are accomplices.
This valley is a closed area.
How is it possible you entered here?
Thanks to this.
The emblem of justice?
Exactly.
Three days ago, the Two Sovereigns entrusted it to me.
I am the new Sovereign of Warriors.
You condemn us without evidence!
With your own way!
In any case, you are at my mercy.
One moment.
- Yin.
- Darling.
- Master.
- Princess.
I am not just a simple warrior, and you, a noble princess.
It's been five years that we are married.
They said that we were not made for each other.
These five last years however filled me.
When I could choose my reincarnation,
I would choose to be married with you for eternity..
I brought our son.
I beg you not to kill my friends in this valley.
Lee is your friend.
But he proofed his guilt by fleeing.
He is my friend, and I know him well.
Yin!
I also know that he is innocent.
But I did not come for him, but for you.
You're making a mistake.
This valley has a rule, set by his Holiness 170 years ago.
Even if they are the worst criminals in the world, as soon as they take refuge here, it is necessary to grant them a chance.
You have to be lenient.
Let us leave this old rule to old.
Then it is necessary that I stop you.
I am afraid that you do not reach that point.
This is the end between us.
We are not anymore husband and wife.
The technique of Frozen Jade?
Right, you won.
I will leave.
In eighteen years, my student will come with this emblem, and will destroy this cursed place.
Yin, how are you?
He was seriously struck.
All his nerves are affected.
- This will do.
- You saved him?
He will live, but he will be a vegetable.
He is a brave man!
Cure him or I kill to you!
I am unable!
One of us gotta take care of his son, and teach him our kung fu.
This harpy treated us like least than nothing.
Qiu-qiu, if his son is raised...
Only you can come up with such an idea.
We will turn him into a terror.
He will drive his mother insane with rage.
All is well.
Its body is very flexible:
excellent to learn kung fu.
Only one among 10.000 babies is like that.
It needs a name.
Which name will I choose?
There, this is the Palace of Hua.
Its name will be Hua.
Its beauty is perfect.
Therefore I will call it Mochue.
Hua Mochue!
The Valley of the Criminals
Where is the Valley of the Criminals?
Right in front of you, it's not too far.
What?
Not too far?
This is vague, rabble!
Who wants to go there?
Speak up.
lnsolent, what are you looking at?
Why aren't you speaking?
Why do you want to go there?
I am a criminal.
Which crime did you commit?
I killed, raped, stole...
All imaginable crimes...
Aren't you exaggerating?
Me?
I am a wanted bandit.
Why should I exaggerate?
- Aren't you telling a lie to yourself?
- When I think that I am beautiful.
- Have you already masturbated?
- All the men do it.
- Have you already comitted a massacre?
- Is this a joke?
Take it.
My arm.
Hold well.
Why did you struck me?
I didn't do it.
You're holding my only hand.
I have enough!
I turn around.
Much too late.
I poisoned you.
- What kind of effect will it have?
- Your genitals will rot.
Don't shout or your buttocks will undergo the same fate.
What I gotta do?
Calm down.
I have the antidote.
Approach, open your mouth.
That's good.
Only a poison has a delicious taste.
- Cease joking, pal.
- Who is your pal?
Who just are you?
He is the only disciple of the Ten Criminals.
He is the most malicious man in this valley.
Tell him, quite simply, that I am Small Fry.
He doesn't know your nickname.
If he doesn't know it, I cut him in pieces.
- Forgive me.
- Never mind.
Small Fry!
Lee and Qiu-qiu seek you everywhere.
Why don't they send somebody?
Follow me.
What?
I must attend the tournament of martial arts?
You must also find two men.
Who are they?
We weren't always the Ten Criminals.
Once we were called the 10 Dispensers of justice of the Cheung River.
- I am Cheung one.
- I am Cheung two.
- Me, number three.
- I am the number four.
- I am the five.
- Fool, I am the number five.
- Then, I am the six.
- Enough.
20 years ago, the state entrusted to us the safety of the convoy with an amount of money intended for the victims of the flood.
Cheung seven and eight, called the Two Devils seized the money.
They destroyed our lives.
Why did nobody intervene?
They drugged us.
Why didn't they kill you?
They didn't on purpose, so that we would be accused.
We decided to send to you to do research.
Wait!
I don't have anything to do with this story.
- But of course.
- I am not a Dispenser of justice.
You are disciple of the Ten Dispensers of justice of Cheung.
My boy, this is the occasion to thank us.
Why becomes life so complicated?
Let us forget the past.
If you refuse, you will have at least to recover the emblem of justice.
If the others unload with this emblem, everything will go down.
That's the truth.
This is a capital affair, concerning all of us.
What does you wanna say?
You will go with brother Lee and sister Qiu-qiu.
We must go all together.
No, you three must go!
Why only us and not the others?
- Daddy Lee, accompany me.
- Everyone agrees.
She is right.
With these mouths, people will recognize us easily.
If you accept, I will look after your mouth and your eyes.
- Really?
- Of course.
It's a little bit harder than to look after a cold.
Just a little bit harder?
Why didn't you look after us in those eighteen years?
These defects belong to your charms.
Get stuffed!
- Then you clear up.
- Cure us...
Who has to go to show himself?
- That's me.
- Do you want to specify this?
I only wanna say... that we go there in your place.
Uncle.
I must go away for a while.
There will be less maliciousness in this valley.
But someone will take care of you.
I always had the feeling that we belong to the same family.
Every time I'm talking to you, you don't answer me.
But I feel that you have to tell me so much.
I hope that one day, you will address me.
When I'm far away, take care of yourself.
Goodbye.
I'm finally starting speaking correctly.
I see more clearly.
It's necessary to get invitations for the tournament for you.
How?
You can handle that.
Let me have a little fun.
- No question.
- It's dangerous.
- It's risky for you.
- That's true.
I have the badge of the Valley of the Criminals.
- I'm scared.
- Nobody will approach me.
I go.
We'll meet in three days in front of the entry of the tournament.
- See you later.
- Take care of yourself.
What a horrible mouth I had before!
And me, my look was hideous.
No, you were pretty with your eye.
But you are still now.
- Really?
- Yes, my beauty.
You're making fun of me, my Apollo.
- Let's go, my beauty.
- My Apollo.
Mistress, we captured one more or less correct man.
He is at your disposal.
How should I know if I like him or not?
Awake him.
I am awake.
He's a rather fine young man.
This is my palace, and they are my concubines.
Young man, satisfy me and you will live.
With me, you wont need anymore of these goods for nothing.
Are my men thus goods for nothing?
Apply!
Pardon me.
The water is cold.
I will change it immediately.
Beat it!
I have enough of it!
Bath him.
I'm finished.
Already?
You did not even strip yourself.
I don't like someone watching me while taking a bath.
I never dare to undress.
I considered nobody would see me naked.
I must acknowledge that you...
Acknowledge what?
I am not a man without experience.
We will see.
- What's that?
- Don't touch it.
It's embarrassing.
I am very constrained.
Your hand!
No, it's here.
- Why a false hand?
- That's a long story.
When I got captured, these women searched me and said that you would capture me your own way.
They then gave me this false hand.
They said to me to give it to you.
You're from the Palace of Hua!
Listen well.
The young Master of the Palace of Hua charged out to capture you.
Show yourself immediately or you all will be executed.
- What's going on?
- Withdraw.
What's happening here?
This is strange.
I have an urgent need to satisfy.
Pity.
Attention.
It's you.
You manage well.
I think that you can help me to flee.
Let's cooperate.
Mr. Hero, you had the intelligence to take refuge in this reluctant place.
I admire your courage.
I would like to be your bloodbrother.
I will call you brother then.
Don't play with me.
You're quite sharp.
A danger.
On position.
Here are the orders of the sovereign:
You and your clan have insulted justice.
The young Master of the Palace of Hua has charged out to eliminate you.
Young master, do not put on this dress.
The princess will punish us.
You will be punished, only if she gets informed.
Silence.
As you order.
Am I beautiful?
You look magnificent.
Stay here.
I will take a look.
What a beauty!
Accounting
Help!
I will kill whoever dares to help him!
Darn!
Calm down!
I want his invitation to the tournament.
Go to hell!
Darn!
It doesn't matter who claims to be a master of martial arts.
But only the elected officials have an invitation.
This is too prestigious.
With this invitation you can attend the tournament.
If you win you will be elected sovereign.
... and you will reign the world.
Get stuffed!
As long as I live... you wont get this invitation.
You will not manage to kill everyone...
Go to hell!
Who of the others has an invitation?
Cowards!
They are all fleeing!
What?
This was easier than to seduce them.
I am exhausted.
- Who would have done it?
- Me.
You?
- You said to me that I was pretty.
- Collect the invitations.
- You were sincere?
- Of course!
Collect them.
- Swear it.
- Swear to yourself.
A guest.
- Buddha may bless you!
- Welcome.
Please take a rest.
Will someone recognize you?
That would be difficult.
Besides, we have been withdrawn from the scene for eighteen years.
Excuse me, I know you... lmpossible!
Do you believe to know everyone here?
You are vulgar.
You are surely...
Exactly.
We are the three Brutes.
Mister Brute, Madame Brute and Brute Junior.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Leave now!
Out of my way or I teach you a lesson.
Beat it, let us be on our way.
Calm down.
I think I know someone over there.
You are fantastic!
This one seems to have hot blood.
Here is our famous inspector
Madame Yi.
Your presence honours us.
Thank you for coming from so far away.
I've gotta thank you.
You recommended me to act as arbiter at this great tournament.
I am very flattered.
After you.
After you.
There are too many candidats.
If they all fight, that will take an insane amount of time.
It's not so simple.
These are the rules of the tournament.
Nobody is authorized to enter without invitation.
There are three types of invitations:
gold, silver and bronze.
Each victory makes it possible to pass to the higher category.
Those of the gold category will have to pass the personality test.
And they all will be candidates for the title of sovereign.
Who set up these shitty rules?
A man observes me since a moment.
- Where is he?
- Over there.
- A woman looks at me.
- Where is she?
They resemble the Two Devils.
- You are sure?
- Let's see.
She winked at me.
No reaction.
Follow me.
She has only one eye.
Really?
-You remember me?
- No.
- So?
- He doesn't recognize me.
Welcome.
Dear friends, my name is Kong Pik-hok.
In the name of the organization comitee of the tournament, let me wish you all welcome.
It's supper time.
I wish you a good appetite.
Who is the man with the ridiculous hairstyle?
Don't you know?
He is the commissioner of the tournament.
In the last ten years, he received many gifts.
This is how the expenses of the tournament are defrayed.
And the person beside him?
This is a dream come alive.
But he is bald!
- Bravo.
- Thanks.
Please forgive me if the reception is not appropriate to you.
Welcome all.
- Mister Lee, this is my son Jade.
-How are you?
Your son is exceptional.
He could be the big winner of the tournament.
Brother!
- Toilet buddy.
- Let's forget the past.
I've got your invitation.
Please, take a seat.
- Jade.
- Father.
This is my saver. 2 days ago, I was falling...
This is my father.
- What's your name?
- Kao.
His name is Kao.
My pleasure.
I will tell your father my true name.
The inspector arrived.
I will greet her.
Mind your language, please.
You have a gold invitation.
Follow me.
Thanks.
To your health.
To your health?
!
The dishes are cold.
This guy is impolite by letting us wait.
Patience.
It's not polite indeed, but the rules require that we wait.
You want to teach me a lesson?
lnsolent!
You will not regret having waited.
Look, here it is.
It's not enough to win her over.
I've got a request...
Mr. Hua !
Mr. Kong.
Better late than never.
Go on, eat!
Excuse me...
I am used to...
He saw me dressed like a woman... only have lunch.
So I came to tell you that I'm not taking dinner with you.
To your health!
Good bye.
This is the girl from the other night.
Why is she disguised as a man?
Enough speeches, let us eat!
This world is full of strange people.
I believe you dumb.
Good appetite.
I am the Black Monk.
May I know your name?
An interrogation?
Okay!
I am the chief of the clan of Mount Tian Dao of Chun Fa.
Did you already hear my name?
You surely know the name of my master.
It's Lee the Flying Knife.
- He is known.
- I know it well.
You know it well?
Let us drink.
I am sure he was talking about Lee the Man-eater and To Qiu-qiu.
The young man is no other than the son of Yin and the Hua princess.
Eighteen years ago this couple fought and Yin disappeared with the child.
He was seriously wounded.
He was the benefactor of the Ten Criminals.
They had to take care of his son.
I believe that's him.
Perfect.
We will reveal his identity.
He will be eliminated quickly.
Let's be serious.
You will wound Hua Mochue.
Why?
You are the only one who can measure with him.
If you wound him, you will tarnish his reputation, and he will not be elected new sovereign.
You will do it in my place.
- Me?
I will be occupied.
- By what?
I must whistle to inform Qiu-qiu.
She will accompany the others.
And if he is indeed a girl?
Then, there is more need to whistle.
I'm going to take care of her myself.
Look at yourself in a mirror.
She is right.
I will use aphrodisiacs.
They are available in form of wine and powder.
But if you take them without having a number it's your death.
Pay more attention.
- What do you see?
- Something import.
Let's descend.
Shit!
Keep guard.
I'm doomed!
Miss, your centres are quite large.
May I touch them?
Will I get a kiss?
What did I say?
You wanted to leave.
How?
What I'm trying to tell you?
I raised you for eighteen years.
Daddy Lee.
Now, you can fly with your own wings.
Do you want me to leave?
It's the first time for a pretty long time
I am attracted by somebody.
But you are caring only for yourself.
Perfect.
I leave you for Hua.
I leave.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
What an unworthy son!
Daddy Lee...
Why do you cry?
I hid my feelings...
My eyes betrayed me...
- Look at my eyes.
- I'm looking.
I respect you.
I know...
- I admire you, I love you...
- I know...
I always regarded you as my benefactor... a relative and an honest man, how can you... transform into the person whom I love.
What do you think of that?
- I am bad...
- You are not human.
Yes.
- Leave.
- I go.
That's good.
If he is a man, I will call you.
What an idiot!
Come out.
What else?
I'm staying here to attend the scene.
Why do you want to stay?
If you do not know how to make out, I will be able to assist you.
Your presence will disturb me.
The last time, there were people around me...
Go, hide somewhere else.
You're dismissed.
What's wrong?
What's happening?
Let us follow her.
Ask me what I'm doing here.
- What are you doing in my room?
- Your room?
- Very pretty this glove.
- Speak up.
- Why did you come here?
- I explain to you...
What's up?
I am in charge of it.
Withdraw your hand or I tear it off.
I see.
You still want me.
- Do not touch me.
- It's not me.
It's my wrong arm.
Real one is here.
Everybody came for one and the same reason.
And this reason is him.
Lately...
Your breast is huge.
Can I touch it?
A masked rapist hides under the tables.
He attacks only men.
He strikes them, violates and kills them.
I followed this future victim until here..
Then I hid to confront the culprit and stop him.
- Take away this arm.
- Sorry.
Miss, Let me touch your big breast!
He is under the influence of an aphrodisiac.
Don't touch.
This rapist is interested only in the men.
He is creepy.
He was lucky untill now.
I came with Mrs. Yi to stop him.
Why does this guy rape men?
What a moron!
Stop talking.
Rather give him the antidote.
A banal antidote will not return his normal state to him.
Let us try... that!
- Did you find something?
- Yes.
I found a small pill.
It's much too big.
It will pass with some wine.
No!
Take away your false arm!
Difficult to distinguish truth and fake.
You are lucky!
He's finished.
He is too excited.
Young woman, you have big breasts.
Can I touch them?
It's better I take him elsewhere.
Remain where you are.
Let us get to the bottom of this story.
You are right.
I need to clarify this.
According to the testimony of a victim, the rapist has a beauty spot on the chest.
We are the only men.
I prove my innocence.
Look.
And you?
Show us your chest.
Come on!
You are disgusting!
Undress!
Mr. Hua.
Two solutions:
You show us your chest.
Or you will be taken along to look after it.
What do you think about it?
If you say nothing, this means that you want them to look after.
As you want.
You are understanding.
Farewell.
Let us leave.
You see, you are poisoned.
But I have no antidote.
If you don't make love, you will die.
They entrust you this mare.
Go for it.
One, two and three, leave.
Will this mare make the deal?
I think yes.
She is tame and quick.
Two hours should be enough.
I appreciate what you did.
Thanks.
I would like to take a bath.
So fast?
You're done very fast.
But it's only an animal.
Why would I have taken my time?
I did it to remove the poison.
We just wanted...
Do not go there.
He smells bad.
They gave you this horse so that you can go downtown to the brothel, where you can be with a girl.
To go downtown?
To bring me to the brothel?
Why you didn't tell me?
With the horse...
How are you?
They greeted us.
I don't understand.
They resemble the Two Devils.
I will question them.
Not right away.
We have no proof.
I will find a measure this evening.
Please excuse my delay.
It's all right.
We begin the drawing of lots.
The tournament begins.
The first participants are Fei and Yua.
What a shame!
Eliminated in the first round.
I want to sit down.
You're a looser!
Beat it!
You really don't have a heart.
After these preliminary round combats, six participants reached the final.
Chan An-chong of the Dim Chong School.
Jade Kong, of the city of Martial Arts.
Small Fry, a new participant.
Kong, our General Commissioner.
Hua Mochue of the Palace of Hua.
Mou of the Tian Shan School.
Mou!
How do you dare to come here?
How do you justify the rape which you committed?
Which rape?
Do you became insane?
And how would you know about it?
Mount Tian is very isolated, shelters few inhabitants.
There are sixteen villages:
120 men and 49 women.
On the evening of the 15th of last month, you were drunken.
You wounded the Chan brothers and raped their sister.
Who are you?
How do you know that?
I have informants across the whole country.
My pigeons bring me more than 3000 letters a day.
I nourish them without looking at the expenses.
Thus, I know everything that happens.
Buddha may bless you.
- You are Chan Year-chong?
- I'm withdrawing...
Congratulations.
You are the four finalists.
Master, between Small Fry and Hua, who will leave victorious?
It doesn't matter.
Small Fry will help us to eliminate Hua.
Master, my career depends on you.
Among the four finalists of the tournament, you will be the big victor for sure.
Father doesn't even have confidence...
"Who will love a progressive girl?"
"While discussing the world, he watches me putting on make-up."
"I hate to earn my living"
"by making wedding dresses for others."
You're in love?
By reciting this poem... do you know that you infringed our rules?
I did never understand their meaning.
I was only repeating.
Really?
Small Fry is detestable.
Exactly.
Especially his eyes, they are magical!
When he looks at you, your heart gets carried away.
He is so adorable that no one can ever be annoyed.
Rendez-vous at the ruins.
Hua Mochue.
The Two Sovereigns?
Sorry to send for you so late.
What's happening?
You are gifted in martial arts, worthy and brave.
But your enemies are envious.
You are in danger.
Be vigilant!
Attention!
You?
No need to shout.
Everything is fine.
How do you do?
My face suffered from the fall, didn't it?
Don't leave me!
I'm here.
Thank you, Miss.
Since our last meeting, I realized that... it's you whom I want.
Only you.
I came into the world for you.
She withdrew her hand.
I must go on.
I want to tell you that you are beautiful.
Since your departure,
I closed my eyes.
I am afraid that by opening them, I don't see you anymore, but only ordinary people.
I would like to...
How are you?
Same here.
Really?
I assure you.
I spoke a little too much...
This is blood!
Blood...
My love for you is so deep...
When I saw you the second time, and you saved me in that room...
There I knew that I am not unimportant to you.
I think that if I must die,
I would like that it is near you.
My wish is granted.
I regret that my dream is not realizable...
Winning her over.
Which dream?
I would like to take the woman of my life... in my arms.
I would like to put a kiss on these lips.
I'm going too far.
But that's not important.
We all take along a dream or two to the beyond.
Only for this kiss...
If I get out of here alive,
I will marry you.
Are you moved?
I won.
It's time to retreat.
My dream becomes reality,
I don't want to die anymore.
I remember!
I have an antidote.
Help me to take it.
Lower.
Lower.
Higher, that's not it.
Good, higher!
That's good.
Thank you.
Chew it and make me eat it.
No, that's not necessary anymore.
Unbelievable!
What's happening?
Nothing.
Something obstructs me.
When I go out in the evening, I always take a candle with me.
Like that, I don't get lost.
Help me to light it.
I will take a look.
It's wet.
Surely there is an exit.
I didn't make a mistake.
Did I.
Don't forget what they said.
Farewell.
You must wait for me.
We walked all evening long.
What do you want to show us?
We'll arrive, it's right in front of us.
A cabin?
Enter.
A woman?
A pretty woman.
I agree with you.
But no interrest.
Mr. Big Pimp...
Just Pimp.
Else it would be rude on my part.
That would not be correct.
I thank you for your kindness.
What?
You refuse to pay?
No...
Then, come!
Qiu-qiu !
It's her?
A lot of skill...
No interest in women.
Let us play to choose who will begin.
That's not necessary.
How come?
You courted her in the past.
What?
She was your lover in the past...
I am going to vomit.
Because of finding former buddies.
What?
- The Two Devils!
- Take a good look.
The appealing To Qiu-qiu.
The handsome Lee the Man-eater.
I don't understand anything.
Do you remember at least the theft?
Where did you hide the donated money?
Now I understand!
You belong to the Ten Criminals.
You are also part of it.
What's happening?
All these people!
Is there a party?
I welcome you in our city.
They speak to you, answer!
You are uncovered.
They know your identity.
It's him, Lee the Man-eater.
Catch them.
Let's hurry or it will be too late.
They are the Two Sovereigns.
Stop.
I am in charge of it.
If it pleases you.
It's up to me to kill the Ten Criminals.
My family went to Beijing in search of a better life.
While they crossed the valley of the Criminals, they all were killed.
Stand back, let me punish them.
A gas capsule for the Criminals?
Why do you try to run away?
Why no toxic gas?
I wanted to use some.
But I was given this bomb falsely.
I have to investigate that.
Move away!
Let me.
Excuse me?
Nobody is authorized to leave this place.
What an authority!
Master.
Sovereigns.
We are here to defend the position of the new sovereign.
Truth, falsehood and revenge will be decided in the ring.
This is our law.
If you don't respect the rules, there is nothing here to achieve.
Nobody will question the orders of the Two Sovereigns.
Mochue.
After you.
Thank you for coming here.
Your presence honours us.
My student is not bad.
But he lacks experience.
I came here to watch over him.
I don't want him to fall into a trap.
But somebody has already set up a trap for him.
Who dared to do that?
He is called Small Fry.
Small Fry?
He is geting along well with your student.
Mr. Hua will hesitate to do everything to kill him tomorrow.
I have trained him for eighteen years.
I want to make a grand master out of him.
If he betrays me, I will make him pay a lot.
Calm down.
Young people need our patience.
I'm not sure of that.
This pill will make him so obedient as a dog.
And if he does not obey, he will not receive the antidote and will die within twelve hours.
He will defeat Small Fry.
My student will surely be elected new sovereign.
Even if it's necessary to assist him in this task.
He is very strong.
The victory is almost acquired.
But we are afraid that Small Fry takes it.
I am going to see Mochue immediately.
Farewell.
Thank you, Princess.
This bitch drank the wine of madness.
But she is capable.
The poison is colourless and scentless.
It will only work when she draws upon her energy.
It will diminish her mind little by little without her being able to recover.
If activated, it will plunge her into madness in the end.
You are a huge expert in poisons.
You are also expert in disguises.
We were disguised, but nobody noticed anything.
You are both extraordinary.
Enough flatteries.
We gotta prepare the secret weapon against Hua.
At your command.
What are you doing here?
I want you to fight with all your power tomorrow.
What do you want exactly?
I will tell you the truth.
I mastered the technique of the Blue Devil.
During the fight, one of us must die.
It's going to be myself without pity.
You must make a tone to better overcome me.
In the encyclopaedia of kung fu, in the blue chapter, there is the Blue Sword, the Fist of the Blue School and the Blue Hand of Jade.
Your technique does not appear there.
Do not trust rumours.
The encyclopaedia was published six years ago.
At least two hundred techniques are not mentioned there.
lmpossible.
My master assured me that it was complete.
What are you trying?
Your face...
I know that this technique does not exist.
You lie to me.
You want to die at my hands.
Why?
That's true.
I lied to you.
Because...
Since our meeting...
Since our kiss...
- my life belongs to you.
- Be silent!
lmpossible !
Before dying...
- I must confess to you.
- Stop!
I am happy to die at your hand.
I fear that if you do not fight thoroughly, your master will be angry.
Since you are going to die...
Why do you still care about me?
Though you say so,
I cannot kill you.
Don't cry.
If you go on, I'm also going to cry.
She is sincere.
How can I lie to her?
I must confess her the truth.
What did I teach you during 18 years?
No man is honest.
Don't consider yourself to be a woman.
Feel nothing towards a man.
Preserve your virginity preciously.
When you have the emblem of justice, train and attain perfection.
Honour your school and fulfil my wish.
You cry for a man!
A man who comes from the Valley of the Criminals.
You disappoint me.
Forgive me, master.
You are not worthy to be my student.
I will give my best tomorrow.
Perfect.
Swallow this.
It's a lethal poison.
You must win.
Otherwise, you will have no antidote and you will quickly die.
I am grateful to you.
- I take it.
- No!
We'll meet at the final.
Why?
There are only four finalists left.
They will be divided into two groups.
Hua Mochue versus Small Fry.
Master Kong versus Jade Kong.
The match... begins.
Let's do it.
Hua Mochue!
Mochue !
Don't touch!
The rules forbid any interruption of a fight.
You attacked him from behind.
That's inacceptable.
Even if we forgive you, Mr. Yin will not tolerate that.
Yes?
Your former husband.
He who broke with you.
It's finished between us...
You left your own child and adopted an orphan in its place.
Hua Mochue.
"A couple separates and reunites"
"Flowers bloom, flowers die." Hua Mochue!
Do you feel regrets?
I feel regrets.
But I made no mistake.
No mistake?
Why did you attack him?
Didn't you know that he is your son?
My son?
My son?
It's definitely him.
No, he's not my son!
He's definitely your son.
- No.
- Yes.
He's not my son!
It's the truth.
No.
No, he's not my son...
You're an unworthy mother.
You seriously hurt him.
Are not you ashamed?
How do you dare to look at his face.
lmpossible...
My son cannot live in the Valley of the Criminals.
I am a monster!
Forgive me, my son!
Mother...
She is very weak.
Finish her.
Witch, how do you dare to disturb the order?
I beg your pardon, my son!
I destroyed the life of my son!
Mother!
Master!
This is the famous antidote.
No!
Catch them.
One moment.
Let's flee!
They are gone.
We killed her in the spirit of justice.
If you want to punish me,
I will accept my fate.
You've done well.
Small Fry and Hua Mochue left.
Master Kong and his son are going to compete in the final.
One moment, Master, Father.
How can a son compete against his father?
Right.
I declare therefore that the victor is Master Kong Pic-Hok.
Wait.
Your Excellencies.
Dear Sirs, the competition indicates
Master Kong as the winner.
However, we will not entrust the emblem of justice to him.
Somebody informed us about his crimes.
I have a book of account in hand.
A young hero risked his life by stealing it from robbers.
On March 21st, Kong ordered to us to plunder a convoy.
Two million taels.
We received 800.000.
On July 14th, abduction of the girl of Chin.
Three millions.
Received a million.
We killed the girl.
On November 7th,
Kong tells us about the flood donation.
Stolen.
Hundred millions.
The half comes back to us.
Received fifty millions.
You're in alliance with bandits.
You deserve death.
I am innocent!
No way.
It's your own son who entrusted us this book of account.
I can't stand this anymore.
You went too far.
I am your son.
But I cannot tolerate your acts.
Father, confess.
You...
I will kill you!
Go ahead!
Strike me!
If you have remorse, my death will have served a reason.
Father, pull yourself together.
- Father?
- Rotten.
You betrayed your father?
You were in great shape.
If I had not done it,
I would have waited ten years or more for this title.
Rest in peace.
Father!
He is dead...
You killed my father...
Don't be sad.
You've done right.
You have our support.
Dear Sirs, the emblem of justice returns to Jade Kong.
He becomes the new sovereign.
My kung fu is poor.
I do not deserve this position.
No, you are worthy of it.
Are you a virgin?
Perfect.
Your body is pure.
We will help you to enrich your internal energy.
We will teach you the supreme technique.
You will be invincible.
Congratulations.
We will teach you the technique of Frozen Jade.
The supreme technique.
I succeeded!
I attained the ultimate state.
Fist of Ice and Fire.
We are exhausted.
You are vulnerable.
Rest a little.
We are not only exhausted.
You will have to protect to us for three months.
Got it.
You always need to get rid of enemies when they are weak.
With this blow, I cut three of your nerves.
You will never practise kung fu again.
Why did you do that?
It's demanding for you to transmit your knowledge every eighteen years.
So I will be sovereign for life.
No more tournaments.
You are sly!
Sly?
If that were the case... you would have died.
Here is a million.
Skedaddle.
You...
We better leave.
At least, we have some money.
Let us go.
Jade.
How do you dare to call me Jade?
Forgive me.
Your Honour.
Why not eliminate them?
Are you crazy?
Use your brain.
From now on I am sovereign.
If I kill them, I will be under suspicion.
Pass around this news.
They transport a million and are without defense.
There are more than enough enemies of justice.
When these will have killed them,
I shall avenge them.
And everybody will recognize my uprightness.
What a good idea!
You are my uncle and my master.
Be faithful to me and I could be generous.
Do you remember that I promised to marry you?
It was not a joke?
It was a promise.
Life and death are hanging by a thread...
Even after having crossed the worst moments, a couple continues to like each other,
for the rest of their life.
I would like to be your husband for the rest of my life.
Let us begin from now on.
Congratulations to the bridegroom.
Congratulations to the bride.
Let us begin the ceremony.
Small Fry, I am cold...
Drink this wine, and you will not feel the cold anymore.
Yin.
I entrust this couple to you.
Bow to the heaven.
Bow to the father.
Bow to each other.
Why do you cry?
It is a big day.
That's enough!
We must be cheerful!
You know that I will not survive this night.
Why marry me then?
You are the only one
I want to marry.
To be your husband for a day, will fill me with happiness.
Darling.
Darling.
- Who makes so much noise?
- I am going to see.
I am cold, everything is black!
Don't be afraid.
Enemies?
I entrust her to you.
I accompany you.
Stay where you are.
How do you dare to come here?
Beat it!
They are the Two Sovereigns.
We must kill them.
You are the Two Sovereigns?
Yes.
The representatives of justice.
Why are you afraid of them?
Jade set a trap for us.
Our power is lost.
Give us the million or we kill you.
A million?
Jade gave us this sum.
Since then, they follow us.
Give it to me and I regulate the problem.
Give it to him.
- Quickly.
- They shall leave.
You promised to help us.
I only promised to regulate the details of your funeral.
Wait.
If you fight against us two, are you sure to win?
Our chances are equal.
What's the point in killing each other?
If you want to leave...
I would like to keep this money...
Here's the money.
You could share it.
What do you think of it?
It's a deal.
Accepted.
Why does he marry her?
She will not get over the night.
Don't you have anything better to say?
Nice words!
Fine.
She will make it till dawn.
We are responsible.
We have to save her at all costs.
Jade destroyed the only antidote.
There is no rescue.
He is right.
That's not sure.
Two people can use their energy to cancel the effect of the poison.
You don't have enough power left.
He is a grand master of martial arts.
Ridiculous.
He is a vegetable.
He cannot help us.
He is like a chest without a key.
If we find the key, his power will be released.
Really?
I will teach you how to stimulate the right nerves to transfer his energy to your body.
So, you will save your wife.
He's right.
Father, this is a desperate case.
If you want to help us, give me a sign.
Thank you, father.
What are you waiting for?
What do you say?
Your wife is very pretty.
He complimentes you on your beauty.
This is unbelievable.
Do you want to try?
Guess it's working.
Profiteer!
Darling, thank your father on my part.
I feel better.
I am happy to hear that.
He already knows.
You can stop...
Father.
He is dead.
Yin!
He joined his wife as he wished.
He transmitted all his energy so that his son can take revenge.
To take revenge?
But Jade mastered the supreme technique.
There is a much more powerful technique than his.
It's called the Sword of the Couple.
The Sword of the Couple?
Only a couple deeply in love can carry it out.
You then become ten times as powerful.
You are the ideal couple for this technique.
Do you think that this technique is unstoppable?
I don't have the slightest idea.
We have never tried it.
We have to try it or Jade will stalk us for eternity.
You are right.
Don't forget: the power of the sword increases with your love.
This sounds amusing.
Let us try too.
I envy them.
Are you a lovers?
Don't we look like it?
Then you are going to learn another one.
Will do.
Let us greet our sovereign.
Long life to the sovereign!
I will do my best to deserve this honour.
It's been fifteen days since, your sovereign discovered the true identity of the Two Devils.
He also captured six Criminals.
We will execute them, then annihilate their home.
I promise this to you.
Bravo!
These men are volunteers to participate in the demonstration of the supreme technique.
Light becomes darkness and darkness becomes light.
How do you dare to return?
I did not die yet.
You killed your own father.
You're not worthy of being here!
Don't be upset with them.
Bring some wine.
It's a misunderstanding between us.
Let's take a glass.
I am going to explain everything to you.
Everything will be fine.
Speak up.
The sovereign admires you a lot.
To your health!
You used this wine to kill my mother.
It's your turn to try it.
How could you advance so quickly?
We trained hard, contrary to you.
What did you think?
He would have killed you after having gotten rid of us.
That's not true, isn't it?
You helped him to kill his father, as well as my master.
He also wants to kill the Two Sovereigns.
You know too much about it.
He will kill you one day.
No, he will never do it!
I'm your master.
Tell them that you will not kill me!
Let's go.
I will find you.
Follow me.
Why did we come here?
I don't want to hurt the innocent.
He will follow us.
Where is he?
He is very near.
That progress in so little time!
Your technique is not invincable.
I'll proof it to you.
Really?
I would like to believe you.
He is very powerful.
Calm.
A little bit of encouragement.
It's not enough.
Here is a little more.
It's my turn.
What are you still capable of?
Show me.
It is our turn!
This is the moment.
More encouragements.
That's not enough.
These emblems spoiled the life of many people.
Throw them away.
We need to keep them.
If our children are not wise, we shall spank them with them.
Let's go.
They are a nice couple.
I envy them.
We learned a similar technique.
If we...
- No.
- Why?
You made it with the horse...
Make it with an ox, and we shall be quits.
Sir
What's your mission today?
Save hostages, Sir
What?
Save hostages, Sir
Kill hostage is more proper
Such a lovely girl
Was destroyed by you
Can't you differentiate enemy and friend?
Did I tell you how many hostages
No, Sir
So you thought there's only me
And you rolling in and firing at the same time are cool, right?
Didn't look behind you?
If I were the one who got up
I'd be shot by you
Then you have to handle my funeral and also my parents
Look at you, can you afford it?
Is it enough?
Yes, Sir
Good, no more scolding then
From tomorrow onwards, I'll be promoted to a better life
You'll be on your own
Yes, Sir
Give me five...
Are you happy that I leave?
Let me tell you
I'm happier than you
Sir Chow, your file hasn't come back yet
Madam will see you later
Alright then
I know you may think I'm boasting but you think about it
When I sit in that room and give out orders
How can I not be proud of myself?
I'm love torn
I'm finally promoted
I'm love torn
Love torn!
You're love torn?
Is it possible?
You've dated before?
No
That is!
We're pen pals
Pen pals
We've corresponded for three years
Recently, she stopped writing to me
Why?
Cause I sent her a photo
You asked for it
How can you send a picture of your face?
Right, that's why I sent yours
My picture?
Yes, your picture and that she never writes me back
Well, it's not your fault
It's not a sin to have an ugly face
What's love, one may sacrifice for it
In the dark... all is ended
Your mother...
Did I ask for cold water?
Have you ever seen me drinking cold water?
No
Then why did you pour me cold water?
Behave yourself, this is police station
So what?
I like to beat her, and she likes it
So?
Do you like it?
Yes
Speak up
Yes
Louder
Yes, I like it
Then go and get me water
You're jealous I have lots of women?
Getting a statement
Let me finish it Yes, Sir
Come here Where?
Over here Come here right away
Just questioning no need to use a hammer?
!
Questioning?
After the beating
Hold him, don't let him move
Hey
Wait
What are you doing?
Sit still!
Ah Tat...
This isn't right
Have you questioned any suspect before?
No but you'll be in trouble if you hurt him
How would this hurt him?
!
I'll put a phone book on this chest and hammer on it
Then there'll be no evidence
Better don't make trouble at this time
Any phone book?
How come there's no phone book in the station?
It seems I haven't bring along
There is
Put on your chest
I really don't agree what you're doing
Don't worry, it'll be alright
Come, put it here
Count to three
Sir, your phone book is so small It'll kill me
Open it
Three
It'll kill me too
Take your hand off, hold him
Hold him
It's not my fault, I'm forced to do so
Three
Don't play around
Hurry up
Two...
Hey, wanna die?

You're a man too
I knew it

Why did you beat him?
Such a big man insulted a woman
I hate those men who don't respect women
You can report if you think I'm wrong
I wanna report...
I'm beaten by the policemen
Have your files been back?
No
Mr., sorry, according to the procedure these two ain't policemen
What?
Then why did they beat me?
There's nothing wrong.
We're reasonable
If you wanna sue these two men
I have to charge... you three gang fighting
Interested?
Why did you let these two mad dogs beat me?
I have to report them
I have to report you too
Don't think that I wouldn't recognize you
I remember you, short, fat and wrinkled
Gee, my eyes
I'm the top in this district
If you wanna report, come to me
Did anybody see I hurt his eyes?
Yes
Then I'll take one more and kick your bottom too
See if anybody believe you?
!
Let's go
Yes, Madam
Did anybody see I kick him?
Yes
What about a short, fat and wrinkled me?
No
Good!
Madam, it's a misunderstanding just now
But...
I'm responsible for it
I was happy to hit that guy
If Madam thinks I'm wrong you can nail me anytime
You two did very well in the firearm case last month
Yes, because
That's nothing, it's our duty
Nothing special
Don't be so humble what do you wanna do?
Which department is the most dangerous in the force?
Regional Crime Unit
I wanna go there
If you go there, what about me?
Then I'll go to the Transport Unit right?
What have I done wrong?
Sigh...
Hopeless
Oh my god
Turn it off, license, ID card
Great trouble!
It's Brother Sing
Don't be afraid
You guys are getting more stupid
Brother Sing, we'll be alright, right?
You guys are lucky.
It's me this time
Be more careful
We can go then?
Go...
Why did you degraded to be a traffic policeman?
Yes...
Turn it off, license, ID card
Don't joke around
Ignore him
I'm not joking
Get of the car put both hands on your head
Hold them tight
I'm now charging you dangerous driving attempted murder
I'm not the driver
Shut up
You have unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16
I haven't
Shut up!
Look at it yourself
Go...
Bastards, am I degraded?
It's called desertion
Slow down
Sing...
Tat
Wow, in such a good mood for BBQ
Of course
Give me a sausage
There're more for me
How's the uniform?
Good, colourful and comfortable
Really?
Yes
Then you wear it longer
You should have made Madam happy
She's lucky that I didn't beat her up
Not like you, I don't date old woman
Hey, it's not me who date her
It's she that keeps following me
I'll get her for sure
Look at your ugly face
I wonder what she likes about you
She likes everything about me
You're the No. 1 shooter in the SPU aren't you?
Sir, the car's gone
Oh, I'm going.
I'm following a big case
What case?
Big case
Is there anybody from the other team?
I've got a hard band transmission
We have company gentlemen
Is it the Urban Council to clear the garbage?
Check it out
Don't shoot, we're police too...
We've got an undercover up there
Everybody's safe
That's our undercover
He's investigating a terrorist case at an international school
Those terrorists have already exploded 2 schools in Britain
They came to Hong Kong this time which school is the target?
We're still investigating
Thank you Peter, your turn Lydia
We haven't received any message about the undercover from the Special Branch
Do we have to inform you everything we do?
Peter, don't get mad You both ain't wrong
Little friend, what's your name?
Transport Unit P.C. No.167 Chow Sing Sing, Sir
Any backing?
Backing?
No
Good, then you can be the scapegoat for the case
Agree?
This is to make me a scapegoat
Yes, it's a shame
I shall beat him up
Right
You think so too?
Right...
I'll beat him up now
Hey, be gentle
Don't kill him
It's hard to say, I can't control myself
Don't use so much force
I'm a strong man
Yes, you're right
Who can afford my punch?
I think there's no one
Okay, I'll fight
Hey, watch out for my Madam
I'll beat whoever make me a scapegoat
Yes...
Am I right?
Yes, then hurry back for coffee
Do you wanna go for a coffee?
Yes, coffee
Then go for coffee first
I tell you, I'm not afraid of anything
Whoever blame me, I'll beat him up
Auntie, have a cup of tea
Good boy
Mom, don't force him
When did I force him?
You say it, have I forced you?
You say it
Theoretically, no
Your mother wouldn't force him
I'm talking to him.
Don't interrupt
Oh, yes
Have you thought of getting married?
Under normal logical morality, yes
What does that mean?
It means no
It's because I've got no money
No money?
I don't believe
You've got no money for working so long?
Are you joking?
The money needed for wedding dress courtesy money, cakes feast, honeymoon new house, and other things
I couldn't afford it
I heard policemen have five hundred million income
That's a long time ago
It's not your business
Five hundred million?
Yes, I have it but I've spend it all on those
What?
Those worth five hundred million?
Yes, they do
It's only paper
Yes...
Right now you just cost me hundred and fifty million
Is that too expensive?
Hey, you've got money
Where?
This account, we own it
I remember, each of us contributed $10
It's worth more than $10 now
$100,000?
You've saved that much
Hey, you've contributed too Don't you remember?
It's helpless.
My daughter is like me
You're lucky, get ready for the wedding
Mom, don't worry.
He'll manage it
Okay
Hey, Sing
There's some important matters you've got to help
Special Branch and Regional Crime Unit are cooperating for the first time
I'll be exposed this time
As a prostitute?
No
Then why exposed?
No
I mean I'll be visible How should I say it?
Be extraordinary
Yes... extraordinary
That's what I've just said, right?
Yes, then what?
All these English I know but not understand
You explain to me
I see, this is about...
Hum...
What?
Is it true...
Hum...
What?
What's the matter?
Madam, please think twice
I believe about this case, besides me
You shouldn't find another person to do it
Tat is our best He'll finish the job with no problem
Say it yourself, are you able?
Well, let me tell you those terrorists are crazy
Don't pretend, say it
I know...
The report is very detailed
This case is very dangerous but I'm not afraid all along
Don't overestimate yourself
Your superior told me you're not suitable for traffic
I've considered to transfer you to Tung Lung Island
That's an deserted island
Yes, there's no traffic
Wow, then you'll be very comfortable congratulations
Those junior grade people, please go out We're having a meeting
Sorry, I'm not junior
Actually I'm not part of the police force
I resign
River flows to the east
The younger generation has no cultivation nowadays
We're lucky to have you
Don't be so loud.
People will be jealous
Sorry
Sing...
I've found you several jobs
You listen
The electronics factory's vacancy with high salary, good benefit and transportation is provided
Not suitable?
How about this... as a watchman?
It'll fit you.
They provide uniform
No?
Hey, this one will do.
A movie company is looking for a leading actor
No bad habits, young strong and good-Iooking
Hey, everything fits you
Is it?
But, there's a little incompatibility
What?
They're looking for a dog to do a love story
Just a little difference Doesn't hurt to try
You're not thinking you're worse than a dog?
Not that bad!
Sing, you've got to have a plan
You're still young Don't destroy yourself?
No matter what, I've decided
What?
If it's business, count me in
Doing what I do best
Right the dog leading role is suitable for you
Undercover at school
I have to go back to school as a undercover
I have to go back to school as a undercover
I need a few assistants
They have to be strong, fast and smart
That's why I find you guys
No
You're fooling us
How do you know?
We're not as what you've described
Don't think we're stupid
That's right
We're stupid, but not a fool
Won't be fooled by you so easily
No way
No way...
No
How much money you want?

Each one $15,000
On a monthly basis
Hong Kong dollar, not Yen
Deal
Thank you boss...
Let's eat...
Let's go together
I don't understand why you have to do it
That's right
Because I wanna tell them I'm the No. 1 in the SPU
Last time the firearm case I was the best
I should have been the Chief Superintendent or Chief Inspector
Shouldn't be in Transport Unit P.C., No. 167
You understand?
I do
You're lying
You're stupid, how would you understand?
Sing, I'm not stupid
If the British Government, within a week that is before the coming Christmas Eve midnight doesn't release the head of the terrorists they'll make trouble in one of the school in HK
Sing, why is Hong Kong involved with the British Government?
Right
Do you have a holiday on the Queen's Birthday?
Yes
Then you're involved
That's right
But there's so many schools How do we know which one?
I've analyzed
The undercover just died is working in the Adam Smith International School and those studying in this school are the children of the ambassadors
If I were the terrorists
I'll make trouble there
But what if you're wrong?
Then I'll beat you up
Is it real?
As real as the 999 real gold
Now you guys get ready, I'll go apply
Sing, don't guess wrong
Excuse me, is Principal Kim here?
Is it Manager Kim?
It's Principal, not Manager
It's the same The first one on the left ahead

My neck is tired from all these turning
Any other style?
Yes
Why is there a rod?
Sing, are you alright?
Yes
What about now?
Looking for a chance to beat him up
No, I mean what's the next step?
The next is to collect information on this school
I wanna know what Mike has done in this school before

None of your business
What kind of manner is this?

Downstairs Thank you
This novel isn't suitable for you
The story is romantic and terrifying but the main leads are dead at the end Such a tragedy
Too gloomy
You should read something delightful
Delightful?
Yes, such as Yi She's 'Spring Dream'
Tsukasa Hojo's 'City Hunter'
Akira Toriyama's 'Doctor IQ'
Jademan's 'Oriental Heroes'
I think they're all suitable for you
Sing, don't know that you're an expert of literature
You're great
Don't understand why did people say you're senseless
Yes and not fair It's unreasonable
Sing, I've just got a hanger-on
You?
Yes, I'm surprise too
Say big brother
Big brother
Hello, how are you?
How much do you want?
Big brother

Sandy Lai
Sandy...
I'm here
And this one... is a new student
Stephen Chow
Here...
It's Chow
Here...
Mr. Chow, welcome to the class
Matthew, chapter 27
At this time, when Juda the betrayer of Jesus saw that Jesus would be nailed he repented
Play Mahjong
Good, how much?
What are you doing?
Goodbye, Sir.
Play mahjong
Your punishment is to copy the Old arid New Testament once
What?
Why so serious?
Didn't you say play mahjong?
Few years later, the Bible is so thick
Don't even think of playing mahjong for these 2 years
It can't be?
!
Returning to the repentant Juda
He put $30 in the church
Then left, and hanged himself
What depressed him so much to end his life?
Do you think what Juda who betrayed Christ is a good man?
He's alright
If he did not betrayed Christ then Christ'll not be nailed to the cross then you won't have a cross on your neck
You'll be unemployed, fear?
The betrayal is arranged by God
That means...
God purposely cheated Juda
God, please forgive my violence
Please show me how to save this student
Sing, it's reckless here
You can do whatever you want
What?
Do you wanna copy the Bible?
It's nothing
I don't care if God saves my soul
Right now I wanna beat you
Sing, you're great Your fighting is good
But I've sensed something bad is coming
You shouldn't have insulted Minister Wong
He's the most powerful in the school even bigger than me and the Principal
He can kick you out anytime
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
I forgot
Go...
See how you can beat me up
Go!
You're something, head of discipline
Of course, don't run
Head of discipline
What?
I wanna ask you something in the washroom
Why have to be in he washroom?
Only takes you a second
Why not here?
Washroom is better
Don't go away, Head of discipline
It's the school regulation I don't wanna beat you
Come on, I ain't that stingy
I haven't killed you right?
I ain't angry at all
Yes...
It's very kind of you not to kill me.
Thanks a lot...
I'm always good for you Worth treating me a meal right?
Sure...
Can you bring some dim sum to me too?
That guy is weird, what's he doing here?
Don't care about him
As long as he doesn't intervene with what we're doing
Most important isn't letting him get close to Sandy
Sir, I really won't do it next time
You fool see if you dare to do it next time
Yes, but can you be gentle next time?
You won't be scared if I'm gentle
That's right
Go back to the classroom
Thank you, Sir
Is Sandy really involved?
Brother Sing you're really great just now
Personal show of the ball trick
It really amazes all of us
Am I that good?
Very good
It's the top
Did any girls yell?
Not only yell, some moan
Who?
Them
Brother Sing remember you can just catch the brush before
Now you've already attain such level with the ball and also play it with such style you're great
I can catch not only the brush now
Then what?
I can even catch bullets
Wow, you've got to perform a show
There's chances.
Just be patient
Then I'll wait for you
The Special Branch has already put their people here
That proves I'm right
There's something going on in this school
Good, I don't have to be beaten
What're you doing?
Any information?
No, thinking of my girlfriend
Me too
What?
Is it time to go now?
Go home and do the homework
Chow Sing Sing, the Special Branch invites you for coffee
Big Brother...
I wanna go too
What're you doing in the school
I've said before we're there to study
Sir
Teacher?
Which subject are you teaching?
You must be teaching Shitly, no, History
I warn you guys Don't follow him to school
Or else, I'll lock you up
What?
What can I do except study?
I'm a student only
Yes, you can't stop people from studying
Chow Sing Sing isn't our man anymore
Is it right, Tat?
Are you scared of him?
No, not me!
Listen, study hard.
No more investigations and no fooling around
Not to beat the head of discipline
Yes Sir!
Get out
Goodbye, Sir
Thank you, Sir
Dismiss
If there's anything went wrong you're responsible
Let's go
Did you arrange that?
Can you not ask what I'm up to?
Yes, I'll trust you then
Are you alright with your face?
Shut up
Roger
Why it doesn't work?
Anyway, the informer said they're here Move in
Okay
How come no one's here?
Be careful, they must be here
Alright, we do it as planned
The target is Adam Smith International School
But the cops are already at the school
Cops?
So you're afraid of cops
Now?
Let's go to teach them a lesson
Sing, this guy knows our identity
We're in danger.

Brother...
Do you know that girl with short hair?
Which one?

That one, no way
What about the one next to her?
I'll take care of her you take care of 'Never Defeated'
It is an order

Yes... but...
I'm afraid
No problem, let's discuss it
Of course you should have the guts to do it
But, I think you should take care of your hair first
Yes... yes...
Wasting my time
All those stuffs are irrelevant
How are you, Turtle?
Turtle...
So powerful!
How can a kiss be that powerful?
It must be the power of love
When do you marry her then?
She said when she'd get enough saving
Fine...

I'm in love with a little girl
How can I end that up?

Let me fix the situation for you
Miss Ho, don't you get mad
The reason why Sing is with Sandy lately it's all because of work
There may be some personal feeling between them
It's hard to say but don't think it's real
You too
In fact Sing is aggressive
Even though he got fired by the police force
He still comes back as undercover
Also, because of it he even spent the $100,000 wedding money
What a guy!
He's very miserable now Look at him, right?
So, let's think of a way to help him
Let's think
That means the wedding is off
Good idea, what a good solution it is
No wedding
You damn fool.
I'm in big trouble now
Why insult me?
I helped you
lucky that we don't have your kind in our team

Have a cup of tea
Don't be angry, those guys are just jealous of you
Don't you worry.

Sir
Sir
The Mission has been completed smoothly
Star Chow, where are your men?
All dead!
?
We want a supervisor, we want team work
Not going alone like Rambo
The captives have been saved
Rescuing is just an item in this exam
What matters most is the safety of your juniors and your leadership but I can't see anything!
Sir, give me a chance
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Don't!
Sir, could you please reconsider?
Who is it?
Yes
Yes, Sir.
The boss wants to see you
Yes, Sir
Good morning Sir, I'm Star Chow
Damn it, that adorable!
Turn a round for me don't be shy, come on!
Irresistible, I'm sorry
Wanna get a promotion?
I don't want to be a gigolo, Sir
I asked if you want a promotion
I won't be gigolo, Sir
That's nonsense!
I asked if you want a promotion
Yes but not at the cost of my chastity
Who wants your chastity?
I want your youth
Youth and chastity are equally important to me
Fine, fine, I see Let me finish my words
One day some students visited our police station
A pistol was lost afterwards
Sir, we lose pistols very often
But that pistol is mine!
I can share your heartbreaking feeling
Yes that pistol's followed me for 30 years
I've never shot it it's for scratching itches
Speaking of the itch and here comes Scratch me
The back?
Yes
It's a kind pistol
Can pistol be kind?
It's got a kind nature if it falls in the hands of bad students tragedies will follow
Don't worry, Sir
I'll search the whole school for your pistol
If I can manage, I don't have to ask you
I'm retiring, but I've lost my pistol
I'll lose my face if others know so I want you to enter that school as a spy
I'm not sure if I can teach
Who ask you to teach?
To be a student!
Student?
I joined the police force because I hated studying
I can't be a student Sir, if you do so... you're bringing me to a volcano with lots of wild animals paying no attention to my wailing and are just kicking me cruelly... into the exploding volcano
How can you be so cruel?
You can live and die excitingly then
Stop, no way escaping
Here's a pager watch, put it on 666 means I call you
Say to me, good morning sir
Good... morning... sir
Very good
Don't let others know or both you and I will be in trouble
I'll see if you guys will be late again
What are you staring at?
You'll learn it by heart later
That's the new boy
Big stupid guy, from which class?
Could it be ours?
I don't think so
Star Chow, I'm the Head of Discipline of this school.
My name is Lam
A mosquito
You came from England College?
Students from that school are rubbish
I don't care what's between your family and the school committee
Edinburgh College is a prestigious school and teach the best students
I can't stand a single bad element or I'll kick you out of here, clear?
Yes, Sir!
You think that's interesting?
Bring him to the classroom
Come with me to the classroom
Around 1987, an observation from the sky above the South Pole... revealed the ozone hole up above there
Strong ultraviolet ray is harmful to living organisms
A less serious situation will affect the genes
The worst case will kill the cells
Plants will die as a result
Ultraviolet ray can penetrate into the sea
I lose freedom, my heart's breaking my tears' flowing
I've lost my way and gone astray My heart is breaking
Who's attacking the police
Attacking what?
You!
Take the duster out
I don't care you're new in here What are you dreaming?
What?
Miss has got her pride The lesson restarts!
Let's start with the atmosphere layer
The atmosphere is made up of several layers
The layer nearest to the earth is called the troposphere
It's 15,000 to 50,000 feet above the earth
It contains cloud and weather systems
The Ming Dynasty particularly stressed on punishment
Disrespect Party politics and espionage were subjects to punishment
Turtle Wong
Mr. Cheng what does it mean by espionage?
It's the current practice of spying
The people involved are called spies
These people are punished by castration
Castration!
?
Chopping sex organ, kid
Chopped by how many inches?
That depends on how many inches you've got
The wrong book again, absent-minded!
Really absent-minded!
What's that noise?

Memory

Stop!
Hey... get back down here
Hey, you, go away
Please could you get down here first
What are you doing?
Who are you?

Excuse me and you get down
Why pulling me down here?

Thank you
You're not feeling well
Yes
Come with me

I'm feeling so bad
Let me see your eyes
Look down
Look up
Look at the left
Hey, your eyeballs can't move?
It can't since I've got a fever
Pretending...
I'm Miss Ho, I'm not teaching your class but I'm the counsellor of your class
You go back to classroom first
Come to me anytime if you've got problem.
Be good
Are you mad just because I've dropped your pencil case unintentionally?
No, I ain't, ain't
I'm so frightened
So how much do you want?
That depends...
Only $300
I'm not frightened now
If I know you still got money with you
I'll not throw your pencil case away but you!
I understood
Good, the saviour comes
Don't get it mistakenly I'm not helping you guys and I'm not your saviour
You can!
You look so cheeky
They'll only bully you, not me Thank you very much!
Sir, I remember the code
It's Dong Tong, Tong Dong Dong, right?
It's you?
Yes
You should have said earlier
I forgot the code earlier
Sir, I'm CID5798 I'm sent here to cooperate with you
Go home and have your hands stopped trembling
My hands are not trembling It's the Parkinsonism
I'm only pretending That saves me from doing a lot of work
The boss has asked you to stay at my home
What kind of stick are you chewing?
To quit smoking
Hey...
Miss Ho?
Forget about her!
Her boyfriend is the Head of Anti-triad Unit
What are you saying?
What?
I'm keeping an eye on that kid who's smoking
You mean Johnny?
What is he?
The head of the 4 Tigers of Mount Parker
His big brother Teddy Big is really somebody
He's the most suspicious in the case which our boss lost his pistol
Keep an eye on him
Go!
Big brother
You asshole, what a lousy idea
Big brother
Now somebody's after us for money
It's fine to traffic drugs why trafficking arms?
You said arms-trafficking is profiteering during the Gulf War
You should have persuaded me
What are we going to do with these AK47 s?
If we got pistols, we can rob
Johnny is here
Why didn't you tell me earlier
He's cheeky
Even you can be cheeky if you've got money
You're here, come in
They're for Fung-shui keep your hands off
I'm sorry
How are you getting on?
You're cheeky now
Don't worry, my dad's gone traveling
He won't have come back even our cars reach Shenzhen
Let's see and do pay us the money for the 2 cars of my Brother back
I can only pay you when my clients pay me
You're not that in need of money, right?
I need money badly
The money I collected in the school can't even afford 2 nights in the Karaoke
I've got a great thing, wanna see?
It's great we stole from the police academy
Cop's pistol?
3 each.
Don't fight for it
In memory of your fathers?
Do I still need to work if I've got so many fathers
They're all my ex-partners
Good, noodles...
Cook some for yourself
Come on, no...
Yes
Cook oneself is illegal
How many partners you've got?
But there're 10 here
I have to prepare one to two more... one to two more... and see who's coming to me
Maybe he needs it.
Just keep as stock
Would you mind?
What are you saying?
You don't understand?
It's better if you don't understand
Die at an early age
Eat your noodles I'll have supper outside
Remember to do your homework you've to go school tomorrow
Fuck you No fucking
Nothing.
Keep talking
You're always so dirty
I get used to it
I worked as a servant in a school it's fine at first but I have to work under Sir Chow
What an ass
What are you doing?
I'm less fortunate than you
I'm following the case of Teddy Big
Arms?
What a coincidence we're also after Teddy Big but for the pistol
Cop's pistol?
Yes
Really?
They're in the machine gun business
Machine guns in HK?
Yes, goods have arrived
Wow...
Why don't you arrest them
The buyers are terrorists Boss wants to arrest all at one go
That's tough!
It's life and death if something goes wrong
We can't afford to alarm them
Well keep an eye for the pistol for me as well
Sure Sure?
You have my word
Among the gang of underground informers all are dead except you and me
Of course, I'll keep an eye for you
Everyone can die, except this
Lousy
Brother Teddy, stay calm
We'll settle if there's any problem
Remember Chicken Brand whom you arrested 10 years ago
He wants to say hello to you Inspector Wong
Policeman
Understand?
Yes, good
Understand?
Fuck
Stand on one foot, upper
A show over there
Watch only...
What?
I said watch only, don't laugh
Ha...
Are you alright?
Does it hurt?
You just didn't take my words to heart
This student is brainless he's hopeless
Yes... always absent-minded hopeless
He's a jerk already looks as if he's sick
Never seen a 'star' like him
You 2 should be looking for the pistol not looking up the dictionary
He couldn't hand in his homework today and was punished by not allowing to go back the classroom
You can look into the case even if you're outside the classroom!
If I fail to hang in homework again I'm out of the school and I can't look into anything
Can you solve this calculation?
Let's see
I know nothing about trigonometry
When you first asked me to handle this case your attitude was different
No, he's always like this
I'm always like this
My soft words are for cheating you to get involved
What about asking some other cadets to come here... and solve the Maths
You're an idiot!
That means disclosing the case to everybody?
Let me tell you finish this case quickly or I'll kick your brains out with my Scissors Legs
What?
I'll fly over and kick you with legs like scissors and kick your brain out
Scissors Legs, scared?
Very
Scissors Legs, what a joke
He was really gorgeous he was!
He was able to deal with 20 guys alone or only be able to shoot 20 planes!
?
Dad, are you alright?
Dad
Dad, go to hell, Dad
How can you say that!
Damn it!
I'm late
It's only 6 o'clock
I'm influenced by your hard-work I've to do a little revision
Yam...
I'm not called Yam
But you really look like
Have you finished your Biology?
Let me copy
I won't even if I have.
Are you nuts?
I'll give you $50 in return
Mine?
You want money before finishing the homework?
Stay away, one by one as many as you want

I won't let anyone throwing dusters at me
I won't be punished by standing on the corridor or standing in the playground or holding a damn cardboard publicly like a monkey.

Sudden test, those who fail will be standing in the playground for a week
Mobile phone?
Cool, isn't it?

Mandy, ask all seniors to come up here
Ask them who's the one suppressed the An-Shi Rebellion?

A is Kwok Chi Yee B is Lee Kwang Bud
Which two of them are the heroes
Kwok Chi Yee and Chu Wen
It seems to be Lee Kwang Bud and Chu Wen
So who's the hero?
Answer me!
Kwok Chi Yee or Chu Wen?
What?
You look up the book?
No, I can manage... few more seconds
Son, it's Chu Wen.
Who's Chu Wen?
The answer is B
Banana?
B for banana

You two are riding?
Falling
So you two are cheating
No, only me who's cheating.
Arrest me
Come out with me
A moment please
He cheated in the Chinese History test by copying the Chinese Literature book
You're dumb
That's not exactly cheating
I only want to let him have the proper punishment
What do you say?
Deduct 3 marks from his conduct as usual Stop it
Please don't.
A deduction of 12 marks will be out of this school
Miss Leung, what about you?
Kill him
What did you say?
That isn't what you want?
Just cheating
It's one of our experience of growing up
Who hasn't cheated before?
But you even didn't use your brains to cheat
Stand properly.
Don't move!
You don't use your brains you deserve it
I suggest arranging for another test
If he still doesn't learn from it test him again and again until he passes
That's punishing me I can't afford the time
Save your time from going to the race-course You
I agree
You can talk to his parents and try to understand his family background
Fine, I've decided
He's punished by staying after school for a week, clean the playground for two
Deduct 5 marks from his conduct re-test next week
Also, I want to meet your parents
Parents?
I don't have any
I've got no relatives, no friends
Who's your guardian?
I'm my own guardian
If there's anybody you want to see It's me
His file
Who's his guardian in there?
Uncle Tat?
Uncle Tat!
Stop it, God... big news
Uncle Tat, is Star Chow really your son?
You're a senior to me, you say
Star Chow, say!
Don't laugh, say!
Yes
Yes...
I'm sorry...
I bet, they look exactly the same
What?
The same?
His dad?
Nonsense
Hey, no... here your surname's Tso his is Chow, why?
How do I know?
Why?
This is an order
When he's born, I named him Star Tso but then he named himself Star Chow I don't know why
Is this correct?
It's right
Sir, excuse us
Hold on, Uncle Tat we want you to come up here to tell your son cheated in a test
Cheated?
That's disgraceful, no good...
You can't cheat Sir, cheating... no good...
Excuse us
Hey, don't you see parents and teachers should cooperate to teach him
Right?
Teach him, for how long?
Your son's been here for only 3 days and he cheated
Give me one or two slaps No...
You should teach him effectively
Don't be too serious
Of course, not to be too serious
Alright, I know what to do
You cheated?
I'll beat the hell out of you
Don't let him beat you
I'll beat you...
Dead already?
Dead already
You're lying No

Yes
I'm sorry
Never mind, I'm in this business
Go and see the doctor, I'll pay for it
Thank you, thank you
Uncle Tat!
Miss Ho
Don't be so angry

That's you.
You're the head recently
So what?

You didn't even inform me when you set up a gang in my sphere
What's your rank?
I'm second in my family I've got an elder sister but she married a long time ago
She's trying to emigrate
How dare you talk to my big brother like that?
Cops're coming
Kid, you're lucky
Watch your steps you'll be less fortunate next time
What are you doing?
Are you still the tutor of Star Chow?
Yes though his performance is not that great but he's progressing a lot
Do you know there's a new triad gang in your school?
Triads again?
I've told you before
I won't tell you my students' particulars
I'm not asking for that I want to tell you
The new triad gang in your school is called the Star Gang
The leader is your student, Star Chow
That's ridiculous.
Listen!
He's my student not a triad leader
But he's a bad element in the school
I say again:
no bad elements in my school
We're responsible for leading students on to the right track
Fine, forget it
I don't want him to ruin our love
Can you stop being his tutor?
I'm your boyfriend, I worry about you
I teach students to trust those around him and you ask me not to trust my students?
Hi

Are you alright, Miss?
Study in the bedroom

Who asked you to come?
Teddy Big, please give me another chance
Give you another chance to do what
To go away
Where you wanna go?
I don't know
Go home and have a sleep Your mom misses you
You're no wonder the no. 1 killer in the SDU
That's only basic skill Cops can't be as stupid as you
You're right
Dad, are you alright?
I'm fine, I'll rub some oil...
Let me rub...
Good boy
Stop pretending
You're not a student and you're not his father
We're indeed father and son
Though I look younger than him he's my true son
Actually, I can't tell you this but I don't want to lie to you
I'm a cop
Sir Chow, everything's settled Do tell all
I'm a cop and I'm in the school to look into a case but I really want to help the kids
I don't care and don't wanna know what's between you but please stop fooling me, Sir Chow
What are you doing?
Don't tell the others, OK?
Don't
Will she tell the others?
She will, you go and kill her
Yes, Sir!
Save your dirty words
I should kill you first, save yourself!
OK...
Have I spent too much?
Do you believe I'll smash your head
I do
That's wonderful
Yes...
You've been in the school for 2 months and you've found nothing
What have you done?
Tell me
My way is like this
First I have to communicate with the students and teachers
Yes, culturing a relationship
No matter what find out that pistol within a month or both of you will be fired
I don't care, I was born cheap I'm not ambitious
I'll send you to work along the border
Great... thanks a lot!
Don't be so rash
You scared us by your hand which can smash
Yes, we're scared
Keep that smashing hand away We're scared enough
The students will do a good job in the Open Day
Fine, last year was boring
Alright
Can you lend me your pager?
What's for?
Lend it to me
The pager is mine...
Lend it to me
The pager is...
I know, I'll return it to you afterwards Thanks
If not for you I wouldn't have scored 80 in Geography
If not for you the kids wouldn't have listened to me
For you told me the goal of life shouldn't be for oneself
Now I tell you my goal in life is you
Sorry for having lied to you in the past
Sorry because I'll always follow you Star Chow
Hi
Foolish!

It stinks Hands off
Wanna beat my sole?

You'll never get a promotion
Maybe you don't want promotion, too
Go away, get back to square one
Give me one more chance Chance?

Didn't I give you any chance?
I didn't say that
We'll die together if you can't find the pistol

The men're coming.

Save hostages, Sir

Save hostages, Sir
Kill hostage is more proper
Such a lovely girl
Was destroyed by you
Can't you differentiate enemy and friend?
Did I tell you how many hostages
No, Sir
So you thought there's only me
And you rolling in and firing at the same time are cool, right?
Didn't look behind you?
If I were the one who got up
I'd be shot by you
Then you have to handle my funeral and also my parents
Look at you, can you afford it?
Is it enough?
Yes, Sir
Good, no more scolding then
From tomorrow onwards, I'll be promoted to a better life

Love torn!
You're love torn?
Is it possible?
You've dated before?
No
That is!
We're pen pals
Pen pals
We've corresponded for three years
Recently, she stopped writing to me
Why?
Cause I sent her a photo
You asked for it
How can you send a picture of your face?
Right, that's why I sent yours
My picture?
Yes, your picture and that she never writes me back
Well, it's not your fault
It's not a sin to have an ugly face
What's love, one may sacrifice for it
In the dark... all is ended
Your mother...
Did I ask for cold water?
Have you ever seen me drinking cold water?
No
Then why did you pour me cold water?
Behave yourself, this is police station

So?
Do you like it?

Have you questioned any suspect before?
No but you'll be in trouble if you hurt him
How would this hurt him?
!
I'll put a phone book on this chest and hammer on it
Then there'll be no evidence
Better don't make trouble at this time
Any phone book?
How come there's no phone book in the station?
It seems I haven't bring along
There is
Put on your chest
I really don't agree what you're doing

You can report if you think I'm wrong
I wanna report...
I'm beaten by the policemen
Have your files been back?
No
Mr., sorry, according to the procedure these two ain't policemen
What?
Then why did they beat me?
There's nothing wrong.
We're reasonable

Interested?
Why did you let these two mad dogs beat me?
I have to report them

Let's go
Yes, Madam
Did anybody see I kick him?
Yes
What about a short, fat and wrinkled me?
No
Good!
Madam, it's a misunderstanding just now
But...
I'm responsible for it
I was happy to hit that guy
If Madam thinks I'm wrong you can nail me anytime
You two did very well in the firearm case last month
Yes, because
That's nothing, it's our duty
Nothing special
Don't be so humble what do you wanna do?
Which department is the most dangerous in the force?
Regional Crime Unit
I wanna go there
If you go there, what about me?
Then I'll go to the Transport Unit right?
What have I done wrong?
Sigh...
Hopeless
Oh my god
Turn it off, license, ID card
Great trouble!
It's Brother Sing
Don't be afraid
You guys are getting more stupid
Brother Sing, we'll be alright, right?
You guys are lucky.
It's me this time
Be more careful
We can go then?
Go...
Why did you degraded to be a traffic policeman?
Yes...
Turn it off, license, ID card
Don't joke around
Ignore him
I'm not joking
Get of the car put both hands on your head
Hold them tight
I'm now charging you dangerous driving attempted murder
I'm not the driver
Shut up
You have unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16
I haven't

Look at it yourself
Go...
Bastards, am I degraded?
It's called desertion
Slow down
Sing...
Tat
Wow, in such a good mood for BBQ
Of course
Give me a sausage
There're more for me
How's the uniform?
Good, colourful and comfortable
Really?
Yes
Then you wear it longer
You should have made Madam happy
She's lucky that I didn't beat her up
Not like you, I don't date old woman
Hey, it's not me who date her
It's she that keeps following me
I'll get her for sure
Look at your ugly face
I wonder what she likes about you
She likes everything about me
You're the No. 1 shooter in the SPU aren't you?
Sir, the car's gone
Oh, I'm going.
I'm following a big case
What case?
Big case
Is there anybody from the other team?
I've got a hard band transmission
We have company gentlemen
Is it the Urban Council to clear the garbage?
Check it out
Don't shoot, we're police too...
We've got an undercover up there
Everybody's safe
That's our undercover
He's investigating a terrorist case at an international school
Those terrorists have already exploded 2 schools in Britain
They came to Hong Kong this time which school is the target?
We're still investigating
Thank you Peter, your turn Lydia
We haven't received any message about the undercover from the Special Branch
Do we have to inform you everything we do?
Peter, don't get mad You both ain't wrong
Little friend, what's your name?
Transport Unit P.C. No.167 Chow Sing Sing, Sir
Any backing?
Backing?
No
Good, then you can be the scapegoat for the case
Agree?
This is to make me a scapegoat
Yes, it's a shame
I shall beat him up
Right
You think so too?
Right...
I'll beat him up now
Hey, be gentle
Don't kill him
It's hard to say, I can't control myself
Don't use so much force
I'm a strong man
Yes, you're right
Who can afford my punch?
I think there's no one
Okay, I'll fight
Hey, watch out for my Madam
I'll beat whoever make me a scapegoat
Yes...
Am I right?
Yes, then hurry back for coffee
Do you wanna go for a coffee?
Yes, coffee
Then go for coffee first
I tell you, I'm not afraid of anything
Whoever blame me, I'll beat him up
Auntie, have a cup of tea
Good boy
Mom, don't force him
When did I force him?
You say it, have I forced you?
You say it
Theoretically, no
Your mother wouldn't force him
I'm talking to him.
Don't interrupt
Oh, yes
Have you thought of getting married?
Under normal logical morality, yes
What does that mean?
It means no
It's because I've got no money
No money?
I don't believe
You've got no money for working so long?
Are you joking?
The money needed for wedding dress courtesy money, cakes feast, honeymoon new house, and other things
I couldn't afford it
I heard policemen have five hundred million income
That's a long time ago
It's not your business
Five hundred million?
Yes, I have it but I've spend it all on those
What?
Those worth five hundred million?
Yes, they do
It's only paper
Yes...
Right now you just cost me hundred and fifty million
Is that too expensive?
Hey, you've got money
Where?
This account, we own it
I remember, each of us contributed $10
It's worth more than $10 now
$100,000?
You've saved that much
Hey, you've contributed too Don't you remember?
It's helpless.
My daughter is like me
You're lucky, get ready for the wedding
Mom, don't worry.
He'll manage it
Okay
Hey, Sing
There's some important matters you've got to help
Special Branch and Regional Crime Unit are cooperating for the first time
I'll be exposed this time
As a prostitute?
No
Then why exposed?
No
I mean I'll be visible How should I say it?
Be extraordinary
Yes... extraordinary
That's what I've just said, right?
Yes, then what?
All these English I know but not understand
You explain to me
I see, this is about...
Hum...
What?
Is it true...
Hum...
What?
What's the matter?
Madam, please think twice
I believe about this case, besides me
You shouldn't find another person to do it
Tat is our best He'll finish the job with no problem
Say it yourself, are you able?
Well, let me tell you those terrorists are crazy
Don't pretend, say it
I know...
The report is very detailed
This case is very dangerous but I'm not afraid all along
Don't overestimate yourself
Your superior told me you're not suitable for traffic
I've considered to transfer you to Tung Lung Island
That's an deserted island
Yes, there's no traffic
Wow, then you'll be very comfortable congratulations
Those junior grade people, please go out We're having a meeting
Sorry, I'm not junior
Actually I'm not part of the police force
I resign
River flows to the east
The younger generation has no cultivation nowadays
We're lucky to have you
Don't be so loud.
People will be jealous
Sorry
Sing...
I've found you several jobs
You listen
The electronics factory's vacancy with high salary, good benefit and transportation is provided
Not suitable?
How about this... as a watchman?
It'll fit you.
They provide uniform
No?
Hey, this one will do.
A movie company is looking for a leading actor
No bad habits, young strong and good-looking
Hey, everything fits you
Is it?
But, there's a little incompatibility
What?
They're looking for a dog to do a love story
Just a little difference Doesn't hurt to try
You're not thinking you're worse than a dog?
Not that bad!
Sing, you've got to have a plan
You're still young Don't destroy yourself?
No matter what, I've decided
What?
If it's business, count me in
Doing what I do best
Right the dog leading role is suitable for you
Undercover at school
I have to go back to school as a undercover

I should have been the Chief Superintendent or Chief Inspector
Shouldn't be in Transport Unit P.C., No. 167
You understand?
I do
You're lying
You're stupid, how would you understand?
Sing, I'm not stupid
If the British Government, within a week that is before the coming Christmas Eve midnight doesn't release the head of the terrorists they'll make trouble in one of the school in HK
Sing, why is Hong Kong involved with the British Government?
Right
Do you have a holiday on the Queen's Birthday?
Yes
Then you're involved
That's right
But there's so many schools How do we know which one?
I've analyzed
The undercover just died is working in the Adam Smith International School and those studying in this school are the children of the ambassadors
If I were the terrorists
I'll make trouble there
But what if you're wrong?
Then I'll beat you up
Is it real?
As real as the 999 real gold
Now you guys get ready, I'll go apply
Sing, don't guess wrong

Any other style?
Yes
Why is there a rod?
Sing, are you alright?

Too gloomy
You should read something delightful
Delightful?
Yes, such as Yi She's 'Spring Dream'
Tsukasa Hojo's 'City Hunter'
Akira Toriyama's 'Doctor IQ'
Jademan's 'Oriental Heroes'
I think they're all suitable for you
Sing, don't know that you're an expert of literature
You're great
Don't understand why did people say you're senseless
Yes and not fair It's unreasonable
Sing, I've just got a hanger-on
You?
Yes, I'm surprise too
Say big brother
Big brother

Sandy Lai
Sandy...
I'm here
And this one... is a new student
Stephen Chow
Here...
It's Chow
Here...
Mr. Chow, welcome to the class
Matthew, chapter 27
At this time, when Juda the betrayer of Jesus saw that Jesus would be nailed he repented
Play Mahjong
Good, how much?
What are you doing?
Goodbye, Sir.
Play mahjong
Your punishment is to copy the Old arid New Testament once
What?
Why so serious?
Didn't you say play mahjong?
Few years later, the Bible is so thick
Don't even think of playing mahjong for these 2 years
It can't be?
!
Returning to the repentant Juda
He put $30 in the church
Then left, and hanged himself
What depressed him so much to end his life?
Do you think what Juda who betrayed Christ is a good man?
He's alright
If he did not betrayed Christ then Christ'll not be nailed to the cross then you won't have a cross on your neck
You'll be unemployed, fear?
The betrayal is arranged by God
That means...
God purposely cheated Juda
God, please forgive my violence
Please show me how to save this student
Sing, it's reckless here
You can do whatever you want
What?
Do you wanna copy the Bible?
It's nothing
I don't care if God saves my soul
Right now I wanna beat you
Sing, you're great Your fighting is good
But I've sensed something bad is coming
You shouldn't have insulted Minister Wong
He's the most powerful in the school even bigger than me and the Principal
He can kick you out anytime
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
I forgot
Go...
See how you can beat me up
Go!
You're something, head of discipline
Of course, don't run
Head of discipline
What?
I wanna ask you something in the washroom
Why have to be in he washroom?
Only takes you a second
Why not here?
Washroom is better
Don't go away, Head of discipline
It's the school regulation I don't wanna beat you
Come on, I ain't that stingy
I haven't killed you right?
I ain't angry at all
Yes...
It's very kind of you not to kill me.
Thanks a lot...
I'm always good for you Worth treating me a meal right?
Sure...
Can you bring some dim sum to me too?
That guy is weird, what's he doing here?
Don't care about him
As long as he doesn't intervene with what we're doing
Most important isn't letting him get close to Sandy
Sir, I really won't do it next time
You fool see if you dare to do it next time
Yes, but can you be gentle next time?
You won't be scared if I'm gentle
That's right
Go back to the classroom
Thank you, Sir
Is Sandy really involved?
Brother Sing you're really great just now
Personal show of the ball trick
It really amazes all of us
Am I that good?
Very good
It's the top
Did any girls yell?
Not only yell, some moan
Who?
Them
Brother Sing remember you can just catch the brush before
Now you've already attain such level with the ball and also play it with such style you're great
I can catch not only the brush now
Then what?
I can even catch bullets
Wow, you've got to perform a show
There's chances.
Just be patient
Then I'll wait for you
The Special Branch has already put their people here
That proves I'm right
There's something going on in this school
Good, I don't have to be beaten
What're you doing?
Any information?
No, thinking of my girlfriend
Me too
What?
Is it time to go now?
Go home and do the homework
Chow Sing Sing, the Special Branch invites you for coffee
Big Brother...
I wanna go too
What're you doing in the school
I've said before we're there to study
Sir
Teacher?
Which subject are you teaching?
You must be teaching Shitly, no, History
I warn you guys Don't follow him to school
Or else, I'll lock you up
What?
What can I do except study?
I'm a student only
Yes, you can't stop people from studying
Chow Sing Sing isn't our man anymore
Is it right, Tat?
Are you scared of him?
No, not me!
Listen, study hard.
No more investigations and no fooling around
Not to beat the head of discipline
Yes Sir!
Get out
Goodbye, Sir
Thank you, Sir
Dismiss
If there's anything went wrong you're responsible
Let's go
Did you arrange that?
Can you not ask what I'm up to?
Yes, I'll trust you then
Are you alright with your face?
Shut up
Roger
Why it doesn't work?
Anyway, the informer said they're here Move in
Okay
How come no one's here?
Be careful, they must be here
Alright, we do it as planned
The target is Adam Smith International School
But the cops are already at the school
Cops?
So you're afraid of cops

But, I think you should take care of your hair first
Yes... yes...
Wasting my time
All those stuffs are irrelevant
How are you, Turtle?
Turtle...

Sit...
It's you?
!
Yes...
Sit...
Let me fix the situation for you
Miss Ho, don't you get mad
The reason why Sing is with Sandy lately it's all because of work
There may be some personal feeling between them
It's hard to say but don't think it's real
You too
In fact Sing is aggressive
Even though he got fired by the police force
He still comes back as undercover
Also, because of it he even spent the $100,000 wedding money
What a guy!
He's very miserable now Look at him, right?
So, let's think of a way to help him
Let's think
That means the wedding is off
Good idea, what a good solution it is
No wedding
You damn fool.
I'm in big trouble now
Why insult me?
I helped you
Lucky that we don't have your kind in our team

Do you have a stomach ache?
Yes.
I went shitting twice.
Sing Sing.
Hi, Ah Man.
Cousin, how are you?
I am an experienced police officer.
I won't care about such little injury.
But he is different.
He hasn't had such chance to stay with a senior officer like me.
You are not my boss.
And you are not a police officer either.
You are suspended by the Dept.
I am protecting a common witness.
I was framed, you'll know that I am innocent sooner or later.
When I resume duty, you will regret what you've done to me.
Cut the crap, stop arguing.
Please, you'd encourage him.
Say, being the undercover.
Undercover?
Don't ask him to be undercover!
I hate people being undercover.
Sing Sing, you promised me you'd never be undercover again.
Yes.
But I prefer being an undercover than protecting this scumbag
I need no protection from you.
But you were attacked over 30 times after you're suspended.
What?
Come on.
Stop arguing!
I will give you some soup, come on.
Anything wrong with you?
I have headache, and a little bit dizzy.
I see.
You refuse to leave the hospital.
Because the nurses here are so pretty.
My hand is hurt.
Miss, when can I leave the hospital?
No peeping!
You don't even take care of my hand!
Go and get some medicine from the nurse.
No peeping!
I haven't!
What are you doing?
It was dangerous!
Didn't you notice it?
What?
You are insane!
On the floor!
That's too much!
No, he....
Don't bully me!
Try once more if you dare!
Be careful!
Damn you, you wolf!
I can recognize you anyway.
Calling control, I am Chow Sing Sing, are you calling me?
Yes.
I've just destroyed a notorious group of killers.
And I've arrested the involved criminals.
Come and take them back to the station now.
Tell him I achieved something.
Officer Lai asked you to go to the scene.
I am now protecting the witness, I can't leave.
Officer Lai asked you to leave everything alone.
Come now.
-Do you mean to leave everything alone?
-Yes.
Alright.
Don't move, let me pick up the gun first.
Where is Sing Sing?
On the floor, now!
What's the matter?
He is called by the Headquarters.
Hey, the test tube is broken, give me a cup.
Yes Sir!
Madam
I'll take it for chemical test right now.
What's the matter?
It's a homicide case.
Is the dead a man or an animal?
Man.
Why a tail is found here?
You are the chemical teacher.
Who are you?
I am Chow Sing Sing, you taught me Chemistry in last movie.
I can't remember that.
I am the judicial doctor, who are you?
Chow Sing Sing.
What did you ask me?
Nothing.
Nonsense.
-Have you seen Officer Lai?
-Which one are you talking about?
That scumbag.
He claims himself Bruce Willis, he is nicknamed Super-cop.
That scumbag's foot is under yours.
Sorry sir.
Are you hurt?
Sure!
I am hurt!
Yes.
About the homicide...
It's so cruel.
The dead is called Million Wong.
His hands are tied up, and he is stabbed to death by an ice digger.
There is sperm left on the bed sheet.
The way he was killed is similar to the story of one recent movie.
So what do you want me to do with this case?
Take a look at this picture.
When did you take my picture?
I hate this.
This is the picture of the dead, you two look the same.
But he had a mole more.
It's funny.
What do you want?
It's a merit to you.
Excuse me!
I am sorry, clean your face please.
Where did you get the tissue?
It's put next to the bed, so what?
It's used by the victim for cleaning!
Cleaning what?
What do you think?
It's alright, just take it as facial.
What do you think, Officer Lai?
Where is the sperm of the victim?
Here it is.
It's empty.
You know it's a serious crime to destroy the evidence?
Unless you obey my instruction, or you'll be punished.
Your mission is to act as Million Wong, go back to his home.
Watch his wife, Judy Tong.
And his friend, Taior Lam who always wants to take his advantage.
They are suspected to be the murderers.
You want me to be undercover?
That's what I want.
Or you can name yourself "Betrayer", or, bad egg, just as you like!
I beg you, don't ask me to be undercover.
I promised my girl of not being undercover anymore.
Or, I will lose my wife.
Please, be merciful.
Please show mercy to me, I beg you!
You can refuse going.
Anymore of you, take him back and charge him... of destroying the important evidence.
Yes sir.
You scared me!
Even I refuse, there will be another one who is willing to go.
OK, I will listen to you, you are disgusting!
I haven't promised Macdonna who flattered me 8 times.
So how can you change my mind by flattering me like this?
I think it's not Macdonna but Mac Dong Hung.
Macdonna!
Please give me face to let me excuse from this mission!
No, you should go!
You are too dominant!
Dominic is my christian name.
Damn it, don't go too far!
I am a kung-fu master.
I am expert in No-shadow Fist and Skeleton Kick!
You can never defeat me.
But I can defeat you just by my tongue!
Do you want me to go?
Well, it must be reasonable for you to send me as undercover.
Let me think...
I respect your decision.
OK?
Fine!
Actually I love the name of "Undercover".
I didn't push you.
You are silly, how can you say this to your best friend?
Are you taking me as your friend?
We're colleague, lend me few hundred thousands to buy a flat, OK?
I can tell you are not righteous.
I will support you anyway.
Try hard to solve the case.
My future brother-in-law.
How nice to meet you, it's my treat.
But, lend me $20,000 first.
You are suspended, how dare you borrow money from me?
Don't lose my face.
I come to report a crime, isn't it OK?
I was indecent assaulted by a woman.
Hold it...
You said, you'd support me anyway.
If you are willing to do so, I will do everything to assist you.
That's fine!
I want him to be my assistant!
The 4th seat of the 3rd row.
You are exaggerating!
None of your business.
You are late.
I was busy.
How is the story?
The woman stays with the man in bed.
she kills the man with an ice-digger.
Hey, I want to tell you something.
What?
I quitted the job in school.
I want to help my mom to take care of her florist.
I wish to take some order from the hotel and restaurants.
Isn't it a good idea?
Good, very good.
