Are you warm enough, honey?
We can't have you catching cold.
There we go.
Hello there.
Hi.
She's beautiful.
I have a little girl, too.
Yes?
I like your shoes.
They're very bright.
What do you say?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
You know, I have one of my daughter's friends with me.
Can he say hello?
Hello there.
Hello.
- How are you today?
- Good.
I think he likes you.
Yeah.
All right, Catherine, let's give it back.
That's all right.
She can keep it.
Thank you, but we can't accept this.
Really, it's all right.
It was nice to meet you, Catherine.
Can I have the panda, please?
Yes.
Well, here you go.
There he is.
I'm heading over to Afghanistan.
I'd like to get your latest intel.
I want to see what's happening on the ground over there.
I'll see what I can dig up.
What's the sudden urge to go back to the sandbox?
I need to make an appearance, check on my men.
With all the new contracts coming in, I want to make sure everything's tip-top.
And I want to see Sanchez.
See Sanchez?
What's the point?
I want to look him in the eye, one Marine to another, make him understand.
Well, I guess that's up to you, but I think you're just delaying the inevitable.
He's one of my men.
I got to give the kid a chance.
It'll be harder to do once you see him again.
Sanchez understands the chain of command, he's just a little lost.
I think I can bring him back.
You're taking a risk going over there.
My best advice is to keep your distance from him.
I really don't need you telling me how to run my men.
You mean your employees, don't you?
I'm heading out early on tomorrow.
I really would appreciate that intel.
All right, all right, I'll make some calls.
Why don't you ditch that thing and we'll go in and have a drink?
Outstanding.
Mr Coupet, is it common practice for your vaccines to be tested in Third World countries?
All pharmaceuticals must be tested in clinical trials.
Please instruct your client to answer the question.
All right, you can answer.
Consider him instructed.
Yes, we conduct trials in Third World countries.
Because impoverished, uneducated people make more compliant subjects, is that right?
- No.
- Because many Third World governments will happily take a bribe to look the other way?
- No.
- Mr Coupet... were you aware that the man you hired to conduct trials on the vaccine, Tranzec, failed out of veterinary school?
Two decades ago.
He's now a very well-respected researcher.
Mr Coupet, are you a member of the extreme-right French ultra-nationalist political party, Le front National?
I was, briefly.
Not any more.
What the hell does my client's political affiliation have to do with this case?
Tranzec was tested using poor, illiterate children as guinea pigs.
And the research was conducted by a person who wasn't even qualified to care for animals.
Now, does that kind of callous, unethical experimentation remind you of anything?
Do not compare me to the Nazis.
You did, Mr Coupet, not me.
You know, I speak a little French, Mr Coupet.
And just because that little outburst wasn't in English, doesn't mean it's not gonna be on the record.
Well, what did he say?
Tell me, what did you say?
He called me a manipulative bitch.
- You get that?
- Please!
- May we go off the record?
- Certainly.
We will increase the settlement offer to $650 million.
Absolutely not.
Daddy's home, boys!
Welcome back, sir.
Damn good to be back, AC.
Feels good breathing in that dust again.
You know, Bartkowski.
- Sure I do.
Good to see you again.
- You, too, sir.
So how was your trip?
The road in was a little hairy, as usual.
Aside from that, I got nothing to complain about.
The guys are gonna be happy to see you.
It's good for morale.
Bartkowski, would you mind stepping out for a second?
Of course, sir.
How's Sanchez?
Not good, sir.
I want to talk to him.
I'm home!
How is everyone?
- Good.
- Wonderful.
We had a play date with the boy downstairs today.
They got along very well.
Well, that's good to hear.
Where did she get that?
We were out on a walk, and a nice man gave it to her.
She's crazy about it.
A nice man?
He had a kind face.
Said he had a daughter of his own.
I'm surprised you'd take a toy from a stranger.
I don't want it in the house.
Hey, hey.
Come on.
You, hey, come on.
Let's get up!
Let's get out of here!
Hey!
Come on, this is not your goddamn living room.
Jesus Christ, this fucking city!
Hey, schmuck, want me to call the cops again?
I'm talk...
Julius.
Yeah.
Okay, your problem's been solved.
What's wrong?
He's not coming.
I'm in the middle of the deposition.
What's going on?
- He's dead.
- Who?
Bill's contact.
I was supposed to meet him, and he never showed.
Bill found him.
The CIA guy.
He knows we're on to him.
- Hey!
We're on a schedule here.
- One minute.
This is un-fucking-believable.
Are you alone?
- No, I'm with Bill.
- Good.
Go back to the office and stay there until you hear from me, and call Huntley.
- Tell him to bring security.
- Okay.
I'm so sorry.
Patty, you're not getting this time back.
I don't need it.
I'd like to talk to your client again, off the record.
I believe your last offer was $650 million?
Yes.
I'll accept a billion.
Jesus, Patty, come on.
As long as you can get me what I need.
And what is it you need?
You say resolving this case is important to your government.
How important?
You know what I want to know.
You were there, you saw it.
This is your last chance.
Jesus Christ.
I brought some things from the States.
Some beer.
Peanuts.
I thought maybe you could use some things from home.
Everything that's happened to you,
I've had my reasons, and they were good reasons.
I hope someday you'll be able to see that.
Lowry, and the other men...
Franks.
- Rayburn.
- Yes.
They're gone, Chris.
They're not coming back.
I can't bring them back, you can't bring them back.
They went in there.
They knew it was dangerous.
No one forced them.
They needed the money.
We all did.
You see, that's why we worked for you, because you paid more than anyone else.
That's it.
My options with you, they're very limited, Chris.
Now, the question that you and I have to answer together is,
"What next?"
You have a chance to save yourself, but you need to summon your loyalty.
You need to soldier up and maintain your silence.
You need to take what happened on that last mission to your grave with you.
That's the code.
I need you to honour that code.
Fuck your code.
- Now, you listen to me, son.
- Or what?
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me?
Go ahead.
Give me a fucking gun.
Give me a fucking gun, I'll blow my fucking brains out right now for you.
Go on, do it.
You tortured me because I told the truth?
Whose truth?
Because the truth that I see is there's people out there trying to kill us and we had the balls to go get them!
It was illegal.
The law is not the fucking truth!
Now,
I'm giving you a chance to save yourself.
I was looking after you.
I tried to protect you, I defended you.
That's what you did?
You tried to help me?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
I told Boorman that you were a stand-up guy.
But what do you do?
You betray me!
You talk to lawyers.
You send Nasim Marwat to fuck me!
Everything that happened to you, you did to yourself.
Fuck you.
You fucked yourself!
Fuck you, you cocksucker!
Fuck you!
Go ahead and laugh.
Because it's the last fucking thing you will ever do.
This agreement requires your client's company to change their testing practices.
If they don't comply, I'm coming after them again.
Come on, Patty.
You won.
Relax.
You have something for me.
Yeah.
It's courtesy of the French Secret Services.
Leave a message.
I know I shouldn't call, but I need to see you.
My government is betraying you.
His name is Gerald Boorman.
And the French government gave you his file?
Yeah, they were very invested in the Tranzec case going away, so I made a deal.
You settled your case to help me with mine?
It was a very healthy settlement.
Is there any useful information in here?
I found something very interesting.
The French Secret Service stopped getting intelligence briefings from Boorman in early 2010.
And Chris's last mission was October.
I think it's time we made a call.
- Patty, it's Ellen.
- I'm glad you called.
Why is that?
I was just about to have a word with Mr Boorman.
Hello, Mr Boorman.
This is Patty Hewes.
There's no need to respond.
I know you're listening.
So please don't hang up.
I think we can be useful to each other.
I've learnt a lot about you.
Is that so?
Let's start with the fact that you used to run an illegal extraction programme called Operation Dust Devil.
With the help of High Star employees, your agency was able to provide the international community with intelligence about supposed terrorist activities in Afghanistan.
The problem is... the French government learnt that much of your intelligence was faulty,
and that some of the targets you tortured were innocent.
Well, hell, they're the French.
So, because of international pressure, the CIA stopped Operation Dust Devil, which was, what?
Beginning of 2010?
But three employees of High Star were killed in October, which means that you and Howard Erickson sent those men on a mission that was not sanctioned by the CIA.
What did you and Howard Erickson get out of that mission?
Who was the target?
Much as I'd love to chat about Dust Devil,
I'm afraid it's classified and I'm just not at liberty.
You helped Erickson cover up the deaths of three High Star employees, so I'm thinking you've got a lot to lose.
We don't want you.
We're not idiots.
We know we can't bring down the CIA.
Well, who do you want?
Howard Erickson.
Proof that those men died illegally, so we can hold High Star accountable, get restitution for their families.
Ms Hewes, you're wrestling with the wrong gator.
Give us Howard Erickson and we'll leave you alone.
I don't make deals.
Mainly 'cause I don't have to.
I know you had our contact killed.
And if anything happens to me or Ms Parsons,
I've arranged for everything we have on you to go public.
Have a nice day, Mr Boorman.
- How'd it go?
- As we suspected.
He didn't show his hand, and I could tell he was nervous.
- What do we do next?
- Wait for him to turn against Erickson.
I was wrong.
The lawsuit against High Star?
You asked me if it had anything to do with Dust Devil.
Does it?
Yes.
Erickson lied.
He went rogue on me.
After the Agency called off the operation, he pulled another mission anyway.
So what's it got to do with us?
He used the Dust Devil unit and three of them got killed.
Jesus.
Fuck.
High Star's got to take the fall for this.
It's time we cut ties with Howard Erickson.
Hello?
Jerry?
Hello?
Jerry?
- You talk to Sanchez?
- Yes, I did.
- And I offered him a lifeline.
- And?
The son of a bitch did not take it.
I'm sorry to hear that.
He forced my hand.
He's got to go.
Howard, you and I, we go way back.
If that's your decision, I'm behind you 100%.
Thank you, Jerry.
It's good to know I got you in the trenches with me.
Hello?
Jerry?
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago, meaning Terminator could be his own father, and then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him!
No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator five, that really happened.
Skeletor's real?
No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
Skeletor's a lady?
God dammit!
Who the fuck do they think they are?
This is the last fucking straw!
I am going to fucking kill everybody!
Hey, Eric!
I am so sick of this fucking schooooool!
This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone too far this time!
You get in trouble again, Cartman?
No!
I didn't do a damn thing.
Nothing!
I told you this school is a den of snakes!
You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
Dude, we're just trying to eat.
Oh, you think I'm just over reacting again, huh.
No, not this time!
The school has gone too far and it affects each and every one of you!
You remember the school physical we all took last week?
Yeah.
Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
No, they didn't.
Yeah, they fucking did, Kyle!
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
Because they don't fucking care!
I've told you this!
They don't give a shit about the students and they live to make us miserable!
That doesn't make any sense.
Go look for yourselves!
There, you see?
Can you fucking believe it?
Is that really all our wiener sizes?
Yeah, dude!
Look at it!
It says right there.
Eric Cartman 1.2 inches.
Why would they tell everybody that?
They wanna measure my wiener, fine, but don't put me on blast!
Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches.
Yeah, that's about right.
Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches.
Is that good?
How big do they say mine is?
I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
You're right, they really seem into it, mkay.
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches.
That doesn't seem right.
No shit, Sherlock!
My dick isn't 1.4 inches either.
It isn't.
This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
A conspiracy?
They're trying to stir up some big thing again!
Get all the girls all heated up and freaking out over with boy has the biggest shlong!
This has to be dealt with!
Well everyone's already seen it.
Nothing we can do about it now.
Oh, there's something we can do about it, all right.
If they're gonna put us on blast, they are at least getting the numbers right.
We are going to re-measure!
All right.
Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.
You see witnesses?
That's .2 inches more than what the school said.
All right.
Nice one, Clyde.
All right, next.
Whip it out, butters.
Ooh, it's a little chilly in here.
All right, butters, let's see what you got going on down there.
Hey, wait, the cold is makin' it shrink some.
Where you goin' little feller?
Butters, I don't have time for this.
I can't wait if your wiener is pullin' a scared turtle.
Hang on, he's comin' back out.
There he is!
Who's a little guy.
All right, butters.
Looks like we have 2 point -- wow -- 2.4 inches.
Really nice, butters.
I'm hung like a horse!
All right, that's everybody!
Let's go post these numbers!
What?
Didn't you forget something?
What, Kyle?
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
I measured mine this morning.
See?
It's right here at the top.
13.7 inches?
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Your wiener is not thirteen inches long!
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses.
You have to too.
Well, what are you guys gonna do, use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?
Are you homos?
You just did that to everybody in class!
Okay, fine, whatever.
Go ahead!
Yeah, that's good.
A little higher on Craig's side.
Yeah.
Actual boy's penis sizes?
Gross!
You see?
My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!
What red?
You all freakin' out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys?
I don't care!
Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement and for this poster to be put up at all?
Don't forget that this was all my idea!
Eric Cartman to the principal's office.
Immediately.
Oh God dammit!
Let me guess, I'm in trouble again!
You're darn right, Eric.
For what?
Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?
Why did you measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?
What?
I don't care if Obama is president!
You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world lengths of their dicks!
Wait.
Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physicals?
You're damn right!
1.2 inches!
I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches!
Maybe it's still the smallest in the school, but it's point two inches bigger that you said!
The numbers we put up were height differentials!
What?
We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year.
You grew 1.2 inches.
Those weren't our dick sizes?
Why would we publish the length of our students' private parts?
I don't know, why would you?
We didn't!
Aw, crap!
You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?
This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about Eric.
You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen.
This time, you've done it to yourself!
Oh God.
Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it.
Because you have an anger problem, Eric.
No, I don't!
What we need to figure out here, is are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism, some rage addiction.
It could be a lot of things.
My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.
Let's try a little experiment.
I want to see what kind of things trigger you, Eric, okay?
How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?
Honestly I wouldn't really care.
What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat?
I think you're a fat little boy.
I think you're way too fat for your age.
Does that make you feel any anger?
Huh, fatty?
Jelly belly?
You got jelly in your belly you little fat [Bleep].
You get a little flash of anger when someone tells you you got tits like a forty year old woman, fat boy?
You like that?
Shitty titty jelly belly?
Oh, yeah, he's a big boy!
Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass.
Big ol' jiggly fatty butt!
Huh.
Well, I just don't see it, Ms. Cartman.
Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all.
In fact, I'd say he's one of the more even tempered children I've ever seen.
Sorry, doctor.
Your wife's on the phone.
Says it's an emergency.
Excuse me.
Carol, what -- whoa, calm down, honey.
What do you mean?
Web chat with what-- what fourteen year old girl?
Carol, I would never!
No, I don't have a criminal record!
Who is Mitch Conner?
There can't be an official police report, honey, there's no -- no, Carol put down the gun!
Sweetie, put down the --
Carol?
Carol?
I'm not fat.
I'm big boned.
Thank you for coming parents, we've called you in because we have had a little 'incident' at the school.
The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
Oh dear.
Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling affect that can get blown out of proportion.
Did they measure from the base or from the balls?
How does the school let things like this happen?
Now, now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing.
We simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
I'm a scientist.
I think it's best I handle this.
Hello, students, my name is doctor marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday.
How do a man and woman make a baby?
Anybody.
A man and a woman, what do they do to make a baby?
How about the little girl in the brown coat.
Yeah, you.
They have sex.
Good!
The man puts his penis, okay, into the woman's vagina.
Okay, now sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is is actually important.
But is it?
When you boys measured your penis length the truth is it doesn't really matter.
What does matter is -- length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared.
Okay?
When we are talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure.
We need a scale, and a protractor as well.
Let's look at it on the graph here.
Follow along with me on your study sheet, kids.
I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.
We didn't make any effort.
We didn't have a choice!
Yeah, this is bullshit!
Together, we are going to learn what makes us angry, okay, and how to better deal with it so we don't get our ourselves into trouble a anymore.
So lame.
Why doesn't everyone just die.
Look!
If a somebody order the city beef, and a complain because they say they ordered the city s shrimp it's not a my fault he gets a city chicken poured all over his head!
We have good reason to be angry!
This country is going to shit!
We have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!
Right.
See, what we all need to do is channel our various reasons for anger and learn to control it.
Man, this shit is whack, mah.
I just seen all this shit front in, mah.
Don't understand what it's like my pops.
Ain't no mother good, mah, bitch be coming.
I be tappin that shit, mah.
Why am I here?
Well, Eric, because I know you want to control your anger and become a better person.
You saying I got problems like these people?
No!
No, I'm not saying that at all.
Please, I'm just saying how amazing you are for wanting to lessen some of your more less awesome attributes.
Oh, that's cool.
And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the -- what do we call it again?
The yaw, the yaw of the shaft, what we finally get is the adjusted penis size or t.M.I.
Any questions so far?
Yes, little girl over there.
What's a penis?
Ah, good question.
Uh, the penis, is the thing we are talking about that boys' have that we're measuring.
Okay.
Any other questions?
Okay.
So then let's move on to the example on your study sheet.
How about you, could you read the first example for the class?
Example one, young lady, please read the problem out loud.
Example one: 'Randy' has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.
4.4 inches.
Its angle is 32 degrees.
Its flaccid girth is 1 inch in diameter.
His balls are 7 centimeters from the base.
Seven centimeters.
Randy notes that the drift of his penis is 4 centimeters to penis right and its dead weight is .5 kilograms.
Great.
And so, divide by the 17, carry the one and we can see that 'Randy's' adjusted penis size, or TMI, is 6.3 inches.
Do we got that?
Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3.
So how does our example person 'Randy' compare to others on the TMI scale?
By referring again to the TMI chart, we see that a TMI of 6.3 is.
8 inches more than the national average.
Okay.
What we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger.
Daniel, could you stand up, please.
What makes you the angriest, Daniel?
Stupid ass blind liberals!
Okay, great.
Chase, could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid ass blind liberal.
And what makes you angriest, chase?
Skrawny ass sissies!
Okay, Daniel is a skrawny ass sissy.
He just cut in front of you in line at the bank.
Go!
Hey!
What, you think, I got a small dick?
Huh?
I don't have a small penis!
My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!
Okay.
Uh, why don't we do some role playing now with Wayne d who gets angriest at his mom.
Gretchen, could you play Wayne d's mom for us.
You bitch!
You think you bad just cuz you a mom don't mean I won't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mah!
I may be female on the outside but I still have a bigger penis than you!
Don't say that!
It isn't true!
It isn't true!
That's enough!
I'm sick of everyone talking about a penis size!
Yeah, it doesn't matter!
It doesn't matter!
Does everyone here have an issue with their penis size?
No.
Nope.
Not me.
Nah mah, my shit be packin', mah.
My penis is thirteen inches long!
Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnoud and I'm an actual doctor of human sexuality and behavior.
Unfortunately, you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days and I am here to set things straight.
Thank God.
I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width.
Vous êtes un menteur!
We all want to welcome our new member, Randy.
Say hi to everyone, Randy.
Oh suck it, all of you!
Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy.
Why don't you share what's bothering you.
You don't just go around changing math.
Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?
God damn right!
Socialist fascists!
Power to the people!
Burn it down!
Burn it down!
Mr. marsh, this is what we are here to try and work on, okay.
No dude, we're burnin' this shit!
If you take a minute to think about your anger -- yeah, dude!
Mah, that shit be burnin n shit mah!
Welcome to fed ex, how can I help you today?
Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.
Alright, let's see what kind of -- burn it down!
Burn it down, dude!
Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their federal express!
Tom, I'm standing outside the fedex in fairplay, Colorado where a radical political group has taken several people hostage.
They call themselves 'the pissed off and angry party' and they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
This is a call to all angry people!
We've had enough!
We're gonna hit the government where it hurts!
Right in the federal express!
What exactly are you angry about?
We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media control, and -- and Jews!
Yeah, and Jews and all the stuff that the government's doing!
You've got a lot of people scared.
What are your demands?
Well, first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
And we want -- and we wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
Yeah.
We wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
And, uhmm -- and my mom gotta stop trippin mah.
Bitch be trippin' all the time, mah!
Yeah, we want our mom's to stop trippin, man, cuz them bitches be trippin all the time!
And I think that -- is that it?
No, and Kyle!
Oh, yeah and Kyle!
Surgeon general's resignation,
Obama's real birth certificate, mom's to stop trippin and Kyle.
You got that?
Or else we're gonna bring the federal express to a grinding halt!
Does it bother you that the federal express is not affiliated at all with the federal government?
No!
No, that doesn't matter.
Really?
Butters, what are you doing?
Homework!
I just don't get it!
That is the fourth time I've calculated!
And it's below average!
I thought I was hung, but according to my TMI I have a micropenis!
Your TMI?
I don't understand it.
I'm startin' -
- I'm startin to feel angry!
Butters, put your clothes on!
Oh, what's the point, mom?
What's the point of life anyways?
All you do is yell at me!
And the government!
It's lead by fascists!
And everyone's a Justin Bieber wanna be!
I wanna go and drive a hummer.
That's what I wanna do!
I wanna drive a car that goes vram vram vram!
Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small?
Hey!
Everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America!
Join the fight!
We're gonna take down the federal expresses!
The American apparels!
And the American furniture warehouse!
We are fed up and we've had enough!
Surgeon general, twelve more fedexs have been taken over, the pissed off and angry party is gaining more support.
They've shut down American airlines and American apparels all over the country.
We have to ask you to step down.
Are you seriously saying we're going to give into their demands?
They are all really angry.
We have to make them stop.
Is the team standing by to that little boy 'Kyle'?
Team is standing by, sir.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Let me through!
Who is this?
Surgeon general, I believe I know why this is happening.
I have found a direct correlation between anger and TMI.
Anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw.
Look, we all get angry, but when someone is consistently angry, or always finding new reasons to be angry it means they have a very, very, very, very small dick.
Your theory is fine, doctor, but it doesn't matter.
The TMI equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Isn't there?
Isn't there?
We've waited long enough, Randy!
Let's start killing these sons a bitches!
No, please!
Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want.
Yo, let's cap these bitches, mah.
Let's cap 'em 'n leave 'em in the back a the buildin', mah.
Hey, come over here!
Look!
We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general.
Fellow Americans, as you all know the TMI scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk.
The established equation is 100 percent accurate.
However, due to recently collected data we are making one change.
The national average for penis length is now officially moved, from six inches to 1.6 inches.
Anyone with a TMI of over 1.5 inches is considered 'above average.'
the winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it?
It's electric and magical the happy train's on track because America is back.
Come on!
Wait, what?
America is back!
America is back!
Wait, according to that scale,
I still have a small wiener.
America is back!
I'm still fucking angry!
And we're back!
and then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him!
That's not the trailer for Terminator 5.
That really happened.
Skeletor's real?
That's not Skeletor.
That's Terminator's wife.
Skeletor's a lady?
God dammit!
Who the fuck do they think they are?
This is the last fucking straw!
I am going to fucking kill everybody!
I am so sick of this fucking school!
This stupid school and principal have gone too far this time!
273)}– You get in trouble again?
– I didn't do a damn thing!
I told you.
This school is a den of snakes!
You won't believe what they did this time.
We're trying to eat.
You think I'm overreacting again?
Not this time!
and it affects everyone of you.
You remember the school physical we all took last week?
The school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
they fucking did!
Why would they put up the sizes of our wieners?
Because they don't fucking care!
I've told you this.
They don't give a shit about us.
They live to make us miserable.
273)}– That doesn't make any sense.
– Go look for yourselves!
you see?
Can you fucking believe it?
273)}– Is that really all our wiener sizes?
– Yeah!
Look at it!
Eric Cartman 1.2″.
Why would they tell everybody?
but don't put me on blast!
2.4″.
That's about right.
2.2″.
Is that good?
How big do they say mine is?
I told you they would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
You're right.
They really seem into it.
It says mine's only 2.1″.
That doesn't seem right.
Sherlock!
My dick isn't 1.4″ either.
It isn't!
This is another conspiracy by the school faculty.
A conspiracy?
They're trying to stir up some big thing again.
Get all the girls all heated up over which boy has the biggest shlong!
This has to be dealt with!
Everyone's already seen it.
Nothing we can do about it.
There's something we can do about it.
they're at least getting it right.
We are going to remeasure!
2.3″.
witnesses?
That's .2″ more than what they said.
273)}– All right!
– Nice one.
next.
Whip it out.
It's a little chilly in here.
Let's see what you got going on down there.
Wait.
The cold is making it shrink some.
little feller?
– I don't have time for this.
I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a scared turtle.
He's coming back out.
There he is!
Who's a little guy?
All right.
Looks like we have... 2.4″.
273)}– Really nice.
– I'm hung like a horse!
That's everybody.
Let's go post these numbers.
273)}– What?
– Didn't you forget something?
What?
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
I measured mine this morning.
It's right here at the top.
13.7″?
It's pretty good.
Your wiener is not 13″ long!
We all got measured with witnesses.
You have to too.
What are you guys gonna do?
Measure my penis yourselves?
273)}– Are you homos?
– You just did that to everybody!
whatever!
Go ahead!
That's good.
A little higher on Craig's side.
273)}– "Actual boys' penis sizes"?
– Gross!
it's 1.4!
What?
My wiener's smaller than the others'?
I don't care!
I'm very happy with my wiener.
why would I have called for this poster to be put up at all?
Don't forget that this was all my idea!
Eric Cartman to the principal's office immediately.
God dammit!
Let me guess.
I'm in trouble again.
273)}– You're darn right.
– For what?
Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?
Why did you do it and put the results on the school bulletin board?
273)}– What?
– I don't care if Obama is president. telling the world the lengths of their dicks!
Are you talking about the numbers we published from the physicals?
You're damn right!
1.2″!
I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4″!
but it's .2″ bigger that you said!
The numbers we put up were height differentials.
We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year.
You grew 1.2″.
Those weren't our dick sizes?
Why would we publish the length of our students' private parts?
273)}– I don't know.
Why would you?
– We didn't!
Crap!
Everyone knows my wiener is smaller because of me?
This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about. and you cause bad things to happen.
you've done it to yourself!
God!
Why couldn't I have taken a minute to think?
Because you have an anger problem.
I don't! some rage addiction...
It could be a lot of things.
but he's not all bad.
Let's try an experiment.
I wanna see what kind of things trigger you.
How do you think you would react if I said negative things about you?
I wouldn't really care.
What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat?
I think you're a fat little boy.
I think you're way too fat for your age.
Does that make you feel any anger?
fatty?
Jelly belly?
you little fat fuck.
You get angry when someone tells you you got tits like a 40-year-old woman?
Fat boy?
You like that?
Shitty titty jelly belly?
He's a big boy!
Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass!
Big ol' jiggly fatty butt!
I just don't see it.
Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all.
He's one of the more even tempered children I've ever seen.
says it's an emergency.
Excuse me.
what...
Calm down.
What do you mean?
Web chat with what...
I would never...
I don't have a criminal record...
Who is Mitch Connor?
There can't be a police report.
There's no...
Put down the gun!
Sweetie...
Put down the...
I'm not fat.
I'm big-boned.
Thank you for coming.
because we've had a little incident at the school.
The 4th-grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
dear.
This issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.
Did they measure from the base or from the balls?
How did this school let this happen?
boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing.
We simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
I'm a scientist.
I think it's best I handle this.
students.
My name is Dr. Marsh.
I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened yesterday.
How do a man and woman make a baby?
Anybody?
what do they do to make a baby?
you.
273)}– They have sex.
– Good!
The man puts his penis... into the woman's vagina.
a man... can feel like how long his penis is is actually important.
But is it? the truth is it doesn't really matter.
What does matter is... divided by angle of the tip squared.
we can't just use a tape measure.
We need a scale and a protractor as well.
Let's look at it on the graph.
Follow along with me on your study sheet.
I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.
We didn't make any effort.
We didn't have a choice!
This is bullshit! and how to better deal with it so we don't get into trouble anymore.
So lame.
Why doesn't everyone just die? it's not a my fault he gets a city chicken poured all over his fucking head!
We have good reason to be angry.
This country is going to shit! and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!
Right.
What we all need to do is channel our reasons for anger and learn to control it.
mah.
mah.
mah.
Why the fuck am I here?
I know you want to control your anger and become a better person.
I got problems like these fucking people?
I'm not saying that at all.
I'm saying how amazing you are for wanting to... lessen some of your more... less awesome attributes.
That's cool.
by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the...
What do we call it again? what we finally get is the adjusted penis size or TMI.
little girl over there.
What's a penis?
Good question.
The penis is... the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're measuring.
Any other questions?
So let's move on to the example on your study sheet.
could you read it for the class?
please read the problem out loud.
Example one:
Randy has a penis that is 4.4″ in length.
4.4″.
Its angle is 32°.
Its flaccid girth is 1″ in diameter.
His balls are 7 cm from the base.
7 cm.
Randy notes that the drift of his penis and its dead weight is .5 kg.
carry the one and we can see that...
Randy's adjusted penis size or TMI is... 6.3″.
Do we got that? but his adjusted length is 6.3.
So how does our example person Randy compare to others on the TMI scale? we see that a TMI of 6.3 is .8″ more than the national average.
What we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger.
could you stand up?
What makes you the angriest?
Stupid ass blind liberals!
could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid ass blind liberal?
And what makes you angriest?
Scrawny ass sissies!
Daniel's a scrawny ass sissy.
He just cut in front of you in line at the bank.
Go!
What?
You think I got a small dick?
I don't have a small penis!
My wife thinks it's perfectly fine!
Why don't we do some role playing with Wayne D?
Who gets angriest at his mom.
could you play Wayne D's mom?
Yo bitch!
You think you bad just cuz you a mom mah! but I still have a bigger penis than you!
I don't have a small penis.
It isn't true!
Enough!
I'm sick of everyone talking about penis size!
It doesn't matter!
Does everyone here have an issue with their penis size?
mah.
My penis is 13″ long!
My name is Rebecca Turnoud.
I'm an actual doctor of human sexuality and behavior. and I'm here to set things straight.
God!
I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually... divided by mass over width...
Randy.
Say hi to everyone.
all of you!
We've been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways.
Why don't you share what's bothering you?
You don't just go around changing math!
Who is this chick Surgeon General appointed by Obama?
God damn right!
Socialist fascists!
Power to the people!
Burn it down!
Burn it down!
This is what we are here to try and work on.
Fuck you!
We're burning this shit!
If you take a minute to think about your anger... dude!
mah!
Welcome to FedEx.
How can I help you today?
I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.
let's see what kind of... dude!
Let's see how the government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! where a radical political group has taken several people hostage. and they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
This is a call to all angry people.
We've had enough!
We'll hit the government where it hurts.
Right in the Federal Express!
What exactly are you angry about?
We're angry about this stupid liberal government media control and...
And Jews!
Jews and all the stuff that the government's doing!
You've got a lot of people scared.
What are your demands?
we want that Surgeon General to step down!
273)}– And we want...
– Obama's real birth certificate!
We wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
And... mah! 'cause them bitches be tripping all the time!
And I think that... 273)}– Is that it?
– And fuck Kyle!
And fuck Kyle! moms to stop tripping and fuck Kyle.
You got that?
we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!
Does it bother you that the FedEx is not affiliated at all with the federal government?
That doesn't matter.
really?
What are you doing?
Homework.
I just don't get it.
and it's below average.
but my TMI says I have a micropenis.
273)}– Your TMI?
– I don't understand it.
I'm starting to feel angry!
Put your clothes on!
What's the point?
What's the point of life anyways?
All you do is yell at me!
And the government!
It's lead by fascists!
And everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe!
I wanna go and drive a hummer.
That's what I wanna do!
I wanna drive a car that goes vram vram vram!

If you take a minute to think about your anger... dude!
mah!
Welcome to FedEx.
How can I help you today?
I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.
let's see what kind of... dude!
Let's see how the government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! where a radical political group has taken several people hostage. and they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
This is a call to all angry people.
We've had enough!
We'll hit the government where it hurts.
Right in the Federal Express!
What exactly are you angry about?
We're angry about this stupid liberal government media control and...
And Jews!
Jews and all the stuff that the government's doing!
You've got a lot of people scared.
What are your demands?
we want that Surgeon General to step down!
273)}– And we want...
– Obama's real birth certificate!
We wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
And... mah! 'cause them bitches be tripping all the time!
And I think that... 273)}– Is that it?
– And fuck Kyle!
And fuck Kyle! moms to stop tripping and fuck Kyle.
You got that?
we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!
Does it bother you that the FedEx is not affiliated at all with the federal government?
That doesn't matter.
really?
What are you doing?
Homework.
I just don't get it.
and it's below average.
but my TMI says I have a micropenis.
273)}– Your TMI?
– I don't understand it.
I'm starting to feel angry!
Put your clothes on!
What's the point?
What's the point of life anyways?
All you do is yell at me!
And the government!
It's lead by fascists!
And everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe!
I wanna go and drive a hummer.
That's what I wanna do!
I wanna drive a car that goes vram vram vram!
What does driving a car have to do with your penis being small?
Everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America.
Join the fight! the American Apparels and the American Furniture Warehouse!
and we've had enough!
twelve more FedExes have been taken over.
The pissed off and angry party's gaining support.
They've shut down American Airlines and American Apparels all over the country.
We have to ask you to step down.
Are you seriously saying we're going to give in?
They're all really angry.
We have to make them stop.
Is the team standing by to fuck that little boy Kyle?
Team standing by.
273)}– Let me through!
– Who is this?
I believe I know why this is happening.
I have found a direct correlation between anger and TMI. plus yaw. very small dick.
but it doesn't matter.
which cannot be changed.
There's nothing we can do.
Isn't there?
Isn't... there?
We've waited long enough.
Let's kill these sons of bitches!
They aren't gonna give us what we want.
Let's cap these bitches 'n' leave 'em in the back of the buildin'.
Come over here.
We're interrupting for a message from the Surgeon General.
the TMI scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk.
The established equation is a hundred percent accurate. we are making one change. from 6″ to 1.5″.
Anyone with a TMI of over 1.5″ is considered above average.
The winds of change are blowin'
There's excitement in the air
Can you feel it?
It's electric and magical
The happy train's on track
Because America is back!
what?
America is back!
I still have a small wiener.
I'm still fucking angry!
And we're back!
"T.M.I."
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago, meaning Terminator could be his own father, and then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him!
No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator five, that really happened.
Skeletor's real?
No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
Skeletor's a lady?
God dammit!
Who the fuck do they think they are?
This is the last fucking straw!
I am going to fucking kill everybody!
Hey, Eric!
I am so sick of this fucking schooooool!
This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone too far this time!
You get in trouble again, Cartman?
No!
I didn't do a damn thing.
Nothing!
I told you this school is a den of snakes!
You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
Dude, we're just trying to eat.
Oh, you think I'm just over reacting again, huh.
No, not this time!
The school has gone too far and it affects each and every one of you!
You remember the school physical we all took last week?
Yeah.
Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
No, they didn't.
Yeah, they fucking did, Kyle!
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
Because they don't fucking care!
I've told you this!
They don't give a shit about the students and they live to make us miserable!
That doesn't make any sense.
Go look for yourselves!
There, you see?
Can you fucking believe it?
Is that really all our wiener sizes?
Yeah, dude!
Look at it!
It says right there.
Eric Cartman 1.2 inches.
but don't put me on blast!
Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches.
Yeah, that's about right.
Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches.
Is that good?
How big do they say mine is?
I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
You're right, they really seem into it, mkay.
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches.
That doesn't seem right.
No shit, Sherlock!
My dick isn't 1.4 inches either.
It isn't.
This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
A conspiracy?
They're trying to stir up some big thing again!
Get all the girls all heated up and freaking out over with boy has the biggest shlong!
This has to be dealt with!
Well everyone's already seen it.
Nothing we can do about it now.
Oh, there's something we can do about it, all right.
If they're gonna put us on blast, they are at least getting the numbers right.
We are going to re-measure!
All right.
Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.
You see witnesses?
That's.2 inches more than what the school said.
All right.
Nice one, Clyde.
All right, next.
Whip it out, butters.
Ooh, it's a little chilly in here.
All right, butters, let's see what you got going on down there.
Hey, wait, the cold is makin' it shrink some.
Where you goin' little feller?
Butters, I don't have time for this.
I can't wait if your wiener is pullin' a scared turtle.
Hang on, he's comin' back out.
There he is!
Who's a little guy.
All right, butters.
Looks like we have 2 point -- wow -- 2.4 inches.
Really nice, butters.
I'm hung like a horse!
All right, that's everybody!
Let's go post these numbers!
What?
Didn't you forget something?
What, Kyle?
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
I measured mine this morning.
See?
It's right here at the top.
13.7 inches?
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Your wiener is not thirteen inches long!
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses.
You have to too.
Well, what are you guys gonna do, use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?
Are you homos?
You just did that to everybody in class!
Okay, fine, whatever.
Go ahead!
Yeah, that's good.
A little higher on Craig's side.
Yeah.
Actual boy's penis sizes?
Gross!
You see?
My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!
What red?
You all freakin' out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys?
I don't care!
Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement and for this poster to be put up at all?
Don't forget that this was all my idea!
Eric Cartman to the principal's office.
Immediately.
Oh God dammit!
Let me guess, I'm in trouble again!
You're darn right, Eric.
For what?
Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?
Why did you measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?
What?
I don't care if Obama is president!
You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world lengths of their dicks!
Wait.
Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physicals?
You're damn right!
1.2 inches!
I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches!
Maybe it's still the smallest in the school, but it's point two inches bigger that you said!
The numbers we put up were height differentials!
What?
We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year.
You grew 1.2 inches.
Those weren't our dick sizes?
Why would we publish the length of our students' private parts?
I don't know, why would you?
We didn't!
Aw, crap!
You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?
This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about Eric.
You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen.
This time, you've done it to yourself!
Oh God.
Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it.
Because you have an anger problem, Eric.
No, I don't!
What we need to figure out here, is are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism, some rage addiction.
It could be a lot of things.
My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.
Let's try a little experiment.
I want to see what kind of things trigger you, Eric, okay?
How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?
Honestly I wouldn't really care.
What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat?
I think you're a fat little boy.
I think you're way too fat for your age.
Does that make you feel any anger?
Huh, fatty?
Jelly belly?
You got jelly in your belly you little fat [Bleep].
You get a little flash of anger when someone tells you you got tits like a forty year old woman, fat boy?
You like that?
Shitty titty jelly belly?
Oh, yeah, he's a big boy!
Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass.
Big ol' jiggly fatty butt!
Huh.
Well, I just don't see it, Ms. Cartman.
Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all.
In fact, I'd say he's one of the more even tempered children I've ever seen.
Sorry, doctor.
Your wife's on the phone.
Says it's an emergency.
Excuse me.
Carol, what -- whoa, calm down, honey.
What do you mean?
Web chat with what-- what fourteen year old girl?
Carol, I would never!
No, I don't have a criminal record!
Who is Mitch Conner?
There can't be an official police report, honey, there's no -- no, Carol put down the gun!
Sweetie, put down the --
Carol?
Carol?
I'm not fat.
I'm big boned.
Thank you for coming parents, we've called you in because we have had a little 'incident' at the school.
The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
Oh dear.
Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling affect that can get blown out of proportion.
Did they measure from the base or from the balls?
How does the school let things like this happen?
Now, now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing.
We simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
I'm a scientist.
I think it's best I handle this.
Hello, students, my name is doctor marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday.
How do a man and woman make a baby?
Anybody.
A man and a woman, what do they do to make a baby?
How about the little girl in the brown coat.
Yeah, you.
They have sex.
Good!
The man puts his penis, okay, into the woman's vagina.
Okay, now sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is is actually important.
But is it?
When you boys measured your penis length the truth is it doesn't really matter.
What does matter is -- length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared.
Okay?
When we are talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure.
We need a scale, and a protractor as well.
Let's look at it on the graph here.
Follow along with me on your study sheet, kids.
I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.
We didn't make any effort.
We didn't have a choice!
Yeah, this is bullshit!
Together, we are going to learn what makes us angry, okay, and how to better deal with it so we don't get our ourselves into trouble a anymore.
So lame.
Why doesn't everyone just die.
Look!
If a somebody order the city beef, and a complain because they say they ordered the city s shrimp it's not a my fault he gets a city chicken poured all over his head!
We have good reason to be angry!
This country is going to shit!
We have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!
Right.
See, what we all need to do is channel our various reasons for anger and learn to control it.
Man, this shit is whack, mah.
I just seen all this shit front in, mah.
Don't understand what it's like my pops.
Ain't no mother good, mah, bitch be coming.
I be tappin that shit, mah.
Why am I here?
Well, Eric, because I know you want to control your anger and become a better person.
You saying I got problems like these people?
No!
No, I'm not saying that at all.
Please, I'm just saying how amazing you are for wanting to lessen some of your more less awesome attributes.
Oh, that's cool.
And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the -- what do we call it again?
The yaw, the yaw of the shaft, what we finally get is the adjusted penis size or t.M.I.
Any questions so far?
Yes, little girl over there.
What's a penis?
Ah, good question.
Uh, the penis, is the thing we are talking about that boys' have that we're measuring.
Okay.
Any other questions?
Okay.
So then let's move on to the example on your study sheet.
How about you, could you read the first example for the class?
Example one, young lady, please read the problem out loud.
Example one: 'Randy' has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.
4.4 inches.
Its angle is 32 degrees.
Its flaccid girth is 1 inch in diameter.
His balls are 7 centimeters from the base.
Seven centimeters.
Randy notes that the drift of his penis is 4 centimeters to penis right and its dead weight is.5 kilograms.
Great.
And so, divide by the 17, carry the one and we can see that 'Randy's' adjusted penis size, or TMI, is 6.3 inches.
Do we got that?
Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3.
So how does our example person 'Randy' compare to others on the TMI scale?
By referring again to the TMI chart, we see that a TMI of 6.3 is.
8 inches more than the national average.
Okay.
What we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger.
Daniel, could you stand up, please.
What makes you the angriest, Daniel?
Stupid ass blind liberals!
Okay, great.
Chase, could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid ass blind liberal.
And what makes you angriest, chase?
Skrawny ass sissies!
Okay, Daniel is a skrawny ass sissy.
He just cut in front of you in line at the bank.
Go!
Hey!
What, you think, I got a small dick?
Huh?
I don't have a small penis!
My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!
Okay.
Uh, why don't we do some role playing now with Wayne d who gets angriest at his mom.
Gretchen, could you play Wayne d's mom for us.
You bitch!
You think you bad just cuz you a mom don't mean I won't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mah!
I may be female on the outside but I still have a bigger penis than you!
Don't say that!
It isn't true!
It isn't true!
That's enough!
I'm sick of everyone talking about a penis size!
Yeah, it doesn't matter!
It doesn't matter!
Does everyone here have an issue with their penis size?
No.
Nope.
Not me.
Nah mah, my shit be packin', mah.
My penis is thirteen inches long!
Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnoud and I'm an actual doctor of human sexuality and behavior.
Unfortunately, you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days and I am here to set things straight.
Thank God.
I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width.
Vous êtes un menteur!
We all want to welcome our new member, Randy.
Say hi to everyone, Randy.
Oh suck it, all of you!
Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy.
Why don't you share what's bothering you.
You don't just go around changing math.
Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?
God damn right!
Socialist fascists!
Power to the people!
Burn it down!
Burn it down!
Mr. Marsh, this is what we are here to try and work on, okay.
No dude, we're burnin' this shit!
If you take a minute to think about your anger -- yeah, dude!
Mah, that shit be burnin n shit mah!
Welcome to FedEx, how can I help you today?
Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.
Alright, let's see what kind of -- burn it down!
Burn it down, dude!
Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their federal express!
Tom, I'm standing outside the FedEx in Fairplay, Colorado where a radical political group has taken several people hostage.
They call themselves 'the pissed off and angry party' and they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
This is a call to all angry people!
We've had enough!
We're gonna hit the government where it hurts!
Right in the federal express!
What exactly are you angry about?
We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media control, and -- and Jews!
Yeah, and Jews and all the stuff that the government's doing!
You've got a lot of people scared.
What are your demands?
Well, first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
And we want -- and we wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
Yeah.
We wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
And, uhmm -- and my mom gotta stop trippin mah.
Bitch be trippin' all the time, mah!
Yeah, we want our mom's to stop trippin, man, cuz them bitches be trippin all the time!
And I think that -- is that it?
No, and Kyle!
Oh, yeah and Kyle!
Surgeon general's resignation,
Obama's real birth certificate, mom's to stop trippin and Kyle.
You got that?
Or else we're gonna bring the federal express to a grinding halt!
Does it bother you that the federal express is not affiliated at all with the federal government?
No!
No, that doesn't matter.
Really?
Butters, what are you doing?
Homework!
I just don't get it!
That is the fourth time I've calculated!
And it's below average!
I thought I was hung, but according to my TMI I have a micropenis!
Your TMI?
I don't understand it.
I'm startin' -
- I'm startin to feel angry!
Butters, put your clothes on!
Oh, what's the point, mom?
What's the point of life anyways?
All you do is yell at me!
And the government!
It's lead by fascists!
And everyone's a Justin Bieber wanna be!
I wanna go and drive a hummer.
That's what I wanna do!
I wanna drive a car that goes vram vram vram!
Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small?
Hey!
Everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America!
Join the fight!
We're gonna take down the federal expresses!
The American apparels!
And the American furniture warehouse!
We are fed up and we've had enough!
Surgeon general, twelve more FedExs have been taken over, the pissed off and angry party is gaining more support.
They've shut down American airlines and American apparels all over the country.
We have to ask you to step down.
Are you seriously saying we're going to give into their demands?
They are all really angry.
We have to make them stop.
Is the team standing by to that little boy 'Kyle'?
Team is standing by, sir.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Let me through!
Who is this?
Surgeon general, I believe I know why this is happening.
I have found a direct correlation between anger and TMI.
Anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw.
Look, we all get angry, but when someone is consistently angry, or always finding new reasons to be angry it means they have a very, very, very, very small dick.
Your theory is fine, doctor, but it doesn't matter.
The TMI equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Isn't there?
Isn't there?
We've waited long enough, Randy!
Let's start killing these sons a bitches!
No, please!
Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want.
Yo, let's cap these bitches, mah.
Let's cap 'em 'n leave 'em in the back a the buildin', mah.
Hey, come over here!
Look!
We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general.
Fellow Americans, as you all know the TMI scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk.
The established equation is 100 percent accurate.
However, due to recently collected data we are making one change.
The national average for penis length is now officially moved, from six inches to 1.5 inches.
Anyone with a TMI of over 1.5 inches is considered 'above average.'
The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it?
It's electric and magical the happy train's on track because America is back.
Come on!
Wait, what?
America is back!
America is back!
Wait, according to that scale,
I still have a small wiener.
America is back!
I'm still fucking angry!
And we're back!
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago, meaning Terminator could be his own father, and then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him!
No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator five, that really happened.

What we need to figure out here, is are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism, some rage addiction.
It could be a lot of things.
My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.
Let's try a little experiment.
I want to see what kind of things trigger you, Eric, okay?
How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?
Honestly I wouldn't really care.
What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat?
I think you're a fat little boy.
I think you're way too fat for your age.
Does that make you feel any anger?
Huh, fatty?
Jelly belly?
You got jelly in your belly you little fat [Bleep].
You get a little flash of anger when someone tells you you got tits like a forty year old woman, fat boy?
You like that?
Shitty titty jelly belly?
Oh, yeah, he's a big boy!
Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass.
Big ol' jiggly fatty butt!
Huh.
Well, I just don't see it, Ms. Cartman.
Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all.
In fact, I'd say he's one of the more even tempered children I've ever seen.
Sorry, doctor.
Your wife's on the phone.
Says it's an emergency.
Excuse me.
Carol, what -- whoa, calm down, honey.
What do you mean?
Web chat with what-- what fourteen year old girl?
Carol, I would never!
No, I don't have a criminal record!
Who is Mitch Conner?
There can't be an official police report, honey, there's no -- no, Carol put down the gun!
Sweetie, put down the --
Carol?
Carol?
I'm not fat.
I'm big boned.
Thank you for coming parents, we've called you in because we have had a little 'incident' at the school.
The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
Oh dear.
Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling affect that can get blown out of proportion.
Did they measure from the base or from the balls?
How does the school let things like this happen?
Now, now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing.
We simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
I'm a scientist.
I think it's best I handle this.
Hello, students, my name is doctor marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday.
How do a man and woman make a baby?
Anybody.
A man and a woman, what do they do to make a baby?
How about the little girl in the brown coat.
Yeah, you.
They have sex.
Good!
The man puts his penis, okay, into the woman's vagina.
Okay, now sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is is actually important.
But is it?
When you boys measured your penis length the truth is it doesn't really matter.
What does matter is -- length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared.
Okay?
When we are talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure.
We need a scale, and a protractor as well.
Let's look at it on the graph here.
Follow along with me on your study sheet, kids.
I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.
We didn't make any effort.
We didn't have a choice!
Yeah, this is bullshit!
Together, we are going to learn what makes us angry, okay, and how to better deal with it so we don't get our ourselves into trouble a anymore.
So lame.
Why doesn't everyone just die.
Look!
If a somebody order the city beef, and a complain because they say they ordered the city s shrimp it's not a my fault he gets a city chicken poured all over his head!
We have good reason to be angry!
This country is going to shit!
We have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!
Right.
See, what we all need to do is channel our various reasons for anger and learn to control it.
Man, this shit is whack, mah.
I just seen all this shit front in, mah.
Don't understand what it's like my pops.
Ain't no mother good, mah, bitch be coming.
I be tappin that shit, mah.
Why am I here?
Well, Eric, because I know you want to control your anger and become a better person.
You saying I got problems like these people?
No!
No, I'm not saying that at all.
Please, I'm just saying how amazing you are for wanting to lessen some of your more less awesome attributes.
Oh, that's cool.
And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the -- what do we call it again?
The yaw, the yaw of the shaft, what we finally get is the adjusted penis size or t.M.I.
Any questions so far?
Yes, little girl over there.
What's a penis?
Ah, good question.
Uh, the penis, is the thing we are talking about that boys' have that we're measuring.
Okay.
Any other questions?
Okay.
So then let's move on to the example on your study sheet.
How about you, could you read the first example for the class?
Example one, young lady, please read the problem out loud.
Example one: 'Randy' has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.
4.4 inches.
Its angle is 32 degrees.
Its flaccid girth is 1 inch in diameter.
His balls are 7 centimeters from the base.
Seven centimeters.
Randy notes that the drift of his penis is 4 centimeters to penis right and its dead weight is .5 kilograms.
Great.
And so, divide by the 17, carry the one and we can see that 'Randy's' adjusted penis size, or TMI, is 6.3 inches.
Do we got that?
Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3.
So how does our example person 'Randy' compare to others on the TMI scale?
By referring again to the TMI chart, we see that a TMI of 6.3 is.
8 inches more than the national average.
Okay.
What we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger.
Daniel, could you stand up, please.
What makes you the angriest, Daniel?
Stupid ass blind liberals!
Okay, great.
Chase, could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid ass blind liberal.
And what makes you angriest, chase?
Skrawny ass sissies!
Okay, Daniel is a skrawny ass sissy.
He just cut in front of you in line at the bank.
Go!
Hey!
What, you think, I got a small dick?
Huh?
I don't have a small penis!
My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!
Okay.
Uh, why don't we do some role playing now with Wayne d who gets angriest at his mom.
Gretchen, could you play Wayne d's mom for us.
You bitch!
You think you bad just cuz you a mom don't mean I won't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mah!
I may be female on the outside but I still have a bigger penis than you!
I don't have a small penis.
Don't say that!
It isn't true!
It isn't true!
That's enough!
I'm sick of everyone talking about a penis size!
Yeah, it doesn't matter!
It doesn't matter!
Does everyone here have an issue with their penis size?
No.
Nope.
Not me.
Nah mah, my shit be packin', mah.
My penis is thirteen inches long!
Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnoud and I'm an actual doctor of human sexuality and behavior.
Unfortunately, you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days and I am here to set things straight.
Thank God.
I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width.
Vou damn n montaire!
We all nt to welcome our new member, Randy.
Say hi to everyone, randi.
Oh suck it, all of you!
Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy.
Why don't you share what's bothering you.
You don't just go around changing math.
Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?
God damn right!
Socialist fascists!
Power to the people!
Burn it down!
Burn it down!
Mr. marsh, this is what we are here to try and work on, okay.
No dude, we're burnin' this shit!
If you take a minute to think about your anger -- yeah, dude!
Mah, that shit be burnin n shit mah!
Welcome to fed ex, how can I help you today?
Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.
Alright, let's see what kind of -- burn it down!
Burn it down, dude!
Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their federal express!
Tom, I'm standing outside the fedex in fairplay, Colorado where a radical political group has taken several people hostage.
They call themselves 'the pissed off and angry party' and they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
This is a call to all angry people!
We've had enough!
We're gonna hit the government where it hurts!
Right in the federal express!
What exactly are you angry about?
We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media control, and -- and Jews!
Yeah, and Jews and all the stuff that the government's doing!
You've got a lot of people scared.
What are your demands?
Well, first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
And we want -- and we wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
Yeah.
We wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
And, uhmm -- and my mom gotta stop trippin mah.
Bitch be trippin' all the time, mah!
Yeah, we want our mom's to stop trippin, man, cuz them bitches be trippin all the time!
And I think that -- is that it?
No, and Kyle!
Oh, yeah and Kyle!
Surgeon general's resignation,
Obama's real birth certificate, mom's to stop trippin and Kyle.
You got that?
Or else we're gonna bring the federal express to a grinding halt!
Does it bother you that the federal express is not affiliated at all with the federal government?
No!
No, that doesn't matter.
Really?
Butters, what are you doing?
Homework!
I just don't get it!
That is the fourth time I've calculated!
And it's below average!
I thought I was hung, but according to my TMI I have a micropenis!
Your TMI?
I don't understand it.
I'm startin' -
- I'm startin to feel angry!
Butters, put your clothes on!
Oh, what's the point, mom?
What's the point of life anyways?
All you do is yell at me!
And the government!
It's lead by fascists!
And everyone's a Justin Bieber wanna be!
I wanna go and drive a hummer.
That's what I wanna do!
I wanna drive a car that goes vram vram vram!
Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small?
Hey!
Everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America!
Join the fight!
We're gonna take down the federal expresses!
The American apparels!
And the American furniture warehouse!
We are fed up and we've had enough!
Surgeon general, twelve more fedexs have been taken over, the pissed off and angry party is gaining more support.
They've shut down American airlines and American apparels all over the country.
We have to ask you to step down.
Are you seriously saying we're going to give into their demands?
They are all really angry.
We have to make them stop.
Is the team standing by to that little boy 'Kyle'?
Team is standing by, sir.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Let me through!
Who is this?
Surgeon general, I believe I know why this is happening.
I have found a direct correlation between anger and TMI.
Anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw.
Look, we all get angry, but when someone is consistently angry, or always finding new reasons to be angry it means they have a very, very, very, very small dick.
Your theory is fine, doctor, but it doesn't matter.
The TMI equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Isn't there?
Isn't there?
We've waited long enough, Randy!
Let's start killing these sons a bitches!
No, please!
Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want.
Yo, let's cap these bitches, mah.
Let's cap 'em 'n leave 'em in the back a the buildin', mah.
Hey, come over here!
Look!
We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general.
Fellow Americans, as you all know the TMI scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk.
The established equation is 100 percent accurate.
However, due to recently collected data we are making one change.
The national average for penis length is now officially moved, from six inches to 1.6 inches.
Anyone with a TMI of over 1.5 inches is considered 'above average.'
the winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it?
It's electric and magical the happy train's on track because America is back.
Come on!
Wait, what?
America is back!
America is back!
Wait, according to that scale,
I still have a small wiener.
America is back!
I'm still fucking angry!
And we're back!
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago, meaning Terminator could be his own father, and then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him!
No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator five, that really happened.
Skeletor's real?
No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
Skeletor's a lady?
God dammit!
Who the fuck do they think they are?
This is the last fucking straw!
I am going to fucking kill everybody!
Hey, Eric!
I am so sick of this fucking schooooool!
This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone too far this time!
You get in trouble again, Cartman?
No!
I didn't do a damn thing.
Nothing!
I told you this school is a den of snakes!
You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
Dude, we're just trying to eat.
Oh, you think I'm just over reacting again, huh.
No, not this time!
The school has gone too far and it affects each and every one of you!
You remember the school physical we all took last week?
Yeah.
Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
No, they didn't.
Yeah, they fucking did, Kyle!
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
Because they don't fucking care!
I've told you this!
They don't give a shit about the students and they live to make us miserable!
That doesn't make any sense.
Go look for yourselves!
There, you see?
Can you fucking believe it?
Is that really all our wiener sizes?
Yeah, dude!
Look at it!
It says right there.
Eric Cartman 1.2 inches.
Why would they tell everybody that?
They wanna measure my wiener, fine, but don't put me on blast!
Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches.
Yeah, that's about right.
Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches.
Is that good?
How big do they say mine is?
I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
You're right, they really seem into it, mkay.
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches.
That doesn't seem right.
No shit, Sherlock!
My dick isn't 1.4 inches either.
It isn't.
This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
A conspiracy?
They're trying to stir up some big thing again!
Get all the girls all heated up and freaking out over with boy has the biggest shlong!
This has to be dealt with!
Well everyone's already seen it.
Nothing we can do about it now.
Oh, there's something we can do about it, all right.
If they're gonna put us on blast, they are at least getting the numbers right.
We are going to re-measure!
All right.
Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.
You see witnesses?
That's.2 inches more than what the school said.
All right.
Nice one, Clyde.
All right, next.
Whip it out, butters.
Ooh, it's a little chilly in here.
All right, butters, let's see what you got going on down there.
Hey, wait, the cold is makin' it shrink some.
Where you goin' little feller?
Butters, I don't have time for this.
I can't wait if your wiener is pullin' a scared turtle.
Hang on, he's comin' back out.
There he is!
Who's a little guy.
All right, butters.
Looks like we have 2 point - wow - 2.4 inches.
Really nice, butters.
I'm hung like a horse!
All right, that's everybody!
Let's go post these numbers!
What?
Didn't you forget something?
What, Kyle?
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
I measured mine this morning.
See?
It's right here at the top.
13.7 inches?
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Your wiener is not thirteen inches long!
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses.
You have to too.
Well, what are you guys gonna do, use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?
Are you homos?
You just did that to everybody in class!
Okay, fine, whatever.
Go ahead!
Yeah, that's good.
A little higher on Craig's side.
Yeah.
Actual boy's penis sizes?
Gross!
You see?
My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!
What red?
You all freakin' out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys?
I don't care!
Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement and for this poster to be put up at all?
Don't forget that this was all my idea!
Eric Cartman to the principal's office.
Immediately.
Oh God dammit!
Let me guess, I'm in trouble again!
You're darn right, Eric.
For what?
Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?
Why did you measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?
What?
I don't care if Obama is president!
You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world lengths of their dicks!
Wait.
Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physicals?
You're damn right!
1.2 inches!
I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches!
Maybe it's still the smallest in the school, but it's point two inches bigger that you said!
The numbers we put up were height differentials!
What?
We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year.
You grew 1.2 inches.
Those weren't our dick sizes?
Why would we publish the length of our students' private parts?
I don't know, why would you?
We didn't!
Aw, crap!
You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?
This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about Eric.
You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen.
This time, you've done it to yourself!
Oh God.
Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it.
Because you have an anger problem, Eric.
No, I don't!
What we need to figure out here, is are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism, some rage addiction.
It could be a lot of things.
My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.

Does it bother you that the federal express is not affiliated at all with the federal government?
No!
No, that doesn't matter.
Really?
Butters, what are you doing?
Homework!
I just don't get it!
That is the fourth time I've calculated!
And it's below average!
I thought I was hung, but according to my TMI I have a micropenis!
Your TMI?
I don't understand it.
I'm startin'
- I'm startin to feel angry!
Butters, put your clothes on!
Oh, what's the point, mom?
What's the point of life anyways?
All you do is yell at me!
And the government!
It's lead by fascists!
And everyone's a Justin Bieber wanna be!
I wanna go and drive a hummer.
That's what I wanna do!
I wanna drive a car that goes vram vram vram!
Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small?
Hey!
Everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America!
Join the fight!
We're gonna take down the federal expresses!
The American apparels!
And the American furniture warehouse!
We are fed up and we've had enough!
Surgeon general, twelve more fedexs have been taken over, the pissed off and angry party is gaining more support.
They've shut down American airlines and American apparels all over the country.
We have to ask you to step down.
Are you seriously saying we're going to give into their demands?
They are all really angry.
We have to make them stop.
Is the team standing by to that little boy 'Kyle'?
Team is standing by, sir.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Let me through!
Who is this?
Surgeon general, I believe I know why this is happening.
I have found a direct correlation between anger and TMI.
Anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw.
Look, we all get angry, but when someone is consistently angry, or always finding new reasons to be angry it means they have a very, very, very, very small dick.
Your theory is fine, doctor, but it doesn't matter.
The TMI equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Isn't there?
Isn't there?
We've waited long enough, Randy!
Let's start killing these sons a bitches!
No, please!
Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want.
Yo, let's cap these bitches, mah.
Let's cap 'em 'n leave 'em in the back a the buildin', mah.
Hey, come over here!
Look!
We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general.
Fellow Americans, as you all know the TMI scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk.
The established equation is 100 percent accurate.
However, due to recently collected data we are making one change.
The national average for penis length is now officially moved, from six inches to 1.6 inches.
Anyone with a TMI of over 1.5 inches is considered 'above average.'
The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it?
It's electric and magical the happy train's on track because America is back.
Come on!
Wait, what?
America is back!
Wait, according to that scale,
I still have a small wiener.
America is back!
I'm still fucking angry!
And we're back!
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago, meaning Terminator could be his own father, and then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him!
No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator five, that really happened.
Skeletor's real?
No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
Skeletor's a lady?
God dammit!
Who the fuck do they think they are?
This is the last fucking straw!
I am going to fucking kill everybody!
Hey, Eric!
I am so sick of this fucking schooooool!
This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone too far this time!
You get in trouble again, Cartman?
No!
I didn't do a damn thing.
Nothing!
I told you this school is a den of snakes!
You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
Dude, we're just trying to eat.
Oh, you think I'm just over reacting again, huh.
No, not this time!
The school has gone too far and it affects each and every one of you!
You remember the school physical we all took last week?
Yeah.
Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
No, they didn't.
Yeah, they fucking did, Kyle!
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
Because they don't fucking care!
I've told you this!
They don't give a shit about the students and they live to make us miserable!
That doesn't make any sense.
Go look for yourselves!
There, you see?
Can you fucking believe it?
Is that really all our wiener sizes?
Yeah, dude!
Look at it!
It says right there.
Eric Cartman 1.2 inches.
Why would they tell everybody that?
They wanna measure my wiener, fine, but don't put me on blast!
Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches.
Yeah, that's about right.
Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches.
Is that good?
How big do they say mine is?
I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
You're right, they really seem into it, mkay.
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches.
That doesn't seem right.
No shit, Sherlock!
My dick isn't 1.4 inches either.
It isn't.
This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
A conspiracy?
They're trying to stir up some big thing again!
Get all the girls all heated up and freaking out over with boy has the biggest shlong!
This has to be dealt with!
Well everyone's already seen it.
Nothing we can do about it now.
Oh, there's something we can do about it, all right.
If they're gonna put us on blast, they are at least getting the numbers right.
We are going to re-measure!
All right.
Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.
You see witnesses?
That's.2 inches more than what the school said.
All right.
Nice one, Clyde.
All right, next.
Whip it out, butters.
Ooh, it's a little chilly in here.
All right, butters, let's see what you got going on down there.
Hey, wait, the cold is makin' it shrink some.
Where you goin' little feller?
Butters, I don't have time for this.
I can't wait if your wiener is pullin' a scared turtle.
Hang on, he's comin' back out.
There he is!
Who's a little guy.
All right, butters.
Looks like we have 2 point -- wow -- 2.4 inches.
Really nice, butters.
I'm hung like a horse!
All right, that's everybody!
Let's go post these numbers!
What?
Didn't you forget something?
What, Kyle?
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
I measured mine this morning.
See?
It's right here at the top.
13.7 inches?
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Your wiener is not thirteen inches long!
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses.
You have to too.
Well, what are you guys gonna do, use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?
Are you homos?
You just did that to everybody in class!
Okay, fine, whatever.
Go ahead!
Yeah, that's good.
A little higher on Craig's side.
Yeah.
Actual boy's penis sizes?
Gross!
You see?
My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!
What red?
You all freakin' out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys?
I don't care!
Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement and for this poster to be put up at all?
Don't forget that this was all my idea!
Eric Cartman to the principal's office.
Immediately.
Oh God dammit!
Let me guess, I'm in trouble again!
You're darn right, Eric.
For what?
Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?
Why did you measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?
What?
I don't care if Obama is president!
You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world lengths of their dicks!
Wait.
Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physicals?
You're damn right!
1.2 inches!
I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches!
Maybe it's still the smallest in the school, but it's point two inches bigger that you said!
The numbers we put up were height differentials!
What?
We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year.
You grew 1.2 inches.
Those weren't our dick sizes?
Why would we publish the length of our students' private parts?
I don't know, why would you?
We didn't!
Aw, crap!
You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?
This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about Eric.
You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen.
This time, you've done it to yourself!
Oh God.
Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it.
Because you have an anger problem, Eric.
No, I don't!
What we need to figure out here, is are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism, some rage addiction.
It could be a lot of things.
My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.
Let's try a little experiment.
I want to see what kind of things trigger you, Eric, okay?
How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?
Honestly I wouldn't really care.
What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat?
I think you're a fat little boy.
I think you're way too fat for your age.
Does that make you feel any anger?
Huh, fatty?
Jelly belly?
You got jelly in your belly you little fat [Bleep].
You get a little flash of anger when someone tells you you got tits like a forty year old woman, fat boy?
You like that?
Shitty titty jelly belly?
Oh, yeah, he's a big boy!
Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass.
Big ol' jiggly fatty butt!
Huh.
Well, I just don't see it, Ms. Cartman.
Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all.
In fact, I'd say he's one of the more even tempered children I've ever seen.
Sorry, doctor.
Your wife's on the phone.
Says it's an emergency.
Excuse me.
Carol, what -- whoa, calm down, honey.
What do you mean?
Web chat with what-- what fourteen year old girl?
Carol, I would never!
No, I don't have a criminal record!
Who is Mitch Conner?
There can't be an official police report, honey, there's no -- no, Carol put down the gun!
Sweetie, put down the --
Carol?
Carol?
I'm not fat.
I'm big boned.
Thank you for coming parents, we've called you in because we have had a little 'incident' at the school.
The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
Oh dear.
Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling affect that can get blown out of proportion.
Did they measure from the base or from the balls?
How does the school let things like this happen?
Now, now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing.
We simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
I'm a scientist.
I think it's best I handle this.
Hello, students, my name is doctor marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday.
How do a man and woman make a baby?
Anybody.
A man and a woman, what do they do to make a baby?
How about the little girl in the brown coat.
Yeah, you.
They have sex.
Good!
The man puts his penis, okay, into the woman's vagina.
Okay, now sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is is actually important.
But is it?
When you boys measured your penis length the truth is it doesn't really matter.
What does matter is -- length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared.
Okay?
When we are talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure.
We need a scale, and a protractor as well.
Let's look at it on the graph here.
Follow along with me on your study sheet, kids.
I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.
We didn't make any effort.
We didn't have a choice!
Yeah, this is bullshit!
Together, we are going to learn what makes us angry, okay, and how to better deal with it so we don't get our ourselves into trouble a anymore.
So lame.
Why doesn't everyone just die.
Look!
If a somebody order the city beef, and a complain because they say they ordered the city s shrimp it's not a my fault he gets a city chicken poured all over his head!
We have good reason to be angry!
This country is going to shit!
We have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!
Right.
See, what we all need to do is channel our various reasons for anger and learn to control it.
Man, this shit is whack, mah.
I just seen all this shit front in, mah.
Don't understand what it's like my pops.
Ain't no mother good, mah, bitch be coming.
I be tappin that shit, mah.
Why am I here?
Well, Eric, because I know you want to control your anger and become a better person.
You saying I got problems like these people?
No!
No, I'm not saying that at all.
Please, I'm just saying how amazing you are for wanting to lessen some of your more less awesome attributes.
Oh, that's cool.
And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the -- what do we call it again?
The yaw, the yaw of the shaft, what we finally get is the adjusted penis size or t.
M. I.
Any questions so far?
Yes, little girl over there.
What's a penis?
Ah, good question.
Uh, the penis, is the thing we are talking about that boys' have that we're measuring.
Okay.
Any other questions?
Okay.
So then let's move on to the example on your study sheet.
How about you, could you read the first example for the class?
Example one, young lady, please read the problem out loud.
Example one: 'Randy' has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.
4.4 inches.
Its angle is 32 degrees.
Its flaccid girth is 1 inch in diameter.
His balls are 7 centimeters from the base.
Seven centimeters.
Randy notes that the drift of his penis is 4 centimeters to penis right and its dead weight is.5 kilograms.
Great.
And so, divide by the 17, carry the one and we can see that 'Randy's' adjusted penis size, or TMI, is 6.3 inches.
Do we got that?
Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3.
So how does our example person 'Randy' compare to others on the TMI scale?
By referring again to the TMI chart, we see that a TMI of 6.3 is. 8 inches more than the national average.
Okay.
What we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger.
Daniel, could you stand up, please.
What makes you the angriest, Daniel?
Stupid ass blind liberals!
Okay, great.
Chase, could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid ass blind liberal.
And what makes you angriest, chase?
Skrawny ass sissies!
Okay, Daniel is a skrawny ass sissy.
He just cut in front of you in line at the bank.
Go!
Hey!
What, you think, I got a small dick?
Huh?
I don't have a small penis!
My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!
Okay.
Uh, why don't we do some role playing now with Wayne d who gets angriest at his mom.
Gretchen, could you play Wayne d's mom for us.
You bitch!
You think you bad just cuz you a mom don't mean I won't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mah!
I may be female on the outside but I still have a bigger penis than you!
Don't say that!
It isn't true!
It isn't true!
That's enough!
I'm sick of everyone talking about a penis size!
Yeah, it doesn't matter!
It doesn't matter!
Does everyone here have an issue with their penis size?
No.
Nope.
Not me.
Nah mah, my shit be packin', mah.
My penis is thirteen inches long!
Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnoud and I'm an actual doctor of human sexuality and behavior.
Unfortunately, you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days and I am here to set things straight.
Thank God.
I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width.
Vous êtes un menteur!
We all want to welcome our new member, Randy.
Say hi to everyone, Randy.
Oh suck it, all of you!
Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy.
Why don't you share what's bothering you.
You don't just go around changing math.
Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?
God damn right!
Socialist fascists!
Power to the people!
Burn it down!
Burn it down!
Mr. marsh, this is what we are here to try and work on, okay.
No dude, we're burnin' this shit!
If you take a minute to think about your anger -- yeah, dude!
Mah, that shit be burnin n shit mah!
Welcome to fed ex, how can I help you today?
Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.
Alright, let's see what kind of -- burn it down!
Burn it down, dude!
Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their federal express!
Tom, I'm standing outside the fedex in fairplay, Colorado where a radical political group has taken several people hostage.
They call themselves 'the pissed off and angry party' and they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
This is a call to all angry people!
We've had enough!
We're gonna hit the government where it hurts!
Right in the federal express!
What exactly are you angry about?
We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media control, and -- and Jews!
Yeah, and Jews and all the stuff that the government's doing!
You've got a lot of people scared.
What are your demands?
Well, first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
And we want -- and we wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
Yeah.
We wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
And, uhmm -- and my mom gotta stop trippin mah.
Bitch be trippin' all the time, mah!
Yeah, we want our mom's to stop trippin, man, cuz them bitches be trippin all the time!
And I think that -- is that it?
No, and Kyle!
Oh, yeah and Kyle!
Surgeon general's resignation,
Obama's real birth certificate, mom's to stop trippin and Kyle.
You got that?
Or else we're gonna bring the federal express to a grinding halt!
Does it bother you that the federal express is not affiliated at all with the federal government?
No!
No, that doesn't matter.
Really?
Butters, what are you doing?
Homework!
I just don't get it!
That is the fourth time I've calculated!
And it's below average!
I thought I was hung, but according to my TMI I have a micropenis!
Your TMI?
I don't understand it.
I'm startin' -
- I'm startin to feel angry!
Butters, put your clothes on!
Oh, what's the point, mom?
What's the point of life anyways?
All you do is yell at me!
And the government!
It's lead by fascists!
And everyone's a Justin Bieber wanna be!
I wanna go and drive a hummer.
That's what I wanna do!
I wanna drive a car that goes vram vram vram!

How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?
Honestly I wouldn't really care.
What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat?
I think you're a fat little boy.
I think you're way too fat for your age.
Does that make you feel any anger?
Huh, fatty?
Jelly belly?
You got jelly in your belly you little fat [Bleep].
You get a little flash of anger when someone tells you you got tits like a forty year old woman, fat boy?
You like that?
Shitty titty jelly belly?
Oh, yeah, he's a big boy!
Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass.
Big ol' jiggly fatty butt!
Huh.
Well, I just don't see it, Ms. Cartman.
Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all.
In fact, I'd say he's one of the more even tempered children I've ever seen.
Sorry, doctor.
Your wife's on the phone.
Says it's an emergency.
Excuse me.
Carol, what -- whoa, calm down, honey.
What do you mean?
Web chat with what-- what fourteen year old girl?
Carol, I would never!
No, I don't have a criminal record!
Who is Mitch Conner?
There can't be an official police report, honey, there's no -- no, Carol put down the gun!
Sweetie, put down the --
Carol?
Carol?
I'm not fat.
I'm big boned.
Thank you for coming parents, we've called you in because we have had a little 'incident' at the school.
The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
Oh dear.
Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling affect that can get blown out of proportion.
Did they measure from the base or from the balls?
How does the school let things like this happen?
Now, now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing.
We simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
I'm a scientist.
I think it's best I handle this.
Hello, students, my name is doctor marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday.
How do a man and woman make a baby?
Anybody.
A man and a woman, what do they do to make a baby?
How about the little girl in the brown coat.
Yeah, you.
They have sex.
Good!
The man puts his penis, okay, into the woman's vagina.
Okay, now sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is is actually important.
But is it?
When you boys measured your penis length the truth is it doesn't really matter.
What does matter is -- length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared.
Okay?
When we are talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure.
We need a scale, and a protractor as well.
Let's look at it on the graph here.
Follow along with me on your study sheet, kids.
I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.
We didn't make any effort.
We didn't have a choice!
Yeah, this is bullshit!
Together, we are going to learn what makes us angry, okay, and how to better deal with it so we don't get our ourselves into trouble a anymore.
So lame.
Why doesn't everyone just die.
Look!
If a somebody order the city beef, and a complain because they say they ordered the city s shrimp it's not a my fault he gets a city chicken poured all over his head!
We have good reason to be angry!
This country is going to shit!
We have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!
Right.
See, what we all need to do is channel our various reasons for anger and learn to control it.
Man, this shit is whack, mah.
I just seen all this shit front in, mah.
Don't understand what it's like my pops.
Ain't no mother good, mah, bitch be coming.
I be tappin that shit, mah.
Why am I here?
Well, Eric, because I know you want to control your anger and become a better person.
You saying I got problems like these people?
No!
No, I'm not saying that at all.
Please, I'm just saying how amazing you are for wanting to lessen some of your more less awesome attributes.
Oh, that's cool.
And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the -- what do we call it again?
The yaw, the yaw of the shaft, what we finally get is the adjusted penis size or t.M.I.
Any questions so far?
Yes, little girl over there.
What's a penis?
Ah, good question.
Uh, the penis, is the thing we are talking about that boys' have that we're measuring.
Okay.
Any other questions?
Okay.
So then let's move on to the example on your study sheet.
How about you, could you read the first example for the class?
Example one, young lady, please read the problem out loud.
Example one: 'Randy' has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.
4.4 inches.
Its angle is 32 degrees.
Its flaccid girth is 1 inch in diameter.
His balls are 7 centimeters from the base.
Seven centimeters.
Randy notes that the drift of his penis is 4 centimeters to penis right and its dead weight is .5 kilograms.
Great.
And so, divide by the 17, carry the one and we can see that 'Randy's' adjusted penis size, or TMI, is 6.3 inches.
Do we got that?
Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3.
So how does our example person 'Randy' compare to others on the TMI scale?
By referring again to the TMI chart, we see that a TMI of 6.3 is.
8 inches more than the national average.
Okay.
What we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger.
Daniel, could you stand up, please.
What makes you the angriest, Daniel?
Stupid ass blind liberals!
Okay, great.
Chase, could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid ass blind liberal.
And what makes you angriest, chase?
Skrawny ass sissies!
Okay, Daniel is a skrawny ass sissy.
He just cut in front of you in line at the bank.
Go!
Hey!
What, you think, I got a small dick?
Huh?
I don't have a small penis!
My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!
Okay.
Uh, why don't we do some role playing now with Wayne d who gets angriest at his mom.
Gretchen, could you play Wayne d's mom for us.
You bitch!
You think you bad just cuz you a mom don't mean I won't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mah!
I may be female on the outside but I still have a bigger penis than you!
Don't say that!
It isn't true!
It isn't true!
That's enough!
I'm sick of everyone talking about a penis size!
Yeah, it doesn't matter!
It doesn't matter!
Does everyone here have an issue with their penis size?
No.
Nope.
Not me.
Nah mah, my shit be packin', mah.
My penis is thirteen inches long!
Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnoud and I'm an actual doctor of human sexuality and behavior.
Unfortunately, you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days and I am here to set things straight.
Thank God.
I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width.
Vous êtes un menteur!
We all want to welcome our new member, Randy.
Say hi to everyone, Randy.
Oh suck it, all of you!
Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy.
Why don't you share what's bothering you.
You don't just go around changing math.
Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?
God damn right!
Socialist fascists!
Power to the people!
Burn it down!
Burn it down!
Mr. marsh, this is what we are here to try and work on, okay.
No dude, we're burnin' this shit!
If you take a minute to think about your anger -- yeah, dude!
Mah, that shit be burnin n shit mah!
Welcome to fed ex, how can I help you today?
Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.
Alright, let's see what kind of -- burn it down!
Burn it down, dude!
Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their federal express!
Tom, I'm standing outside the fedex in fairplay, Colorado where a radical political group has taken several people hostage.
They call themselves 'the pissed off and angry party' and they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
This is a call to all angry people!
We've had enough!
We're gonna hit the government where it hurts!
Right in the federal express!
What exactly are you angry about?
We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media control, and -- and Jews!
Yeah, and Jews and all the stuff that the government's doing!
You've got a lot of people scared.
What are your demands?
Well, first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
And we want -- and we wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
Yeah.
We wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
And, uhmm -- and my mom gotta stop trippin mah.
Bitch be trippin' all the time, mah!
Yeah, we want our mom's to stop trippin, man, cuz them bitches be trippin all the time!
And I think that -- is that it?
No, and Kyle!
Oh, yeah and Kyle!
Surgeon general's resignation,
Obama's real birth certificate, mom's to stop trippin and Kyle.
You got that?
Or else we're gonna bring the federal express to a grinding halt!
Does it bother you that the federal express is not affiliated at all with the federal government?
No!
No, that doesn't matter.
Really?
Butters, what are you doing?
Homework!
I just don't get it!
That is the fourth time I've calculated!
And it's below average!
I thought I was hung, but according to my TMI I have a micropenis!
Your TMI?
I don't understand it.
I'm startin' -
- I'm startin to feel angry!
Butters, put your clothes on!
Oh, what's the point, mom?
What's the point of life anyways?
All you do is yell at me!
And the government!
It's lead by fascists!
And everyone's a Justin Bieber wanna be!
I wanna go and drive a hummer.
That's what I wanna do!
I wanna drive a car that goes vram vram vram!
Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small?
Hey!
Everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America!
Join the fight!
We're gonna take down the federal expresses!
The American apparels!
And the American furniture warehouse!
We are fed up and we've had enough!
Surgeon general, twelve more fedexs have been taken over, the pissed off and angry party is gaining more support.
They've shut down American airlines and American apparels all over the country.
We have to ask you to step down.
Are you seriously saying we're going to give into their demands?
They are all really angry.
We have to make them stop.
Is the team standing by to that little boy 'Kyle'?
Team is standing by, sir.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Let me through!
Who is this?
Surgeon general, I believe I know why this is happening.
I have found a direct correlation between anger and TMI.
Anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw.
Look, we all get angry, but when someone is consistently angry, or always finding new reasons to be angry it means they have a very, very, very, very small dick.
Your theory is fine, doctor, but it doesn't matter.
The TMI equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Isn't there?
Isn't there?
We've waited long enough, Randy!
Let's start killing these sons a bitches!
No, please!
Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want.
Yo, let's cap these bitches, mah.
Let's cap 'em 'n leave 'em in the back a the buildin', mah.
Hey, come over here!
Look!
We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general.
Fellow Americans, as you all know the TMI scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk.
The established equation is 100 percent accurate.
However, due to recently collected data we are making one change.
The national average for penis length is now officially moved, from six inches to 1.6 inches.
Anyone with a TMI of over 1.5 inches is considered 'above average.'
the winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it?
It's electric and magical the happy train's on track because America is back.
Come on!
Wait, what?
America is back!
America is back!
Wait, according to that scale,
I still have a small wiener.
America is back!
I'm still fucking angry!
And we're back!
and then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him!
That's not the trailer for Terminator 5.
That really happened.
Skeletor's real?
That's not Skeletor.
That's Terminator's wife.
Skeletor's a lady?
God dammit!
Who the fuck do they think they are?
This is the last fucking straw!
I am going to fucking kill everybody!
I am so sick of this fucking school!
This stupid school and principal have gone too far this time!
273)}– You get in trouble again?
– I didn't do a damn thing!
I told you.
This school is a den of snakes!
You won't believe what they did this time.
We're trying to eat.
You think I'm overreacting again?
Not this time!
and it affects everyone of you.
You remember the school physical we all took last week?
The school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
they fucking did!
Why would they put up the sizes of our wieners?
Because they don't fucking care!
I've told you this.
They don't give a shit about us.
They live to make us miserable.
273)}– That doesn't make any sense.
– Go look for yourselves!
you see?
Can you fucking believe it?
273)}– Is that really all our wiener sizes?
– Yeah!
Look at it!
Eric Cartman 1.2″.
Why would they tell everybody?
but don't put me on blast!
2.4″.
That's about right.
2.2″.
Is that good?
How big do they say mine is?
I told you they would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
You're right.
They really seem into it.
It says mine's only 2.1″.
That doesn't seem right.
Sherlock!
My dick isn't 1.4″ either.
It isn't!
This is another conspiracy by the school faculty.
A conspiracy?
They're trying to stir up some big thing again.
Get all the girls all heated up over which boy has the biggest shlong!
This has to be dealt with!
Everyone's already seen it.
Nothing we can do about it.
There's something we can do about it.
they're at least getting it right.
We are going to remeasure!
2.3″.
witnesses?
That's .2″ more than what they said.
273)}– All right!
– Nice one.
next.
Whip it out.
It's a little chilly in here.
Let's see what you got going on down there.
Wait.
The cold is making it shrink some.
little feller?
– I don't have time for this.
I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a scared turtle.
He's coming back out.
There he is!
Who's a little guy?
All right.
Looks like we have... 2.4″.
273)}– Really nice.
– I'm hung like a horse!
That's everybody.
Let's go post these numbers.
273)}– What?
– Didn't you forget something?
What?
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
I measured mine this morning.
It's right here at the top.
13.7″?
It's pretty good.
Your wiener is not 13″ long!
We all got measured with witnesses.
You have to too.
What are you guys gonna do?
Measure my penis yourselves?
273)}– Are you homos?
– You just did that to everybody!
whatever!
Go ahead!
That's good.
A little higher on Craig's side.
273)}– "Actual boys' penis sizes"?
– Gross!
it's 1.4!
What?
My wiener's smaller than the others'?
I don't care!
I'm very happy with my wiener.
why would I have called for this poster to be put up at all?
Don't forget that this was all my idea!
Eric Cartman to the principal's office immediately.
God dammit!
Let me guess.
I'm in trouble again.
273)}– You're darn right.
– For what?
Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?
Why did you do it and put the results on the school bulletin board?
273)}– What?
– I don't care if Obama is president. telling the world the lengths of their dicks!
Are you talking about the numbers we published from the physicals?
You're damn right!
1.2″!
I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4″!
but it's .2″ bigger that you said!
The numbers we put up were height differentials.
We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year.
You grew 1.2″.
Those weren't our dick sizes?
Why would we publish the length of our students' private parts?
273)}– I don't know.
Why would you?
– We didn't!
Crap!
Everyone knows my wiener is smaller because of me?
This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about. and you cause bad things to happen.
you've done it to yourself!
God!
Why couldn't I have taken a minute to think?
Because you have an anger problem.
I don't! some rage addiction...
It could be a lot of things.
but he's not all bad.
Let's try an experiment.
I wanna see what kind of things trigger you.
How do you think you would react if I said negative things about you?
I wouldn't really care.
What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat?
I think you're a fat little boy.
I think you're way too fat for your age.
Does that make you feel any anger?
fatty?
Jelly belly?
you little fat fuck.
You get angry when someone tells you you got tits like a 40-year-old woman?
Fat boy?
You like that?
Shitty titty jelly belly?
He's a big boy!
Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass!
Big ol' jiggly fatty butt!
I just don't see it.
Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all.
He's one of the more even tempered children I've ever seen.

Excuse me.

Calm down.
What do you mean?

How do a man and woman make a baby?
Anybody?
what do they do to make a baby?
you.
273)}– They have sex.
– Good!
The man puts his penis... into the woman's vagina.
a man... can feel like how long his penis is is actually important.
But is it? the truth is it doesn't really matter.
What does matter is... divided by angle of the tip squared.

Why doesn't everyone just die? it's not a my fault he gets a city chicken poured all over his fucking head!
We have good reason to be angry.
This country is going to shit! and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!
Right.
What we all need to do is channel our reasons for anger and learn to control it.
mah.

Why the fuck am I here?
I know you want to control your anger and become a better person.
I got problems like these fucking people?
I'm not saying that at all.
I'm saying how amazing you are for wanting to... lessen some of your more... less awesome attributes.
That's cool.
by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the...
What do we call it again? what we finally get is the adjusted penis size or TMI.
little girl over there.
What's a penis?
Good question.
The penis is... the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're measuring.
Any other questions?
So let's move on to the example on your study sheet.
could you read it for the class?
please read the problem out loud.
Example one:
Randy has a penis that is 4.4″ in length.
4.4″.
Its angle is 32°.
Its flaccid girth is 1″ in diameter.
His balls are 7 cm from the base.
7 cm.
Randy notes that the drift of his penis and its dead weight is .5 kg.
carry the one and we can see that...
Randy's adjusted penis size or TMI is... 6.3″.
Do we got that? but his adjusted length is 6.3.
So how does our example person Randy compare to others on the TMI scale? we see that a TMI of 6.3 is .8″ more than the national average.
What we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger.
could you stand up?
What makes you the angriest?
Stupid ass blind liberals!
could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid ass blind liberal?
And what makes you angriest?
Scrawny ass sissies!
Daniel's a scrawny ass sissy.
He just cut in front of you in line at the bank.
Go!
What?
You think I got a small dick?
I don't have a small penis!
My wife thinks it's perfectly fine!
Why don't we do some role playing with Wayne D?
Who gets angriest at his mom.
could you play Wayne D's mom?
Yo bitch!
You think you bad just cuz you a mom mah! but I still have a bigger penis than you!
I don't have a small penis.
It isn't true!
Enough!

Yeah.
Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
No, they didn't.
Yeah, they fucking did, Kyle!
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
Because they don't fucking care!
I've told you this!
They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!
That doesn't make any sense.
Go look for yourselves!
There, you see?
Can you fucking believe it?
Is that really all our wiener sizes?
Yeah, dude, look at it!
It says right there.
Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches.
Why would they tell everybody that?
They wanna measure my wiener?
Fine!
But don't put me on blast!
Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches.
Yeah, that's about right.
Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches.
Is that good?
How big do they say mine is?
I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
You're right.
They really seem into it, mkay.
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches.
That doesn't seem right.
No shit, Sherlock!
My dick isn't 1.2 inches either.
It isn't!
This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
A conspiracy?
They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up and freaking out over which boy has the biggest schlong!
This has to be dealt with!
Well, everyone's already seen it.
Nothing we can do about it now.
Oh, there's something we can do about it, all right.
If they're gonna put us on blast, they are at least gonna get the numbers right.
We are going to re-measure!
All right.
Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.
You see, witnesses?
That's.2 inches more than what the school said.
- All right.
- Nice one, Clyde.
All right, next.
Whip it out, Butters.
Oh, it's a little chilly in here.
All right, Butters, let's see what you got going on down there.
Hey, wait, the cold is makin' it shrink some.
Where you goin', little feller?
Butters, I don't have time for this.
I can't wait if your wiener is pullin' a scared turtle.
Hang on, he's comin' back out.
There he is!
Who's a little guy?
All right, Butters, looks like we have 2 point-
Wow. 2.4 inches.
Really nice, Butters.
I'm hung like a horse!
All right, that's everybody!
Let's go post these numbers!
What?
Didn't you forget something?
What, Kyle?
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
I measured mine this morning.
See?
It's right here at the top.
13.7 inches?
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Your wiener is not 13 inches long!
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses.
You have to too.
Well, what are you guys gonna do?
Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?
Are you homos?
You just did that to everybody in class!
Okay!
Fine!
Whatever!
Go ahead!
Yeah, that's good.
A little higher on Craig's side.
Yeah.
- Actual boys' penis sizes?
- Gross!
Yeah, you see?
My wiener isn't 1.2 inches.
It's 1.4!
What, red?
You all freakin' out 'cause my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?
I don't care!
Clearly, I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else, why would I have called for a new measurement and for this poster to be put up at all?
Don't forget that this was all my idea!
Eric Cartman to the principal's office immediately!
Oh, God damn it!
Let me guess.
I'm in trouble again.
- You're darn right, Eric.
- For what?
Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?
Why did you measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?
What?
I don't care if Obama is president!
You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the lengths of their dicks!
Wait.
Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physicals?
You're damn right!
1.2 inches.
I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches!
Maybe it's still the smallest in the school, but it's.2 inches bigger than you said!
The numbers we put up were height differentials!
What?
We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year.
You grew 1.2 inches.
Those weren't our dick sizes?
Why would we publish the length of our students' private parts?
I don't know!
Why would you?
We didn't!
Aw, crap!
You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?
This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric.
You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen.
This time, you've done it to yourself.
Oh, God.
Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
Because you have an anger problem, Eric.
Fuck you!
No, I don't!
What we need to figure out here is, are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism, some rage addiction.
It could be a lot of things.
My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.
Let's try a little experiment.
I want to see maybe what kind of things trigger you, Eric, okay?
How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?
Honestly, I wouldn't really care.
What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat?
I think you're a fat little boy.
I think you're way too fat for your age.
Does that make you feel any anger?
Huh, fatty?
Jelly belly?
You got jelly in your belly, you little fat fuck?
You get a little flash of anger when someone tells you you got tits like a 40-year-old woman, fat boy?
Huh?
You like that, shitty titty jelly belly?
Oh, yeah, he's a big boy!
Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass!
Big ol' jiggly fatty butt!
Huh.
Well, I just don't see it, Ms. Cartman.
Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all.
In fact, I'd say he's one of the more even-tempered children I've ever seen.
Sorry, Doctor.
Your wife's on the phone.
- Says it's an emergency.
- Excuse me.
Carol, what-
Whoa, calm down, honey.
What do you mean?
Web chat with-
What 14-year-old girl?
Carol, I would nev-
No, I don't have a criminal record!
Who is Mitch Conner?
There can't be an official police report, honey.
There's no
- No, Carol, put down the gun!
Sweetie, come on, put down the-
Carol?
Carol!
I'm not fat.
I'm big-boned.
Thank you for coming, parents.
We've called you in because we've had a little incident at the school.
The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
Oh, dear.
Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.
Did they measure from the base or from the balls?
How does the school let things like this happen?
Now, now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing.
We simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
I'm a scientist.
I think it's best I handle this.
Hello, students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday.
How do a man and woman make a baby?
Anybody?
A man and a woman, what do they do to make a baby?
How about the little girl in the brown coat.
- Yeah, you.
- They have sex?
Good!
The man puts his penis, okay, into the woman's vagina.
Okay, now sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is is actually important.
But is it?
When you boys measured your penis length, the truth is, it doesn't really matter.
What does matter is... length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared.
Okay?
When we are talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure.
We need a scale and a protractor as well.
Let's look at it on the graph here.
Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.
I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.
We didn't make any effort.
We didn't have a choice!
Yeah, this is bullshit!
Together, we're gonna learn what makes us angry, okay, and how to better deal with it so we don't get our ourselves into trouble anymore.
So lame.
Why doesn't everyone just die?
Look, if a somebody order the City Beef and complain because they say they order the City Shrimp, it's not a my fault he gets City Chicken poured all over his fucking head!
We have good reason to be angry!
This country is going to shit!
We have exactly 12 days before the oil is gone, and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!
Right, see, what we all need to do is channel our various reasons for anger and learn to control it.
Man, this shit is wack, mah.
I just seen all this shit frontin', mah.
I don't understand; it's like pops ain't no fucking good, mah.
Bitch be callin', be tappin' that shit, mah.
Why the fuck am I here?
Well, Eric, because I know you want to control your anger and become a better person.
You saying I got problems like these fucking people?
No, no!
I'm not saying that at all.
Please, I'm just saying how amazing you are for wanting to lessen some of your more less awesome attributes.
Oh, that's cool.
And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle, or the- what do we call it again?
The yaw, the yaw of the shaft.
What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or T.M.I.
Any questions so far?
Yes, little girl over there.
What's a penis?
Ah, good question.
Uh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're measuring.
Okay, any other questions?
Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet.
How about you?
Could you read the first example for the class?
Example one, young lady, please read the problem out loud.
Randy has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length."
4.4 inches.
"Its angle is 32 degrees.
"Its flaccid girth is one inch in diameter.
His balls are 7 centimeters from the base."
7 centimeters.
"Randy notes that the drift of his penis
"is 4 centimeters to penis right, and its dead weight is.5 kilograms."
Great, and so divide by the 17, carry the 1, and we can see that
Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M. I, is... 6.3 inches.
Do we got that?
Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3.
So how does our example person, "Randy,"
compare to others on the T.M.I. Scale?
By referring again to the T.M.I. Chart, we see that a T.M.I. Of 6.3 is.8 inches more than the national average.
Okay, what we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger.
Daniel, could you stand up, please?
What makes you the angriest, Daniel?
Stupid ass blind liberals!
Okay, great.
Chase, could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid ass blind liberal.
And what makes you angriest, Chase?
Scrawny-ass sissies!
Okay, Daniel is a scrawny-ass sissy.
He just cut in front of you in line at the bank.
- Go!
- Hey!
What, you think I got a small dick, huh?
I don't have a small penis!
My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!
Okay.
Uh, why don't we do some role-playing now with Wayne D, who gets angriest at his mom?
Gretchen, could you play Wayne D's mom for us.
Yo, bitch!
You think you bad.
Just 'cause you a mom don't mean I can't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mah!
I may be female on the outside, but I still have a bigger penis than you!
I don't have a small penis.
Don't say that!
It isn't true!
It isn't true!
That's enough!
I'm sick of everyone talk about penis size!
Yeah, it doesn't matter!
It doesn't matter!
Does everyone here have an issue with their penis size?
- No.
- Nope.
- Not me.
- Nah, mah shit be packin', mah.
My penis is 13 inches long!
Hmm.
Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnoud, and I'm an actual doctor of human sexuality and behavior.
Unfortunately, you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days, and I am here to set things straight.
Thank God.
I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually length times girth over angle of the shaft, divided by mass over width.
Ugh!
Unh!
We all want to welcome our new member, Randy.
Say hi to everyone, Randy.
Oh, suck it, all of you!
Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy.
Why don't you share what's bothering you?
You don't just go around changing math.
Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?
God damn right!
Socialist fascists!
Power to the people!
Burn it down!
Burn it down!
Mr. Marsh, this is what we're here to try and work on, okay?
No, dude, fuck you!
We're burnin' this shit!
If you take a minute to think about your anger and-
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Yeah!
- Yeah, dude!
Mah, that shit be burnin' and shit, mah!
Unh!
Yeah!
Welcome to FedEx.
How can I help you today?
Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.
All righty, let's see what kind of-
Burn it down!
Burn it down, dude!
- Huh!
Huh!
- Aah!
Oh, no!
Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express!
Tom, I'm standing outside the FedEx in Fairplay, Colorado, where a radical political group has taken several people hostage.
They call themselves the Pissed Off and Angry Party, and they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
This is a call to all angry people!
We've had enough!
We're gonna hit the government where it hurts, right in the Federal Express!
What exactly are you angry about?
We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media control, and-
- And Jews!
- Yeah, Jews!
And all the stuff that the government's doing!
You've got a lot of people scared.
What are your demands?
Well, first of all, we want that Surgeon General to step down!
- Yeah!
- And we want-
And we wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
Yeah, we wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
And, um-
And my mom gotta stop trippin', mah.
Bitch be trippin' all the time, mah!
Yeah, we want our moms to stop trippin, man, 'cause them bitches be trippin all the time!
And I think that- uh, is that it?
No, and fuck Kyle!
Oh, yeah, and fuck Kyle!
Surgeon general's resignation,
Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin, and fuck Kyle.
You got that?
Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!
Does it bother you that the Federal Express is not affiliated at all with the federal government?
No.
No, that doesn't matter.
Fuck!
Really?
Butters, what are you doing?
Homework!
I just don't get it!
That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average!
I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I.,
I have a micropenis!
Your T.M. I?
I don't understand it.
I'm startin'...
- I'm startin' to feel angry!
Argh!
Butters, put your clothes on!
Oh, what's the point, mom?
What's the point of life, anyways?
All you do is yell at me!
And the government, it's just lead by fascists!
And everyone's a Justin Beiber wannabe!
I wanna go and drive a Hummer.
That's what I wanna do!
I wanna drive a car that goes "vram vram vram!"
Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small?
Hey, everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America!
Join the fight!
We're gonna take down the Federal Expresses, the American Apparels, and the American Furniture Warehouse!
We are fed up, and we've had enough!
Surgeon General, 12 more FedEx's have been taken over.
The Pissed Off and Angry Party is gaining more support.
They've shut down American Airlines and American Apparels all over the country.
We have to ask you to step down.
Are you seriously saying we're going to give in to their demands?
They are all really angry.
We have to make them stop.
Is the team standing by to fuck that little boy Kyle?
Team is standing by, Sir.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Let me through!
Who is this?
Surgeon General, I believe I know why this is happening.
I have found a direct correlation between anger and T.M.I.
Anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw.
Look, we all get angry, but when someone is consistently angry, or always finding new reasons to be angry, it means they have a very, very, very, very small dick.
Your theory is fine, Doctor, but it doesn't matter.
The T.M.I. Equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Isn't there?
Isn't... there?
We've waited long enough, Randy!
Let's start killing these sons a bitches!
No, please!
Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want.
Yo, let's cap these bitches, mah.
Let's cap and leave 'em in the back of the buildin', mah.
Hey, come over here.
Look.
We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the Surgeon General.
Fellow Americans, as you all know, the T.M.I. Scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk.
The established equation is 100 percent accurate.
- Argh!
- Shh!
However, due to recently collected data, we are making one change.
The national average for penis length is now officially moved from 6 inches to 1.5 inches.
Anyone with a T.M.I. Of over 1.5 inches is considered above average.
* The winds of change are blowin' *
* There's excitement in the air *
* Can you feel it?
*
* It's electric and magical *
* The happy train's on track *
* Because America is back *
* Yeah!
*
* Woo-hoo!
Come on!
*
Wait, what?
* America is back *
* America is back *
Wait!
According to that scale,
I still have a small wiener!
* America is back *
I'm still fucking angry!
* Back and we're back and we're back *
* We're so back, we're so back *
* Back back back back back *
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago, meaning Terminator could be his own father, and then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him!
No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator five, that really happened.
Skeletor's real?
No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
Skeletor's a lady?
God dammit!
Who the fuck do they think they are?
This is the last fucking straw!
I am going to fucking kill everybody!
Hey, Eric!
I am so sick of this fucking schooooool!
This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone too far this time!
You get in trouble again, Cartman?
No!
I didn't do a damn thing.
Nothing!
I told you this school is a den of snakes!
You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
Dude, we're just trying to eat.
Oh, you think I'm just over reacting again, huh.
No, not this time!
The school has gone too far and it affects each and every one of you!
You remember the school physical we all took last week?
Yeah.
Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
No, they didn't.
Yeah, they fucking did, Kyle!
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
Because they don't fucking care!
I've told you this!
They don't give a shit about the students and they live to make us miserable!
That doesn't make any sense.
Go look for yourselves!
There, you see?
Can you fucking believe it?
Is that really all our wiener sizes?
Yeah, dude!
Look at it!
It says right there.
Eric Cartman 1.2 inches.
Why would they tell everybody that?
They wanna measure my wiener, fine, but don't put me on blast!
Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches.
Yeah, that's about right.
Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches.
Is that good?
How big do they say mine is?
I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
You're right, they really seem into it, mkay.
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches.
That doesn't seem right.
No shit, Sherlock!
My dick isn't 1.4 inches either.
It isn't.
This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
A conspiracy?
They're trying to stir up some big thing again!
Get all the girls all heated up and freaking out over with boy has the biggest shlong!
This has to be dealt with!
Well everyone's already seen it.
Nothing we can do about it now.
Oh, there's something we can do about it, all right.
If they're gonna put us on blast, they are at least getting the numbers right.
We are going to re-measure!
All right.
Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.
You see witnesses?
That's .2 inches more than what the school said.
All right.
Nice one, Clyde.
All right, next.
Whip it out, butters.
Ooh, it's a little chilly in here.
All right, butters, let's see what you got going on down there.
Hey, wait, the cold is makin' it shrink some.
Where you goin' little feller?
Butters, I don't have time for this.
I can't wait if your wiener is pullin' a scared turtle.
Hang on, he's comin' back out.
There he is!
Who's a little guy.
All right, butters.
Looks like we have 2 point ... wow ... 2.4 inches.
Really nice, butters.
I'm hung like a horse!
All right, that's everybody!
Let's go post these numbers!
What?
Didn't you forget something?
What, Kyle?
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
I measured mine this morning.
See?
It's right here at the top.
13.7 inches?
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Your wiener is not thirteen inches long!
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses.
You have to too.
Well, what are you guys gonna do, use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?
Are you homos?
You just did that to everybody in class!
Okay, fine, whatever.
Go ahead!
Yeah, that's good.
A little higher on Craig's side.
Yeah.
Actual boy's penis sizes?
Gross!
You see?
My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!
What red?
You all freakin' out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys?
I don't care!
Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement and for this poster to be put up at all?
Don't forget that this was all my idea!
Eric Cartman to the principal's office.
Immediately.
Oh God dammit!
Let me guess, I'm in trouble again!
You're darn right, Eric.
For what?
Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?
Why did you measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?

I don't care if Obama is president!
You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world lengths of their dicks!
Wait.
Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physicals?

Sorry, doctor.
Your wife's on the phone.
Says it's an emergency.
Excuse me.
Carol, what ... whoa, calm down, honey.
What do you mean?
Web chat with what... what fourteen year old girl?
Carol, I would never!
No, I don't have a criminal record!
Who is Mitch Conner?
There can't be an official police report, honey, there's no ... no, Carol put down the gun!
Sweetie, put down the ...
Carol?

If a somebody order the city beef, and a complain because they say they ordered the city s shrimp it's not a my fault he gets a city chicken poured all over his head!
We have good reason to be angry!
This country is going to shit!
We have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!
Right.
See, what we all need to do is channel our various reasons for anger and learn to control it.
Man, this shit is whack, mah.
I just seen all this shit front in, mah.
Don't understand what it's like my pops.
Ain't no mother good, mah, bitch be coming.
I be tappin that shit, mah.
Why am I here?
Well, Eric, because I know you want to control your anger and become a better person.
You saying I got problems like these people?
No!
No, I'm not saying that at all.
Please, I'm just saying how amazing you are for wanting to lessen some of your more less awesome attributes.
Oh, that's cool.
And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the ... what do we call it again?
The yaw, the yaw of the shaft, what we finally get is the adjusted penis size or t.M.I.
Any questions so far?
Yes, little girl over there.
What's a penis?
Ah, good question.
Uh, the penis, is the thing we are talking about that boys' have that we're measuring.
Okay.
Any other questions?
Okay.
So then let's move on to the example on your study sheet.
How about you, could you read the first example for the class?
Example one, young lady, please read the problem out loud.
Example one: 'Randy' has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.
4.4 inches.
Its angle is 32 degrees.
Its flaccid girth is 1 inch in diameter.
His balls are 7 centimeters from the base.
Seven centimeters.
Randy notes that the drift of his penis is 4 centimeters to penis right and its dead weight is .5 kilograms.
Great.
And so, divide by the 17, carry the one and we can see that 'Randy's' adjusted penis size, or TMI, is 6.3 inches.
Do we got that?
Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3.
So how does our example person 'Randy' compare to others on the TMI scale?
By referring again to the TMI chart, we see that a TMI of 6.3 is.
8 inches more than the national average.
Okay.
What we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger.
Daniel, could you stand up, please.
What makes you the angriest, Daniel?
Stupid ass blind liberals!
Okay, great.
Chase, could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid ass blind liberal.
And what makes you angriest, chase?
Skrawny ass sissies!
Okay, Daniel is a skrawny ass sissy.
He just cut in front of you in line at the bank.
Go!
Hey!
What, you think, I got a small dick?
Huh?
I don't have a small penis!
My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!
Okay.
Uh, why don't we do some role playing now with Wayne d who gets angriest at his mom.
Gretchen, could you play Wayne d's mom for us.
You bitch!
You think you bad just cuz you a mom don't mean I won't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mah!
I may be female on the outside but I still have a bigger penis than you!
I don't have a small penis.
Don't say that!
It isn't true!
It isn't true!
That's enough!
I'm sick of everyone talking about a penis size!
Yeah, it doesn't matter!
It doesn't matter!
Does everyone here have an issue with their penis size?
No.
Nope.
Not me.
Nah mah, my shit be packin', mah.
My penis is thirteen inches long!
Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnoud and I'm an actual doctor of human sexuality and behavior.
Unfortunately, you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days and I am here to set things straight.
Thank God.
I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width.
Vou damn n montaire!
We all nt to welcome our new member, Randy.
Say hi to everyone, randi.
Oh suck it, all of you!
Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy.
Why don't you share what's bothering you.
You don't just go around changing math.
Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?
God damn right!
Socialist fascists!
Power to the people!
Burn it down!
Burn it down!
Mr. marsh, this is what we are here to try and work on, okay.
No dude, we're burnin' this shit!
If you take a minute to think about your anger ... yeah, dude!
Mah, that shit be burnin n shit mah!
Welcome to fed ex, how can I help you today?
Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.
Alright, let's see what kind of ... burn it down!
Burn it down, dude!
Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their federal express!
Tom, I'm standing outside the fedex in fairplay, Colorado where a radical political group has taken several people hostage.
They call themselves 'the pissed off and angry party' and they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
This is a call to all angry people!
We've had enough!
We're gonna hit the government where it hurts!
Right in the federal express!
What exactly are you angry about?
We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media control, and ... and Jews!
Yeah, and Jews and all the stuff that the government's doing!
You've got a lot of people scared.
What are your demands?
Well, first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
And we want ... and we wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
Yeah.
We wanna see Obama's real birth certificate!
And, uhmm ... and my mom gotta stop trippin mah.
Bitch be trippin' all the time, mah!
Yeah, we want our mom's to stop trippin, man, cuz them bitches be trippin all the time!
And I think that ... is that it?
No, and Kyle!
Oh, yeah and Kyle!
Surgeon general's resignation,
Obama's real birth certificate, mom's to stop trippin and Kyle.
You got that?
Or else we're gonna bring the federal express to a grinding halt!
Does it bother you that the federal express is not affiliated at all with the federal government?
No!
No, that doesn't matter.
Really?
Butters, what are you doing?
Homework!
I just don't get it!
That is the fourth time I've calculated!
And it's below average!
I thought I was hung, but according to my TMI I have a micropenis!
Your TMI?
I don't understand it.
I'm startin' ...
I'm startin to feel angry!
Butters, put your clothes on!
Oh, what's the point, mom?
What's the point of life anyways?
All you do is yell at me!
And the government!
It's lead by fascists!
And everyone's a Justin Bieber wanna be!
I wanna go and drive a hummer.
That's what I wanna do!
I wanna drive a car that goes vram vram vram!
Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small?
Hey!
Everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America!
Join the fight!
We're gonna take down the federal expresses!
The American apparels!
And the American furniture warehouse!
We are fed up and we've had enough!
Surgeon general, twelve more fedexs have been taken over, the pissed off and angry party is gaining more support.
They've shut down American airlines and American apparels all over the country.
We have to ask you to step down.
Are you seriously saying we're going to give into their demands?
They are all really angry.
We have to make them stop.
Is the team standing by to that little boy 'Kyle'?
Team is standing by, sir.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Let me through!
Who is this?
Surgeon general, I believe I know why this is happening.
I have found a direct correlation between anger and TMI.
Anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw.
Look, we all get angry, but when someone is consistently angry, or always finding new reasons to be angry it means they have a very, very, very, very small dick.
Your theory is fine, doctor, but it doesn't matter.
The TMI equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Isn't there?
Isn't there?
We've waited long enough, Randy!
Let's start killing these sons a bitches!
No, please!
Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want.
Yo, let's cap these bitches, mah.
Let's cap 'em 'n leave 'em in the back a the buildin', mah.
Hey, come over here!
Look!
We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general.
Fellow Americans, as you all know the TMI scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk.
The established equation is 100 percent accurate.
However, due to recently collected data we are making one change.
The national average for penis length is now officially moved, from six inches to 1.6 inches.
Anyone with a TMI of over 1.5 inches is considered 'above average.'
the winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it?
It's electric and magical the happy train's on track because America is back.
Come on!
Wait, what?
America is back!
America is back!
Wait, according to that scale,
I still have a small wiener.
America is back!
I'm still fucking angry!
And we're back!
Previously on The Secret Life of the American Teenager...
I love sleeping over here.
I want you and John to live here.
It's not going to bring her back, hiding here in the condo.
I can find another place to stay.
Grace isn't even in the house.
I never thought she'd actually go to Zimbabwe.
Adrian and Ben are not going to split up.
If anything, they're closer than ever, having been through what they've been through.
Well, what about Ricky?
Is he letting you move in to keep himself from Adrian?
Is there any way you could drop by our condo today and see if Adrian will let you in to talk to her?
She has to talk to someone other than me.
I want to talk to you about something.
Why would you be looking for another job?
It's time to make I just think a change in my life.
I know it must be really tough, Adrian.
Yeah, it is.
Do you still have feelings for Adrian?
Feeling sorry for her is dangerous.
I'm here with Rachel.
We were just discussing her moving into the guest house.
Being married and having a baby in high school is scary.
Not as scary as holding your stillborn daughter in your arms.
Don't say it out loud.
I don't want to be married.
Me neither.
But we can't do anything about it.
Leo.
I know you still miss her.
It's just, uh...
It's okay.
And losing that baby must be so difficult for you and Ben.
It's got to be so painful.
I just feel so terrible for you both.
But I gotta say, I feel even worse for Adrian.
It's just that I think about
Sarah when I see Ben like he is.
He's in a really bad place.
Which is not to say I don't feel terrible for Adrian, too, who I guess is in a worse place.
I don't know.
Maybe I could go over there again tomorrow and see if there was something I could do for her, to bring her mood up.
All right, well, you better get to bed.
I'll, uh...
I'll be up in a minute.
Don't you want to come upstairs with me now?
I bet you I could get your mood up.
I'm sure, but I've got a lot on my mind.
Camille quit today and I gotta go over my schedule for tomorrow and the rest of the week.
I gotta take care of some business.
What?
Camille quit?
Why didn't you tell me?
I mean, when did that happen?
I got home and Ben was here, and I didn't get a chance to tell you.
Tomorrow, I'll get an assistant from marketing or I'll get a temp or something until I can find someone.
Oh, no, you won't!
No, cause I'm going to get up bright and early.
And I'm going to go in with you.
I can do anything that Camille can do, if not more.
You won't believe how smart I am.
What time do we leave?
I mean, I've always wanted to do something like this, be an assistant to a big, important man like yourself.
What time did you say?
That's really nice of you to offer, great at the job, Betty, and I'm sure you'd be hey, how great Would it be that I get and to work with my wife, huh?
But the most important thing you could do for me tomorrow, is to take care of Ben.
And if you want to go by the condo and visit with Adrian,
I know he'll appreciate it.
And so would I.
Okay, well, if that's what you want, consider it done.
Good night.
Where do you think she is?
It's a little cold out here, don't you think?
I'm okay.
I don't know where she is, Adrian.
I don't think there's any way of knowing.
Do you think she exists in some way, or something?
In some other dimension
I like to think so, yeah.
I like to think that the people we've known are all somewhere that's nice and safe and, uh, warm.
And that maybe they're looking down on us, we don't know about, in some way that taking care of us can't know about.
She's just a baby,
Who's taking care of her?
An innocent, little baby.
I can't stand to think that she has no one,
That she's alone or crying or something.
Yeah.
I know, Adrian.
I have those horrible thoughts sometimes, too, taking care of her.
That my mom is but I like to think you're my wife And you know what,
And I have to take care of you, too.
What do you say?
Let's go inside.
I love you, Ben.
I love you too, Adrian.
Amy moved in with Ricky, you know.
I didn't know.
Yeah, she told me, today.
Is that what upset you?
No, Ben.
Losing the baby, that's what upset me.
Hi.
What are you doing?
Eh, I needed a project, thought I'd do some updating.
You're gonna update my house?
This is my house.
Is it?
Yeah, you got the business,
I got the house.
You gave me the house.
I own the house, you're just living here.
Yeah, well, while I'm living here, alone,
I thought I'd make the house better, just like I made the business better.
The store has never done this well.
Yeah, I know.
I'm giving you a lot of business.
Or Donovan, anyway.
He has this upholsterer who's a genius...
Yeah, you can thank me later.
And you know, you can't update in here without showing me what you're doing.
I'll show you when I figure it out.
You haven't figured it out, yet?
It looks like you might be doing some demolition.
I might be.
No, George, no demolition.
Not without a plan.
A plan that I've seen and approved.
And even then, not while you're watching Robie.
You said that I could bring Robie by.
Did you forget?
Did you forget?
No, I didn't forget.
I thought it could be a father and son thing.
Come here, my man.
Yay!
Well, it'll have to be a father, son and mother thing because I have to know what you two are doing.
Okay, I gotta go.
I'm gonna be back by three.
I wanna miss all the traffic.
I don't want to turn a two-hour drive into a four.
Hey, are you okay?
You seem a little off.
I'm fine.
Well, you don't seem fine.
Are you angry at someone?
At me?
I'm annoyed with Amy.
She moved in with Ricky.
Well, I think we knew that that was gonna happen.
No, we didn't.
We knew it might happen, we hoped it wouldn't happen, didn't we?
Well, I guess we're just going to have to see if it's a good thing or a bad thing.
I don't know.
Did she tell you she was moving in?
No.
But she told me that she was spending practically every night there.
You know, they were already having sex, if that's what was bothering you.
I realize that, but they were not living together, and now they are.
I found this out when Ruben came over for a drink last night.
I saw him when I pulled up in the driveway and made the mistake of...
Did you just look at your watch?
I have to go, George.
I'm sorry.
Look, I don't know what you're so upset about.
We knew that this was happening, it was just a matter of time.
A matter of not enough time.
Go, just go.
Hey, did you hear from Ashley last night?
No, did you?
I got a text from her.
And that was not our agreement.
Yeah, I know that.
Okay, bye, Robie.
I'll see you boys later.
Don't do anything without a plan, a plan that I've seen and approved.
Bye.
Don't listen to her.
You listen to me.
I'm a grown man and I say, "We can do whatever we want."
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So what do you wanna bust up first?
Oh.
Hey, I'm reporting in.
You were supposed to report in last night.
But we drove 12 hours yesterday and it was late when we stopped.
What are the rules, Ashley?
I have to call you every night.
Day one and you broke the rules.
I told you it was late.
I didn't want to wake you up.
There's nothing in the rules that says if it's too late, you don't call.
You call every night, all right?
No matter how early or late it is, you got that?
- I got that.
- What are the other rules?
Are you breaking any of the other rules?
The rules are we have to stay in the same room, separate beds, no sex.
No drugs.
No alcohol.
No driving after 9:00.
Don't let the gas tank get below a half a tank.
No speeding.
No tornado chasing.
No hanging my arms or feet out the windows.
Uh, Toby is not allowed to pee on the side of the road.
And I'm not allowed to go to the restroom at truck stops.
Should I keep going?
No.
So, how far did you get?
What city you in?
I don't know.
I think it's called Kingman.
Kingman?
Kingman is like a couple of hours away.
Well, we didn't go on the freeway.
Still.
You can't be in Kingman.
It doesn't take a whole day to get to Kingman.
Oh, we stopped at this town and fed donkeys.
Yeah, and?
It was educational.
You fed donkeys all day, and that was educational?
Yeah.
How is that educational, Ashley?
Clark Gable and Carole Lombard stayed in the hotel there on their honeymoon.
Are you talking about Oatman?
Oatman is where Olive Oatman was given back to the US Army by the Mojave Indians.
Oh, I didn't know.
She was taken by the Yavapai and held captive, and then traded to the Mojave.
I had no idea.
Well, now you do.
Well, we're not going back there, so what difference does it make?
You're supposed to be learning something.
I did.
I learned where Clark Gable and
Carol Lombard went on their honeymoon.
And I have to go now.
Sorry.
Okay, well, call me tonight, and tell Toby to drive safely today, and you two pay more attention to where you are and what you're seeing.
All right.
Bye, Dad.
- I love you, Ashley.
- Love you, too.
Your dad wasn't too happy, was he?
Apparently Donkey Town had some historical significance that we missed.
Come on.
Let's get on the freeway.
Freeway?
I thought we were taking old Route 66.
That's what I mapped out, old Route 66.
That's not the freeway.
I don't even know where the freeway is.
It's the red line that goes from the West Coast to the East Coast.
Yeah, I don't know how to get to the red line.
That's the 10.
We're nowhere near the 10 freeway.
We'll just figure it out.
My dad thinks we're moving too slow.
So do I.
Oh, another day of cheap sexual innuendo?
Sorry, couldn't help myself.
We're going to miss a lot of good stuff if we get on the freeway, you know.
All right.
Well, you're driving, you decide.
Dad?
Hey.
Hey, you needed something?
Yeah, I needed something.
What do you need?
I have school.
Where were you last night?
I came home and no one was here.
Oh, I was over at uh, you know, the apartment.
So, it's gone from Ricky's apartment to the apartment?
No, no, it's still Ricky's apartment.
I was just using a more neutral term, I guess, "The apartment."
More neutral than what?
Well, Ricky calls it "Our apartment,"
Not that it's our apartment, 'cause it's really "His apartment."
But you're living there, at his apartment?
I don't know if I would say living there.
Who said I was living there?
Ashley?
I heard from the neighbors.
Sure you did.
What neighbors?
Ruben.
Who heard it from his wife.
Who heard it from their daughter.
- Oh.
- Yeah, "Oh."
Well, I have been staying over there.
But you knew that.
But now you're not just staying over there, you're living over there.
Well, "Staying" Sounds so, like, low class, so, yeah, I prefer to say "Living."
No matter what you call it, living together unmarried, that is low class.
You're the one who said it and you're right, it's low class.
Weren't you and Mom just living together and not married just a short time ago?
We were.
And you see how that worked out?
Yeah, I'm sorry that it didn't work out.
I had hoped that it would.
Do you hope things will work out with Ricky and me?
I've told you more than once that it won't work out if you just move in there without any kind of commitment.
But I guess I lost that argument long time ago when you started staying over there.
So I guess I don't understand why you're so upset then.
I'm upset because of the way I heard about this.
If you and Ricky make any more bad decisions,
I'd like to know first.
I don't like getting bad news from the neighbors, especially Ruben.
I can't believe he'd be so concerned with my personal life.
Why would he tell you that I'm living over there?
Why not?
You are, aren't you?
And he just assumed I knew, you know, since I'm your father, and you were living here before you were living there.
Do we have to make such a big deal out of this?
It's really not that big of a deal.
Do we have to make a big deal out of you and my grandson living with your boyfriend?
Are you kidding?
No?
And Ricky's not just my boyfriend, he's John's father.
I thought maybe if the two of you like being with each other so much, that maybe you'd get engaged.
And you'd stay engaged through college, and then after you graduate college, then you'd get married, and then you'd actually move in with each other.
- Really?
- Really.
You're just not old enough or mature enough to be living together on your own.
We're not old enough or mature enough to have a two-year-old son either.
No, you're not, but just because you have John doesn't mean you have to raise him together, unmarried, in the same apartment.
I know that but that's what we want to do.
Dad, Ricky's going to be in college next year, and I'm going to be a senior.
So?
So?
So we're young, but we're very mature.
Yeah, sure you are.
Okay, fine, I don't know.
Maybe, we're not.
But like I told Ashley yesterday,
I'm happy.
I'm really happy, okay?
So, please, just let me be happy.
Please.
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you, Dad.
Well, Amy, the door is always open.
You know that.
When it doesn't work out, the door is always open.
You can always come home.
If it does work out, will the door be open?
I love you, Dad.
I love you too, Amy.
In the blink of an eye.
***
How lousy I feel right now has nothing to do with what's going on with Ricky and Amy.
I mean, so they're living together?
So what?
That has nothing to do with Ben and me and what happened to us.
I know, but it must be hard.
I mean, you and Ricky were really close and Amy knows that and Amy knows how hard everything is for you now.
I just don't know why it happened.
I can't figure out why it happened, Grace.
Oh, Adrian, I don't think there's a why.
I mean, there's no why.
It just happened, things just happen.
I wish I was there to give you a hug.
I mean, it'll be okay, you just need time.
Thank you.
Thank you for saying that.
No one seems to understand that.
I mean, everyone's in such a hurry for me to just go back to the way things were and just do the same things I was doing before this happened.
But going back to the way things were seems like, I don't know, like, like I'm not honoring my little girl.
Adrian, that's sad.
But maybe the best way to honor her is to just get back out there and live your life in a way that honors her.
Maybe you could do something like a good deed in her name or something.
You mean like volunteering to help in Africa?
I have to go.
How was Grace?
Grace was Grace.
Have a good day at school.
What'd she say?
Nothing.
She said something that upset you.
I can tell.
You know, your two best friends don't seem to know how to be your best friends.
It's not just them, it's everyone.
Including me?
No, Ben, not including you.
Bye.
Dad?
How are you this morning?
Why?
Why?
What's going on?
What do you mean what's going on?
I'm just calling to see how you're doing.
Oh, okay, sorry.
I misread something in your voice.
Okay, there is something going on.
Look, yesterday I didn't get a chance to tell you this, and there's really no reason I would tell you this, but Camille quit.
Are you kidding?
Why would she quit?
I guess after 25 years of me, she's had enough.
But that's not the problem.
Well, no, that's a huge problem.
She was like your second wife.
No she's not.
I can replace her.
She can be replaced.
And you're calling to tell me this?
Not exactly.
The thing is,
Betty has offered to come in and work with me today.
That's funny.
No, that's not funny.
But that can't happen.
It could happen.
It's not going to because she'd rather come over there and visit with Adrian today.
Bad idea.
We don't know that.
No, we do know that.
Did you send her over here instead of going over to your office?
Look, all she just wants to do is drop by there this afternoon, and that's better than her spending all day at the office with me.
I have a business to run.
Well, yeah, I have a wife that's a little depressed.
My life isn't easy either.
Look, maybe those two could have a bite to eat, an early dinner.
And then you and I will go out, have an early dinner too and we'll talk.
I don't know if Adrian will let Betty come over.
Then let Betty handle it.
Betty's going to call her and ask her if she can come over.
Ben?
Amy moved in with Ricky.
So?
It was such a stupid thing to say to her, and I try to be so careful of what I say, but I just said the wrong thing anyway.
So, could you just go by there and make sure she's okay?
Grace, I don't think Adrian would want me to just drop by there.
And I don't think what you said is totally unreasonable.
In fact, I think it was pretty good advice.
I just, I don't think Adrian wants to hear any advice, right now.
You can go see her as soon as you get back.
About that.
Here's what I'm thinking.
This is a really long way to come for just two weeks.
That's why I told you doing something like this would be better in the summer when school's out.
Yeah, but the opportunity presented itself now, and I'm really glad that I came here.
It's amazing.
I just, I hate to leave so soon.
Yet, you're going to have to because you have to finish the school year.
The counselor said,"Two weeks,"
And I agree.
So it's two weeks, honey.
And besides, Jeff is only helping out that group for a couple of more weeks and then he's moving on to his new job and you can't just go with him.
But he said I could if I wanted.
Well, why don't you tell him to call me about that when he gets a chance.
And...
Don't you miss me?
Honey, don't you miss your family here?
Hey, Grace.
Hi, Jack.
Hey, I'm sorry about the move, but I talked to Grant and he's cool with it, so I don't think it's gonna be a problem.
You hadn't told her?
No.
I'll be back.
I was just making my lunch, and I need to grab some mayonnaise.
What move?
Where's he moving?
And why's he moving?
Mom, please do not tell me it's because you're letting
Tom's girlfriend move into the guest house.
Mom, you can't be serious about that.
Grace, when she explained her situation to me, I just couldn't say no.
And, honey, Tom is so happy.
He really is.
So I told Jack he could move into the house and take Tom's old room until school's out.
Don't do that face.
That's not attractive, Grace.
Grace!
Who told your dad you moved in?
Who do you think?
I think Ashley.
Well, we don't know that for sure.
Yeah, we do.
He didn't say that.
He wouldn't say that.
I'm going to talk to her the next time she calls.
Uh, she probably won't call us.
She'll call.
Or I'll call her.
You and I will call her.
You want me to talk to your dad?
No, I do not want you to talk to my dad.
Just let it alone.
He'll get over it.
I knew when you told me you told her that she was going to say something.
That's why I don't want you saying anything to Adrian.
I know that.
I know that you don't want me to say anything to Adrian.
Although, you know, uh, my dad could say something to Ruben, because, you know, they're friends, and then Ruben could say something and...
I have to go.
I'll see you at home.
***
Yeah.
Good morning.
Have you seen Amy?
I need to talk to her.
Unless you have some objection.
I'm not too happy with her.
Because?
I'll just take that up with Amy.
Why do you always do that?
Ask if you can speak to Amy, like she's my property or something.
You want to speak to Amy, speak to Amy.
But right now, you're talking to me.
We're just talking here.
What's going on?
I just don't think that Amy should have said anything about you two living together to Adrian.
It's a little soon to be rubbing your cohabiting bliss in her face, don't you think?
You know Amy stays at the apartment, so does Adrian.
Yeah, but that's different, staying over there and living over there.
That seems to be the general opinion.
Either way, it's not really anyone's business.
Amy made it Adrian's business.
She told her.
Look, I sent her over there to try to cheer Adrian up.
You know, to bring a little bit of light to her dark day and instead she tells her about you two living together.
Why would Adrian care?
You think at a time like this
Adrian wants to hear about you and Amy and John all living happily ever after in the little apartment above my family's butcher shop like it's some sort of freaking fairy tale?
Look, no wonder Adrian doesn't want anyone to come over and visit.
Everyone's completely insensitive and just oblivious to the fact that she's heartbroken and in a lot of pain.
Let's walk outside, out of earshot from the entire school, all right?
I'm going to be straight with you.
I think you're the one who's upset about Amy moving in with me, not Adrian, because I think you want out of that relationship.
And before you say anything,
I'm going to give you some advice whether you want it or not.
You've been trying to get everyone to give Adrian advice, you take some advice.
From a guy who's been there.
I did not want to be with Amy when I found out she was pregnant,
I didn't even want to be with her when she had John.
It took a long time, a very long time to get to know her, and for things to change between us.
I wanted to run.
And I know you want to run.
But you can't.
You can't right now.
And you know that.
Just wait it out, Ben.
Just wait it out.
You might feel differently in another year or two.
Things might get better between you and Adrian.
You got married for the wrong reasons, maybe you'll stay together for the right reasons.
But even if things don't get better, even if you and Adrian split up, you and Amy, that's over.
Me and Adrian, that's over.
I'm in love with Amy, and
I'm gonna be with her for the rest of my life.
And only with her.
If I do leave Adrian, you'll feel even sorrier for her than you do now.
Way too sorry for her not to sleep with her.
You've changed, but you haven't changed that much.
Yeah, we know each other a little too well at this point, don't we?
Excuse me?
Madison, you felt the same way when
I moved into the guest house, and nothing happened.
We're not going to get back together.
I'm going to live in Tom's old room until graduation, and then I'm going to Arizona to stay with my parents and then I'm going off to school.
Where are you going to school?
Have you decided yet?
I want to be near my parents.
I'll probably go to Arizona.
I see.
Even if you get a full scholarship to a school that's right here.
I miss my parents.
I want to live at home and go to school.
I miss them.
You miss them?
Aren't you going to miss me?
You're one year behind me.
You can come to Arizona next year.
It'll be one year of us driving back and forth and then we'll be at the same school again.
Oh.
Okay.
I still don't like your living in the house in the bedroom next to Grace.
But if in the end, I win, I'm okay with that.
I'm an idiot.
I completely lied to him.
I can't believe I did that.
It just happened so quickly, and then I realized it was wrong, and I couldn't stop myself and...
So go find him right now and say you didn't want him to be upset with you, you panicked, you lied and you're sorry you told Adrian and you should have told him.
Why did I do that?
You know, even if I admit to lying, it's still not going to change the fact that I lied.
I don't want to mess anything up.
I just moved in there.
I love living there.
I love Ricky and John and me as a family.
Then get out there and do what you got to do.
And do it quickly, don't wait.
Amy, I need to talk to you.
Do it.
I'm going to call Bunny and tell her I'm going to be late for work today.
I wanna go over and talk to your dad.
I don't want him to be upset with me and I think
I should just go over there and face him.
Look, Ricky...
Yeah?
I asked you to just leave it alone and I want you to just leave it alone, okay?
He's my dad and I think I know better than you what to do here.
All right, I gave you a chance to tell me and you didn't take it.
I know you're lying.
Ben told me you told Adrian you moved in.
You said you weren't going to do that.
And I said if you did do that, it would be a problem.
Now it's a problem.
Hey Amy.
Hey there, John.
Come here.
How was your day, buddy?
Hmm.
My day wasn't that great either.
I asked your mom not to do something and she did it anyway.
Then she lied about it.
Don't tell him bad stuff about me.
I don't tell him bad stuff about you.
No?
No, I don't.
Sorry, that was my way of trying to get an apology.
You baited me, Ricky.
You knew I lied and then you set me up to lie again.
Oh, so it's my fault?
No.
No, it's my fault.
And if you don't want to live with a liar, then I'll go home.
I'm sure my dad would be very happy for John and me to be home again.
This is your home.
Oh.
I wasn't sure.
Come on, you're sure.
I'm sorry, okay?
I don't know why I told her.
I just told her.
Okay.
I'm sorry, too.
About baiting you.
Let's go home.
Just like that?
Yeah, let's go home.
You're not even upset with me?
It's over, okay?
It's not going to work.
I don't care how happy they are right now, it's not going to work.
He got what he wanted, he's having sex with her and he didn't even have to marry her to get it.
You think they should have gotten married first?
Yeah, Alice, I do.
You know why?
Why?
Because all he wants to do is have sex with her.
He doesn't want to marry her.
He's not going to marry her.
He's not going to marry anyone.
He can't make a commitment to just be with Amy for the rest of his life.
That's ridiculous!
I mean, I'm sure Amy thinks, oh, it'll just going to be the two of them from now until eternity.
Isn't this great?
You know, just hanging out in my room.
It's like old times, isn't it?
Yeah, just like old times.
Old times.
Um, Ben, you know, Alice and I were wondering, is it too soon to ask if...
If Adrian and I are going to stay together?
You know, yesterday, I wouldn't have had an answer for you, but today, I do.
Look, I got married because I had to get married.
And no, I do not want to be married.
I just can't get out of it.
Not right now, anyway.
You know, I want to, but it wouldn't be right, right now.
Adrian is in a very bad place, and I'm not in a much better place, but as soon as anything changes, I'm running for the door.
I just admitted that to my dad last night and now that the floodgates are open,
I feel like I'm having a hard time shutting them again.
Boy, does that feel good.
I mean, I know it's just a horrible, horrible thing to admit, and I feel guilty admitting it, but boy,
I mean, phew, just a relief to say it out loud again.
We weren't going to ask if you two are staying together.
We just wanted to know if it was too soon to ask if we could visit Adrian.
Oh.
Uh, no, I don't think she's ready quite yet.
You know, Ben, I don't think I'd say anything about this stuff to anyone else.
Things could change.
Not fast enough.
I want out.
And every time I say it, I feel less guilty about it.
I hate to see you like this.
Like what?
Well, you're not Jewish, are you?
You haven't covered up all your mirrors, have you?
No.
I haven't covered the mirrors.
Well, good, 'cause Adrian,
I just don't want you to settle for looking like a tomato.
When you used to be such a hot tomato.
Is it tamale?
Is it hot tamale?
I don't think it could be tamale because tamales are thin.
I just think you should go to the gym.
I think you should just go out and go for a walk and get some of those new shoes that can make your butt tight.
There's a great salon in the neighborhood.
You could walk down there and have them do something with your hair.
Or go out and buy some clothes that fit.
If you want I can take you out on a big girl day?
We could give you just a big makeover.
Um, Betty,
I'm in mourning.
And Ben doesn't care what I look like.
Take it from a former pro, honey, he does care.
And so do you.
I don't want to hurt your feelings, but you got to do something.
I mean, you can mourn and still look good.
Just think Jackie Kennedy.
What?
Yeah.
She was married to President Kennedy.
Yeah, I know who she is, Betty.
Do you?
Well, good, 'cause you're a big mess.
You're a big hot mess.
What are you saying, I'm fat?
Yeah, that too.
But go back to the times when you were smiling.
You have such a beautiful smile.
I don't want to smile.
I don't feel like smiling.
Well, do it anyway.
What?
You're going to be okay, Adrian.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Smile.
Oh, you got something in your teeth.
See, you got it.
You're the first person who hasn't treated me like I'm going to break.
Honey, you're already broken.
What you went through,
I mean it shatters people, and you just have to put all the pieces back together again.
I don't think I can, Betty.
I don't think I can.
You can and you will.
You have to.
And you have to take a bath.
I stink, don't I?
Yeah.
I'm afraid he's going to leave me.
Ben.
I keep telling everyone he won't, but...
But I'm afraid he will, and I wouldn't blame him.
I would.
That would be a horrible thing if he just went out and did that.
I mean, when you're married, you're married.
And he was in it for better and now he's in it for worse.
Look, Adrian, if you really want to stay with Ben, there's a way you can get Ben to stay with you.
Thanks, Betty.
Oh, yeah, my pleasure.
Us Boykewich girls gotta stick together.
Well, looks like everyone is getting settled in, but I was going to have you over to eat with us, Rachel.
Oh, that's nice of you, Kathleen, but I promise,
We're not going to cause you to do any extra work.
Definitely don't want that.
Say hi to Grandma.
Hi, Grandma.
Hi, Grandma.
You're our first grandma.
Our other one died of being old.
No chance of that with this one.
Uh, Tom, maybe Ronnie and Bonnie should just call your mom Kathleen.
No, come on.
You always wanted to be a grandma, didn't you?
Well...
I do love children.
Or Mrs. Tsegaye?
Is it Kathleen?
Kathleen.
Thank you.
So we're calling Tom's mother Kathleen.
Or just Kathleen?
So, is it Grandma Kathleen?
Just Kathleen.
Okay.
Good night.
Well, it's just the two of us, so we can just eat in here.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Everything's fine.
Tom is so happy, isn't he?
He is.
For now.
Yes, he is.
And thank you for letting me stay here.
I'm sure things will be fine with Grace and Grant and me and all that.
And if things aren't so fine, then that's that.
Yeah.
That's what?
Well, that's how it goes.
So you'd be okay if they broke up?
Yeah, well, I like Grant,
They're really great.
I do, and I love his parents.
I just, I think all of you guys are so serious about each other.
A little too young to be out of high school.
I mean, you're not even do love Madison.
Yeah, but I really so in love with Madison Are you still going to be if Grace taps on your door One night and says she wants to get back together?
Did she say something?
No.
She didn't.
Oh.
Well, then, no.
"No," What?
I wouldn't want to get back together with Grace.
Grab the salad.
Hey, give me a minute to change, and we're on our way.
Take your time.
You know, uh, don't get too used to that.
You're not coming home, you know that?
I know that.
Unless...
Don't go down that road.
No, it's just that... what if she leaves me?
I was thinking,
I've already realized, Adrian realizes what I mean, what if for all the wrong reasons which is that we got married to go back home?
And what if she decides she's a very smart woman, I mean, very independent, and she was always and that could happen.
It could, but I doubt it.
And don't even think about trying to make it happen.
Is this why you're so bothered with Ricky and Amy moving in together?
Would leave you for Ricky You were hoping that Adrian and now he's not available?
Honestly, I just...
I don't like Amy living with him.
You need to give up the idea of ever getting back together with Amy, all right?
There's more than two girls in the universe, you know.
Yeah, I know.
Do you know?
Do I know what?
That there are more women out there in the universe for you, too.
I'm married to Betty.
I'm taken.
Betty is it.
And what about Camille?
What about Camille?
You're not in love with Camille?
What are you talking about, you knucklehead?
I'm not in love with Camille.
Well, apparently Camille is in love with you.
What?
That's why she quit.
Dad, of course she is.
She quit because she quit.
No, she quit because Betty came back and she's giving up.
Ridiculous.
You know that?
You're ridiculous,
You think?
You could not have possibly got him down that quickly.
He doesn't give me any problems going to bed.
Good, you can put him to bed every night.
I'm happy to put him to bed every night.
What bed?
I put the mattress on the floor for him.
He's getting too old for that.
He doesn't like the baby bed.
But he can just walk right into the kitchen.
I blocked it all off and No, he can't.
I'll go to sleep on the couch
I'll watch him.
To go to sleep.
When we're ready
I can't believe he's two.
Me, neither.
Why are you being so nice to me after I lied to you?
I'm just happy, happy you're here.
And I know you're happy you're here.
That's why you lied to me.
So it's probably not going to be the worst thing you ever do or the biggest fight we'll ever have.
But...
Ah, yeah, I knew there would be a "But."
But I want you to be honest with me and not keep anything from me, and I want to be free to be honest with you and not keep anything from you, even if I do something stupid.
What'd you do?
Nothing.
Nothing yet?
Just nothing.
Nothing, Amy.
I haven't done anything I can't tell you about.
Okay.
Look, it's still early, John's in bed and I really would like to go talk to your dad.
I don't want your family to be upset with us.
That's really nice of you.
Or I could talk to him another night.
Yeah.
Do that.
Oh, I'm sorry, I really am.
Everything took twice as long as it should have.
It took me a whole hour to get from the Design Center to here.
Hate the traffic here.
And I'm starving.
Did you take out the countertop?
Yeah, but don't worry, I'm going to put in a new one.
And Robie's going to help.
It'll look good, stop worrying.
I'm going to look at some granite.
I asked you not to do that.
Jeez, It'll be fine.
It's going you'd think you'd thank me.
To look better.
You liked that, didn't you?
I did a great job in Ashley's room, converting the garage.
But I didn't care about the garage.
I didn't want anything in here to change.
You change things in people's houses all the time.
Why wouldn't you want to change things here?
Because.
Because why?
Because I have some really good memories in this kitchen, that's why.
The same kitchen, It's still going to be just different countertops.
Thanks for taking care of Robie.
You don't have to thank me, he's my son too.
Come here.
Goodnight, George.
Forgot to lock the door.
I forgot my purse.
I guess we do have a lot of good memories in this kitchen.
I can put the countertops back in, if you want.
No, that's okay.
They were kind of outdated.
Still seeing your boyfriend?
No.
But that doesn't make any difference when it comes to us.
Has nothing to do with us.

Hello, brother!
Hello, how are you?
- Fine.
Where's Mom?
- Hello, son!
How lovely to see you.
I was happy you finished school.
Why did you pick this job?
Mom!
This is for my internship.
It is useful for people.
Wasn't it enough that we lost your dad in this job?
Eat your dinner, brother!
But Mom is upset.
I love you son, eat your food!
Hey, bring some tea over here.
- At your service, Mr. Mojerloo.
Here's fresh tea.
Hello!
Bring some lemons!
I'll have you insured.
Ok?
Hi!
You'll get the stops tomorrow.
Ok?
Ok.
I need three technicians for the Galugah power line.
I'll come.
Who's coming?
The route is to heaven.
Who's coming?
Mojerloo!
If you raise the pay, more men will come.
No way.
Everything is calculated.
The power line is close to the city.
I have Saman.
I need two linemen, one for the overhead and one to work down.
Who needs a job?
Sir!
I said I'll come.
Emran?
Down or up?
Ok, down.
No, I already worked on lower sections.
I want up.
Be careful not to fall!
Sir!
I can cook and I can carry iron beams to the base, but I want Sistan power line's pay.
But Sistan...
But I'll be working two jobs, Sir!
Ok.
Morteza too.
Mojerloo!
Since the line isn't too far, I won't bargain over the pay, I'll come.
Early tomorrow morning all be ready to start work.
You go ahead!
I'll catch up.
Ok.
Hello.
Hello.
The rug is turning out so beautifully.
Here's Saman.
- Hello to all!
Hello!
Fereydoon!
Sit here!
I study high-voltage electrical power.
What sizearm should be used on this plan?
The last corner piece had a different size.
Are we all set, Mr. Mojerloo?
- Yes, we'll leave tomorrow morning.
Who's the second lineman?
- Emran is your co-worker.
How are you?
Welcome to the group.
Fereydoon is with us too.
Rostam!
Ask him to stop.
I want to visit my dad's gravesite.
Why not?
Stop, Mojerloo!
Let's visit out senior linemen's graves.
Thank you.
Now let go.
Be careful!
Loosen up the wires!
That's enough.
Go up!
Be careful.
Enough.
Come up!
Go up, Feyredoon!
Next one.
I'll fasten this.
You go up help them!
Be careful!
Use your left hand!
Do I have it right?
You have it upside down.
Don't let go!
Turn it the other way!
Good.
Be careful.
Good job, Jabar.
Here are bolts.
Morteza!
Couldn't you have cooked the peas last night to save time?
Oh what wonderful lunch we got.
Give it, Morteza!
Look how he eats.
He ate little meals in college but now indulges in beef stew.
I never had such good stew before.
- Thanks for the compliment.
So, tell me what's your plan doing this job?
I have to work in different areas for my internship.
Bravo.
So what?
He wants to write his experiences from this job.
He has to fill his notebooks.
Push it!
Put a stone under it!
Push!
So it won't slide back.
Good job, guys.
Have some acorn you little squirrel!
Oh God!
I was almost falling.
This tower is done.
This side is finished too.
(song) The black tailed crow caws and informs the city.
What nice water.
Can we swim, Mojerloo?
We have no baths there.
Let's just bathe here.
Ok.
Go ahead.
Head under water!
Push his head into the water!
Yes, down!
I told you many times, tie one on the left and one on the right.
Another threat to Earth these days involves droughts and uncontrollable floods.
Worry over these conditions brings new challenges for world community.
Are the plates ready?
- Yes.
What are you listening to?
- News.
What are they saying?
Social issues and disputes, war, politics, economy...
That we'll have a billion hungry people by 2012.
That's some figure, Saman.
What are we then?
Third world or fourth?
Something like that.
1/5, 2/5 or 2.75 billion or what?
Give it to me.
Go up, guys!
Go up, Saman!
Should I go up too?
Yes, go up.
Prepare the plates for cross-arms!
Mojerloo!
Watch for the plan not to blow away.
World organizations have asked the youths and researchers to study the condition of natural resources, plant species, water and soil.
Go on up and I'll give you the plates.
Floods, drought and damage to plant and animal species are in most cases preventable.
Get a few wrenches, Rostam!
The guys need tools up there.
By implementing cultural research, there is hope that nature destruction can be controlled.
One corner piece is missing here.
Some kebab it will be.
- What is it?
A pheasant.
- It's tomorrow's lunch.
Guys!
Look what Morteza got.
- Don't kill nature.
It's a sin.
I worked hard to set up a trap.
Wait till you eat the pheasant stew and you'll thank me.
It's a sin.
Let it go.
No, Emran.
Don't let it go!
Wait, Emran!
What's going on?
Get back to work!
Emran!
Where are you taking it?
Wait, Emran!
Firmly...
Squeeze it!
I'll tell you a story but don't get scared.
Say it!
We were setting up pylons in Kashan.
A power line with 93 pylons.
I was with my cousin.
We were hanging onto the cables with our soles.
A lightning struck.
My cousin got so scared that his hands slipped.
He had no belt.
He fell down.
God bless his soul.
He's got a 4 year old kid.
Since then I always fasten my belt.
Good thing.
Firmly...
Yes, good.
Get up, guys!
Get up!
Morteza!
Get the tea ready!
Hi!
Get up, Yadi!
The earth is humid.
It makes you think you had little sleep.
Faster, Morteza...
Get up, Emran!
Don't shout at them!
They're not slaves.
Watch your steps!
Walk slowly!
Slowly...
It'll fall.
Did you tell him?
I will know.
It is good, needs a wrench now.
Say it, Rostam!
This town isn't far from the city.
I miss my family.
Just give us a day off.
Let's enjoy life.
Did you hear that?
Pick up these bolts!
Guys!
Linemen's Land Cruiser is so cool.
I'll become a lineman when I grow up.
- How nice.
What are you here for?
To cut extra saplings and plant in our school garden.
We're metal men and they're tree guys.
Are you a sheep to chew grass?
Are you comfortable, Mojerloo?
- Yes.
What about you?
Hope you'll have a comfortable afterlife too!
Such magical hands.
What a pretty pattern.
It is a 'Marigol' pattern.
I'll buy it.
Of course I'll just keep it.
It shoudn't be stepped on.
It is for my bride.
What's taking so long buying a rug?
- Quiet!
He'll hear you.
Don't miss it too much.
You'll see it very soon.
Ok, let me go talk to her.
No, wait till her customers leave.
Mehran!
Come.
Take this rug.
Thank you.
Hello!
- No, no.
Listen to the lady!
Saman has excellent taste.
Thanks to this lady's fingers.
With your permisson.
Thanks a lot.
Take care.
Oh, how are you?
Hi, Saman!
- What are you doing here?
So Saman - the lineman - bought a rug?
- Don't be funny.
How are you?
Fine.
- What're you doing here?
That's my mother.
She's talking to her.
Does she want a rug?
Maybe.
Pretty rugs.
Yes, and I got the prettiest one.
And I will get her too.
I'll see you on the tower tomorrow.
Bye, little one.
Working on power line towers is different every day.
There're no fixed rules.
Sometimes unpredictabe things happen.
Start work!
Check the cables first!
Up there keep your eyes wide open.
Don't fall asleep.
We need iron at the base.
Why are you sitting here?
I heard you're in love.
Girls won't wait until you set up 1000 pylons.
They fall in love several times.
Get up and go there.
Take it to the tractor.
This is tight.
Should I come up?
Hunting and cutting trees is prohibited.
Tell the others too.
Ok, Sir.
We linemen have certain words that you'd feel with all your heart upon hearing.
I mean, you'd understand what we mean.
So?
- Make it tighter.
So, you're a spoled city guy.
You need to learn other stuff too while doing your homework.
Wait!
That needs another bolt.
- So, what are the words?
You'll get it.
Pay close attention.
We say words that we stick by a lifetime.
These things are rare in colege.
You have to be among people to get a good grasp like that wrench in your hand.
If you stay with us longer it'll sink in.
Fasten this.
Yes, make it tight.
Come forward!
Be careful!
I have you.
Don't be afraid.
You won't fall.
Good.
Turn it with your other hand!
That's good.
What's going on there?
Is it a flour factory or a mine?
That's pylon 68 and 69.
We'll go blind there.
But is there a base around there?
My balanced eyes say yes.
Hey, how dare you stop work when I'm here?
Oh, back off!
- Rostam!
They'll do their job without you too.
- How do these pylons get erected then?
Do you do that?
They're doing their job and chatting a little.
Fasten that!
Watch your step!
Rostam!
Ask Mojerloo if he's seen the whole power line route or just the start and end?
- He's seen it all.
Has he seen all the bases?
- What do you mean?
It looks like volcanic dust over there.
A pylon base is probably there.
Not everywhere has bases.
That's his job, he knows.
Go find out what's going on.
Ok, I'm hungry now and have to eat lunch.
Walk there, Mojerloo!
So I saw every other one.
I don't need to see them all.
Then we'll fasten every other nut.
Won't it collapse on you then?
Then I'll pay you for every other day.
I can't walk 80 kilometers.
Linemen should erect pylons at every base.
Let's have lunch!
It's all dust here.
There's no way.
Go back!
Let's not hit anyone.
I hope the bases aren't in the mine area.
Don't go!
Turn back!
He can't see us!
Turn back!
Go this way!
Oh God!
They're right in the middle of our job.
Dust will prevent us from working.
- That's what I was afraid of.
Close the mine for 8 hours and we'll set up the pylon.
What do you mean?
They won't shut down.
They're complaining about the bases there.
We're lucky if they don't demolish our pylons.
We've set up many tough pylons.
This is one of them.
There're three more left.
Convince them!
They won't agree, Rostam!
A lineman sets up pylons.
That's it.
Don't snore here!
Go to bed!
Give him some kebab!
Guys!
This pylon is finished too.
To the left.
It's falling!
Run!
Why don't you tighten the cables?
Everybody ok down there?
I set up 3000 pylons in 50 years, but I've never seen it like this.
I set up some tough pylons before.
Sometimes I had to warn the guys that I'd regret if I didn't.
This white hair and experience tell me not to leave room for regrets.
Fereydoon!
Kiumars!
You wait too long for each other.
Your muscles get tired.
Try to be tuned with each other.
Tomorrow, you may have to rub your eyes.
Then the ropes or parts may become loose and put all of us in danger.
Emran!
Saman!
Keep an eye on each other more often.
Pay attention!
Tomomow visibility is poor.
Look after each other.
Once a bolt wasn't tight.
The person wanted to grab the corner but he fell.
The next person wanted to save him, but fell too.
You remember Saber and Davood.
Morteza!
Make some masks of white cloth!
Wash them well tonight and deliver tomorrow!
Give everyone hot milk at 10 and 4 o'clock!
Ok, Sir.
Yadi!
Don't go under the structure.
I won't either.
There's chance of iron parts falling.
But you!
We'll wake up while the stars still shine in the sky and leave with our tools to the bases.
We can work for 2 hours before the mine opens.
The bulldozers work on their own.
The compressors have other owners and the mine owner says no pylons there.
So, we won't be working there tomorrow?
What?
No pylons?
You're not familiar with the law on pylons.
For full payments, the powerline route has to be completed.
A lineman leaves no pylon out.
In 2006 in Shalamcheh, we had 6 km of power line in a minefield.
Our men set them up.
This is just one.
Isn't it so, Yadi?
You remember the war.
But tomorrow, we're not working in a minefield.
Let's be alert and God will help us.
You heard what Rostam said.
End of meeting.
Get off, guys!
Hammer the nails, fasten the cables, take up the jin-pol.
Hurry, guys!
Open the ropes!
This is one of those pylons I told you about.
Today we have to fight.
If we make it, I'll have a word with you on that hill tomorrow.
These men are quite spiteful today.
- What're they saying?
Don't come forward!
Just keep working!
You can't work here.
We already told you.
Listen!
We have permits.
Besides, the base is already concreted.
You can't erect pylons in our work environment.
But people need electricity and industry over there.
What's all the commotion for?
Get your stuff out and leave!
Quit talking!
Let's talk calmly.
Rostam!
You're the eldest, so talk.
When plans were drawn, the mine was elsewhere.
Now it is here!
Quit your work!
We have to start work!
Stay back!
Be humans!
This mountain and forest belongs to everyone.
You guys scrape mountains and we set up pylons in the forest.
This is for the country's advancement.
Let's be wise.
Won't we all die eventually?
This is our permit.
We'll legally resolve any problems.
Bring a 91!
Hurry up!
Here.
Yadi!
Go bring a 91!
- I brought a 91, Sir.
Look well!
Your glasses are dusty.
Clean them!
What's with you two?
Don't you see our work condition?
It's his fault.
He's not attentive.
Push the plan aside!
Yadi!
Mind your own job!
Iron is falling down.
Be careful!
It was almost hitting his head.
Here.
Thanks.
We were lucky.
Morteza!
Who told you to stand under the pylon?
You said.
When did I tell you to stand there?
Just handle your kitchen.
It'll get worse.
They'll get mad at us.
If you were an overhead worker, you would have become a lineman by now, not a cook down here.
Mojerloo!
I can't.
Up there, Emran works with almost closed eyes and the parts are mishandled.
I brought glasses for you guys to wear.
Dust will settle on the glasses.
Either call it off or talk to them to close down the mine!
They won't accept.
Get up!
Get done with this pylon!
Water faucet is here.
Sir!
We shut down the mine.
The dust will settle down.
Is it shut down?
- Yes.
Go up!
You can't imagine the hell I was in yesterday.
It was the worst pylon of my life.
Amidst the dust up there.
It was terrible.
How are you, Fery?
You're our honor.
You're right whatever you say.
Hi, Saman!
- Saman is going to propose.
Hush!
Be quiet!
Be polite.
Gently, greet from behind the door.
Ok, we'll just smile.
It's ok.
I'll wait.
My Mom takes this rug wherever she goes, even on trips.
It's hand-woven from 60 years ago.
My mother made it when she was Molood's age.
I like to use it all the time.
This rug was woven with motherly love and patience.
Natural colors and Iranian design.
Naturally, I like to have it all the time.
The pattern is a "Marigol".
What? "Marigol"?
"Marigol" was a woman who loved a man years ago, but he had to leave.
So, Marigol wove a rug in the years she waited for him.
Don't upset yourself!
I'll ask the stores around.
I'll go this way to ask.
Don't you think it is a dangerous job?
Of course it is, especially for overhead linemen.
I've heard stories from linemen's families, but now it is different.
I have to work on pylons for 2 years.
It is an internship for me.
It's interesting to be with them.
Later we have to decide what to do.
I like the job.
Where are you working now?
Behind those mountains.
We're setting up towers all the way to this mountain.
Get off!
Let's start work.
Khalil!
Come fasten the cable holders.
- Hold this.
Loosen it!
Come on!
Pull!
Take the legs and fitings to the base!
Saman and Emran!
Go to that side and hammer the nails!
Up... up!
Emran!
Saman!
Bring these ropes to the next base!
Wait, Emran!
I have a word wth you!
Wait and listen!
Before, unofficially... and yesterday, officially I was going to propose to her.
But seems like I was late.
Everyone in this city knows who Saman loves.
So don't tell me a newcomer has shown up in town.
I visited Molood everytime after work.
Listen!
I visited her whenever I came from Tehran.
One day I realized I love her.
- Quiet!
Shut up!
I shoud have broken your jaw when I suspected!
Are you done?
Wait!
Where did you pop up from?
We're all having fun working in the forest and nice weather.
But you've become a thorn in my eye.
Watch your language!
Hush!
Hush!
See.
I'm taller than you like this, get it?
Your mouth is as big as a bolt 35.
If I blow you down from up there, you'll be finished.
I didn't think you'd be so cruel.
Yes, up there on the pylon is cruelty, but we're on the ground.
Come on up, Emran!
Come hit me!
I'm crazy.
Come hit me!
Move over!
What happened?
- I didn't come here for this.
Ok.
Watch your bangles not to break.
Hit me!
Hit me, Emran!
This is the base of the pylon.
Number 92. 28 more to go.
Molood wil be upset.
Go!
You didn't bring the ropes?
This job needs order.
Pay attention!
It is not right to fight like this.
Linemen don't deal with each other like that.
You are fellow citizens.
Guys!
Pylon number 105 is near the road.
Families are coming to watch you set it up.
What's going on here?
What're you up to in my workshop?
What do I do if the guys see and get addicted?
It's cold.
Iron is cold.
Pylon is cold.
I can't work like this.
We already set up a 40 km route.
I know.
Thank you, but I can't pay for your damages.
Your hands will slip and you'll fall down from up there.
Do you want to ruin my life?
What's wrong, Mojerloo?
- Don't know.
He's sitting there...
I can't work.
Iron is cold.
The weather is cold.
What's he doing?
- I don't know.
Tel me what's wrong.
Enough?
Be careful, Jalil!
Morteza!
Make some tea!
Morteza!
Take this!
I'll see if I can get any reception.
Don't get lost!
We don't feel like looking for you in the forest.
Love you, mom.
I may get disconnected.
Tonight or tomorrow go to Molood's house.
Talk to her mother.
Tell her I came with flowers, but they weren't there.
Tell her I'll come in all honesty.
Don't make a fuss!
Don't sound like you're begging either!
Just be confident!
Thanks.
Hi!
How are you?
Fine.
Don't you get scared up there?
- Well, yes, sort of.
This is the first time in 20 years that families have come to see our work.
Let's applaud for all linemen of Galugah.
Do you like to go up?
Afraid?
In honor of Saman.
- Thanks.
Good of you to come.
(Rhyme) Uncle!
Did you weave my chain?
Yes.
- Did you throw it over the mountain?
Yes.
Give me some tea!
I'm afraid of these guys.
I mean Emran and Saman.
I hope they won't get into trouble.
Good job, guys.
- You too.
Emran!
You should mention me in your thesis.
Mention everyone!
By all means, both you and Mojerloo.
Mention Mojerloo too!
Health and well being.
Fasten the bolts, then go down.
- They're tight.
Ropes must be opened too.
Tomorrow, we'll set up pylon no. 120.
End of the line and time to pay.
Morteza's throwng a little party for you.
Go bring some sweets and juice.
So what are we doing?
So what are you going to do?
Will we go after our own life tomorrow?
Look!
We've already talked.
It is over.
- The hell with you.
I did the talking first.
Really?
But Molood didn't mention anything.
Who are you for Molood to talk to?
Move over!
You talk too big.
Move over!
Hey!
Friend!
Student!
Good looking!
Whatever you like.
I'll do anything for you out of friendship.
I will even bite the ground for you.
But don't ruin my life!
I'm barely literate, sensitive and impatient.
I'm mad.
I grew up with these irons.
Don't make me throw you down from the last pylon tomorrow.
Come down, guys!
Have sweets and tea!
I'll be a coward if I don't get her consent to marry me.
Look!
Neither you nor anyone else can do anything.
I told you this before.
I'm the gentlest of all gentlemen.
I fight too.
See this rod?
Want me to hit your forehead with this?
Hit me!
Dare to hit me!
- See.
That's how you'll fall down.
Back off!
- Up on the pylon in front of people,
I wanted to shout that you don't let me work.
That you're a thorn in my eye worse than gambling.
That dropping bolts is all you do.
Come down and talk!
They're wrapping up the cables.
Come down!
Aren't the bolts fastened?
- Come down!
I won't come down until I settle the matter.
Nobody interfere either.
Move over!
Go bring one of them down!
Saman!
Let go!
Move over!
Let me go down.
What do I tell them?
They should just come down.
I'm coming up with Fereydoon to fasten the bolts.
Hear that?
Say right here that you won't hang around Molood and I'll leave you alone.
Tomorrow, after pylon number 120 is set up, do whatever the hell you want.
Such a mess!
You guys are exhausted after setting up 119 pylons.
Come and rest!
- He doesn't let me.
Your arms are tired.
Just say that you won't go after Molood and it'll be over.
Back off!
Saman!
You don't have to go up.
- No, I will.
You're not emotionally well.
Don't go up!
Don't insist!
No, I will.
I just slipped for a moment.
I'll go.
You want me to send Jalil up?
Say it!
He's conscious?
Well, say it!
What?
He's back in coma?
ICU?
Say it!
What?
We all said it wasn't Emran's fault.
We are witnesses.
Nonsense.
When?
Mojerloo!
They're here.
Keep working!
They can't do anything to you.
Come down, Emran!
We have to take you to the police.
We have a complaint.
You have to pay for what you did to Saman.
I'll kill you if he dies!
Don't make a hype!
These guys are men of work.
They're not after trouble like you guys.
These men are workers with dignity.
Come down, Emran!
We have to take you to the police.
We have a complaint.
Go away!
Once we finish, we'll gather our stuff to Galugah until the case is settled.
We'll settle it right here.
Go away!
These guys are working.
You guys leave!
I'll come to the police station.
You're like my sons.
What do you want?
It'll be clear at the police station tomorrow.
Go on, leave!
Move back!
You'll call the police?
Go!
Leave!
Pylon no. 120 is finished.
This line is finished.
Go!
When you're summoned, come to the police station.
You're free for now.
Until Saman talks, Emran is free.
Nobody make any trouble, or you will be prosecuted.
Quiet!
Nobody talk!
Go on!
Be quiet!
You insensitve coward!
Move away!
Hi!
He's becoming conscious.
I'll call the doctor.
Don't leave us in the dark, Emran!
We're here, Emran!
Saman!
You have to wear this girdle for 6 months, because there are bolts and metals around your spine.
You can only take it off at night;
otherwise, wear it all the time.
Emran!
Come on!
We are going.

At least our caller has already aired out her pains.
Here we go!
Here we go!
The unstoppable.
This is it!
This is it!
Right away!
The freshest!
Even fresher than the fish in the market this morning.
I now introduce you to...
The girl who doesn't want to sleep.
The girl who was born to shake love.
Here she is and no one can stop her!
- DJ Heidee!
- I better call there some time.
- Spell bitter!
- H-E-I-D-E-E as in Heidee!
- Never to be fooled again!
- Yes!
- Never to be deceived again!
- Yes!
- Never to go soft again!
- Yes!
Oh please!
Never mind if you're bitter, if bitter is better!
It's even better for your health!
Amazing!
For those who just tuned in... you're still with me here at " You Know it" with DJ Ram.
DJ Heidee will be with us all night.
Listen to her as she fires up... the airwaves and feel her unleash the monster within.
Hello caller, here's Heidee you're on the air.
Roar, hello!
What should I do so that he'd notice me?
Planking!
Do it in front of him.
Oh please!
Calm down, planking right away?
- Do some dancing first.
- Dancing?
It's just like planking but you do this.
- That's for sure, sister!
- Correct!
Do we still need closure?
You so deserve that, sister!
Here you go!
Ouch!
I'm scared!
It's like hearing something from below the ground.
Exactly!
That " love-love" should be buried, you know!
I love him so much...
even if he leaves me.
- What do you call yourself then?
- Stupid.
- One big check mark!
- My girlfriend left me.
Oh, where are you?
I'll have someone pick you up.
My boyfriend cheated on me.
Cheat on love and leave your man.
I can't take the pain anymore!
Hold on.
I'll send an ambulance there.
- What if there's still a chance?
- Chance, chance?
Chance upon them doing who knows what!
And then move on to someone else.
Next!
So, what should I do?
- Leave him.
- But...
Stop it!
You're free!
Stop!
Leave him.
Stop it!
Forget him, you're already free!
The end!
Ouch!
There you go.
For those who still can't get enough of what you just heard... tune in again tomorrow night.
For the victims of love, call right away.
And for the players of love, you just found your match!
You just heard DJ Heidee.
The goddess of the broken-hearted... in our newest segment only here at " You Know It" with DJ Ram.
To our Sikat-in listeners, let us know what you think on our web wall.
Sikat Radio 104.3 FM.
We also have online chat.
Sikat 1043.
S-I-K-A-T 1043.
Yes, let's do this again tomorrow.
Remember:
Falling in love is prohibited.
It's deadly.
What happened?
What's your story?
Call me!
Here at Heartbreak Hotline with yours truly, Heidee!
I have a point, right?
Excuse me.
Ram, I'll go ahead.
- Guys, bye.
- Bye.
- Wait, wait.
- Why?
- Come here, George.
Come here quick!
- What's that?
I told sir Bong that we'd check the ratings together.
Uhm, I don't know if I want to see that, sis.
Oh don't play hard to get.
- This is it.
- Shocks, now I'm feeling tense.
- We're on the the next page.
- Next page.
Aaah!
High ratings!
Am I dreaming?
Please slap me, sis!
Slap me!
Yes it's true, sis!
It's real!
Thank you for the break, Ram.
- Thank you.
- What?
You've been here for almost a month.
You've thanked me enough.
But seriously, I'm so proud of you.
Imagine, you're a newbie and you've already gained followers and fans.
Who knows, maybe next time you'd have TV guestings...
- tapings, shootings...
- Like an actress?
Maybe you'd be invited to pictorials, ribbon cuttings... baptisms, first-death anniversaries, everything.
Well, I learned from the best teacher.
Excuse me, I never taught you to be bitter.
You know what I'm saying.
But seriously, George, keep it up.
You know, there's been talk that... there will be some re-shuffling of shifts.
And that there will be a vacancy in the morning time slot.
Who knows, they might give it to you.
- To me?
- Yes.
- I've only been here for a month, sis.
- Precisely.
Look at how the ratings improved since you joined my show.
That's because of Heartbreak Hotline.
You know, we should celebrate.
I mean it.
Right now.
Let's go!
Come on!
- Oh wait, let me take a look first.
- Here, have it framed.
Dude.
You might not find a boyfriend because of that segment.
That's okay.
I'm not looking for a rock to hit my head with.
You talk as if you've been really burned.
How many boyfriends have you had?
Just enough.
Enough to finally stop.
Don't talk with such finality.
I'm serious.
I've learned my lesson.
I'll never be fooled again.
I'll never be fooled by that " Love" again.
Oh no!
So, I guess that makes us fools.
Crazy!
Tissue!
I don't have any.
- Give me that.
- Are you okay?
Sir, can I have tissue?
Of course, he had to make a big impression.
He revved his engine, just like the taxis...
And then he...
And then?
And then his car zoomed past!
It was power-tripping!
He even hilltowed!
- Bro!
- Yes Sir?
One Daiquiri, one Pink Lady.
- Yes sir.
- They're wholesome.
Tissue, please...
You need help?
- I just need tissue...
- What are you drinking?
- Gin?
Rhum?
- Non-alcoholic
Where's your boyfriend?
He's supposed to be helping you.
I have to go.
I already got my drink.
Good night.
Miss, here's your tissue.
Ah.
I know, I know.
I'm handsome.
What's that?
Water or drool?
Allow me.
What are you doing?
!
I'll do it!
Irritating!
Where are my manners?
I'm Andrew.
Miss, I'm just introducing myself.
I'm Andrew.
Nice to meet you.
I don't care!
And we dedicate that song to Sir Ralph.
Happy birthday, boss.
Sorry.
Who's that guy reaching out to you?
I don't know.
Non-entity!
Hey, I better go home.
This place is full of bad vibes.
Oh no!
We should just be happy today.
Correct!
No need for that.
This is my treat for a job well done.
Thanks.
Okay, I'll go now.
My entire clan is waiting for me.
Bye!
- Bye!
- Take care.
Isn't that right?
That's why it's important to have change oil regularly.
Thanks.
- Thank you.
Cheers!
- Congratulations, Yumi!
It's really you!
You're so famous!
This is it!
George!
George, can you believe it?
Oh my gosh!
I'm a VJ finalist.
Oh my goodness!
I didn't believe I was going to get it.
But I actually got it!
Can you believe it, sister?
I'm a finalist!
Oh my gosh!
Unbelievable!
There were a lot of people.
Oh my goodness!
Well, I always told you that you'd get in.
- You're the one doubting yourself.
- Yes, sister.
I did it.
Wait, I'll just go to my friends, okay?
Oh my gosh, guys!
One more toast!
Let's go!
One more!
One more!
For the next VJ!
Cheers!
I know.
Can you believe it, sister?
Wait a minute, it's late.
Where's your gig?
In Katipunan.
Late notice.
Oh my goodness!
Where were you earlier?
I'm so excited!
Gosh.
You know, this is it.
This is the beginning for all of us.
- Tita George, you're famous!
- Elvis!
- I have a point, right?
- Right!
Hey, you're famous already.
DJ Heidee!
George, when our single gets released...
promote it, okay?
- I don't want to.
- Promote it.
Just kidding.
But sis, you really listened to me earlier?
Of course.
Look at that.
It was open earlier and we tuned in to your segment all night.
- Really?
- Definitely!
Where's Pablo?
As usual.
You know, little girl.
Our rock band was so popular back in the day.
Really?
Yes, our lead guitarist just left us.
Fajardo Bato.
That's his name.
He went to America.
And he also changed his name.
Fajardo Bato became Fadra.
No, no, seriously.
Our band was really a huge hit.
Other bands like Juan dela Cruz weren't around then.
We were the number one Pinoy rock band.
That's why we have an award.
That's our name.
Pablo Apostol Ba-Rock-Co...
"Bandang Rock and Company"
- Darling, we were number one then.
- Really?
But don't think that we only play purely rock music.
We also play ballads.
Love songs.
You... what's your favorite love song?
" Forgive Me"
Really? " Forgive Me"?
Look at that, we're the same.
We like the same song.
That's also my favorite.
Seriously?
The writers of that song are very talented.
Vic Sotto.
Joey de Leon, I think.
- They're my favorite.
- Oh yeah.
Me too.
Since you're already holding the guitar... do you want me to teach you the chords of " Forgive Me"?
Really?
Yes please.
Sure.
It's easy.
Hi, George.
Forgive my father.
He's been forgetful lately.
And I think Yumi is looking for you inside.
Okay.
Pablo, what are you doing?
Sit down.
Leave her alone.
Oh come on, Anaconda.
Your dad's just telling her a story.
Pablo, don't you get goosebumps?
That's Yumi's friend.
I noticed that the kid was really sad.
I was just entertaining her.
I was trying to make her laugh.
Pablo, for you, all girls are sad.
Anaconda, your dad's different.
Daddy is harmless.
Hold on, Anaconda?
!
I'm not a snake.
F-Y-I.
For your information...
Anaconda - " Anak Kong maganda"
- My pretty daughter.
That's you.
Right...
DJ Heidee!
Did you even listen?
Here you are, trying to look cool and handsome to that clueless kid.
I listened.
I heard you.
Every word.
Your advice was really good.
Direct to the point.
Look, I recorded it.
See, it's in the cassette tape.
You actually taped it, huh.
Of course.
But seriously, Anaconda.
My pretty daughter, George.
I'm so proud.
I'm proud of all my kids.
You.
Even Mayumi.
Paraluman is also on her way to reaching her dream.
I hope you girls take care of the breaks given to you.
You know, that only comes once in a while.
Yes, definitely.
Just promise me that you'd always be a good boy.
I promise.
Rock and roll forever.
You don't look like a rocker with that hand.
- Did you see?
- Pars, Yumi, let's eat.
Comment:
Paraluman, you're beautiful and you sing really well!
Very good!
Here's another!
Good job, Pars.
Isn't this...
Guys, let's eat.
Hey, what's that?
- Uhm, no.
Don't!
- Don't what?
Don't?
No!
What's that?
You know Yumi, George needs this.
Go ahead, look.
Face it.
Who would have thought that they'd really end up together?
In all fairness, Lauren has gotten prettier.
I wonder how many whitening shots she took?
You're one to talk...
Hey, you better eat now or you'll be late.
Sis, go to bed.
You've been up all night.
You're still prettier than the girl he replaced you with.
I know right!
- Right!
- Sis, are you sure George is prettier?
It just happened.
We didn't mean to...
- we just got together.
- What do you think are you doing now?
You're hurting the person!
You're fooling her.
You're playing with her.
You know, it will be better if you just told her the truth right away.
This is better than her being surprised... that Ryan is suddenly breaking up with her.
And then a few months later, she learns that wow... you guys are together as a couple.
And then one morning, she finds out on the Internet...
Hey!
You guys are getting married!
And to be fair to you, you even invited her, what a best friend!
Andrew, its your turn!
Pass.
Andrew, you said you're going to review.
Put that Car Finder down.
Andrew, you're always like this.
Okay, okay next question.
Babe.
Hi babe, where are you?
What's up?
We're here at the gasoline station.
Reviewing with Carol and the gang.
Oh.
Do you have plans after that?
Nope.
None.
- Looks like we'll do an all-nighter.
- Are you sure?
I mean, you might get bored and then you might make other plans after.
Babe, you know that I'm very focused on my review, right?
Where did that even come from?
It's nothing.
I'm just saying.
Gosh, Andrew.
You know sometimes, I don't understand why you have to be so defensive.
You know Andrew, I don't intend to start a fight.
Babe, you're breaking up.
You have weak signal.
I can't hear you.
I'll call you again later, okay?
Okay babe.
Bye.
Wait.
Help.
Andrew, your stuff.
Let's have late dinner.
Dinner?
- Sure, I'll follow.
I'll just help her.
- Let's go.
I'll see you guys there.
- Let me do it.
- Thank you.
Good thing that I'm here, huh?
- I know.
- You should know how to do this.
You drive and you have a nice car.
Alright.
Everyone seems to be hot-headed tonight.
That's why we will pause for a break.
Goodness, I think some of DJ Heidee's anger just got into my system.
Let's do this first.
Hey, what happened to you?
Why?
What I said was true, right?
Yes, you're right.
But stay calm.
Take it easy.
Let's make up for it on the next gap.
If you were a car...
you'd probably be a Ferrari.
- Really?
- Yup, you're a Ferrari.
Sexy and elegant.
That's you.
You should come with me one time to Clark.
There are a lot of pretty cars there.
Babe!
Melissa, wow.
You're here.
Babe, you know I can't believe Carol and those guys.
They left me here while I was reviewing.
- Reviewing, huh?
- Yeah.
So, she's the one you're reviewing.
Babe!
And we are back.
SIKAT listeners...
I think you guys haven't had enough of DJ Heidee for tonight.
Because of your demands on our website walls...
You know Ma'am, if I were only as good as this DJ Heidee...
I'd help you with your problem with Sir Andrew.
Hello Melissa, you are on the air.
Did she just say Melissa?
Melissa of Parañaque.
- Miss, miss, please turn the volume up.
- Okay.
Go on, share with us your heartbreak tonight.
Is that Mel?
My boyfriend has the tendency to be a playboy.
You can't trust him, huh?
- It's like women gravitate towards him.
- I think that's Mel, Drew.
Wherever we go, girls take a second look.
I know this.
He's the type of guy who does not get contented.
Mr. Friendship to the girls?
Very helpful.
Always trying to look cute.
It's because he knows he's handsome and charming.
It's because he knows that he's Andrew Escalona.
It's really Melissa.
He tells me that they are the ones who approach him.
- That he can't avoid them at all.
- What the heck is this?
Oh really now?
Dude, you're on radio!
Well DJ Heidee, that's what he said.
Melissa, if I were you, I'd break up with him.
Well, that DJ is mean.
She just has a lot of guts because she can't see the person she's fighting.
But if I'm in front of her...
Where's this 104.3 radio station?
We're receiving a lot of text messages right now!
That's a lot!
Minus 50 points for the Cute Category.
That's a text coming from Gina of Cubao.
Minus 50 only?
100!
We're really getting a lot of responses from that call.
Andrew.
Bro, are you okay?
104.3 Sikat Radio.
That's near.
Carol, let's go.
Fine.
- Quick!
- Okay.
- Take care of my car.
- I'll take care of that DJ Heidee.
- Who will watch out for...
- Wait!
You know there was a time when I saw his phone book.
He actually placed labels on the names of the girls... because he doesn't know their real names.
Seriously?
Yeah.
You know what's written?
"Girl dash bar".
"Girl dash Bacolod with a question mark".
" Fair-skinned girl dash party".
" Fair-skinned girl dash I-can't- understand how she spells".
What's that?
Melissa, listen up.
Our Sikat radio listeners have already given their verdict.
You have to decide now about your relationship.
You know, love comes with pain.
That's why the person you love should at least be worth the pain.
But in your case...
I don't think it's worth it.
Correct!
- We can't be fooled anymore.
- Yes.
No one should ever take advantage of us.
Yes.
It's not right to love a man who will never be content.
- Yes.
- Heidee, Heidee!
Who is that Heidee, anyway?
!
Who is that Andrew, anyway?
!
Who is he to waste your time and tears?
Who does he think he is?
God's gift to women?
Who is she?
Well, you're about to find out.
So one day he'd tell you that he loves you and then the next day... he's with someone else?
It's that easy?
As easy as changing clothes?
- Sikat Radio?
- 8th floor, Sir.
There are people who can't help but be like that.
Men without hearts.
Guys, guys, faster.
And if we allow them to hurt us, well, they will just keep doing it.
I should've used the stairs.
Excuse me.
- Wait up!
- Andrew!
That's why it's up to us to take care of ourselves.
I'm sorry, girl...
but you have to make a decision tonight.
Do you have any message for Andrew?
Yeah.
- Boss.
- Where are you headed, Sir?
Is this Sikat Radio?
You hurt me Andrew.
There's no point in this relationship.
Goodbye, Andrew.
It's over.
- Boom!
That hurts!
- Check!
Corrected by, Melissa.
That's the smart answer.
- Perfect score on the test of love!
- DJ Heidee's really good, huh?
You said it.
And because of that, I dedicate this song to you.
Why do people fall in love and they end up crying?
- That Heidee better hide.
- Sir, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
Ma'am, where are you headed?
Uhm... we're fans.
Are you Heidee?
Yes, and you are?
Andrew.
Andrew?
I'm Andrew.
Andrew, the boyfriend of your caller.
The one you advised to break up.
That's me!
Nice to meet you.
Where's your manager?
I need to file a complaint against you.
Sir, it's written here in the Broadcast Code...
Article 4, Section 2.
Programs intended to malign and unfairly criticize or attack a person... natural or juridical, are prohibited.
Are prohibited.
And to clarify, in section 4...
A person who attacks another person...
well, it's all here.
My lawyer researched it.
Sir, I'm not a lawyer.
I'm just a student.
Let's just wait for DJ Heidee.
Oh there.
DJ Ram.
Please take a seat.
Of course, nice.
Of course, DJ Heidee.
DJ Heidee.
Anyway, maybe we can talk about it first.
DJ Ram told me what happened.
Their entire side.
So you know.
All we need now is your side, Mr. Escalona.
Actually sir, my friend just wants compensation and retribution... for the wrong that was committed against him.
We just wanted to discuss with you what the procedure is... so we can commence with the filing of the complaint... and immediately proceed to the adjudication.
We're willing to conduct an investigation.
But we're hoping that that won't be necessary.
I mean, maybe we could further discuss things...
Ah, no!
Investigate.
Right, attorney?
- Hey!
You're overreacting!
- What?
Don't have me suspended.
What are you doing here?
- This is the men's room!
- What are you doing here?
You're the one complaining when in fact it's your own fault... why Melissa said those harsh words about you.
Because you provoked her to talk like that.
You know, I'm really filing a complaint.
You're unbelievable!
Now, I can't pee.
Are you okay now?
Okay, fine.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay.
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to talk to Melissa so you guys can fix things?
Because I can help you with that.
You?
She listened to my advice, didn't she?
You're really something, huh.
You think you're always right?
You think you're an expert.
You think that Mel would come back to me after what happened between us.
Yes.
You see, some guys are just clueless.
But it's really easy to woo women if you just know how.
Fine.
Fine, I'll consider it.
If your plan works, okay.
I might just let my complaint slip...
Come to think of it, you're good at this, right?
In solving love problems.
Call me.
Call me.
You can pull over there.
- You're late.
- This place is too far.
- What are we going to do?
- Come here.
You're late and you're slow.
Will you pay for my cab fare?
- What's that?
- Wear it.
Is this something you actually wear?
What is it?
- I don't think so.
- You're refusing?
Okay fine, it's easy to call KBP and file a complaint anyway.
Alright, alright.
Turn around.
I'll change.
What's the size of this?
I'm a size zero.
Okay!
- You're a size zero?
- U-huh.
Can this fit me?
Can you move faster?
Then you better help me.
It's so hot in here.
Why didn't you just buy a real one?
Our deal is that you'll do everything for us to get back together, remember?
First, get her to talk to you.
Then get us back together.
- Faster!
Come on.
Let's go.
- Hey, I'm not a dog, you know.
Stop that.
It's so hard to walk.
It's so hot.
And I'm so sweaty.
Don't be so noisy.
Come on.
- Make it fast.
- Wait.
- Let's go.
- Don't push me.
Wear your head.
Heidee, take care.
- I want to see you.
- Nanny, destroy that bear.
Why did you fall?
- Andrew...
- I want to be with you.
Get that bear out of here, you freak!
- I don't like bears!
- Ouch!
- Let's go.
- I'm getting dizzy.
Go on.
Do it with perseverance.
- I'm doing that already.
- It's not enough.
Put it up.
Higher.
Why don't you do it?
Come on, let's go home.
That's it.
Now, that's effort.
Don't mind the rain.
It will stop soon.
And Melissa will come out in no time.
Just keep doing that.
Very good.
Doing great.
See that?
The rain stopped.
Just as I said.
Here comes Melissa.
You're really pushing it, you know.
What?
Your placard.
Babe, it just got wet from the rain.
Thighs?
Are you telling me my thighs are big?
So, now I'm a cow!
Nanny, get my ball.
- Oh no, no.
- Yes, ma'am.
I swear, I hate you.
Babe!
Please forgive me.
Are you okay?
I'm allergic to that.
If I give you this, will you accept it?
I just said that I'm allergic and you're still shoving it to my face.
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- I want to see you
Because you're beautiful that's why I'm mesmerized.
I want to be with you Let's be together
I want to see you
- I want to be with you
- Mel, this is for you.
I want to see you The two of us
I want to see you See you in the eye
Melissa, talk to me.
I'm sorry.
Higher.
- Huh?
Higher?
- The pitch of your voice should be higher.
- Modulate it.
- Okay.
Melissa!
I'm sorry.
I can't live without you.
- I need you.
- There you go!
Now kneel.
Kneel?
And then cry, do it!
Seriously?
Yes.
Do you know that crying is a very effective tool?
Whenever Ram and I would hear our male callers crying, we would be so moved.
So affected.
We feel really touched.
That's why you should cry now.
Go.
- Melissa!
- Kneel.
- Kneel?
- Yes, kneel.
Melissa, please forgive me.
Sorry.
That's it.
Go on.
Come on.
Tears!
Give me tears.
Cry harder.
Give me real tears so it'll work.
Cry more?
Wait.
Who am I?
John Lloyd Cruz, the actor?
Yes!
Just like his scenes in the movies... whenever he'd leave Bea Alonzo.
Tell them to stop.
Ma'am Melissa might scold me again for this.
Then you better talk to Sir Andrew.
Melissa, I miss you so much.
Are you making fun of me?
- Huh?
Me?
- Yes.
- I'm not making fun of you.
- What's happening?
I can't review when I all I hear is that noisy dog.
Come on.
- Is that her?
- I think she's coming.
Sir Andrew, the dog is already very noisy.
Please be quiet.
- Nanny, run after the dog.
- Get the dog!
Hey, you left me!
You're really useless.
Hey!
Where should I?
...
- Doggie, come back!
- Hey, you coward!
Look at this!
Look at what happened to me?
It's so big.
When our program " You Know It" with DJ Ram returns... we will open our Heartbreak Hotline segment, with DJ Heidee.
Only for the groups and troupes with heartaches.
Ouch!
Sir Bong, easy.
You're a grown woman and you're still so clumsy.
This is Andrew Escalona's fault!
Heidee, are you okay to go?
You just have a few minutes.
I can't take it anymore, Ram.
That guy will be the cause of my death.
I can't do it anymore.
I can't.
Heidee!
Aaah!
Ouch!
She's saying something about you.
What now?
I have a new plan for tomorrow.
- Come, let's go.
- No.
I don't want to.
You do it yourself.
I give up.
You give up?
What do you want?
KBP report?
KBP?
KBP again?
I didn't do anything wrong.
I just gave an advice.
But this pain and embarrassment that you're putting me through... this is way too much.
- You're unfair.
- Ha!
Now, I'm unfair!
Heidee, maybe you're forgetting that... my girlfriend broke up with me because of the things you told her.
And you never gave me a chance to defend myself.
Oh, is that what you want?
If we hear your side, will you stop bothering me?
Yeah, sure.
I'll stop.
If you admit that you gave the wrong advice to my girlfriend, then I'll stop.
- Maybe you're forgetting...
- 30 seconds, Heidee.
That your girlfriend was the one who called me.
And maybe you're the one who can't admit that you were wrong.
- Heidee, stop.
Heidee.
- You don't know my side.
Maybe you'd be embarrassed to your listeners... if they find out that you're wrong.
- 10 seconds!
- So, you're challenging me?
Heidee!
You're damn right.
- 5 seconds!
- Okay, let's do it and get this over with.
Heidee!
- Let's go!
- Come on.
Sikat Radio listeners, your partner in heartaches is here once again.
- Never to surrender!
- Yes!
- Never to be stopped!
- Yes!
Tonight, we are temporarily closing our Heartbreak Hotline... because we have a special guest.
Here with us tonight is the embodiment of the playboys... players, and cheaters in town.
Let's just call him...
Andrew Escalona!
Straight to the question.
Why can't you be contented with just one woman?
Answer.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Isn't that too much?
Am I not allowed to greet first?
Can't I say hi to your listeners?
Guilty!
Check!
What did you expect?
Come on, Mr. Escalona.
Answer the question.
- Don't avoid it.
- Exactly!
Heidee, I haven't said anything yet but you've judged me already.
What if I tell you that I was content with just one?
That I loved her.
But she left me because of you.
Drama!
- Correction!
Because of you!
- Please!
Because she caught you flirting with another girl.
Because you are a playboy!
Gotcha!
You're catching the wrong guy here.
I'm not guilty.
Heidee, you don't know anything about the situation.
And yet you're meddling in our relationship.
I'm meddling?
Your girlfriend was the one who called us here.
Please!
Yes, but that doesn't mean that both of you are right.
I'm not saying that she doesn't have the right to be angry at me.
Really?
I'm just saying that not all her assumptions are right.
And because you're not part of our relationship... you don't have any right to blow her assumptions out of proportion.
You are not part of our relationship.
But when you talk, it's as if you're my girlfriend.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Are you ticked off already, Mr. Escalona?
I'm here to defend the hearts broken by playboys like you.
Wow, then you must be a superhero.
Hey Super Woman, you've been saying repeatedly that I'm a playboy.
Let me ask you, do you know what that term means?
Of course.
Guys who play with the hearts of girls...
like you.
Exactly.
Playboys play around.
They juggle different relationships.
They are not serious.
Alright, fine.
To be brutally honest, I admit.
I was like that before.
But just so you know, I've changed.
- Because I'm serious about Mel.
- There's a miracle!
Really now?
Seriously?
You know, the serious ones don't fool around.
You're so hard headed.
It's hard to talk to someone with a closed mind, you know.
If you're really concerned about your callers Heidee... you should know them.
- I know them.
- Really?
You know everything?
Is that DJ Heidee?
Yeah, she's being attacked by her caller.
So, you know how long Mel and I have been together?
Do you know our favorite pastimes?
Do you know how I pursued her before?
Because, as you said, you know everything.
Did you talk to our friends?
Our families so you could ask them about our relationship?
Why can't you say anything?
Because you know nothing.
This Andrew is a jerk.
Heidee, who are you to give advice to other people?
And where do you get your advises?
From the phone book?
From the internet?
Excuse me, that's not true.
Then where?
What do you know?
And besides, why are you so bitter?
Ah maybe because no one likes you.
Or maybe you have a miserable life... and you want the whole world to be miserable too.
That's why you told my girlfriend to leave me.
Why?
Have you ever experienced being in Mel's shoes?
Do you really know how it feels like to get hurt?
Heidee, have you been left before?
You tell us that you're a defender.
No, you're a destroyer!
You act as if you know a lot when in fact you don't know anything.
You don't know anything, Heidee.
And so listeners, this is Andrew Escalona.
And I am telling all of you that you're listening to a woman... who doesn't know anything about what she's talking about.
I know, okay?
I know exactly what I'm talking about.
Because I was once fooled and left by someone just like you.
Thanks, Andrew for being our special guest.
Wow!
Is this night intense or what?
It's like having heartbreaks debate.
Well at least, both sides are clarified.
And for now, a song by Juris.
DJ Heidee will be right back later.
Or not.
Nope, she's not coming back.
Tomorrow again, then!
Once again, you're tuned in to Sikat Radio 104.3 FM.
What I said was right.
I know, they're all the same.
That's why you shouldn't let Andrew get to you.
If they won't cheat on you, they'll leave you hanging...
Your ex was like that, remember?
Do you think you'll be happier now if you just stuck it out with him?
You should never have met him.
Yeah.
But if we didn't meet, then we won't have Elvis today, right?
Forget it.
Don't mind Andrew.
And don't be like me.
Just avoid him, okay?
Our turn?
Hold my hand
I won't leave you on this journey
In this world where nothing is certain
- Hold my hand
- Yes, I know!
- Rock and roll!
- Yeah!
Idol!
Wow, a miracle.
We thought you'd delay your third take.
It's good that you made it in time.
Guys, don't stress out my idol.
Idol!
Good job last night, bro!
We heard you on the radio.
Heidee deserved it.
Imagine bro... you became the voice of the offended and misjudged men everywhere.
He was the one who offended and misjudged DJ Heidee.
You were just telling the truth, right bro?
You know what bro, I think you went a little too far.
You didn't have to go that far to prove your point.
And there are other ways to do it.
Congratulations!
What an achievement.
Another addition to the list of girls who cried because of you.
Bro, I'll just fall in line.
Mommy, where's my souvenir?
Souvenir?
I have no budget for that.
But a hug should do!
Age!
Don't be afraid to age.
Because that's just a number.
A-G-E is better.
Yeah!
It's good to have a good body.
It's better than being D-E-A-D
Let's take a break.
Let your nurses take care of you.
- Idol!
- Wow!
Pablo!
Can we have a photo together?
Okay... okay!
George...
Give it to me, dad.
There!
- Okay.
- Rock!
One, two, three, okay.
- Idol, thank you!
- Thanks!
Can I kiss you?
One more kiss.
Your camera.
- Thanks, bye.
- Your water.
- Bye again.
- Darling, don't you feel hot in here?
Hot?
That woman still had the hots for me, huh.
Spicy!
Pablo, there you go again.
That's why mommy left you.
I was just kidding.
I really don't understand why guys like you can't be tamed.
Darling, you know that I'm just for show.
I've had my share of womanizing back in the day... but I already gave those up.
But what did your mom do?
She gave up on me right away.
How will she even know if I could change... if she has already turned her back away from me?
We all deserve a second chance, right?
And it's another sleepless night.
DJ Heidee.
Hi.
I miss you a lot.
Get well soon.
Don't let those bacteria win.
It's been two days and your followers... who are victims of love miss you already.
And for a change, I will be dedicating this song to you.
Here it is.
Right away.
Sometimes you'd feel the weight of problems
Pull over now, Andrew.
Here.
That's their house.
Thanks, Ram.
I'll go ahead, okay?
Don't tell her that I was the one who brought you here.
Wait, is she still mad at me?
Why won't she answer my calls and texts?
Try wooing her first.
Huh?
Maybe she doesn't have any cellphone load that's why she can't answer you.
Okay, bye.
Thanks.
Later at midnight
Paolo will go shopping
Wow!
It's Pablo Apostol!
Yeah, the one and only.
Who are you?
What do you need?
- It's near daybreak.
- Idol!
I'm your fan!
I'm your fan!
Do you want my autograph?
Yes, yes please, Idol!
Do you have balls?
- Come again, Idol?
- Ballpen.
- I didn't bring any.
- Pins?
- Huh?
- Pencil?
You again?
!
Dad, come on, let's go inside.
Wait, your father is Pablo Apostol?
Go away.
- Dad, let's go.
- Wait, George.
Who is this guy?
Who is George?
That's the guy who fought me from the radio station.
That's you?
!
- Idol, Idol, who is George?
- You jerk!
- Pablo.
- No, no.
I just want to apologize to your daughter.
No apologies welcomed.
- Heidee, I'm sorry.
- Just leave, okay?
No.
You once told me that if a guy wanted to talk to a girl... then he should be persevering.
Oh, you told him that?
Heidee, please.
Why is it so hard for you to forgive?
Yeah, just like her mom.
Like mother, like daughter.
- Pablo!
- Heidee, come on.
- We all deserve a second chance.
- Oh my goodness.
- Right, Idol?
- Yes, that's right.
That's true.
- Dude, you're good.
- Fine, gang up on me.
Idol, please.
Help me.
Talk to him.
I just want to apologize to her.
- Wet!
Wet!
- Where?
I mean wait.
Wait a second.
You guys are so rowdy.
Let's fix this.
Can we do that?
George, this guy took the initiative to come here.
The least you can do is face him.
- Yeah.
I just wanted to...
- And you, kid!
Pablo...
And you kid, one more time that you make my Anaconda cry...
I'll make sure that you'd borrow teeth from a rabid dog.
That would be worse!
You guys fix your problem.
You turned me into a rubber band.
- Thanks, Idol.
- You're welcome!
I'm sorry.
My hand.
I just wanted to say sorry.
Sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I'm serious.
I'm truly sorry.
You know, he's unlucky.
- Who?
- The guy who left you.
You don't even know him.
Besides, he's happy now.
He's happy with my best friend.
What happened?
Okay, I know.
Let's pretend that I'm George and you are DJ Heidee.
I'll call Heartbreak Hotline to get your advice.
So, what will your advice be?
Hello Sikat radio listeners!
This is yours truly, Heidee!
Hello.
I'm George Apostol.
My name may be George but I swear, I'm a girl.
Go!
What's your advice to George of Pasig?
I'll tell her that "True Love" is dangerous!
That it's not real.
That she shouldn't believe it because it's very misleading.
I'm sorry.
Why?
You're not the one who hurt me.
I'm still sorry that you got hurt.
And sorry because I owe quite a few girls that same sorry.
So for now, I'll start with you.
What about Melissa?
What's gonna happen?
I don't know.
Too bad.
I just really felt like... she was the best decision I've ever done in my entire life.
And then I ruined it.
I guess I'll go ahead.
It's kinda late.
- Okay.
- I'm really sorry.
How should I call you?
Heidee?
George?
Heidee is just my screen name for my work.
Andres Escalona.
Andrew.
George Harrison Apostol.
Nice meeting you.
Why are you laughing?
- Your name is pretty.
- You're laughing at my name.
- Nice meeting you, George.
- Okay.
Bye.
- I'll go ahead.
- Bye.
Bye, George Harrison.
Come in, Ma'am.
- Okay, thank you.
- There she is.
- You're the girl with Andrew, right?
- Yes.
Nanny, please tell her I'm tired.
Ah no...
Melissa, please wait.
Please wait.
Don't worry.
It's just me.
Andrew's not here.
Actually, you know me.
I'm DJ Heidee.
You called me at Heartbreak Hotline and I told you to break up with Andrew.
So Melissa, I'm on your side.
Yours truly, Heidee.
- What, she said that?
- Yup.
She said that you're the worst boyfriend in the universe.
- That's exaggerated.
- Here, I have a list.
Number one...
No direction.
No focus.
Number two...
Insensitive.
Number three...
Dishonest.
Number four...
Inconsistent.
- Number five... and a whole lot more.
- Let me see that!
Give it back.
I'll just give you a copy.
At least now you know what to change so you could win your ex back.
- Alright.
I'll go now.
- Where are you going?
Home.
My mission is complete, right?
- You're old enough to know what to do.
- George.
What?
Don't scream.
What?
Don't leave me.
I still need you.
George, I don't know what to do.
I didn't even think that I'd be this bad as a person.
You know, in my whole life... you're the only person who can tell me the truth.
That's true.
I promise, starting today, I'll listen to everything that you'll tell me.
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.
Every night, I can fetch you and bring you to work.
Whatever you want, I'll give it.
Please, make me a better man.
We all deserve a second chance, right?
You're like this right now.
" Mr. I-A-S-H"...
Mr. " I Am So Handsome".
You don't know how to love.
You've got no direction.
- A liar and...
- Okay, okay I get the picture.
Sheesh!
In order for you to get Melissa back, you have to be like this.
Focused.
With direction.
Loving.
Faithful.
- Someone who smells good.
- Better version..
Not necessarily a better version.
Just the version that will match Melissa well.
So how will we do it?
We'll do training.
If you pass my standards, that means, you'll pass Melissa's as well.
You?
Why, who do you want?
Megan Fox?
I'll make sure she'll fall for you even more.
Like this.
Hmm.
Smells good.
Maybe you're the one who'll fall in love with me..
Excuse me!
I will not fall in love with you, okay!
With this.
With this.
With any of the three of you.
What happened?
What's the story?
Call me!
Here at Heartbreak Hotline with yours truly, Heidee.
I have a point, right?
Wow!
I think Heidee ate a special meal tonight.
One plate of bitterness with lactobacilli and energy!
Sikat Radio?
No need, thank you.
- Alright.
- Bye.
Are you okay?
You look sick.
Look at that!
You got distracted right away.
What am I supposed to do with you?
Here's lesson number one.
Pay attention so there would be no tension.
If you already have a girlfriend... then you should avoid looking at other beautiful and sexy girls... so you can avoid temptation.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.
It's not too heavy.
Fail.
You just failed the test.
Does this look light to you?
Andrew Escalona, lesson number two.
Be sensitive to the needs of your woman.
When a girl tells you that she's okay... what it really means is that she's not okay.
And so, can you just do something now to make me okay?
I'm sorry.
I thought you were trying to look strong.
Don't be stressed out, baby girl.
You're sweating.
What baby girl?
Take this.
See.
It's lovely, right?
It's the perfect place for a date.
This is the place where you should bring girls.
You should take Melissa here.
Perfect.
I'm impressed.
But can I just ask?
I thought you hated that " love" thing?
But how come you know this place?
I know.
Maybe this is the place where your ex-boyfriend takes you, huh?
Admit it.
Did you go here on dates?
Did you guys make-out here?
You're delusional.
Can we go now?
I'm hungry.
I'm sorry about what I said.
I shouldn't have annoyed you about your ex.
Fake flowers for fake apology?
You're allergic to the real ones, remember?
You're paying attention, huh!
So there would be no tension.
You see?
I take the things you're teaching me seriously.
Smell it.
It smells good.
- Smells good.
- Just like me.
Smell me.
Smell me here.
Come on.
Just once.
- Fine, you smell good.
- One more then.
- Sir, that's for our display.
- Sorry.
Sorry, bro.
If you really don't want to be a doctor, then tell Melissa and your dad.
Maybe that's the real direction Melissa's expecting from you.
For you to know what you really want out of your life.
Lesson number three.
You're the best, if you're honest.
- If you're about to say something...
- If you're about to say something...
Hey, where are you going?
It's closed there.
What are you trying to do now?
You said that I'm not allowed to look at pretty girls, remember?
What's so funny?
Good morning.
- Would two be enough?
- Return that.
It's obvious that you don't do your groceries.
That's not enough for the care package you'll give Mel.
Wait, let me do it.
- It's for Mel anyway.
- I got it.
I said, I'll do it.
Oh my!
You're sexy.
We already got coffee to keep her awake.
Then we should get pillows for sleeping.
That's right!
In all fairness to you, you're being consistent.
And that's lesson number four.
You actually know things.
Keep that up.
If you'd be this consistent, for sure...
Melissa's heart would go soft on you.
Like this.
What?
Calm down, sister.
Believe it or not, these guys also have hearts.
Really?
Did I hear that right?
Ha!
You think I won't fight back, huh!
Darling, don't mind those heartaches or you might get a stroke.
Lucky girl.
Hello DJ Heidee, are you still there?
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, yes.
What's that again?
Yes!
More sure than closure.
Don't mind that!
It's fun to be alive.
Life is so beautiful.
Let's all just love each other!
Okay!
Merry Christmas!
Fire!
Pablo asked me to give this to you.
I was about to help you but then you threw the water at me.
- Are you okay, baby girl?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Do you want a hug?
No!
What are you talking about?
It's hot in the kitchen.
I thought the place would burn down.
Go, wear some clothes.
That was tiring.
Is there anything else?
Heidee, come on.
I want to go to Mel already.
So, did I pass?
Wait, okay!
I want to give her my care package already.
Then I'll bring her to the place where you took me.
Heidee, let's go.
I don't want to wait.
What's that?
Give it!
Give it back!
Ah!
Don't use your style on me!
Give that back to me!
- You!
- So what is it?
You know, she's right.
You really rush things.
Rush things?
What do you mean?
You rush!
You really want me to explain?
You're always ready to attack!
It's like you're always late.
Or trying to beat a deadline.
You rush things.
You do things with haste.
Like that.
Hey, excuse me!
Wait...
I'm not like that!
Maybe she's the one who's slow.
Because all girls move slow.
- Fine, get it.
Read it.
- Go on.
Go ahead.
At least you know!
Go!
There's nothing here.
You're just making it up.
Next page.
Excited Kisser.
Hey, I don't rush kissing!
Why are you getting angry at me when it's Melissa who said that?
- Even kissing?
- I told you!
- I'll show you.
- Just try!
You're so hard-headed.
Stop that!
Hasty, huh?
Stop it!
Gosh!
You know... you better listen, okay?
What?
Romance is a slow dance.
And that is lesson number five.
Kissing should have room for missing.
Because the wait... is the bait.
It's about that moment before the kiss.
That's where romance comes in.
And you want that moment to linger.
Keep eye contact.
Make her feel beautiful.
As if she's the only thing you can see.
You can touch her hair.
Her cheeks.
Make her feel safe.
Needed.
Loved.
Hair?
Cheeks?
Eye contact.
That's trouble.
How about Mel?
I thought you wanted to get back with her?
So, you don't love her anymore?
You know what, he won't fall for George if he still loves Mel.
- So what is it?
Do you still love Mel?
- I don't know.
I'm getting confused.
Bro, figure it out.
Fix what's between you and Mel first.
And if you really have feelings for George, make it clear to yourself... how you really feel and why.
Do you like her or do you love her?
Do you really love George... or is it just because you no longer have any feelings for Melissa?
And when everything is finally clear to you... be a man.
Make sure it's clear to the both of them.
There shouldn't be any gray areas here.
I agree.
There you go again!
Why are you looking at me like that?
Don't look at me like that!
What?
What?
!
You're meant to be with Melissa.
With Melissa, okay?
I don't have any feelings for you.
Nothing!
Zero!
Nothing!
Hey!
You've been here all along and you didn't even say anything.
How can I talk when you're talking?
Darling, let me check, okay.
They're fighting.
In here, happy.
In here, kill joy.
Who should I listen to?
Well... my dear.
It's like this.
Too much love can kill.
The lack of it could also do that.
To live or to die is up to you.
I know.
Wait.
That's Ate Pars.
Wait a second, babe.
Thank you!
- Oscar!
Oscar, long time no see!
- How have you been?
You?
How are you?
Still looking handsome.
And you?
Still looking like a rock star!
- Hi, Lauren.
- Hi.
You have a lot of fans.
Wow!
How's your album, anyway?
Good.
Very good.
George.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
It's a bit messy in here.
I have an LSAT tomorrow.
Really sorry for the mess.
Have a seat!
Have a seat!
No, no, no.
Sit here.
Okay.
So, when will that dinner date be?
I actually thought that Andrew would never make it up to me.
Did he actually think that I'd be the one running after him?
You know, I worried because I haven't heard from him lately.
That's because he became very busy with rev...
Reviewing...
Wow!
You know what...
you really are good.
If I'm the one telling him about his boards... watch out!
I'm just trying to be a good influence... but I end up looking like I'm the bad guy.
Yeah but... don't worry.
You'll be happy about him.
He has certainly improved.
He's very mindful now.
Sensitive.
A gentleman.
And he also has those little things that make you feel special.
Seems impossible, huh?
But he could actually change.
Well, that's a relief.
My dad always asks me...
" Mel, where is you boyfriend, the doctor?"
Actually, I haven't told my dad that he hasn't passed his nursing boards yet.
I mean, come on.
It's embarrassing.
- Hey, that's not true.
- But I hope he passes this time around.
I mean, it's crazy to take it the third time.
Besides, when will he ever be a doctor...
when he's forty?
That would be really embarrassing.
Super!
Thank you so much, DJ Heidee.
What's your real name again?
Maybe I can ask that since...
You know... we're friends.
George...
George Apostol.
George.
Too manly for me.
I'll just call you Heidee.
It suits you better.
You're very pretty.
Oh, thank you.
Hey George.
Thanks for the invitation.
I'm glad you finally agreed to see me.
George, I want to tell you how I feel.
Dude, was that okay?
- Yes sir.
Very good.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
- Dude, I'm really nervous.
Okay, let's go.
- Thanks, bro.
I'm okay.
- Okay, sir.
I'm sorry.
We just started fixing up.
No.
What are you talking about?
It's perfect.
Oh, Melissa's running late.
Maybe she got stuck in traffic.
I'm sure she's not too far anyway.
Melissa?
Yeah!
Such hassle that it rained.
It's a good thing that I got here right away so I could check on things.
But don't worry.
She's very excited to see you.
And hey, I built you up.
So you owe me one.
- You told her to come here?
- Yeah!
Why?
Aren't you excited?
The other day you were so excited to bring her here, remember?
- So I made it happen.
- George...
George, wait...
If I really wanted to see her... then I would've invited her a long time ago, right?
You weren't ready then.
Now, you're ready.
You're ready to face her.
What if she's not the one I want to be with tonight?
What if I tell you that I'm happy now...
with who's in front of me?
You're a funny guy, huh?
Really funny.
- Stop it already, Andres!
- I'm not kidding.
I want to be with you here.
What happened between us the other day...
George, it's not...
Andrew, stop!
Drew!
Mel!
So what do you think?
Wow Heidee, you never fail to surprise me.
It's beautiful.
Babe...
I missed you.
It's been a while.
Ma'am!
DJ Heidee's about to leave.
Don't you have anything to say to her?
George...
Why?
Thanks.
Take care.
Okay!
Thank you!
Bye!
Yes, Sikat Radio listeners.
Whew.
Well, well, well.
It seems that Heartbreak Hotline is turning into Love Connection.
Yes!
Yes... and I would just like to greet Melissa from Parañaque... and her boyfriend Andrew Escalona.
Hello to the both of you.
That's the love story that everyone followed.
Now it has a happy ending!
Yahoo!
Sometimes, no matter how hard the world separates two people... if they are really meant for each other... then they'd still be together in the end.
You'll really get knocked out when you're fighting against love.
All you can do is cry because of the pain...
Ouch!
So, to all my followers...
the heartbroken the truth is... there is still true love.
And for Melissa and Andrew... my message for you guys...
for our two lovebirds...
Don't waste or let go of the happy ending that you have.
Because there are a lot of people who dream of having that.
To be with the person they love.
But then again... wait, wait, wait!
Don't dream on!
Don't expect!
We're not a part of that!
And hey, Andrew.
Andrew Escalona... don't ever forget all the things I taught you.
Because if you do, I'll have a dog run after you.
Okay, let's first play one emotional song.
You're still tuned into Sikat Radio 104.3 FM.
- Waiter!
- Yes ma'am?
Don't you have any music?
I'm sorry, Ma'am.
Our CD player is broken that's why we're using the radio.
Wait, that's George's show.
It doesn't really suit the place well.
- Waiter, can you please turn it off?
- Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
So, how's your review going?
Mel, what if I tell you that I'm not pushing through with the board?
So you're not going to take it this time?
So, next time?
I don't want to be a nurse.
You're not going to be a nurse.
You're working hard to become a doctor.
- Mel...
- Won't your dad be disappointed in you?
He wants you to follow in his footsteps.
I know my parents will be disappointed in me.
So, I'll be disappointing your parents too?
There you go again!
What I'm saying is...
Would you rather that I tell them that I'm dating a car salesman?
What's that expression on your face?
- I want to be honest.
- You don't have to be honest.
You know...
you need to focus on your studies.
You know what I learned, Mel?
When it comes to love, we should all be honest.
What do you mean?
Mel, I'm sorry.
Is there someone else?
Idol, please.
It's important that I talk to her.
How can you talk to someone who's asleep?
You know her late hours at work.
Let her rest in the meantime.
Okay?
By the way kid, I have a new composition.
What's that?
Shit happens!
Let's do a duet some time.
Shit happens!
You owe me big time.
I don't like lying.
Are you going to read it or we will?
You're so nosy.
It's over.
It's over between Andrew and Mel.
Huh?
!
Hello?
Hello Ma'am Ludy...
you'll be on air in a few seconds.
Okay.
Just hold on, please.
Don't put the phone down.
- Okay, okay.
- That's crazy!
Here are our other text messages from last night.
"I hope my ex and I would get back together too, DJ Heidee."
"Can you please help me?"
From Everlasting Love 214.
Well, don't worry, Everlasting Love.
We'll get to that.
In the meantime, let's start with our Heartbreak Hotline!
In all fairness, she has a different aura tonight.
Why don't we just go to the station?
If George wants to talk to Andrew, she'll answer him.
Give her some space.
Check the radio, maybe she's on air.
Or maybe, she's absent again.
The unstoppable!
DJ Heidee.
- Are you guys still awake?
- Yes!
Rawr!
Very good!
You're all up!
Here is our first caller!
Hello Ma'am Ludy?
Are you there?
- DJ Heidee.
- Hello Ma'am Ludy, your voice changed.
I'm sorry, I asked my nanny to call.
I was embarrassed.
Oh, okay.
She's on air.
That's her, right?
- So, what's your real name?
- Angela.
- Who?
- Oh Angela.
Angelic.
I don't plan on going to heaven right away, okay?
My boyfriend was stolen away from me!
Excited, huh?
Okay, tell us the story.
How did it happen?
Someone promised me that she'll help me and my boyfriend get back together.
And I just found out that something's been going between the two of them.
Smooth operator, DJ Heidee.
She's very sneaky.
It's just so hard to trust anyone these days, right DJ Heidee?
It's Mel's voice.
- Again?
- Angela, maybe...
Aren't you the expert... when it comes to being left behind and replaced by their boyfriends?
Am I right, DJ Heidee?
Wait Angela, you said earlier or your nanny... that you guys already broke up?
So he's already your ex?
Is that right?
That's not the point, DJ Ram!
I trusted this girl.
I thought she was my friend.
But what kind of a friend is she if she'll just steal your boyfriend away?
That's just hurtful, right DJ Heidee?
And so, since you're the expert... what would you do if you were in my shoes?
Well, it's not right to interfere in other people's relationships..
Really now?
Then why did you interfere in my relationship with Andrew?
George Apostol...
you are a liar, a cheater, and a fake!
- Hey, that's too much!
- What?
You dare to hang up on me?
- Andrew, where are you going?
- I'll go to George.
I can't just listen to this and do nothing.
You've got some nerve.
Hiding behind that radio show.
You pretend to be the champion of the broken-hearted.
But it's you who destroys relationships.
You knew very well that Andrew was trying to get back with me.
But what did you do?
I bet you're the one who flirted with him!
Mel, please calm down.
I think there's just a miscommunication here.
Please just let me explain, Mel.
Nothing like that happened.
Yeah right!
Of course, you'll deny it.
Hypocrite!
You have some nerve to give advice.
Fine, prove to us that you're worthy of the advice you give to us.
That we should still believe you.
Tell me the truth.
Do you love my boyfriend?
And there you have it- Miss George Apostol.
- Melissa, please listen to me.
- Fine.
- Mel, no... nothing like that happened.
- What then?
Melissa, it was never my intention to take Andrew away from you.
- Sincerely, Mel.
- You know what?
Just shut up!
You don't have credibility anymore... because all the things that come from your mouth are lies.
You're a fraud, DJ Heidee!
You're a snake!
A thief!
It's just so crazy, Sikat listeners, when it's a live broadcast.
Please stay tuned and we'll be right back with " You Know it" with DJ Ram!
George.
George, George, wait.
Andrew, please stop.
George.
There you go again.
- You're not listening.
- Okay fine.
But before you speak, listen to me first.
Do you know who I saw the other day?
My ex-boyfriend.
He's happy with his girlfriend, his fiancé.
Do you know how I felt?
I felt the pain again...
of how it feels like to be left behind.
Do you know who I remembered?
Your Melissa.
I know how it feels like to be left behind.
To be replaced by someone else.
That's how she feels right now.
A while ago... when she broadcasted to everyone that I took you away from her...
I couldn't do anything.
I couldn't even defend myself.
Because I know that she's right.
George, wait.
I was the one who decided to stop pursuing Mel.
Not because you took me away from her.
But because now I know myself.
Because now, I know what I want.
George, I know that she'll be angry at me and I have to accept that.
Because it's my fault.
But what can I do if we're not meant for each other?
Philippines, we're back with " You Know It" with DJ Ram.
Usually, you guys would call us here at Heartbreak Hotline and ask for advice.
Well, tonight, I'll change the rules.
Tonight, we ask you to give our DJ Heidee some love advice.
First of all...
What did he say?
What happened?
They need an advice for DJ Heidee.
- Quick!
Text them!
- Hold your horses, I'm texting already.
George.
George.
- Please, just give me a minute.
- You're always here to listen to us.
- Andrew, stop it.
- Now, we're here for you.
- George.
George, please.
- Sis, it's DJ Heidee.
Please, hear me out.
George.
- What?
- George Harrison Apostol.
I love you.
I love you!
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you so much.
Do you want me to sing it?
What are you doing?
Stand up.
Stop it.
- I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
- Stop it.
I know.
I know, okay.
It's her!
That's DJ Heidee.
George, I won't allow you to blame yourself... and I won't allow the whole world to blame you just because you loved.
Just because you loved me.
Have you texted DJ Ram?
Our next caller is Rose from Parañaque.
Go ahead, Rose.
That's love, DJ Heidee.
Sometimes, you can't force it.
And sometimes, you just can't stop it.
So when you fall in love with someone, sometimes there are casualties.
Wow!
We have a lot of callers in line.
Hello caller, you're on the air.
We learned from you that those who love also forgive.
If you don't want Andrew, go for me instead!
If Melissa truly loved Andrew... someday, she will find it in her heart to forgive him.
That's correct!
The only question should be...
Who does Andrew love?
That's a text message from Norman of Bulacan.
DJ Heidee, don't get affected with what happened on air a while back.
You and Andrew are a perfect match.
Perfect!
Our next caller.
Hello, George.
George, this is Oscar.
I've wanted to talk to you for a long time..
But it was not that easy.
Who's Oscar?
- Who's that?
Maybe it's her ex!
- I know I hurt you big time.
If I could just turn back time, I would.
Just so you won't get hurt.
I've always prayed that you find the person who will love you.
I guess what I'm trying to say...
is I'm sorry.
If this thing with Andrew is your chance to be happy...
I hope you won't allow all your pain and bitterness to get in the way.
I only wish the best for you, George.
Our next caller.
Anaconda.
FYI, this is Pablo Apostol.
George, wherever you are.
I know that it was never easy for you to grow up with such... a handsome, rockstar, dad who's always being chased by women.
As your father...
I should be the one showing you girls how a man should love a woman.
I just hope you won't give up right away on love.
I know you got scared of what happened between your mom and I.
Learn from me, from this regretful playboy.
George, don't make the same mistake I did.
I found my true love, your mom, and I let her slip away.
I love you, Pablo!
George, everyone has spoken.
Your answer is the only thing missing.
- Just say yes!
- Are you okay?
I am.
So?
Can you be my girlfriend, baby girl?
How can I even say no to that?
Oh my goodness!
I'm feeling so giddy!
Hold on.
I've waited for this for a long time.
So... it be better be good.
Love is like a slow dance, right?
Hair.
Cheeks.
Eye contact.
There you have it.
They've already made up.
Well, look at that.
No matter how long the journey is, the moral of the story is that...
True love exists.
And for those of you who believe in love even if you've been hurt countless times;
For those who try to change for the better for the ones they love;
For those who are like George and Andrew...
I only have one thing to say to you:
I'm jealoussssss!
- What's happening?
- Oh sir, sorry.
It's nothing.
Rise and shine!
Wake up, Mega Manila!
Buenas Dias with DJ Heidee!
And we have our first caller!
Hello, good morning.
Who's this?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
It's Andrew.
Andrew.
Andrew?
Do I know this Andrew?
I love you, baby girl.
Oh, wow!
Okay.
Why am I screaming?
- Do you miss me?
- Easy on the questions, okay.
- How much do you miss me?
- Huh?
- Baby girl, happy monthsary.
- Happy monthsary too.
And congratulations on your new show.
- Did you get my gift?
- Oh, there's a gift?
Nice!
Wow!
- Do you like it?
- Of course, thank you.
- Is it beautiful?
- Yes, they're very beautiful.
- Smell it.
- Okay, I'll smell it.
Hmm.

You're right!
Okay, enough for now.

Well, I learned lrom the best teacher.
Excuse me, I never taught you to be bitter.
You know what I'm saying.
But seriously, George, keep it up.

How many boylriends have you had?
Just enough.
Enough to linally stop.
Don't talk with such linality.
I'm serious.
I've learned my lesson.
I'll never be fooled agaín.
I'll never be looled by that "Love" again.
Oh no!
So, I guess that makes us lools.
Cray!
Tissue!
I don't have any.
- Give me that.
- Are you okay?
Sir, can I have tissue?
Ol course, he had to make a big impression.
He revved his engine, just like the taxis...
And then he--
And then?
And then his car zoomed past!
It was power-tripping!
He even hilltowed!

One Daiquiri, one Pink Lady.

Look at that.
It was open earlier and we tuned in to your segment all night.

- Delinitely!
Where's Pablo?
As usual.
You know, little girl.
Our rock band was so popular back in the day.
Really?
Yes, our lead guitarist just left us.
Fajardo Bato.
That's his name.
He went to America.
And he also changed his name.
Fajardo Bato became Fadra.
No, no, seriously.
Our band was really a huge hit.
Other bands like Juan dela Cruz weren't around then.
We were the number one Pinoy rock band.
That's why we have an award.
That's our name.
Pablo Apostol Ba-Rock-Co...
" Bandang Rock and Company"
- Darling, we were number one then.
- Really?
But don't think that we only play purely rock music.
We also play ballads.
Love songs.
you... what's your favorite love song?
"Forgive Me"
Really? "forgive Me"?
Look at that, we're the same.
We like the same song.
That's also my lavorite.
Seriously?
The writers ol that song are vey talented.
Vic Sotto.
Joey de Leon, I think.
- They're my lavorite.
- Oh yeah.
Me too.
Since you're already holding the guitar... do you want me to teach you the chords of " forgive Me" ?
Really?
Yes please.
Sure.
It's easy.
Hi, George.
Forgive my lather.
He's been lorgetlul lately.
And I think Yumi is looking lor you inside.
Okay.
Pablo, what are you doing?
Sit down.
Leave her alone.
Oh come on, Anaconda.
Your dad's just telling her a stoy.
Pablo, don't you get goosebumps?
That's Yumi's lriend.
I noticed that the kid was really sad.
I was just entertaining her.
I was tying to make her laugh.
Pablo, lor you, all girls are sad.
Anaconda, your dad's dillerent.
Daddy is harmless.
Hold on, Anaconda?
!
I'm not a snake.
F-Y-l.
For your inlormation...
Anaconda - "ANAk kong maganDA" = my pretty daughter.
That's you.
Right...
DJ Heidee!
Did you even listen?
Here you are, tying to look cool and handsome to that clueless kid.
I listened.
I heard you.
Evey word.
Your advice was really good.
Direct to the point.
Look, I recorded it.
See, it's in the cassette tape.
You actually taped it, huh.
Ol course.
But seriously, Anaconda.
My pretty daughter, George.
I'm so proud. I'm proud ol all my kids.
You.
Even Mayumi.
Paraluman is also on her way to reaching her dream.
I hope you girls take care ol the breaks given to you.
You know, that only comes once in a while.
Yes, delinitely.
Just promise me that you'd always be a good boy.
I promise.
Rock and roll lorever.
You don't look like a rocker with that hand.

Paraluman, you're beautilul and you sing really well!
Vey good!
Here's another!
Good job, Pars.
Isn't this...
Guys, let's eat.
Hey, what's that?
- Uhm, no.
Don't!
_ Don't what?
Don't?
No!
What's that?
You know Yumi, George needs this.
Go ahead, look.
Face it.
Who would have thought that they'd really end up together?
In all lairness, Lauren has gotten prettier.
I wonder how many whitening shots she took?
You're one to talk...
Hey, you better eat now or you'll be late.
Sis, go to bed.
You've been up all night.
You're still prettier than the girl he replaced you with.
I know right!
- Right!
- Sis, are you sure George is prettier?
It íust happened.
We dídn't mean to...
- we íust got togdher.
- What do you think are you doing now?
You're hurting the person!
You're looling her.
You're playing with her.
You know, it will be better il you just told her the truth right away.
This is better than her being surprised... that Ryan is suddenly breaking up with her.
And then a few months later, she learns that wow... you guys are together as a couple.
And then one morning, she linds out on the Internet...
Hey!
You guys are getting married!
And to be lair to you, you even invited her, what a bestlriend!
Andrew, it's your turn!

Oh really now?
Dude, you're on radío!

"Girl dash bar".
"Girl dash Bacolod with a question mark".
"Fair-skinned girl dash party".
"Fair-skinned girl dash l-can't- understand how she spells".
What's that?
Melissa, listen up.
Our Sikat radio listeners have already given their verdict.
You have to decíde now about your relatíonshíp.
You know, love comes with pain.
That's why the person you love should at least be worth the pain.
But in your case...
I don't think it's worth it.
Correct!
- We can't be fooled anymore.
- Yes.
No one should ever take advantage of us.
Yes.
It's not ríght to love a man who wíll never be content.
- Yes.
- Heidee, Heidee!
Who is that Heidee, anyway?
!
Who is that Andrew, anyway?
!
Who is he to waste your time and tears?
Who does he think he is?
God's gift to women?
Who is she?
Well, you're about to lind out.
So one day he'd tell you that he loves you and then the ne_ day... he's with someone else?
It's that easy?
As easy as changing clothes?
- Sikat Radio?
- $th lloor, Sir.
There are people who can't help but be like that.
Men without hearts.
Guys, guys, laster.
And il we allowthem to hurt us, well, they will just keep doing it.
I should've used the stairs.
Excuse me.
- Wait up!
- Andrew!
That's why it's up to us to take care ol ourselves.
I'm sory, girl...
but you have to make a decision tonight.
Do you have any message lor Andrew?
Yeah.
- Boss.
- Where are you headed, Sir?

You hurt me Andrew.
There's no point in this relationship.
Goodbye, Andrew.
It's over.
- Boom!
That hurts!
- Check!
Corretted by, Melíssa.
That's the smart answer.
- Pe_ett score on the test of love!
- DJ Heídee's really good, huh?
You saíd ít.
And because of that, I dedícate thís song to you.
Why do people fall ín love and they end up cyíng?

We just wanted to discuss with you what the procedure is...
SO We Can commence with the liling ol the complaint... and ímmedíately proceed to the adíudícatíon.
We're willing to conduct an investigation.
But we're hoping that that won't be necessay.
I mean, maybe we could further díscuss thíngs...

Right, attorney?
- Hey!
You're overreacting!

Don't have me suspended.
What are you doing here?
- This is the men's room!

You're the one complaining when in lact it's your own lault... why Melissa said those harsh words about you.
Because you provoked her to talk like that.

You're unbelievable!
Now, I can't pee.
Are you okay now?
Okay, line.
I'm sory. I'm sory.

Do you want me to talk to Melissa so you guys can lix things?
Because I can help you with that.
You?
She listened to my advice, didn't she?
You're really something, huh.
You think you're always right?
You think you're an expert.
You think that Mel would come back to me after what happened between us.
Yes.
You see, some guys are just clueless.
But it's really easy to woo women il you just know how.

Melissa, I miss you so much.
Are you making lun ol me?

You're really useless.

Look at this!
Look at what happened to me?
It's so big.
When our program "You Know It" with DJ Ram returns... we will open our Heartbreak Hotline segment, with DJ Heidee.
Only lor the groups and troupes with heartaches.
Ouch!
Sir Bong, easy.
You're a grown woman and you're still so clumsy.
This is Andrew Escalona's lault!
Heidee, are you okay to go?
You just have a lew minutes.
I can't take it anymore, Ram.
That guy will be the cause ol my death.
I can't do it anymore. I can't.
Heidee!
Aaah!
Ouch!
She's saying something about you.
What now?
I have a new plan lor tomorrow.
- Come, Id's go.
- No.
I don't want to.
You do it yoursell.
I gíve up.
You give up?
What do you want?
KBP report?
KBP?
KBP again?
I didn't do anything wrong.
I just gave an advice.
But this pain and embarrassment that you're putting me through... this is way too much.
- You're unlair.
- Ha!
Now, I'm unlair!
Heidee, maybe you're lorgetting that... my girllriend broke up with me because ol the things you told her.
And you never gave me a chance to delend mysell.
Oh, is that what you want?
ll we hear your side, will you stop bothering me?
Yeah, sure. I'll stop.
ll you admit that you gave the wrong advice to my girllriend, then I'll stop.
- Maybe you're lorgetting...
- 30 seconds, Heidee.
that your girllriend was the one who called me.
And maybe you're the one who can't admit that you were wrong.
- Heidee, stop.
Heidee.
- You don't know my side.
Maybe you'd be embarrassed to your listeners... il they lind out that you're wrong.
- 10 seconds!
- So, you're challenging me?
Heidee!
You're damn right.
- 5 seconds!
- Okay, let's do it and get this over with.
Heidee!
- Let's go!
- Come on.
Sikat Radio listeners, your partner in heartaches is here once again.
- Never to surrender!
- Yes!
- Never to be stopped!
- Yes!
Tonight, we are temporarily closing our Heartbreak Hotline... because we have a special guest.
Here with us tonight is the embodiment ol the playboys... players, and cheaters in town.
Let's just call him...
Andrew Escalona!
Straight to the question.
Why can't you be contented with just one woman?
Answer.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Isn't that too much?
Am I not allowed to greet lirst?
Can't I say hi to your listeners?
Guílty!
Check!
What did you expect?
Come on, Mr. Escalona.
Answer the question.
- Don't avoid it.
- Exactly!
Heidee, I haven't said anything yet but you've judged me already.
What il l tell you that I was content with just one?
That I loved her.
But she left me because of you.
Drama!
- Correction!
Because ol you!
- Please!
Because she caught you llirting with another girl.
Because you are a playboy!
Gotcha!
You're catching the wrong guy here.
I'm not guilty.
Heidee, you don't know anything about the situation.
And yet you're meddling in our relationship.
I'm meddling?
Your girllriend was the one who called us here.
Please!
Yes, but that doesn't mean that both ol you are right.
I'm not saying that she doesn't have the right to be angy at me.
Really?
I'm just saying that not all her assumptions are right.
And because you're not part of our relatíonshíp... you don't have any right to blow her assumptions out ol proportion.
You are not part ol our relationship.
But when you talk, it's as il you're my girllriend.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Are you ticked oil already, Mr. Escalona?
I'm here to delend the hearts broken by playboys like you.
Wow, then you must be a superhero.
Hey Super Woman, you've been sayíng repeatedly that I'm a playboy.
Ld me ask you, do you know what that term means?
Ol course.
Guys who play with the hearts ol girls...
like you.
Exactly.
Playboys play around.
They juggle dillerent relationships.
They are not seríous.
Alright, line.
To be brutally honest, I admit.
I was like that belore.
But just so you know, I've changed.
- Because I'm serious about Mel.
- There's a míracle!
Really now?
Seriously?
You know, the serious ones don't lool around.
You're so hard headed.
It's hard to talk to someone with a closed mind, you know.
ll you're really concerned about your callers Heidee... you should knowthem.
- l knowthem.
- Really?
You know eveythíng?
is that DJ Heidee?
Yeah, she's being attacked by her caller.
So, you know how long Mel and I have been together?
Do you know our lavorite pastimes?
Do you know how I pursued her belore?
Because, as you said, you know eveything.
Did you talk to our lriends?
Our lamilies so you could ask them about our relationship?
Why can't you say anything?
Because you know nothing.
This Andrew is a jerk.
Heidee, who are you to give advice to other people?
And where do you gd your advíses?
from the phone book?
from the ínternd?
Excuse me, that's not true.
Then where?
What do you know?
And besídes, why are you so bítter?
Ah maybe because no one líkes you.
Or maybe you have a míserable lífe... and you want the _ole world to be míserable too.
That's why you told my girllriend to leave me.
Why?
Have you ever experíenced beíng ín Mel's shoes?
Do you really know how it leels like to get hurt?
Heídee, have you been left before?
You tell us that you're a delender.
No, you're a destroyer!
You act as il you know a lot when in lact you don't know anything.
You don't know anything, Heidee.
And so listeners, this is Andrew Escalona.
And I am telling all ol you that you're listening to a woman... who doesn't know anything about what she's talking about.
I know, okay?
I know exatly what I'm talkíng about.
Because I was once looled and left by someone just like you.
Thanks, Andrew lor being our special guest.
Wow!
Is this night intense or what?
It's like having heartbreaks debate.
Well at least, both sides are clarilied.
And lor now, a song by Juris.
DJ Heidee will be right back later.
Or not.
Nope, she's not coming back.
Tomorrow again, then!
Once again, you're tuned in to Sikat Radio 104.3 FM.
What I said was right.
I know, they're all the same.
That's why you shouldn't let Andrew get to you.
ll they won't cheat on you, they'll leave you hanging... your ex was like that, remember?
Do you think you'll be happier now il you just stuck it out with him?
You should never have met him.
Yeah.
But il we didn't meet, then we won't have Elvis today, right?
Forget it.
Don't mind Andrew.
And don't be like me.
Just avoid him, okay?
Our turn?
Hold my hand I won't leave you on thís íourney ln thís world _ere nothíng ís certaín
- Hold my hand
- Yes, I know!
- Rock and roll!
- Yeah!
- Idol!
- Wow, a miracle.
We thought you'd delay your third take.
It's good that you made it in time.
Guys, don't stress out my idol.
Idol!
Good job last night, bro!
We heard you on the radio.
Heidee deserved it.
Imagine bro... you became the voice ol the ollended and misjudged men eveywhere.
He was the one who ollended and misjudged DJ Heidee.
You were just telling the truth, right bro?
You know what bro, I think you went a little too lar.
You didn't have to go that lar to prove your point.
And there are other ways to do ít.
Congratulations!
What an achievement.
Another addition to the list ol girls who cried because ol you.
Bro, I'll just lall in line.
Mommy, where's my souvenir?
Souvenír?
I have no budgd for that.
But a hug should do!
Age!
Don't be afraíd to age.
Because that's íust a number.
A-G-E ís bmer.
Yeah!
lPs good to have a good body.
It's bmer than beíng D-E-A-D
Let's take a break.

- Darling, don't you leel hot in here?
Hot?
That woman still had the hots lor me, huh.
Spicy!
Pablo, there you go again.
That's why mommy left you.
I was just kidding.
I really don't understand why guys like you can't be tamed.
Darling, you know that I'm just lor show.
I've had my share ol womanizing back in the day... but I already gave those up.
But what did your mom do?
She gave up on me right away.
How will she even know il l could change... il she has already turned her back away lrom me?
We all deserve a second chance, right?
And it's another sleepless night.
DJ Heidee.
Hi.
I miss you a lot.
Get well soon.
Don't let those bacteria win.
It's been two days and your lollowers... who are victims ol love miss you already.
And lor a change, I will be dedicating this song to you.
Here it is.
Right away.
Somdímes you'd feel the weíght of problems
Pull over now, Andrew.
Here.
That's their house.
Thanks, Ram.
I'll go ahead, okay?
Don't tell her that I was the one who brought you here.
Wait, is she still mad at me?
Why won't she answer my calls and te_s?
Ty wooing her lirst.
Huh?
Maybe she doesn't have any cellphone load that's why she can't answer you.
Okay, bye.
Thanks.
Later at mídníght
Paolo wíll go shoppíng
Wow!
It's Pablo Apostol!
Yeah, the one and only.

I just want to apologize to your daughter.
No apologies welcomed.
- Heidee, I'm sory.
_ Just leave, okay?
No.
You once told me that il a guy wanted to talk to a girl... then he should be persevering.
Oh, you told him that?
Heidee, please.
Why is it so hard lor you to lorgive?
Yeah, just like her mom.
Like mother, like daughter.

That's true.

I mean wait.
Wait a second.
You guys are so rowdy.
Let's lix this.
Can we do that?
George, this guy took the initiative to come here.
The least you can do is lace him.
- Yeah. I just wanted to--
- And you, kid!
Pablo...
And you kid, one more time that you make my Anaconda cy... I'll make sure that you'd borrow teeth lrom a rabid dog.
That would be worse!
You guys lix your problem.
You turned me into a rubber band.
- Thanks, Idol.
- You're welcome!
I'm sory.
My hand.
I just wanted to say sory.
Sory.
I'm really sory.
I'm serious. I'm truly sory.
You know, he's unlucky.
- Who?
- The guy who left you.
You don't even know him.
Besides, he's happy now.
He's happy with my best lriend.
What happened?
Okay, I know.
Let's pretend that I'm George and you are DJ Heidee.
I'll call Heartbreak Hotline to get your advice.
So, what will your advice be?
Hello Sikat radio listeners!
This is yours truly, Heidee!
Hello. I'm George Apostol.
My name may be George but I swear, I'm a girl.
Go!
What's your advice to George ol Pasig?
I'll tell her that "True Love" is dangerous!
That it's not real.
That she shouldn't believe it because it's vey misleading.
I'm sory.
Why?
You're not the one who hurt me.
I'm still sory that you got hurt.
And sory because I owe quite a lew girls that same sory.
So lor now, I'll start with you.
What about Melissa?
What's gonna happen?
I don't know.
Too bad.
I just really lelt like... she was the best decision I've ever done in my entire lile.
And then I ruined it.
I guess I'll go ahead.
It's kinda late.
- Okay.
- l'm really sory.
How should I call you?
Heidee?
George?
Heidee is just my screen name lor my work.
Andres Escalona.
Andrew.
George Harrison Apostol.
Nice meeting you.
Why are you laughing?
- Your name is pretty.
- You're laughing at my name.
- Nice meeting you, George.
- Okay.
Bye.
- l'll go ahead.
- Bye.
Bye, George Harrison.
Come in, Ma'am.
- Okay, thank you.
- There she is.
- You're the girl with Andrew, right?
- Yes.
Nanny, please tell her I'm tired.
Ah no...
Melissa, please wait.
Please wait.
Don't wory.
It's just me.
Andre_s not here.
Actually, you know me.
I'm DJ Heidee.
You called me at Heartbreak Hotline and I told you to break up with Andrew.
So Melissa, I'm on your side.
Yours truly, Heidee.
- What, she said that?
- Yup.
She said that you're the worst boylriend in the universe.
- That's exaggerated.
- Here, I have a list.
Number one...
No direction.
No locus.
Number two...
Insensítíve.
Number three...
Dishonest.
Number lour...
Inconsistent.
- Number live...and a whole lot more.
- Let me see that!
Give it back. I'll just give you a copy.
At least now you know what to change so you could win your ex back.
- Alright. I'll go now.
- Where are you going?
Home.
My mission is complete, right?
- You're old enough to know what to do.
- George.
What?
Don't scream.
What?
Don't leave me.
I still need you.
George, I don't know what to do.
I didn't even think that I'd be this bad as a person.
You know, in my whole lile... you're the only person who can tell me the truth.
That's true.
I promise, starting today, I'll listen to eveything that you'll tell me.
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.
Evey night, I can letch you and bring you to work.
Whatever you want, I'll give it.
Please, make me a better man.
We all deserve a second chance, right?
You're like this right now.
"Mr. l-A-S-H"...
Mr. "l Am So Handsome".
You don't know how to love.
You've got no direction.
- A liar and...
- Okay, okay I get the picture.
Sheesh!
In order lor you to get Melissa back, you have to be like this.
Focused.
With direction.
Loving.
Faithlul.
- Someone who smells good.
- Bdter versíon.
Not necessarily a better version.
Just the version that will match Melissa well.
So howwíll we do ít?
We'll do training.
ll you pass my standards, that means, you'll pass Melissa's as well.
You?
Why, who do you want?
Megan Fox?
I'll make sure she'll lall lor you even more.
Like this.
Hmm.
Smells good.
Maybe you're the one who'll lall in love with me..
Excuse me!
I will not lall in love with you, okay!
With this.
With this.
With any ol the three ol you.
What happened?
What's the stoy?
Call me!
Here at Heartbreak Hotline with yours truly, Heidee.
I have a point, right?
Wow!
I think Heidee ate a special meal tonight.
One plate of bítterness wíth lactobacíllí and energy!
Sikat Radio?
No need, thank you.
- Alright.
- Bye.
Are you okay?
You look sick.
Look at that!
You got distracted right away.
What am I supposed to do with you?
Here's lesson number one.
Pay attention so there would be no tension.
ll you already have a girllriend... then you should avoid looking at other beautilul and sey girls... so you can avoid temptation.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.
It's not too heavy.
Fail.
You just lailed the test.
Does this look light to you?
Andrew Escalona, lesson number two.
Be sensitive to the needs ol your woman.
When a girl tells you that she's okay... what it really means is that she's not okay.
And so, can you just do something now to make me okay?
I'm sory.
I thought you were tying to look strong.
Don't be stressed out, baby girl.
You're sweating.
What baby girl?
Take this.
See.
It's lovely, right?
It's the perlect place lor a date.
This is the place where you should bring girls.
You should take Melissa here.
Perlect.
I'm impressed.
But can I just ask?
I thought you hated that "love" thing?
But how come you know this place?
I know.
Maybe this is the place where your ex-boylriend takes you, huh?
Admit it.
Did you go here on dates?
Did you guys make-out here?
You're delusional.
Can we go now?
I'm hungy.
I'm sory about what I said.
I shouldn't have annoyed you about your ex.
Fake llowers lor lake apology?
You're allergic to the real ones, remember?
You're paying attention, huh!
So there would be no tension.
You see?
I take the things you're teaching me seriously.
Smell it.
It smells good.
- Smells good.
- Just like me.
Smell me.
Smell me here.
Come on.
Just once.
- Fine, you smell good.
- One more then.
- Sir, that's lor our display.
- Sory.
Sory, bro.
ll you really don't want to be a doctor, then tell Melissa and your dad.
Maybe that's the real direction Melissa's expecting lrom you.
For you to know what you really want out ol your lile.
Lesson number three.
You're the best, il you're honest.
- If you're about to say somdhíng...
- If you're about to say somdhíng...
Hey, where are you going?
It's closed there.
What are you tying to do now?
You said that I'm not allowed to look at pretty girls, remember?
What's so lunny?
Good morning.
- Would two be enough?
- Return that.
It's obvious that you don't do your groceries.
That's not enough lor the care package you'll give Mel.
Wait, let me do it.
- It's lor Mel anyway.
- l got it.
I saíd, I'll do ít.
Oh my!
You're sey.
We already got collee to keep her awake.
Then we should get pillows lor sleeping.
That's right!
In all lairness to you, you're being consistent.
And that's lesson number lour.
You actually know things.
Keep that up.
ll you'd be this consistent, lor sure...
Melissa's heart would go soft on you.
Like this.
What?
Calm down, sister.
Believe it or not, these guys also have hearts.
Really?
Did I hear that right?
Ha!
You think I won't light back, huh!
Darling, don't mind those heartaches or you might get a stroke.
Lucky girl.
Hello DJ Heidee, are you still there?
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, yes.
What's that again?
Yes !
More sure than closure.
Don't mind that!
It's lun to be alive.
Lile is so beautilul.
Let's all just love each other!
Okay!
Mery Christmas!
Fire!
Pablo asked me to give this to you.
I was about to help you but then you threw the water at me.
- Are you okay, baby girl?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Do you want a hug?
No!
What are you talking about?
It's hot in the kitchen.
I thought the place would burn down.
Go, wear some clothes.
That was tiring.
is there anything else?
Heidee, come on.
I want to go to Mel already.
So, did I pass?
Wait, okay!
I want to give her my care package already.
Then I'll bring her to the place where you took me.
Heidee, let's go. I don't want to wait.
What's that?
Give it!
Give it back!
Ah!
Don't use your style on me!
Give that back to me!
- You!
- So what is it?
You know, she's right.
You really rush things.
Rush things?
What do you mean?
You rush!
You really want me to explain?
You're always ready to attack!
It's like you're always late.
Or tying to beat a deadline.
You rush things.
You do things with haste.
Like that.
Hey, excuse me!
Wait...
I'm not like that!
Maybe she's the one who's slow.
Because all girls move slow.
- Fine, get it.
Read it.
- Go on.
Go ahead.
At least you know!
Go!
There's nothing here.

Hey, I don't rush kissing!
Why are you getting angy at me when it's Melissa who said that?
- Even kissing?
- l told you!
- l'll show you.
- Just ty!
You're so hard-headed.
Stop that!
Hasty, huh?
Stop it!
Gosh!
You know... you better listen, okay?
What?
Romance is a slow dance.
And that is lesson number live.
Kissing should have room lor missing.
Because the wait... is the bait.
It's about that moment belore the kiss.
That's where romance comes in.
And you want that moment to linger.
Keep eye contact.
Make her leel beautilul.
As il she's the only thing you can see.
You can touch her hair.
Her cheeks.
Make her leel sale.
Needed.
Loved.
Hair?
Cheeks?
Eye contact.
That's trouble.
How about Mel?
I thought you wanted to get back with her?
So, you don't love her anymore?
You know what, he won't lall lor George il he still loves Mel.
- So what is it?
Do you still love Mel?
- l don't know.
I'm getting conlused.
Bro, ligure it out.
Fix what's between you and Mel lirst.
And il you really have leelings lor George, make it clear to yoursell-- how you really leel and why.
Do you líke her or do you love her?
Do you really love George... or is it just because you no longer have any leelings lor Melissa?
And when eveything is linally clear to you... be a man.
Make sure it's clear to the both ol them.
There shouldn't be any gray areas here.
I agree.
There you go again!
Why are you looking at me like that?
Don't look at me like that!
What?
What?
!
You're meant to be with Melissa.
With Melissa, okay?
I don't have any leelings lor you.
Nothíng!
lero!
Nothíng!
Hey!
You've been here all along and you didn't even say anything.
How can I talk when you're talking?
Darling, let me check, okay.
They're lighting.
In here, happy.
In here, kill joy.
Who should I listen to?
Well... my dear.
It's like this.
Too much love can kill.
The lack ol it could also do that.
To live or to die is up to you.
I know.
Wait.
That's Ate Pars.
Wait a second, babe.
Thank you!
- Oscar!
Oscar, long time no see!
_ How have you been?

Still looking like a rock star!

You have a lot ol lans.
Wow!
Ho_s your album, anyway?

George.
Hi.
I'm sory.
It's a bit messy in here.
I have an LSAT tomorrow.
Really sory lor the mess.
Have a seat!
Have a seat!
No, no, no.
Sit here.
Okay.
So, when will that dinner date be?
I actually thought that Andrew would never make it up to me.
Did he actually think that I'd be the one running after him?
You know, I worried because I haven't heard lrom him lately.
That's because he became vey busy with rev--
Reviewing...
Wow!
You know what...
you really are good.
ll i'm the one telling him about his boards... watch out!
I'm just tying to be a good inlluence... but I end up looking like I'm the bad guy.
Yeah but... don't wory.
You'll be happy about him.
He has certainly improved.
He's vey mindlul now.
Sensitive.
A gentleman.
And he also has those little things that make you leel special.
Seems impossible, huh?
But he could actually change.
Well, that's a reliel.
My dad always asks me...
"Mel, where is you boylriend, the doctor?"
Actually, I haven't told my dad that he hasn't passed his nursing boards yet.
I mean, come on.
It's embarrassing.
- Hey, that's not true.
- But I hope he passes this time around.
I mean, it's cray to take it the third time.
Besides, when will he ever be a doctor...
when he's lorty?
That would be really embarrassing.
Super!
Thank you so much, DJ Heidee.
What's your real name again?
Maybe I can ask that since...
You know... we're lriends.
George...
George Apostol.

Too manly lor me.

Okay, let's go.

- Okay, sir.
I'm sory.
We just started lixing up.
No.
What are you talking about?
It's perlect.
Oh, Melissa's running late.
Maybe she got stuck in trallic.
I'm sure she's not too lar anyway.
Melissa?
Yeah!
Such hassle that it rained.
It's a good thing that I got here right away so I could check on things.
But don't wory.
She's vey excited to see you.
And hey, I built you up.
So you owe me one.
- You told her to come here?
- Yeah!
Why?
Aren't you excited?
The other day you were so excited to bring her here, remember?
- So I made it happen.
- George...
George, wait... ll l really wanted to see her... then I would've invited her a long time ago, right?
You weren't ready then.
Now, you're ready.
You're ready to lace her.
What il she's not the one I want to be with tonight?
What il l tell you that I'm happy now...

You're a lunny guy, huh?
Really lunny.

And lor Melissa and Andrew... my message lor you guys...

To be with the person they love.
But then again... wait, wait, wait!
Don't dream on!
Don't expect!
We're not a part ol that!
And hey, Andrew.

You're not going to be a nurse.
You're working hard to become a doctor.
- Mel...
- Won't your dad be disappointed in you?
He wants you to lollow in his lootsteps.
I know my parents will be disappointed in me.
So, I'll be disappointing your parents too?
There you go again!
What I'm saying is...
Would you rather that I tell them that I'm dating a car salesman?
What's that expression on your lace?
- l want to be honest.
- You don't have to be honest.
You know...
you need to locus on your studies.
You know what I learned, Mel?
When it comes to love, we should all be honest.
What do you mean?
Mel, I'm sory.
Is there someone else?
Idol, please.
It's important that I talk to her.
How can you talk to someone who's asleep?

And I just lound out that something's been going between the two ol them.
Smooth operator, DJ Heidee.
She's vey sneaky.

It's Mel's voice.

Aren't you the expert... _en ít comes to beíng left behínd and replaced by theír boyfríends?
Am I ríght, DJ Heídee?
Waít Angela, you saíd earlíer or your nanny... that you guys already broke up?
So he's already your ex?
Is that ríght?
That's not the point, DJ Ram!
I trusted this girl.
I thought she was my lriend.
But what kínd of a fríend ís she íf she'll íust steal your boyfríend away?
That's íust hurtful, ríght DJ Heídee?
And so, since you're the expert... what would you do il you were in my shoes?
Well, it's not right to interlere in other people's relationships..
Really now?
Then why did you interlere in my relationship with Andrew?
George Apostol...

- Hey, that's too much!
- What?
You dare to hang up on me?
- Andrew, where are you goíng?

You've got some nerve.
Hiding behind that radio show.
You pretend to be the champion ol the broken-hearted.
But ít's you who destroys relatíonshíps.
You knew vey well that Andrew was tying to get back with me.
But what did you do?

As Gary just said, there is something tragic occurred last night.
At first I want you to know that there spiritual help is available ... to talk with everyone as one feels that he needs it.
Another reason I'm here is that often as a young person commits suicide ... there is concern that others motivation in order to monitor that example.
If there is anyone who knows a bunch of people ... that you think that dealing with things like that ... then you must report that to us immediately.
We take the idea 'Copy Cat' suicide, very seriously.
We have learned from experience that's a reality.
Life must be respected.
The truth is that we all have thought about.
As strange as that may sound.
Life can be difficult.
We just want to know that we to make if necessary. an end

And deep inside we know that demons will ever disappear.
But not before we're dead.

But you have not login here ... if you are so nags every night.

What do we do?
This is not a decision we can turn back.
Amber means that it did not ...
- I hate you try to postpone.
That's why we're here, not Arch?
- It's not that I have not tried it.
It is not something you just do.

Suicidal tendencies or not, fat people should not eat carbs after noon.
Kenneth, please shut up.
Let us make a covenant, get it together.

I think those pills do sound good.
- We do not do it with pills.
We do it with style.
- It does not matter how God we go.
God?
- Who is talking about God?
For these things go to hell.
- There is no God.
How do you know?
- Samantha, think about it.
If there was a God, what would ...
- Jesus, Kenny, now hold on once.
What do you hang?
Of trees and stuff?
Yeah, I thought so too.
- Then you can not breathe and suffocate you.
I do not like the idea.
- Damn, we plan no party.
Well, to be honest.
Why do not we keep it simple?
We just jump off a building.
Fuck, I jump and then you go back inside.
I am for pills or poison, I not want to discuss about it.
Yes, I agree.
- Damn.
Are you in or not, asshole?
What can it matter to me, I'll play.
I gotta get to class.
See you later.
Is there anything you want to do die for you?
Yes, I want to win the lottery.
- Before you die, win the lottery.
Do not you think if you win the lottery, you want to live?
That's a good argument.
- So you're not romantic.
Would you want to be in love just like Romeo and Juliet?
Would you want that?
- This is not about me, Eden.
This is about you.
- Okay, I'll stay with the lottery.
One in 14 million.
- What?
Your chance to win the lottery is one in 14 million.
Statistically, you have six times more to be. chance struck by lightning
So what do you do before you die, Eden?
Yes, I want to ask a girl or they go out with me.
And she pretty?
- Yes, she's beautiful.
That's going a bit far for you.
- I see it as a last wish.
She pities you.
- Something like that.
Where is she?
I will ask it for you?
Yeah, okay.
That's her.
Marie, well, I'll ask then.
You really wanted that I would ask?
- No, I lied.
About?
- About who I wanted to ask.
So you're a liar?
Very disappointing.
No, I'm not a liar.
Who is it?
Jas.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm talking to you.
Do not you have eyes?
Do not talk to her.
- Come on.
Do not, please.
- Leave me alone.
The guy pushed you, Jas.
- Should I have let him beat you?
That was really romantic.
If you plan to have a drink with me?
- Yes.
This video diary of my life.
So, something like that.
My name is Samantha Reardon.
17 years.
In a few days I'm dead.
I now suffer from bulimia for five years ... and I do not. pull
I do not know if I should say I'm sorry ... not really.
I really tried.
I feel so alone.
I do not know why.
I can not ...
I thought maybe you were not coming.
- That's a surprise for you or not?
Why do you wear sunglasses?
Because I like to wear.
Then you feel a kind of famous.
You're weird.
- And you're so normal, Arch.
I do try.
- I know that.
How is your music?
- It's all right.
Coffee?
- Coffee, I thought you wanted a drink.
Coffee is a drink.
- I know, but I just assumed ... you meant alcohol.
- I do not drink alcohol ... that is bad for you.
- What can I get for you?
I think we are not here should be, Kenneth.
I thought you were a journalist wanted to be, Davey?
I give it to you on a silver platter.
So do not be a sissy.
So you give it exclusive to me?
Yes, damn.
But what are we doing here, mate?
- What are we doing here, mate?
I put some cameras because I want that everyone in the world can see this.
This is a fixed camera shot, Davey.
We use the images from the cameras ... along with those in the documentary style a portable camera.
How are your settings?
Goes well, it is not so ...
Then should we do with it.
Cameras with night vision.
Those guys make sure all the action.
And this will all record.
- Cool.
You really are a virgin?
- Yeah, why can not you believe?
I do not know, you're just beautiful.
- Just?
Well, very beautiful.
- And all the beautiful people are not a virgin?
Of course, but virgins 17 years old are quite rare in London.
I think it's nice to be rare.
And you look great, by the way.
- Thank you.
So when you imagine your parents?
-.
I do not know
They go crazy when they hear that I'm going to commit suicide.
What if I tell them that I tried you to keep away from it
They would probably say that you're talking about the wrong girl.
You're doing the right girl.
The world is just not good.
When you imagine me to your parents?
- I live with my grandmother.
What is she like?
- She's a party animal frankly.
I want to meet her.
- Yes, now?
Yeah, come on.
Why would such a beautiful girl think there is no other option?
I do not know.
It's heartbreaking.
What I do not understand, why she has come here today.
I do not understand.
Those damn kids
Would you do this?
- Yes.
Let's do it.
What are you looking for?
- A handkerchief.
Did you cut yourself?
- Yes, something like that damn tray.
The old hunting knife from my father is there.
A hunting knife?
Where he hunted?
He always took it as we went camping when I was little.
And where is he now?
In hell, probably.
No nightmares.
- Arch?
Is that a compliment?
Where are we?
- Where are we both?
You and me.
- We're in your bag.
Stay with me in life.
- What?
Let us live and then we'll see how it goes, Jas.
We'll see how it goes?
- Yes.
It's not going anywhere, Arch.
Jas, you put me thinking about how things ...
Do not be so damn nice to me.
- How could I have done to you?
I do not know, you do not know me.
- I know what I feel for you.
And I know that I do everything possible want to know about you.
What do you want me to tell you, Arch?
Want to share sad stories with me?
You want me to tell you that my mom was crazy when I was little.
And I left because I could not stand?
You want me to tell you that I sometimes same hear little voices they heard?
And Arch, I would rather die now, than I even a little as if it is.
Yes.
- You're not a superhero, Arch.
You can not save me.
And this is not the reality.
JANICE EDEN Beloved mother and daughter
Okay guys, that's the homework.
Until next week.
page but this week.
Well done, thank you.
Archie, can I talk to you?
- Yes.
How are things at home?
- Yes, well.
Are you okay with your grandmother?
- Yeah, why do you ask?
Because your homework deteriorates.
I was wondering whether it is okay.
I will try harder.
- I will not beg.
If you need anything, just ask.
I'm a friend, Archie.
And I know what's going on.
What was that about?
- He had a difficult time.
I just watch him a bit.
- Be careful.
I know you're involved, but do not get too close.
Yes, that's a good point, thank you.
You've done everything possible with Amber.
- Yes, I know.
Have you heard?
- Heard what?
That bitch has committed suicide.
- What?
That damned Barbie.
She herself cut open with her models job.
Slut who could not wait.
- Wait, Samantha?
Yes, Samantha, stubborn bitch.
- Where are the others?
Way.
We come across half an hour together, it's important.
They are always late.
I think that fat is stopped what to eat to get.
I can not believe Samantha really did it.
Through this kind of thing I think of my mother.
How they would feel.
- Be glad they still talking to you.
I'm indoors.
What is it with your family, McEwen?
You never talk about your little room.
Cannabis sell a girl pregnant, Father found out and sent me away.
That is severely punished.
- And your mother?
They chose his side.
- So you're father?
No, she had a miscarriage.
- Look who's coming.
Listen, I need to do something.
I'll see you at school.
Excuse me, I was wondering if you know anything about Samantha Reardon ... whether it was suicide or ...
- Sorry, I can not talk about it.
I organize a party ... and I would like it if you would come.
We have a free day, so I would do not know why.
Do you understand that you just police for our suicide have invited?
Do you think she's about 16 years?
- Yeah, so what?
I pull it anymore.
Who's there?
Hello?
Help me.
Why are you angry?
Well, I'll call the police.
This is not funny, Kenny.
This is not funny, guys.
Why are you doing this?
Hello, with the police?
Someone is trying to murder me.
I'm on the Wet College.
Coat, come here, what happened?
Come here.
I said, I'm there when I get there.
You know what I do for work.
I have to go.
Yes, I love you too.
Sorry, I want to stay.
Ask here
- No, I have it with Jasmin.
Do not worry about her.
It'll be fine.
It is important, come.
We want to know what you saw, when you found Jasmin.
She was locked in the box.
And that guy was gone when I got there.
Why are you asking me this?
Should you not pick these guys?
So you have not really seen this guy?
- No, like I said, he was gone ... by the time I came.
And it's a mess out there.
It's not that they invent.
- No, they did not invent it this way.
What do you mean, so to speak?
Archie, the family of Jasmin a history of delusions.
So we want to know if there really a crazy guy with a mask on ... was at the College ...
- Or that she imagined that?
Jasmin's mother dies to multiple personality disorder ... that means they sometimes alter egos has.
That can be very confusing for her.
But she is not her mother.
No, but it is often hereditary.
So you're saying it did not happen?
- No, I'm not saying.
We just do not know for sure.
- Why?
There were no real signs of a struggle.
One does not see masked man go away.
And the bruises Jasmin can they caused themselves.
It seems that you have already decided.
- Archie, the police ... a search begins for a masked killer, they should know the facts.
Well, I believe her.
- What you do or do not believe ... is not really relevant.
Can I go now?
- Yes.
Good.
That is the last time you see Eden's son.
Ask only those who inspires me, Davey.
- Who inspires you?
Do you have the song: "I do not like Mondays" ever heard?
About that girl ...
Wait a minute size, what happened?
Someone Jas attacked.
We need to find out who it was.
- Yes, it takes away our publicity.
This is the way Davey, he is doing publicity for our group.
Hello, how are you?
- Publicity?
Yes, I'll shoot him full.
- We're not losers, but with style.
What's wrong with him?
- He's always crabby.
Let's do an interview.
- That Bob Geldof thing ...
'I do not like Mondays' ...
- What's in that bag, Davey?
For if I need a blackout light and ...
Cool, well thought out.
So I ask yet again.
JAMESY, WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING?
Come inside.
How are you, darling?
- Well, thank you, Katie.
You should try to rest.
Jim and I are there.
We guard the fort.
Have you heard some of the College?
- Yes.
No one else saw anything, sweetheart.
Coat, do you know for sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
- Of course you know it.
Shall I get you something to drink?
- No, thank you, Katie.
Okay, goodnight sweetheart.
Goodnight.
Coat, it's me.
Why are you doing in my house?
- I rang ... but your family would not let me inside.
- You do not climb through windows at people.
Jas, I had to see you.
I have to trust you.
- You can trust me.
Coat, listen to me, I swear I would never hurt you.
No one will hurt you.
Come here.
Is it?
- Yes, well.
Shall we get something to eat?
- Yes, there is a Fatboy tent around the corner.
Let's go there, man.
Start filming.
What the hell is that, Kenny?
He is my father.
Good Dad?
But why did you?
- Move the camera back to me.
I thought, why I have to share the spotlight with those losers?
We're not going to die anyway, so why also the history books?
Are you going to shoot them?
- Yes.
Why commit suicide, if you a mass murderer can be?
So you want now as serial killer be remembered?
That's not a serial killer, Davey.
- Yes, because a serial killer kills ... more than three people.
- No Davey, a serial killer ... someone who is more than three people killed in a period of 30 days.
I do massacre, not like a mad, because I do it in different locations.
To be honest, I kill everyone at the party.
Everyone at the party.
- Write on, everyone on the damn party.
The damn party.
Have you talked to Jasmin?
-.
I do not know
I have not seen, so I do not know anything.
- Archie.
What?
- Think about it.
He appears suddenly, minutes after that the killer is gone.
Furthermore, no one will see.
Someone off
- Why would Archie, like murder Jasmin?
Why we plan a suicide pact?
Because we are unstable.
No, it was not Archie.
- I tell you ... there is psychotic on Archie written his forehead.
I do not understand why these two agents, hang on this Board.
They do nothing.
- And what about Mr. Hudson?
He always looks very scary to me.
- Listen, if it was someone, Kenny.
Kenny is really a suspect.
- Yes, but why?
He puts so much time in organizing of this whole thing covenant.
Maybe he got so excited, that he can not wait.
It actually does not matter anyway, we will still be dead soon.
We really go through with it?
We really throw everything away and say that there is nothing to live for?
I do not know what you think, but so are together with you ... is that I have my reservations.
Yes, I have first still a few things to do.
So if you stop?
- Ash?
I do not know, with the death of Amber and Samantha and now Jasmin ... which is attacked.
That makes you think the things that you leave behind.
The people.
Let's just about meditating.
And this.
We need something fun to do all together.
- I'm already on it.
Take a trip to hell.
- I've never been so happy.
Kenneth has told the others?
- Kenny is crazy.
Kenny can fuck off.
- Arch and Jasmin are not there.
They have something together.
- Do you?
I'm sure.
- Who can live on?
We go live.
- We go live.
We go live.
- I'm not living.
We go live.
- We go live.
Everyone dies.
MAM.
CAN WE TALK?
Watch it, asshole.
You had me, thick.
- I have nothing.
Come on, man up and down.
- I have nothing.
Leave me alone.
I'll kill you.
What is going on?
I'll take both of you sissies.
What is that thick?
Fat has a knife.
Come on, fatty.
Let's see if you're going to use it?
Give me that knife.
Try it with me, Curtis.
I know how to use it.
You're making a big mistake.
Arch?
What was that about?
Come and get me.
That hurt.
You call it arrive on time?
Kenny, it's over.
We do not.
- What do you say?
And if I find out that you have attacked Jasmin ...
I'll kill you.
Are you serious?
Come.
- I do not know if that was a good idea.
That asshole is an asshole.
It is past I'm out.
You can keep the money.
I'm out.
Do you think it was Kenny you tried to murder?
Where is your knife?
- We all need to pay attention.
Kenny is impaired.
- Why do not we tell the police
What should we tell them?
- He plans a suicide pact?
Then we are also involved.
- Maybe we can say that ... we think he has attacked Jasmin.
-.
They do not believe
Why not?
- Trust me, because Hudson thinks ... we're crazy.
- Hudson?
Yes, he's a fucking dick.
The best we can do, is going to the party tonight ... and enjoy the fact that we do not die.
Think you that a week ago, we wanted the opposite.
Yes, may we thank Kenny.
Why do not we just?
Murder him
That's what he wants.
Honey, I'm home.
Hello, where are your lips?
Honey, are you asleep?
No!
He's had it.
- Yes, he and his wife.
Damn, so Jasmin, might be telling the truth.
Yes, unless ...
- Unless what?
Unless they did it.
- Why would she do that?
I do not know, we have Archie told earlier that she was lying.
Maybe he told her.
She wanted to make her story credible.
And then killed Hudson.
Yes.
- Coffee?
We need tonight remain at that party together.
I can not believe that someone has planted so.
Yes, he must have heard that Archie was talking about him.
What do you mean?
- You saw how he looked at Curtis.
Archie is impaired guest.
I would not be surprised, as Archie was that guy.
Man, Archie is a good guy.
- Okay, I'm just saying.
Archie is different.
It puts me or thinking.
Why James had a knife?
Who do you, Curtis or Kenny?
- They can be both.
They are both impaired and to be honest ... there is the possibility that someone which we did not know.
Yeah, I thought so already.
Or that camera guy who is always with Kenny.
I have not seen.
- How have you seen him?
He is every day at school.
- No, never noticed.
In any case, I have to go.
All getting ready for tonight.
They are also ungrateful.
After all the work I did.
What will you do now?
Nothing has changed.
I do not want to die.
That has changed.
Come here.
Davey, my friend.
If you make a covenant with the devil ... you will not change my mind at the gate of hell.
Who's there?
I can not live without you.
Please do not fuck with me, girl.
There are not many girls who want to do this.
- Amber?
I can not live without you.
- Amber.
Who wants wine?
This will be a long night.
- A donut?
We will arrest them?
Yes, that seems like a suspect.
Well, there we go look around.
I want you filming everything, Davey.
- That's no problem.
Why look at your cameras?
If it breaks down, then I have a backup.
What are you crazy?
Hey man, nice party.
- Has she danced?
No, not yet.
- It is a show that I tell you.
Okay, this is it.
I'm going to murder anyone.
Yes, get ready for the massacre and violence ...
Shoot him, Kenneth.
That looks good, man.
The suspect has been arrested.
Hello.
- Hello, how are you?
Do you want some food?
- No, thank you.
Besides, I met someone.
- What now?
You do that soon.
- He's cute.
He's cute.
- Fun, what should you get to him?
About 18 cm.
Come, let's go upstairs.
- What?
To fuck.
- Maybe we can stay a while?
Come on, are you still a virgin?
Yes, something like that.
- Are you coming?
Jas.
- Hello.
Welcome.
- You look beautiful.
You too.
- Thank you.
Hello.
- Hello darling, I love watching you.
Where is James?
- He gets some action.
In my bed?
- Come on, Ash.
He deflowered, have mercy.
We are going to fuck.
I have to pee.
You screwed up everything, you fucking thief.
- Shut up.
What's this?
So what is the story for us?
- The story?
So, how will it end?
- Well, I thought ... that we will probably divorce and marry someone else.
and then one day, I see you again ... and I think, where you were all this time?
Why do we marry someone else?
A good story has a beginning, a middle and an end.
Arch, you have between meet other people.
You can not meet someone and end with those.
Because I want to finish with you.
Where are you going?
- In the toilet, is that allowed?
No.
Do not look at me.
I'm a little rosy, I want a drink.
- You take this, I'll get a drink.
Help.
What is going on?
This sucks, let's get something to eat.
- Yeah, okay.
Hello?
I began to worry me.
Worried
- Yes, it is difficult without light.
Where is everybody?
I do not know where the others are.
Come let's go to the main road we will arrange a taxi.
I'm gonna freshen up first.
Look.
Davey's video cameras.
Then we can use the night vision function.
- Cool.
It's like making a movie, right?
Would you want me in your film?
- Yes, you would be a star.
Archie Eden.
I do not like here.
I should drink some juice.
- Have a beer for me.
I twisted my ankle.
You're a kind of invalid.
I'm pretty strong, you know.
Rambo, there is no beer.
I do not know where I can stand.
God.
We are being watched.
I see nothing.
- I do, my watch and my jacket.
I want you to stay here.
I make room for my friend.
No.
- It's good.
I will not let you die.
- Stay here, please, I'm going.
Okay?
- Walk through.
Behind you.
Are you okay?
Drop it.
Lay him down, drop.
I'm a cop, drop.
What?
What?
It's good.
It's all good.
It's good.
Do not worry.
Listen to me.
Are you alone?
Everyone is dead.
You have to wait for me here.
Wait here.
I told you the pain attracts demons.
And I'm one of them, one of many.
The most dangerous kind, devils pay ... to see chase us on the weak their own demons feeding.
You must stabbing me in my side, here.
You have to do it, we are the only two who are still alive ... and he must think I'm dead.
Trust me.
I will not let you die.
Please, do not die.
Arch?
- Hi.
I can not die because I want to finish with you.
a final note yet:
Demons Never Die
All right, rise and shine!
Let's go, shit-wit!
- Help!
What's going on?
- Blood test come back positive for TB.
T...
How in the hell did I get TB?
Do I look like a doctor?
You got to go to the infirmary for quarantine till the tests come back clear.
Let's go!
Well, check my forehead.
That feel hot to you?
Open it up!
God damn it, Raylan!
I thought I was really sick.
Do you even know what TB is?
Well, all the masks and shit, I thought it was some kind of monkey virus, like in that movie.
We pulled you out for quarantine so we can talk without you taking a shiv for it.
But if you'd prefer to talk amongst your friends...
No, no, no, no.
No, I'm good.
I'm good.
- Then what's this about?
- You got to get me out of here, Marshal.
I can't deal with this kind of action.
Do you know what that is?
That's the world's smallest man playing My Heart Bleeds for You on a tiny violin.
Now, why don't you tell me why you dragged me down here?
I'll give you something good, you think I can get early release?
Well, that depends.
If you're not full of shit...
- Hand to God, Marshal.
- ...and if what you have to give me is in any way useful.
Well, for one thing, that town law fella
- you had bring me in?
- Doyle Bennett?
- He's a dirty cop, Raylan.
- No!
- Straight up.
- Dewey, the way this works is, you have to tell me something I don't know.
And then we talk about you getting into a halfway house.
Okay, fine.
That pretty boy molester that you all are putting the federal boot heel to?
- Jimmy Earl Dean.
- Hates you like poison.
- Yeah.
- So, when he found out what I did, you know, dressing up with the hat and all, well, we kind of formed a bond over it.
What fruit did this touching new relationship bear?
Well, he says you don't know half of what's going on down in Bennett.
He says if you did, you'd eat that hat, and he'd be the one to feed it to you.
Dean was the muscle for the Bennett weed trade?
He says no, that ain't all he was doing down there.
He says that the Bennetts are up to something big.
Did he happen to mention what that might be?
Well, not as such, but he did let on it might have something to do with the daddy of that girl he was sweet on.
"Sweet on"?
Is that why he tied up the 14-year-old girl and tossed her into the trunk of his car?
Told me she could pass as 16, easy.
- Dewey.
- What?
The girl's daddy.
What does it have to do with him?
When he first came by their house, he told 'em he was with the bank.
Bank?
Did he elaborate?
Yeah, he did.
He said, now, what'd he say?
He said he was with the bank, and then he said...
It's kind of complicated.
He's with the bank.
Did you get confused?
Do you understand mortgages and shit?
I don't.
Well, seems you're not alone there.
Well, so, come on!
What do I get?
That's got to be worth something.
If you want to get into a halfway house, you got to give me more than that, Dewey.
Come on, now.
Turn that frown around.
Hell, you give yourself a shave,
I'll bet you could pass for 16.
Hey, Mama.
She ain't here.
- What do you mean she ain't here?
- I mean she ain't here.
Well, who's minding the store, then?
What, you?
She said she had affairs to attend to, be back after 4:00.
And I guess she just up and left you in charge.
I find that very hard to believe.
Well, you're welcome to look around for her if it'll set your mind at ease.
You ain't got to get mouthy with me, girl.
Mama ain't never left me in charge.
Dickie neither.
And here you sit?
Well, it ain't as glamorous as it looks.
Goodbye.
You're supposed to leave money for stuff you take.
She told me to tell you that.
Well, you know what?
Now you can tell her that you told me, can't you?
I appreciate the courtesy.
Bye.
Raylan!
I just got a call that your daddy violated his tether again.
Well, if they find him, they can do with him as they see fit.
Hey, look what the cat dragged in.
Hey.
Who let you out of Harlan?
Well, they told me to drop on by, see how you big-time federal police get it done.
- Well, watch and learn, son.
- Yeah.
- Listen, I got a question.
- Shoot.
What would it take for you to let me have Marshal Givens come back down to Harlan, do some more of that task-force stuff we've been running?
Ordinarily, I would say, "Only if you promise to keep him."
But considering the epic backlog of work that he has, I got to ask, what for?
Well, because it seems like that Oxy bus is just sort of the tip of the iceberg as far as people trying to fill the Crowders' shoes down there.
And how exactly do you think Raylan here would be useful to you?
Well, Art, I've been in Harlan 18 years.
People still look at me like I'm some kind of Yankee come down there to burn their crops.
But this guy...
I know my people.
You're like the hillbilly whisperer.
- Put you on Oprah.
- I'll get my coat.
You can catch me up on the way down.
Just hold on, Cochise.
Now, Tom, I hear you.
And I know that Raylan here would probably prefer being down there running down this grudge, but I actually kind of need him here to do some marshal shit.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about whatever this business is with the Bennetts.
It is beyond the purview of what I like to call your job.
Speaking of which, I stopped by up at their place the other day.
Yeah.
You stopped by to do some dynamite fishing and see what you could get
- to bob up to the surface.
- On my own time.
Wearing your badge.
Anyway, I saw Loretta McCready.
Any sign of her daddy since we checked on him?
You know, it's funny you should mention McCready, 'cause I thought he popped back up in town last week or so.
Somebody's been cashing his state-benefit cheques.
But if you have a nice, close look at these signatures, they're a little inconsistent.
Are you thinking a forgery?
Kind of a shaky hand, wouldn't you say?
Standards appear to be slipping.
Gentlemen, this is really fascinating and strangely heartbreaking, but I just don't see what I get out of all this.
Mullen.
No shit.
Hold on a minute.
- Well, they found your daddy.
- Where?
Somewhere between the third and the fourth floor.
Here?
There.
You happy now?
- I don't know.
Should I be?
- Well, you won, didn't you?
Beat an old man down, got your way.
He's been at the Wild Turkey on the way up, so he's in a sulk.
Well, you violated your tether range coming up here, Arlo.
Brought you your damn money, so you can just cut this thing off my leg.
Well, math was never my prime subject, but this feels quite a bit south of 20,000.
Six thousand, thereabouts.
All I got left.
Take it or leave it.
I'll take it.
And you can take him to the cell.
- What the hell?
It's something, ain't it?
- He hasn't got any more, Raylan.
- That's it.
- I'm not running a yard sale here, Helen.
Arlo, you owe what you owe.
So, what?
I wasted my time, then?
Give me that money back.
You want to get out of your obligation, you give us the rest.
Or maybe you got $14,000 in information.
- What we paid for in the first place.
- Well, what you looking for?
Looking for who might trade in illegal papers, stolen government draw cheques and such in Harlan.
Now, why would I know anything about that?
I don't know.
Harlan County, petty bullshit crime, you.
Call it a hunch.
What's the play look like?
Someone's been cashing a man's cheques, and we don't think it's him.
Raylan?
This got anything to do with Mags Bennett?
I don't think so.
Can't help you.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Ask me something else.
I don't give a shit about "something else."
- For God's sake!
- Helen, you shut your mouth.
The hell I will.
I want you gone, and if this helps, good.
Raylan, there's only one man in three counties that'll give you anything like a fair deal on draw cheques.
And that man would be?
Boning you in the ass.
Go ahead, woman.
You already yakked up this much.
Lay it on him.
Helen?
Bowman Crowder.
Damn shame, man you want being dead in a box.
At the hands of your old girlfriend, wasn't it?
You let me know if you get him talking.
Be mighty interested to hear anything he's got to say.
All right, Boyd, one more time.
While you're taking the packets down to the splinter shaft, we're gonna transfer the cash to the truck.
Pruitt's gonna drive it down the mountain.
That right.
And Marcus and I join you in the hole.
And then...
- Boom.
- Drop the ceiling between us and the surface.
Now, the man guarding his take, now, I've known this man for quite some time.
He will not easily part with company money.
Who, Shelby?
Shit, Boyd.
Dude's older than shit.
Yet again, he's a steady hand on that .44 he keeps right underneath his desk.
You ain't gonna have to worry about Shelby.
Yeah?
Why is that?
'Cause you're gonna kill him.
Well, now, you never mentioned bloodshed.
Now, if you had brought this up earlier, I don't know if this conversation would be going on this long.
You've killed men for far less, Boyd.
Let's keep our eye on the prize.
Take Shelby down in the shaft until you set up the det.
Once it's wired, you lay a shovel upside his head real hard.
Cave-in will take care of the rest.
See?
That's the genius of the whole thing.
Everybody will think that he stole the money, tried to blow up the shaft behind him, but instead, premature detonation.
We was just the poor miners who got caught up in all of it.
Well, if this is gonna go down today, the devil lies in the details.
Stop worrying about the details.
Let me worry about the details, all right?
We're counting on you for one thing and one thing alone.
- What's that?
- You're the powderman, Boyd.
We need you to make sure this mountain don't come down on us and kill us.
Now, once you set it, we're gonna detonate remotely.
All right?
ATF will be all over this thing.
We don't need any extra det wire tipping 'em off.
Well, I should probably get that.
Hello?
Why, hello, Ava.
Ain't that his girlfriend?
He should be so lucky.
We should all be so lucky.
I'm listening.
I hear that.
Come on.
All we got to do is charge this thing up.
We're ready to rock.
Let's go.
- Let's wrap it up, Boyd.
- No.
That's just the TV.
I'm here all by myself.
You think he knows?
- Don't worry about Boyd.
- Kyle, what if he bails on us?
Then we do him now instead of later.
When he goes down in the mine, we'll just blow him up.
Pruitt!
I got to go now, Ava.
Got you on a tight leash, huh?
Well, I wouldn't say that.
What's it gonna be, Boyd?
We're running out of time.
Well, what it is that you're asking me to do, I can do.
But radio det adds a whole new host of complexities.
There's only one way this is gonna work.
How's that?
You and your boys, you do exactly what I say, when I say it.
That's the only way I can keep us all alive.
Well, hell, Boyd.
As many people as you robbed,
I wouldn't have it any other way.
- What are you doing?
- Dishes.
Is it charged?
No, Kyle, for the fifth time, it is not.
Who the hell is that?
That's the United States Federal Marshal.
Well, what's he doing here, Boyd?
I couldn't say.
Hey, Pruitt, what the hell is this?
Kyle, get out here.
Hello, fellas.
Don't believe I've had the pleasure.
You don't need to know us.
We mind our own business.
Suppose it'd be best you do the same.
Well, that wouldn't be like me.
What do we do?
My play's always to stop him before he gets on the front porch.
Shit, Boyd.
Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens.
Pleased to meet you, Marshal.
We're Boyd's friends from the mine.
We just come to pick him up for work.
That's all.
Nice to see Boyd's making acquaintances.
I'm gonna step up to the door now, Kyle.
Do you see that as being a problem?
Step inside to do the dishes for two minutes, look who comes by to visit.
Boyd.
Your friends and I were just getting acquainted.
I can see that.
What brings you up to the holler, Raylan?
Just need a word.
Why don't you go make yourself at home on the porch?
Now, Boyd, I've been doing this long enough.
I can spot outlaws at a thousand paces.
Your friends?
They're packing, one and all.
Well, I wouldn't know.
But I'm sure none of them is carrying with ill intent.
Well, that's good.
What are you after, Raylan?
Your brother, Bowman.
You know anything about him trading in stolen papers back when?
Draw cheques and such?
Well, there's little by way of illicit activity in this county that my brother did not have his hands on in one way or another.
Which is why I'm here.
You never really knew my brother, Bowman, did you, Raylan?
I saw him play football.
Gunned down in his prime by the very hand of the woman I now share his roof with.
Not hard to fathom his end, given the life that he led.
My brother Bowman did not deal directly in paper, Raylan.
He handed it off to this Jesus freak.
Runs that Christian ATV place up in Grant's Holler.
You mean old Winston Baines?
Take an ATV tour and get, like, a sermon on the mount?
Steward of the Earth, just like in Genesis.
Little twitchy.
I don't even know if he's still in the game or not.
Come on, Boyd!
Well, I guess me and these boys, we need to get on to work.
- Anything else you need?
- Not right now.
Well, you take care of yourself, Raylan.
You, too, Boyd.
Well, what the hell was that about?
Just some questions about my dead brother, Bowman.
Is that right?
What kind of questions?
Well, it's personal.
Besides, we got more pressing issues to attend to.
Is that right?
The battery, it's not taking a charge.
Don't know who you bought this thing from, but they must have seen you coming.
- Shit.
Are you kidding me?
- We got to pick up another one!
Hell no.
It's 90 minutes there and back.
We'll miss the shift.
Well, then we do it again next time.
There ain't gonna be no next time, Boyd!
- This is the only chance we got!
- The most important thing to know
- in this business is when to walk away.
- We're not walking away.
We'll hit up the Radio Shack on the way there, try to rig something up.
All right?
Let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
What are you doing now?
Writing a note to Ava and letting her know I'm gonna be late.
Damn, Boyd.
Done.
That didn't take long, did it?
If you want to make a living in this business, you got to know your ABCs.
"Always be cool."
You sure your Radio Shack work-around's gonna do the trick?
I'd hate to drive all this way for nothing.
Don't worry about it.
Just focus on setting them charges right.
I don't want to suffocate down there.
You will not die down in that hole, Kyle.
You have my word on that.
And you have my word these batteries are gonna do their job.
God damn, Boyd.
We're about to be rich.
How you like that?
"The Church of the Two-Stroke Jesus." That's good.
It's a good angle with the tourists that come to see the Bible Belt in action.
Honest-to-God church, sanctioned by the state.
Two things important in life, praise God and ride hard.
- Amen.
- I try to give each its due.
Was asking about cheques from the state draw, turned up cashed.
Folks say you might be a person to talk to about such matters.
Well, there was a time that I might have helped out my fellow downtrodden Kentuckians lay hands on their money.
You saying that time has passed?
The Lord has seen fit to bless my little off-road business in recent years.
Folks tour mountaintop removal sites, and bears have started to come back.
So, you wouldn't know anything about your signature matching up with the one of a Walt McCready, then, signed last week.
Say again? "McCready"?
Yeah, no, I got the cheques here with the samples of your first tour up at Big Sandy.
You want to take a look, maybe refresh your memory?
I need my glasses.
- Well.
- Let's see.
Son of a bitch.
Sounds like it's back up to about fifty percent.
It takes a while after that wallop.
Tased me in the nuts, you son of a bitch.
I tried to shoot you first.
I get up from here, I'm gonna grab that thing and cram it right up your...
Now it's back down to thirty.
McCready.
Don't know no McCready.
You ever been tased in the mouth?
Baines?
I'm just thinking that probably hurts worse than a jolt to the pecker.
Go ahead, then.
Do your worst.
I ain't telling you shit, or anybody else.
Man down!
Man down!
- Shut her down!
- We got a man down!
Shut her down!
Come on.
We got it.
We got it.
He's got the angina.
He's got the angina.
He just needs some fresh air.
He'll be all right.
Is he all right?
Watch out.
Clear a path, boys.
Watch out.
This way.
What are we waiting for, bitches?
Let's do this!
Hey, hey!
Cell phones.
Hand them over.
What the hell for, man?
Because, Marcus, we're about to set off a remote detonation.
That's 20 pounds of Emulex triggered by a radio signal.
Wrong signal on our frequency, we're all shaking hands with Jesus.
So I'm just being overly cautious.
Look, you'll get them back.
I just want to make sure that they're off, for myself.
Let's go.
Hand them over.
Damn, Boyd.
Damn it, Boyd.
What the hell?
Got it.
All right?
Let's go.
Hands up, fool!
This is a robbery!
Well shit, son, I can see that.
Don't get smart, Shelby.
Put your damn hands up.
Oh!
Woo, doggy!
How you like that, you old fruit bat?
No call to be disrespectful.
Shut up.
Boyd, put those explosives in the brown bag.
Get down.
Open it.
You got the det.
Why don't you just blow it?
I'd just as soon decorate it with your face!
You got the combination.
Now open it.
Come on!
Hurry up, damn it!
Marcus, you're making me nervous.
Would you please back up?
Come on, open it.
- Boyd, you about done?
- Jesus Christ, old man!
How many numbers is it?
Boyd, Boyd!
You almost done?
Almost done, Kyle.
Holy shit.
Woo-hoo-hoo!
We got the jackpot!
Boyd, would you please put all that money in that green bag?
Come on.
What is that?
It's a goddamn cell phone.
No, you turned it off.
You trying to get us all killed, Kyle?
You turned this off.
Get out of the trailer.
Go on.
Get out of the trailer, Kyle.
Get all that money in that bag.
Let's go.
These hillbilly doorbells really know a federal when they smell one, huh?
Aw, shit!
Better put the weed away.
Although, I got to tell you, I'm surprised they can smell anything over that shit.
Ah!
Dank and delicious.
Oh, I bet.
That's quite a hack you got there.
You don't cough, you don't get off.
So I've heard.
Yeah.
Listen, I know he ain't here, but you're in touch with Walt McCready, right?
Your mama said he was working for the family down south somewhere?
That's what she said?
Well, then, that's what she said.
I know you're cashing his draw cheques for him.
You sending him the money, or you keeping it for yourself?
Well, anyway, uh, if you see Walt, will you tell him I was asking after him?
What for?
Just a few things to clear up in this earlier case with the molester,
Jimmy Earl Dean.
Just dotting the I's, that sort of thing.
All right.
I'll let you get back to it.
All right, let's go.
That phone was off.
You checked it.
Yeah, then why did it ring?
I'll be holding on to that, in case one of you other dumbasses decides to let your cell phone ring.
These batteries will stay with me.
Hand him that shovel.
We're almost there.
Shelby, you're not gonna do something stupid and make me pop you in the gut and carry you down?
I will not.
Good.
You get this cash out of here.
I'll see you down in the hole.
Bring that detonator.
Put the money in the toolbox.
Let's go for a walk, Shelby.
Kyle, he's got the batteries.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Let me ask you something, Marcus.
How stupid do you think I am?
16 years in the Boy Scouts.
My daddy promised me a Marshall stack as long as I made Eagle.
Well, howdy, I tell you what.
I rocked out that summer.
The only other thing I remember,
"Be prepared."
Take my batteries, I'll get another battery.
Turn down right here.
Face that wall.
What are you gonna do with those explosives?
You gonna cave in this mine?
You just stay right there.
God damn it, Boyd.
If you're gonna kill me, just kill me.
You ready?
Hey, so long, there, Boyd!
What would have happened if they had checked that bag?
Then we'd be dead, Shelby.
I'm sorry to get you mixed up in this.
It wasn't supposed to go down this way.
Well, son.
I'm walking away, as far as I know.
Unless you're planning on putting one in me.
No, sir, I am not.
Well, then I guess you saved my life.
I got nothing to complain about.
Who'd listen if I did?
Well, then might I be so bold as to ask you for a favour?
Name it.
The cops are gonna come.
ATF, dogs, everything our federal government has to bear.
Now, you tell them that I had to go home.
It was an emergency, nothing else.
Do you understand?
Shelby?
Done, sir.
No one here.
Yes, I am able to see that, Coover.
Thank you.
You think he told the federal we gave him the cheques to cash?
Maybe we should ask the federal.
Oh, shit.
Do we run?
No, we do not run.
Reverend Baines must not have told him.
Otherwise, Raylan would be arresting us right now.
But he knows.
Yeah, he knows, but he can't prove it.
Raylan Givens!
Dickie.
There he is.
- How you doing, Coover?
- Raylan.
Eat shit.
So, what do we do?
Well, we drive on out of here and give Doyle a call on the way.
Get in.
Come on.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Well, I can see by your face you're somewhat troubled.
I can only imagine what I had to do with that.
"Call this number at exactly 6:05 p.m. Don't tell anybody."
Well, I admit it was terse.
I wrote it under some time pressure.
Boyd, what the hell is this?
A favour.
And what would have happened if I hadn't called?
Well, you wouldn't be speaking to me right now, Ava.
Damn it, Boyd.
What the hell you gone and made me a part of?
Just saving my life.
Nothing else.
What did I miss?
Coover came by with brother Dickie.
They were taking McCready's draw cheques to Baines.
I don't suppose Baines said anything to you, did he?
Some crazy story about you tasing him in the nuts.
I did.
Nice.
So?
So, either the Bennetts are just being neighbourly, cashing McCready's cheques for him and sending him the money...
Or he's dead.
The more likely option.
And I'm worried about that girl.
Me, too.
From what I understand about Loretta, she's a pretty tough kid.
She's fourteen.
What were you like at 14, growing up around these parts?
Call Child Protection?
And say what?
She's being clothed and fed?
Yeah.
Look, I got to get.
I got a world of shit coming off that explosion up at the Plackett mine.
Yeah, I saw the fire-and-rescue trucks.
- Collapse?
- No.
Somebody blew up a truck with Emulex.
Looks like they were fixing to rob the payroll, had some sort of premature detonation.
- Boyd?
- You mean is he dead or did he rob it?
- Either one.
- No sign of his body in the truck wreckage.
ATF is looking for him now.
I'll see you.
I don't believe they intended to let me live through the day.
Didn't think I was gonna find a way out.
Part of me just felt like laying down, letting it happen.
But you killed them instead.
Well, I gave them a choice.
Now, if they hadn't have pulled that switch on me when I was down there in that hole, things would have gone down different.
So the way I see it, Ava, they killed themselves, with greed and avarice.
When I called that cell, did I...
No.
It allowed me to kick them out of the trailer.
I put a little cash on the Emulex, a little Emulex on the cash, and I made sure that the blasting cap went in their packet and not mine.
You could have run when Raylan came by, just lit out and let the chips fall.
What does it say about me that that thought never crossed my mind?
Why did you agree to rob that mine in the first place?
Because it's what I do.
It's who I am, Ava, as hard as I've been trying to pretend otherwise.
Everybody else seems to know that but me.
Anyway, I came across that letter that you received from the bank.
Boyd, I don't...
I violated your privacy.
For that transgression, I do apologise.
So you know that they're after the house?
I don't suppose any of that money survived the blast.
There should be at least $15,000 to $20,000 in there.
That's not enough to pay it off, but enough to buy you some security for a little while.
Shit.
Ava, there's one more favour that I must ask of you.
Ava, you can help me or you can refuse.
Either way, I will understand.
But I'm gonna need to know your answer right now.
Hey, hey, here he comes.
Shit, Mama's with him.
Hey, Mama.
We need to talk.
Can I get you something, Mama?
Nothing's going to take the taste away from my boys going behind my back.
- Mama, we never went behind...
- Cashing McCready's draw cheques?
How long did you think it'd take before that'd come back on us?
Mama, that's that federal.
He's aiming for trouble with us, always has been.
'Cause of your actions.
Starting with hiring that pederast to do a job I give you.
I'm sorry, Mama.
Coover, I know you're sorry.
That's why it's gonna hurt so much to have to do this.
Hey, now!
Hey, hey, now!
Hey!
- Hey!
- Put your hand on the stump!
- Hey!
- Put your hand on the stump!
Take what's coming.
- Mama?
- I'm saving your gun hand, now.
Mama, don't hurt me.
Cross me again, and I will leave you nothing.
- Mama!
You ain't got to do this.
- You shut your mouth!
Mama?
'Cause you're crippled to the point of worthlessness it ain't you down on that table.
As it is, I have to hurt Coover.
And I like Coover.
Mama, I love you.
Mama, I love you.
Mama, no!
We need to talk about what comes next.
I'm sorry, Mama.
Mama.
I love you.
I'm sorry.
Gotta be shitting me, Loretta.
Twenty a gram for shake and seeds?
Plenty of other ways to get high, Levon.
You can always huff paint.
Got plenty of practise at it.
I'll give you 15 for a dub.
Dime is 10, hence a dub is 20.
It's simple math.
Shit.
Five-o!
Loretta.
I see you're keeping busy.
Marshal.
I had it in my head you weren't in the business of harassing growers and sellers of herbal relief.
Herbal relief, huh?
You'll notice I make no attempt to run or otherwise obstruct your investigation.
So I hope you'll take that into consideration before you start shooting.
That's funny.
Mind if I...
So, if you're not here to roust me over the weed, might I inquire as to your intentions?
I know you don't trust me.
I don't fault you that, though I like to think my getting you out of Jimmy Earl Dean's trunk might have earned me some traction.
I kicked a hornet's nest last night, and things may start to happen.
And I need you to know if you find yourself in trouble, any kind, you can call me.
I'll drop whatever I'm doing, and I will come for you.
You hear me?
Previously on Justified...
It was already in the glass, not in the jar.
I bet you're wondering why you had to stay at Doyle's last night and where your daddy is.
I decided to send him down south for a few weeks, handle some business for us.
I just find out you two are responsible for hijacking a shipment of Oxy, and I got to kill two morons to keep your asses out of jail.
Cutter and Elrod told me it was you right before I killed them.
Do you know who that bus belonged to?
- The boys up in Frankfort.
- That's right.
Now, you really want to stir up that hornet's nest, huh?
I ain't afraid of Frankfort.
Well, what about if Mama found out?
You afraid of Mama?
I also got a call from Dewey Crowe's lawyer.
Says Dewey knows about some shit going down in Harlan that might be worth our while.
What would you say if somebody had a friend who worked for the armoured-car company who could provide engine trouble four days running, stalling deliveries so there would be $80,000 cash at one time?
Then I'd say there's still no way to get down off this mountain without getting caught.
What if there's a way not only you not get caught, but get treated like a hero?
All right, rise and shine!
Let's go, shit-wit!
- Help!
What's going on?
- Blood test come back positive for TB.
T...
How in the hell did I get TB?
Do I look like a doctor?
You got to go to the infirmary for quarantine till the tests come back clear.
Let's go!
Well, check my forehead.
That feel hot to you?
Open it up!
God damn it, Raylan!
I thought I was really sick.
Do you even know what TB is?
Well, all the masks and shit, I thought it was some kind of monkey virus, like in that movie.
We pulled you out for quarantine so we can talk without you taking a shiv for it.
But if you'd prefer to talk amongst your friends...
No, no, no, no.
No, I'm good.
I'm good.
- Then what's this about?
- You got to get me out of here, Marshal.
I can't deal with this kind of action.
Do you know what that is?
That's the world's smallest man playing My Heart Bleeds for You on a tiny violin.
Now, why don't you tell me why you dragged me down here?
I'll give you something good, you think I can get early release?
Well, that depends.
If you're not full of shit...
- Hand to God, Marshal.
...and if what you have to give me is in any way useful.
Well, for one thing, that town law fella
- you had bring me in?
- Doyle Bennett?
- He's a dirty cop, Raylan.
- No!
- Straight up.
- Dewey, the way this works is, you have to tell me something I don't know.
And then we talk about you getting into a halfway house.
Okay, fine.
That pretty boy molester that you all are putting the federal boot heel to?
- Jimmy Earl Dean.
- Hates you like poison.
- Yeah.
- So, when he found out what I did, you know, dressing up with the hat and all, well, we kind of formed a bond over it.
What fruit did this touching new relationship bear?
Well, he says you don't know half of what's going on down in Bennett.
He says if you did, you'd eat that hat, and he'd be the one to feed it to you.
Dean was the muscle for the Bennett weed trade?
He says no, that ain't all he was doing down there.
He says that the Bennetts are up to something big.
Did he happen to mention what that might be?
Well, not as such, but he did let on it might have something to do with the daddy of that girl he was sweet on.
"Sweet on"?
Is that why he tied up the 14-year-old girl and tossed her into the trunk of his car?
Told me she could pass as 16, easy.
- Dewey.
- What?
The girl's daddy.
What does it have to do with him?
When he first came by their house, he told 'em he was with the bank.
Bank?
Did he elaborate?
Yeah, he did.
He said, now, what'd he say?
He said he was with the bank, and then he said...
It's kind of complicated.
He's with the bank.
Did you get confused?
Do you understand mortgages and shit?
I don't.
Well, seems you're not alone there.
Well, so, come on!
What do I get?
That's got to be worth something.
If you want to get into a halfway house, you got to give me more than that, Dewey.
Come on, now.
Turn that frown around.
Hell, you give yourself a shave,
I'll bet you could pass for 16.
Hey, Mama.
She ain't here.
- What do you mean she ain't here?
- I mean she ain't here.
Well, who's minding the store, then?
What, you?
She said she had affairs to attend to, be back after 4:00.
And I guess she just up and left you in charge.
I find that very hard to believe.
Well, you're welcome to look around for her if it'll set your mind at ease.
You ain't got to get mouthy with me, girl.
Mama ain't never left me in charge.
Dickie neither.
And here you sit?
Well, it ain't as glamorous as it looks.
Goodbye.
You're supposed to leave money for stuff you take.
She told me to tell you that.
Well, you know what?
Now you can tell her that you told me, can't you?
I appreciate the courtesy.
Bye.
Raylan!
I just got a call that your daddy violated his tether again.
Well, if they find him, they can do with him as they see fit.
Hey, look what the cat dragged in.
Hey.
Who let you out of Harlan?
Well, they told me to drop on by, see how you big-time federal police get it done.
- Well, watch and learn, son.
- Yeah.
- Listen, I got a question.
- Shoot.
What would it take for you to let me have Marshal Givens come back down to Harlan, do some more of that task-force stuff we've been running?
Ordinarily, I would say, "Only if you promise to keep him."
But considering the epic backlog of work that he has, I got to ask, what for?
Well, because it seems like that Oxy bus is just sort of the tip of the iceberg as far as people trying to fill the Crowders' shoes down there.
And how exactly do you think Raylan here would be useful to you?
Well, Art, I've been in Harlan 18 years.
People still look at me like I'm some kind of Yankee come down there to burn their crops.
But this guy...
I know my people.
You're like the hillbilly whisperer.
- Put you on Oprah.
- I'll get my coat.
You can catch me up on the way down.
Just hold on, Cochise.
Now, Tom, I hear you.
And I know that Raylan here would probably prefer being down there running down this grudge, but I actually kind of need him here to do some marshal shit.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about whatever this business is with the Bennetts.
It is beyond the purview of what I like to call your job.
Speaking of which, I stopped by up at their place the other day.
Yeah.
You stopped by to do some dynamite fishing and see what you could get
- to bob up to the surface.
- On my own time.
Wearing your badge.
Anyway, I saw Loretta McCready.
Any sign of her daddy since we checked on him?
You know, it's funny you should mention McCready, 'cause I thought he popped back up in town last week or so.
Somebody's been cashing his state-benefit cheques.
But if you have a nice, close look at these signatures, they're a little inconsistent.
Are you thinking a forgery?
Kind of a shaky hand, wouldn't you say?
Standards appear to be slipping.
Gentlemen, this is really fascinating and strangely heartbreaking, but I just don't see what I get out of all this.
Mullen.
No shit.
Hold on a minute.
- Well, they found your daddy.
- Where?
Somewhere between the third and the fourth floor.
Here?
There.
You happy now?
- I don't know.
Should I be?
- Well, you won, didn't you?
Beat an old man down, got your way.
He's been at the Wild Turkey on the way up, so he's in a sulk.
Well, you violated your tether range coming up here, Arlo.
Brought you your damn money, so you can just cut this thing off my leg.
Well, math was never my prime subject, but this feels quite a bit south of 20,000.
Six thousand, thereabouts.
All I got left.
Take it or leave it.
I'll take it.
And you can take him to the cell.
- What the hell?
It's something, ain't it?
- He hasn't got any more, Raylan.
- That's it.
- I'm not running a yard sale here, Helen.
Arlo, you owe what you owe.
So, what?
I wasted my time, then?
Give me that money back.
You want to get out of your obligation, you give us the rest.
Or maybe you got $14,000 in information.
- What we paid for in the first place.
- Well, what you looking for?
Looking for who might trade in illegal papers, stolen government draw cheques and such in Harlan.
Now, why would I know anything about that?
I don't know.
Harlan County, petty bullshit crime, you.
Call it a hunch.
What's the play look like?
Someone's been cashing a man's cheques, and we don't think it's him.
Raylan?
This got anything to do with Mags Bennett?
I don't think so.
Can't help you.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Ask me something else.
I don't give a shit about "something else."
- For God's sake!
- Helen, you shut your mouth.
The hell I will.
I want you gone, and if this helps, good.
Raylan, there's only one man in three counties that'll give you anything like a fair deal on draw cheques.
And that man would be?
Boning you in the ass.
Go ahead, woman.
You already yakked up this much.
Lay it on him.
Helen?
Bowman Crowder.
Damn shame, man you want being dead in a box.
At the hands of your old girlfriend, wasn't it?
You let me know if you get him talking.
Be mighty interested to hear anything he's got to say.
All right, Boyd, one more time.
While you're taking the packets down to the splinter shaft, we're gonna transfer the cash to the truck.
Pruitt's gonna drive it down the mountain.
That right.
And Marcus and I join you in the hole.
And then...
- Boom.
- Drop the ceiling between us and the surface.
Now, the man guarding his take, now, I've known this man for quite some time.
He will not easily part with company money.
Who, Shelby?
Shit, Boyd.
Dude's older than shit.
Yet again, he's a steady hand on that .44 he keeps right underneath his desk.
You ain't gonna have to worry about Shelby.
Yeah?
Why is that?
'Cause you're gonna kill him.
Well, now, you never mentioned bloodshed.
Now, if you had brought this up earlier, I don't know if this conversation would be going on this long.
You've killed men for far less, Boyd.
Let's keep our eye on the prize.
Take Shelby down in the shaft until you set up the det.
Once it's wired, you lay a shovel upside his head real hard.
Cave-in will take care of the rest.
See?
That's the genius of the whole thing.
Everybody will think that he stole the money, tried to blow up the shaft behind him, but instead, premature detonation.
We was just the poor miners who got caught up in all of it.
Well, if this is gonna go down today, the devil lies in the details.
Stop worrying about the details.
Let me worry about the details, all right?
We're counting on you for one thing and one thing alone.
- What's that?
- You're the powderman, Boyd.
We need you to make sure this mountain don't come down on us and kill us.
Now, once you set it, we're gonna detonate remotely.
All right?
ATF will be all over this thing.
We don't need any extra det wire tipping 'em off.
Well, I should probably get that.
Hello?
Why, hello, Ava.
Ain't that his girlfriend?
He should be so lucky.
We should all be so lucky.
I'm listening.
I hear that.
Come on.
All we got to do is charge this thing up.
We're ready to rock.
Let's go.
- Let's wrap it up, Boyd.
- No.
That's just the TV.
I'm here all by myself.
You think he knows?
- Don't worry about Boyd.
- Kyle, what if he bails on us?
Then we do him now instead of later.
When he goes down in the mine, we'll just blow him up.
Pruitt!
I got to go now, Ava.
Got you on a tight leash, huh?
Well, I wouldn't say that.
What's it gonna be, Boyd?
We're running out of time.
Well, what it is that you're asking me to do, I can do.
But radio det adds a whole new host of complexities.
There's only one way this is gonna work.
How's that?
You and your boys, you do exactly what I say, when I say it.
That's the only way I can keep us all alive.
Well, hell, Boyd.
As many people as you robbed,
I wouldn't have it any other way.
- What are you doing?
- Dishes.
Is it charged?
No, Kyle, for the fifth time, it is not.
Who the hell is that?
That's the United States Federal Marshal.
Well, what's he doing here, Boyd?
I couldn't say.
Hey, Pruitt, what the hell is this?
Kyle, get out here.
Hello, fellas.
Don't believe I've had the pleasure.
You don't need to know us.
We mind our own business.
Suppose it'd be best you do the same.
Well, that wouldn't be like me.
What do we do?
My play's always to stop him before he gets on the front porch.
Shit, Boyd.
Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens.
Pleased to meet you, Marshal.
We're Boyd's friends from the mine.
We just come to pick him up for work.
That's all.
Nice to see Boyd's making acquaintances.
I'm gonna step up to the door now, Kyle.
Do you see that as being a problem?
Step inside to do the dishes for two minutes, look who comes by to visit.
Boyd.
Your friends and I were just getting acquainted.
I can see that.
What brings you up to the holler, Raylan?
Just need a word.
Why don't you go make yourself at home on the porch?
Now, Boyd, I've been doing this long enough.
I can spot outlaws at a thousand paces.
Your friends?
They're packing, one and all.
Well, I wouldn't know.
But I'm sure none of them is carrying with ill intent.
Well, that's good.
What are you after, Raylan?
Your brother, Bowman.
You know anything about him trading in stolen papers back when?
Draw cheques and such?
Well, there's little by way of illicit activity in this county that my brother did not have his hands on in one way or another.
Which is why I'm here.
You never really knew my brother, Bowman, did you, Raylan?
I saw him play football.
Gunned down in his prime by the very hand of the woman I now share his roof with.
Not hard to fathom his end, given the life that he led.
My brother Bowman did not deal directly in paper, Raylan.
He handed it off to this Jesus freak.
Runs that Christian ATV place up in Grant's Holler.
You mean old Winston Baines?
Take an ATV tour and get, like, a sermon on the mount?
Steward of the Earth, just like in Genesis.
Little twitchy.
I don't even know if he's still in the game or not.
Come on, Boyd!
Well, I guess me and these boys, we need to get on to work.
- Anything else you need?
- Not right now.
Well, you take care of yourself, Raylan.
You, too, Boyd.
Well, what the hell was that about?
Just some questions about my dead brother, Bowman.
Is that right?
What kind of questions?
Well, it's personal.
Besides, we got more pressing issues to attend to.
Is that right?
The battery, it's not taking a charge.
Don't know who you bought this thing from, but they must have seen you coming.
- Shit.
Are you kidding me?
- We got to pick up another one!
Hell no.
It's 90 minutes there and back.
We'll miss the shift.
Well, then we do it again next time.
There ain't gonna be no next time, Boyd!
- This is the only chance we got!
- The most important thing to know
- in this business is when to walk away.
- We're not walking away.
We'll hit up the Radio Shack on the way there, try to rig something up.
All right?
Let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
What are you doing now?
Writing a note to Ava and letting her know I'm gonna be late.
Damn, Boyd.
Done.
That didn't take long, did it?
If you want to make a living in this business, you got to know your ABCs.
"Always be cool."
You sure your Radio Shack work-around's gonna do the trick?
I'd hate to drive all this way for nothing.
Don't worry about it.
Just focus on setting them charges right.
I don't want to suffocate down there.
You will not die down in that hole, Kyle.
You have my word on that.
And you have my word these batteries are gonna do their job.
God damn, Boyd.
We're about to be rich.
How you like that?
"The Church of the Two-Stroke Jesus." That's good.
It's a good angle with the tourists that come to see the Bible Belt in action.
Honest-to-God church, sanctioned by the state.
Two things important in life, praise God and ride hard.
- Amen.
- I try to give each its due.
Was asking about cheques from the state draw, turned up cashed.
Folks say you might be a person to talk to about such matters.
Well, there was a time that I might have helped out my fellow downtrodden Kentuckians lay hands on their money.
You saying that time has passed?
The Lord has seen fit to bless my little off-road business in recent years.
Folks tour mountaintop removal sites, and bears have started to come back.
So, you wouldn't know anything about your signature matching up with the one of a Walt McCready, then, signed last week.
Say again? "McCready"?
Yeah, no, I got the cheques here with the samples of your first tour up at Big Sandy.
You want to take a look, maybe refresh your memory?
I need my glasses.
- Well.
- Let's see.
Son of a bitch.
Sounds like it's back up to about fifty percent.
It takes a while after that wallop.
Tased me in the nuts, you son of a bitch.
I tried to shoot you first.
I get up from here, I'm gonna grab that thing and cram it right up your...
Now it's back down to thirty.
McCready.
Don't know no McCready.
You ever been tased in the mouth?
Baines?
I'm just thinking that probably hurts worse than a jolt to the pecker.
Go ahead, then.
Do your worst.
I ain't telling you shit, or anybody else.
Man down!
Man down!
- Shut her down!
- We got a man down!
Shut her down!
Come on.
We got it.
We got it.
He's got the angina.
He's got the angina.
He just needs some fresh air.
He'll be all right.
Is he all right?
Watch out.
Clear a path, boys.
Watch out.
This way.
What are we waiting for, bitches?
Let's do this!
Hey, hey!
Cell phones.
Hand them over.
What the hell for, man?
Because, Marcus, we're about to set off a remote detonation.
That's 20 pounds of Emulex triggered by a radio signal.
Wrong signal on our frequency, we're all shaking hands with Jesus.
So I'm just being overly cautious.
Look, you'll get them back.
I just want to make sure that they're off, for myself.
Let's go.
Hand them over.
Damn, Boyd.
Damn it, Boyd.
What the hell?
Got it.
All right?
Let's go.
Hands up, fool!
This is a robbery!
Well shit, son, I can see that.
Don't get smart, Shelby.
Put your damn hands up.
Oh!
Woo, doggy!
How you like that, you old fruit bat?
No call to be disrespectful.
Shut up.
Boyd, put those explosives in the brown bag.
Get down.
Open it.
You got the det.
Why don't you just blow it?
I'd just as soon decorate it with your face!
You got the combination.
Now open it.
Come on!
Hurry up, damn it!
Marcus, you're making me nervous.
Would you please back up?
Come on, open it.
- Boyd, you about done?
- Jesus Christ, old man!
How many numbers is it?
Boyd, Boyd!
You almost done?
Almost done, Kyle.
Holy shit.
Woo-hoo-hoo!
We got the jackpot!
Boyd, would you please put all that money in that green bag?
Come on.
What is that?
It's a goddamn cell phone.
No, you turned it off.
You trying to get us all killed, Kyle?
You turned this off.
Get out of the trailer.
Go on.
Get out of the trailer, Kyle.
Get all that money in that bag.
Let's go.
These hillbilly doorbells really know a federal when they smell one, huh?
Aw, shit!
Better put the weed away.
Although, I got to tell you, I'm surprised they can smell anything over that shit.
Ah!
Dank and delicious.
Oh, I bet.
That's quite a hack you got there.
You don't cough, you don't get off.
So I've heard.
Yeah.
Listen, I know he ain't here, but you're in touch with Walt McCready, right?
Your mama said he was working for the family down south somewhere?
That's what she said?
Well, then, that's what she said.
I know you're cashing his draw cheques for him.
You sending him the money, or you keeping it for yourself?
Well, anyway, uh, if you see Walt, will you tell him I was asking after him?
What for?
Just a few things to clear up in this earlier case with the molester,
Jimmy Earl Dean.
Just dotting the I's, that sort of thing.
All right.
I'll let you get back to it.
All right, let's go.
That phone was off.
You checked it.
Yeah, then why did it ring?
I'll be holding on to that, in case one of you other dumbasses decides to let your cell phone ring.
These batteries will stay with me.
Hand him that shovel.
We're almost there.
Shelby, you're not gonna do something stupid and make me pop you in the gut and carry you down?
I will not.
Good.
You get this cash out of here.
I'll see you down in the hole.
Bring that detonator.
Put the money in the toolbox.
Let's go for a walk, Shelby.
Kyle, he's got the batteries.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Let me ask you something, Marcus.
How stupid do you think I am?
16 years in the Boy Scouts.
My daddy promised me a Marshall stack as long as I made Eagle.
Well, howdy, I tell you what.
I rocked out that summer.
The only other thing I remember,
"Be prepared."
Take my batteries, I'll get another battery.
Turn down right here.
Face that wall.
What are you gonna do with those explosives?
You gonna cave in this mine?
You just stay right there.
God damn it, Boyd.
If you're gonna kill me, just kill me.
You ready?
Hey, so long, there, Boyd!
What would have happened if they had checked that bag?
Then we'd be dead, Shelby.
I'm sorry to get you mixed up in this.
It wasn't supposed to go down this way.
Well, son.
I'm walking away, as far as I know.
Unless you're planning on putting one in me.
No, sir, I am not.
Well, then I guess you saved my life.
I got nothing to complain about.
Who'd listen if I did?
Well, then might I be so bold as to ask you for a favour?
Name it.
The cops are gonna come.
ATF, dogs, everything our federal government has to bear.
Now, you tell them that I had to go home.
It was an emergency, nothing else.
Do you understand?
Shelby?
Done, sir.
No one here.
Yes, I am able to see that, Coover.
Thank you.
You think he told the federal we gave him the cheques to cash?
Maybe we should ask the federal.
Oh, shit.
Do we run?
No, we do not run.
Reverend Baines must not have told him.
Otherwise, Raylan would be arresting us right now.
But he knows.
Yeah, he knows, but he can't prove it.
Raylan Givens!
Dickie.
There he is.
- How you doing, Coover?
- Raylan.
Eat shit.
So, what do we do?
Well, we drive on out of here and give Doyle a call on the way.
Get in.
Come on.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Well, I can see by your face you're somewhat troubled.
I can only imagine what I had to do with that.
"Call this number at exactly 6:05 p.m. Don't tell anybody."
Well, I admit it was terse.
I wrote it under some time pressure.
Boyd, what the hell is this?
A favour.
And what would have happened if I hadn't called?
Well, you wouldn't be speaking to me right now, Ava.
Damn it, Boyd.
What the hell you gone and made me a part of?
Just saving my life.
Nothing else.
What did I miss?
Coover came by with brother Dickie.
They were taking McCready's draw cheques to Baines.
I don't suppose Baines said anything to you, did he?
Some crazy story about you tasing him in the nuts.
I did.
Nice.
So?
So, either the Bennetts are just being neighbourly, cashing McCready's cheques for him and sending him the money...
Or he's dead.
The more likely option.
And I'm worried about that girl.
Me, too.
From what I understand about Loretta, she's a pretty tough kid.
She's fourteen.
What were you like at 14, growing up around these parts?
Call Child Protection?
And say what?
She's being clothed and fed?
Yeah.
Look, I got to get.
I got a world of shit coming off that explosion up at the Plackett mine.
Yeah, I saw the fire-and-rescue trucks.
- Collapse?
- No.
Somebody blew up a truck with Emulex.
Looks like they were fixing to rob the payroll, had some sort of premature detonation.
- Boyd?
- You mean is he dead or did he rob it?
- Either one.
- No sign of his body in the truck wreckage.
ATF is looking for him now.
I'll see you.
I don't believe they intended to let me live through the day.
Didn't think I was gonna find a way out.
Part of me just felt like laying down, letting it happen.
But you killed them instead.
Well, I gave them a choice.
Now, if they hadn't have pulled that switch on me when I was down there in that hole, things would have gone down different.
So the way I see it, Ava, they killed themselves, with greed and avarice.
When I called that cell, did I...
No.
It allowed me to kick them out of the trailer.
I put a little cash on the Emulex, a little Emulex on the cash, and I made sure that the blasting cap went in their packet and not mine.
You could have run when Raylan came by, just lit out and let the chips fall.
What does it say about me that that thought never crossed my mind?
Why did you agree to rob that mine in the first place?
Because it's what I do.
It's who I am, Ava, as hard as I've been trying to pretend otherwise.
Everybody else seems to know that but me.
Anyway, I came across that letter that you received from the bank.
Boyd, I don't...
I violated your privacy.
For that transgression, I do apologise.
So you know that they're after the house?
I don't suppose any of that money survived the blast.
There should be at least $15,000 to $20,000 in there.
That's not enough to pay it off, but enough to buy you some security for a little while.
Shit.
Ava, there's one more favour that I must ask of you.
Ava, you can help me or you can refuse.
Either way, I will understand.
But I'm gonna need to know your answer right now.
Hey, hey, here he comes.
Shit, Mama's with him.
Hey, Mama.
We need to talk.
Can I get you something, Mama?
Nothing's going to take the taste away from my boys going behind my back.
- Mama, we never went behind...
- Cashing McCready's draw cheques?
How long did you think it'd take before that'd come back on us?
Mama, that's that federal.
He's aiming for trouble with us, always has been.
'Cause of your actions.
Starting with hiring that pederast to do a job I give you.
I'm sorry, Mama.
Coover, I know you're sorry.
That's why it's gonna hurt so much to have to do this.
Hey, now!
Hey, hey, now!
Hey!
- Hey!
- Put your hand on the stump!
- Hey!
- Put your hand on the stump!
Take what's coming.
- Mama?
- I'm saving your gun hand, now.
Mama, don't hurt me.
Cross me again, and I will leave you nothing.
- Mama!
You ain't got to do this.
- You shut your mouth!
Mama?
'Cause you're crippled to the point of worthlessness it ain't you down on that table.
As it is, I have to hurt Coover.
And I like Coover.
Mama, I love you.
Mama, I love you.
Mama, no!
We need to talk about what comes next.
I'm sorry, Mama.
Mama.
I love you.
I'm sorry.
Gotta be shitting me, Loretta.
Twenty a gram for shake and seeds?
Plenty of other ways to get high, Levon.
You can always huff paint.
Got plenty of practise at it.
I'll give you 15 for a dub.
Dime is 10, hence a dub is 20.
It's simple math.
Shit.
Five-o!
Loretta.
I see you're keeping busy.
Marshal.
I had it in my head you weren't in the business of harassing growers and sellers of herbal relief.
Herbal relief, huh?
You'll notice I make no attempt to run or otherwise obstruct your investigation.
So I hope you'll take that into consideration before you start shooting.
That's funny.
Mind if I...
So, if you're not here to roust me over the weed, might I inquire as to your intentions?
I know you don't trust me.
I don't fault you that, though I like to think my getting you out of Jimmy Earl Dean's trunk might have earned me some traction.
I kicked a hornet's nest last night, and things may start to happen.
And I need you to know if you find yourself in trouble, any kind, you can call me.
I'll drop whatever I'm doing, and I will come for you.
You hear me?
Previously on "Justified"...
It was already in the glass, not in the jar.
Gaahh!
I bet you're wondering why you had to stay at Doyle's last night and where your daddy is.
I decided to send him down south for a few weeks, handle some business for us.
I just find out you two are responsible for hijacking a shipment of oxy,
I got to kill two morons to keep your asses out of jail.
Cutter and Elrod told me it was you right before I killed them.
Do you know who that bus belonged to?
- The boys up in Frankfort.
- That's right.
Now, you really want to stir up that hornet's nest?
I ain't afraid of Frankfort.
Well, what about if mama found out?
You afraid of mama?
I also got call from Dewey Crowe's lawyer, says Dewey knows about some shit going down in Harlan that might be worth our while.
What would you say if someone had a friend who worked for the armored-car company who could provide engine trouble four days running, stalling deliveries so there would be $80,000 cash at one time?
Well, I'd say there's still no way to get down off this mountain without getting caught.
What if there's a way not only you not get caught but get treated like a hero?
All right, rise and shine!
Let's go, shit wit!
- Help!
What's going on?
Blood test come back positive for TB.
T...
How in the hell did I get TB?
Do I look like a doctor?
You got to go to the infirmary for quarantine till tests come back clear.
Let's go!
- Well, check my forehead.
That feel hot to you?
Open it up!
God damn it, Raylan!
I thought I was really sick.
Do you even know what TB is?
Well, all the masks and shit, I thought it was some kind of monkey virus, like in that movie.
We pulled you out for quarantine so we can talk without you taking a shiv for it.
But if you'd prefer to talk amongst your friends, we could...
No, no, no, no.
No, I'm good.
I'm good.
Then what's this about?
You got to get me out of here, marshal.
I can't deal with this kind of action.
Do you know what that is?
That's the world's smallest man playing "my heart bleeds for you" on a tiny violin.
Now, why don't you tell me why you dragged me down here?
I'll give you something good, you think I can get early release?
Well, that depends.
If you're not full of shit...
- Hand to God, marshal.
...And if what you have to give me is in any way useful.
Well, for one thing, that town law fella you had bring me in?
Doyle Bennett?
- He's a dirty cop, Raylan.
- No!
Straight up.
Dewey, the way this works is, you have to tell me something I don't know.
And then we talk about you getting into a halfway house.
Okay, fine.
That... that... that pretty boy molester that you all are putting the federal boot heel to?
Jimmy Earl Dean.
Hates you like poison.
So when he found out what I did... you know, dressing up with the hat and all... well, we kind of formed a bond over it.
What fruit did this touching new relationship bear?
Well, he says you don't know half of what's going on down in Bennett.
He says if you did, you'd eat that hat, and he'd be the one to feed it to you.
Dean was the muscle for the Bennett weed trade?
He says no, that ain't all he was doing down there.
He says that the Bennetts are up to something big.
Did he happen to mention what that might be?
Well, not as such, but he...
he did let on it might have something to do with the daddy of that girl he was sweet on.
"Sweet on"?
Is that why he tied up the 14-year-old girl and tossed her into the trunk of his car?
Told me she could pass as 16, easy.
- Dewey.
- What?
The girl's daddy...
What does it have to do with him?
When he first came by their house, he told 'em he was with the bank.
Bank?
Did he elaborate?
Yeah, he did.
H-he said, uh...
Uh, now, what'd he say?
He said he was with the bank.
And then he said...
It's kind of complicated.
He's with the bank.
Did you got confused?
Do you understand mortgages and shit?
I don't.
Well, seems you're not alone there.
Well, so, come on!
What do I get?
That's got to be worth something.
If you want to get into a halfway house, you got to give me more than that, Dewey.
Oh, come on, now.
Turn that frown around.
Hell, you give yourself a shave, I'll bet you could pass for 16.

¤ Justified 2x05 ¤ Cottonmouth Original Air Date on Mar 9, 2011
Hey, mama.
She ain't here.
What do you mean, she ain't here?
I mean she ain't here.
Well, who's minding the store, then?
What, you?
She said she had affairs to attend to, be back after 4:00.
Mm-hmm.
And I guess she just up and left you in charge.
I find that...
Very hard to believe.
Well, you're welcome to look around for her if it'll set your mind at ease.
You ain't got to get mouthy with me, girl.
Mama ain't never left me in charge.
Dickie neither.
And here you sit?
Well, it ain't as glamorous as it looks.
Mm-hmm.
Goodbye.
You're supposed to leave money for stuff you take.
She told me to tell you that.
Well, you know what?
Now you can tell her that you told me, can't you?
I appreciate the courtesy.
Bye.
Raylan!
I just got a call that your daddy violated his tether again.
Well, if they find him, they can do with him as they see fit.
Hey, look what the cat dragged in.
Hey.
Who let you out of Harlan?
Well, they told me to drop on by, see how you big-time federal police get it done.
Well, watch and learn, son.
Yeah.
Listen, I got a question.
Shoot.
What would it take for you to let me have marshal Givens back down to Harlan, do some more of that task-force stuff we've been running?
Ordinarily, I would say, "only if you promise to keep him."
But considering the epic backlog of work that he has, I got to ask, what for?
Well, because it seems like that oxy bust is just sort of the tip of the iceberg as far as people trying to fill the Crowders' shoes down there.
And how exactly do you think Raylan here would be useful to you?
Well, Art, I've been in Harlan 18 years.
People still look at me like I'm some kind of Yankee come down there to burn their crops.
But this guy...
- I know my people.
You're like the hillbilly whisperer.
Put you on "Oprah."
I'll get my coat.
You can catch me up on the way down.
Just hold on, Cochise.
Now, Tom, I hear you.
And I know that Raylan here would probably prefer being down there running down this grudge, but I actually kind of need him here to do some marshal shit.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about whatever this business is with the Bennetts.
It is beyond the purview of what I like to call your job.
Speaking of which, I stopped by up at their place the other day.
Yeah.
You stopped by to do some dynamite fishing and see what you could get to bob up to the surface.
On my own time.
Wearing your badge.
Anyway, I saw Loretta McCready.
Any sign of her daddy since we checked on him?
You know, it's funny you should mention McCready, 'cause
I thought he'd popped back up in town last week or so.
Somebody's been cashing his state-benefit checks.
But if you have a nice, close look at these signatures, they're a little, uh, inconsistent.
Are you thinking a forgery?
Kind of a shaky hand, wouldn't you say?
Standards appear to be slipping.
Gentlemen, this is really fascinating and strangely heartbreaking, but I just don't see what I get out of all this.
Mullen.
No shit.
Hold on a minute.
Well, they found your daddy.
Where?
Somewhere between the third and the fourth floor.
H-here?
There.
You happy now?
I don't know.
Should I be?
Well, you won, didn't you?
Beat an old man down, got your way.
He's been at the wild turkey on the way up, so he's in a sulk.
Well, you violated your tether range coming up here, Arlo.
Brought you your damn money, so you can just cut this thing off my leg.
Well, math was never my prime subject, but this feels quite a bit south of $20,000.
$6,000, thereabouts.
All I got left.
Take it or leave it.
Oh, I'll take it.
And you can take him to the cell.
What the hell?
It's something, ain't it?
He hasn't got any more, Raylan.
That's it.
I'm not running a yard sale, Helen.
Arlo, you owe what you owe.
So, what?
I wasted my time, then?
Give me that money back.
You want to get out of your obligation, you give us the rest.
Or... maybe you got $14,000 in information, huh?
What we paid for in the first place.
Well, what you looking for?
Looking for who might trade in illegal papers... stolen government draw checks and such... in Harlan.
Now, why would I know anything about that?
Oh, I don't know.
Harlan county, petty bullshit crime, you?
Call it a hunch.
- What's the play look like?
- Someone's been cashing a man's checks, and we don't think it's him.
Raylan, this got anything to do with Mags Bennett?
I don't think so.
Can't help you.
Oh, why doesn't that surprise me?
Ask me something else.
I don't give a shit about "something else."
- Oh, for God's sake!
- Helen, you shut your mouth.
The hell I will.
I want you gone, and if this helps, good.
Raylan, there's only one man in three counties that'll give you anything like a fair deal on draw checks.
And that man would be?
Boning you in the ass.
Go ahead, woman.
You already yakked up this much.
Lay it on him.
Helen?
Bowman Crowder.
Damn shame, man you want being dead in a box at the hands of your old girlfriend, wasn't it?
You let me know if you get him talking.
Be mighty interested to hear anything he's got to say.
All right, Boyd, one more time.
While you're taking the packets down to the splinter shaft, we're gonna transfer the cash to the truck.
Pruitt's gonna drive it down the mountain.
That's right.
And Marcus and I join you in the hole.
And then...
- Boom.
Drop the ceiling between us and the surface.
Now, the man guarding his take...
Now, I've known this man for quite some time.
He will not easily part with company money.
Who, Shelby?
Shit, Boyd.
Dude's older than shit.
Yet again, he's a steady hand on that .44 he keeps right underneath his desk.
You ain't gonna have to worry about Shelby.
Yeah?
Why is that?
'Cause you're gonna kill him.
Well, now, you...
Never mentioned bloodshed.
Now, if you had brought this up earlier, I don't know if this conversation would be going on this long.
You've killed men for far less, Boyd.
Let's keep our eye on the prize.
Take Shelby down in the shaft until you set up the det.
Once it's wired, you lay a shovel upside his head real hard.
Cave-in will take care of the rest.
See?
That's the genius of the whole thing.
Everybody will think that he stole the money, tried to blow up the shaft behind him, but instead, premature detonation.
We was just the poor miners who got caught up in all of it.
Well, if this is gonna go down today, the devil lies in the details.
Stop worrying about the details.
Let me worry about the details, all right?
We're counting on you for one thing and one thing alone.
What's that?
You're the powderman, Boyd.
We need you to make sure this mountain don't come down on us and kill us.
Now, once you set it, we're gonna detonate remotely.
All right?
ATF will be all over this thing.
We don't need any extra det wire tipping 'em o...
Off.
Well, I should probably get that.
Hello.
Why, hello, Ava.
Ain't that his girlfriend?
He should be so lucky.
We should all be so lucky.
Oh, I'm listening.
I hear that.
Come on.
All we got to do is charge this thing up.
We're ready to rock.
Let's go.
Let's wrap it up, Boyd.
No.
That's just the TV.
I'm here all by myself.
You think he knows?
Don't worry about Boyd.
Kyle, what if he bails on us?
Then we do him now instead of later.
When he goes down in the mine, we'll just blow him up.
Pruitt!
I got to go now, Ava.
Got you on a tight leash, huh?
Well, I wouldn't say that.
What's it gonna be, Boyd?
We're running out of time.
Well, what it is that you're asking of me to do, I can do.
But radio det adds a whole new host of complexities.
There's only one way this is gonna work.
How's that?
You and your boys, you do exactly what I say, when I say it.
That's the only way I can keep us all alive.
Well, hell, Boyd.
As many people as you robbed...
I wouldn't have it any other way.
What are you doing?
Dishes.
Is it charged?
No, Kyle, for the fifth time, it is not.
Who the hell is that?
That's the United States federal marshal.
- Well, what's he doing re, Boyd?
!
- I couldn't say.
Hey, Pruitt, what the hell is this?
Kyle, get out here.
Hello, fellas.
Don't believe I've had the pleasure.
You don't need to know us.
We mind our own business.
Suppose it'd be best you do the same.
Well, that wouldn't be like me.
What do we do?
My play's always to stop him before he gets on the front porch.
Shit, Boyd.
Deputy U.S. marshal Raylan Givens.
Pleased to meet you, marshal.
We're Boyd's friends from the mine.
We just come to pick him up for work.
That's all.
Oh.
Nice to see Boyd's making acquaintances.
I'm gonna step up to the door now, Kyle.
Do you see that as being a problem?
Step inside to do the dishes for two minutes...
Look who comes by to visit.
Boyd.
Your friends and I were just getting acquainted.
I can see that.
What brings you up to the holler, Raylan?
Just need a word.
Why don't you go make yourself at home on the porch?
Now, Boyd.
I've been doing this long enough.
I can spot outlaws at a thousand paces.
Your friends?
They're packing, one and all.
Well, I wouldn't know.
But I'm sure none of them is carrying with ill intent.
Well, that's good.
What are you after, Raylan?
Oh, your brother, bowman.
You know anything about him trading in stolen papers back when?
Draw checks and such?
Well, there's little by way of illicit activity in this county that my brother did not have his hands on in one way or another.
Which is why I'm here.
You never really knew my brother, bowman, did you, Raylan?
I saw him play football.
Gunned down in his prime by the very hand of the woman I now share his roof with.
Mm-hmm.
Not hard to fathom his end, given the life that he led.
My brother, Bowman, did not deal directly in paper, Raylan.
He handed it off to this Jesus freak.
Runs that Christian ATV place up in Grant's Holler.
You mean old Winston Baines?
Take an ATV tour and get, like, a sermon on the mount?
Steward of the earth, just like in Genesis.
Little twitchy.
I don't even know if he's still in the game or not.
Come on, Boyd!
Well, I guess me and these boys, we need to get on to work.
Anything else you need?
Not right now.
Well, you take care of yourself, Raylan.
You too, Boyd.
Well, what the hell was that about?
Just some questions about my dead brother, Bowman.
Is that right?
What kind of questions?
Well, it's personal.
Besides, we got more pressing issues to attend to.
Is that right?
The battery...
It's not taking a charge.
Don't know who you bought this thing from, but they must have seen you coming.
- Shit.
- Are you kidding me?
We got to pick up another one!
Hell no.
It's 90 minutes there and back.
We'll miss the shift.
Well, then we do it again next time.
There ain't gonna be no next time, Boyd!
This is the only chance we got!
The most important thing to know in this business is when to walk away.
We're not walking away.
We'll hit up the radio shack on the way there, try to rig something up.
All right?
Let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
What are you doing now?
Writing a note to Ava and letting her know I'm gonna be late.
Damn, Boyd.
Done.
That didn't take long, did it?
If you want to make a living in this business, you got to know your ABC's.
"Always be cool."
You sure your radio shack work-around's gonna do the trick?
I'd hate to drive all this way for nothing.
Don't worry about it.
Just focus on setting them charges right.
I don't want to suffocate down there.
You will not die down in that hole, Kyle.
You have my word on that.
And you have my word these batteries are gonna do their job.
God damn, Boyd.
We're about to be rich.
How you like that?
"The church of the two-stroke Jesus." That's good.
It's a good angle with the tourists that come to see the Bible belt in action.
Honest-to-God church, sanctioned by the state.
Oh.
Two things important in life...
"Praise God and ride hard."
Amen.
I try to give each its due.
Was asking about checks from the state draw, turned up cashed.
Folks say you might be a person to talk to about such matters.
Well, there was a time that I might have helped out my fellow downtrodden
Kentuckians lay hands on their money.
You saying that time has passed?
The lord has seen fit to bless my little off-road business in recent years.
Folks tour mountaintop removal sites, and bears have started to come back.
So you wouldn't know anything about your signature matching up with the one of a Walt McCready, then... signed last week.
Say again? "McCready"?
Yeah, no, I got the checks here, with the, uh, samples of your first tour up at Big Sandy.
You want to take a look, maybe refresh your memory?
I need my glasses.
Oh.
Well.
Let's see.
Sounds like it's back up to about 50%.
It takes a while after that wallop.
Tased me in the nuts, you son of a bitch.
Oh, well, I tried to shoot you first.
I get up from here, I'm gonna grab that thing and cram it right up your...
Now it's back down to 30%.
McCready.
Don't know no McCready.
You ever been tased in the mouth, Baines?
I'm just thinking that probably hurts worse than a jolt to the pecker.
Go ahead, then.
Do your worst.
I ain't telling you shit, or anybody else.
Man down!
Man down!
- Shut her down!
- We've got a man down.
- Shut her down!
Come on.
We got it.
We got it.
He's got the angina.
He's got the angina.
He just needs some fresh air.
He'll be all right.
All right.
Watch out.
All right.
Watch out.
This way.
What are we waiting for, bitches?
Let's do this!
Hey, hey!
Cellphones.
Hand them over.
What the hell for, man?
!
Because, Marcus, we're about to set off a remote detonation.
That's 20 pounds of emulex triggered by a radio signal.
Wrong signal on our frequency, we're all shaking hands with Jesus.
So I'm just being overly cautious.
Look, you'll get them back.
I just want to make sure that they're off, for myself.
Let's go.
Hand them over.
Damn, Boyd.
Damn it, Boyd.
"Call this number at exactly 6:05 PM.
Don't tell anyone.
Boyd."
What the hell?
Got it.
All right?
Let's go.
Hands up, fool!
This is a robbery!
Well, shit, son.
I can see that.
Don't get smart, Shelby.
Put your damn hands up.
Whoo, doggy!
How you like that, you old fruit bat?
No call to be disrespectful.
- Shut up, both of you.
Boyd.
Put those explosives in the brown bag.
Get down.
Open it.
You got the det.
Why don't you just blow it?
I'd just as soon decorate it with your face!
You got the combination.
Now open it.
Come on!
Hurry up, damn it!
Marcus, you're making me nervous.
Would you please back up?
Come on, open it.
Boyd, you about done?
Jesus Christ, old man.
How many numbers is it?
!
Open it!
Boyd, Boyd!
You almost done?
Almost done, Kyle.
Holy shit.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
We got the jackpot!
Boyd, would you please put all that money in that green bag?
Come on.
What is that?
It's goddamn cellphone.
No, you turned it off.
You trying to get us all killed, Kyle?
You turned this off.
Get out of the trailer.
Go on.
Get out of the trailer, Kyle.
Get all that money in that bag.
Come on.
Let's go.
These hillbilly doorbells really know a federal when they smell one, huh?
Aw, shit!
Better put the weed away.
Although, I got to tell you...
I'm surprised they can smell anything over that shit.
Ah!
Dank and delicious.
Oh, I bet.
That's quite a hack you got there.
You don't cough, you don't get off.
So I've heard.
Yeah.
Listen, I know he ain't here, but you're in touch with Walt McCready, right?
Your mama said he was working for the family down south somewhere?
That's what she said?
Well, then, that's what she said.
I know you're cashing his draw checks for him.
You sending him the money, or you keeping it for yourself?
Well, anyway, uh, if you see Walt, will you tell him I was asking after him?
What for?
Just a few things to clear up in this earlier case with the molester...
Jimmy Earl Dean.
Just dotting the I's, that sort of thing.
All right.
I'll let you get back to it.
All right, let's go.
That phone was off.
You checked it.
Yeah, then why did it ring?
I'll be holding on to that, in case one of you other dumbasses decide to let your cellphone ring.
These batteries will stay with me.
Hand him that shovel.
We're almost there.
Shelby, you're not gonna do something stupid and make me pop you in the gut and carry you down?
I will not.
- Good.
You get this cash out of here.
I'll see you down in the hole.
Bring that detonator.
Put the money in the toolbox.
Let's go for a walk, Shelby.
Kyle, he's got the batteries.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Let me ask you something, Marcus.
How stupid do you think I am?
16 years in the boy scouts.
My daddy promised me a Marshall stack as long as I made eagle.
Well, howdy, I tell you what...
I rocked out that summer.
The only other thing I remember...
Ah!
Be prepared.
Take my batteries, I'll get another battery.
Turn down right here.
Face that wall.
What are you gonna do with those explosives?
You gonna cave in this mine?
You just stay right there.
God damn it, Boyd.
If you're gonna kill me, just kill me.
You ready?
Hey, so long, there, Boyd!
What would have happened if they'd checked that bag?
Then we'd be dead, Shelby.
I'm sorry to get you mixed up in this.
It wasn't supposed to go down this way.
Well, son.
I'm walking away, as far as I know.
Unless you're planning on putting one in me.
No, sir, I am not.
Well, then I guess you saved my life.
I got nothing to complain about.
Who'd listen if I did?
Well, then might I be so bold as to ask you for a favor?
Name it.
The cops are gonna come.
ATF, dogs... everything our federal government has to bear.
Now, you tell them that I had to go home.
It was emergency, nothing else.
Do you understand?
Shelby?
Done, sir.
No one here.
Yes, I am able see that, Coover.
Thank you.
You think he told the federal we gave him the checks to cash?
Uh, maybe we should ask the federal.
Oh, shit.
Do we run?
No, we do not run.
Reverend Baines must not have told him.
Otherwise, Raylan would be arresting us right now.
But he knows.
Yeah, he knows, but he can't prove it.
Raylan Givens!
Dickie.
There he is.
How you doing, Coover?
Raylan.
Eat shit.
So, what do we do?
Well, we drive on out of here and give Doyle a call on the way.
Get in.
Come on.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Well, I can see by your face you're somewhat troubled.
I can only imagine what I had to do with that.
"Call this number at exactly 6:05 P.M.
Don't tell anybody."
Well...
I admit it was terse.
I wrote it under some time pressure.
Boyd, what the hell is this?
A favor.
And what would have happened if I hadn't called?
Well, you wouldn't be speaking to me right now, Ava.
Damn it, Boyd.
What the hell you gone and made me a part of?
Just saving my life.
Nothing else.
What'd I miss?
Oh, Coover came by with brother Dickie.
They were taking McCready's draw checks to Baines.
Mm-hmm.
I don't suppose Baines said anything to you, did he?
Just some crazy story about you tasing him in the nuts.
I did.
Nice.
So?
So either the Bennetts are just being neighborly, cashing McCready's checks for him and sending him the money...
Or he's dead.
The more likely option.
And I'm worried about that girl.
Me too.
From what I understand about Loretta, she's a pretty tough kid.
She's 14.
What were you like at 14, growing up around these parts?
Call child protection?
And say what?
She's being clothed and fed?
Yeah.
Look, I got to get.
I got a world of shit coming off that explosion up at the plackett mine.
Yeah, I saw the, uh, fire-and-rescue trucks.
Collapse?
- No.
Somebody blew up a truck with emulex.
Looks like they were fixing to rob the payroll, had some sort of premature detonation.
Boyd?
You mean is he dead, or did he rob it?
Either one.
No sign of his body in the truck wreckage.
ATF's looking for him now.
I'll see you.
I don't believe they intended to let me live through the day.
Didn't think I was gonna find a way out.
Part of me just felt like... laying down,
letting it happen.
But you killed them instead.
Well, I gave them a choice.
Now, if they hadn't have pulled that switch on me when I was down there in that hole, things would have gone down different.
So the way I see it, Ava, they killed themselves, with greed and avarice.
- When I called that cell, did I...
- No.
It allowed me to kick them out of the trailer.
I put a little cash on the emulex, a little emulex on the cash, and I made sure that the blasting cap went in their packet and not mine.
You could have run when Raylan came by, just lit out and let the chips fall.
What does it say about me that that thought never crossed my mind?
Why did you agree to rob that mine in the first place?
Because it's what I do.
It's who I am, Ava... as hard as I've been trying to pretend otherwise.
Everybody else seems to know that but me.
Anyway, I came across that letter that you received from the bank.
Boyd, I don't...
I violated your privacy.
For that transgression, I do apologize.
So you know that they're after the house?
I don't suppose any of that money survived the blast.
There should be at least $15,000 to $20,000 in there.
That's not enough to pay it off, but enough to buy you some security for a little while.
Shit.
Ava, there's one more favor that I must ask of you.
Ava, you can help me...
Or you can refuse.
Either way, I will understand.
But I'm gonna need to know your answer right now.
Hey, here he comes.
Oh, shit, mama's with him.
Hey, mama.
We need to talk.
Can I get you something, mama?
Nothing's gonna take the taste away from my boys going behind my back.
- Mama, w-we never went behind...
- Cashing McCready's draw checks?
How long did you think it'd take before that'd come back on us?
Mama, that's that federal.
He's aiming for trouble with us, always has been.
'Cause of your actions.
Starting with hiring that pederast to do a job I give you.
I'm sorry, mama.
Coover, I know you're sorry.
That's why it's gonna hurt so much to have to do this.
Hey, now!
Hey, hey, now!
Hey!
Hey!
Put your hand on the stump!
Put your hand on the stump!
- Take what's coming.
- Mama.
I'm saving your gun hand, now.
Mama, don't hurt me.
Cross me again, and I will leave you nothing.
- Mama!
- You ain't got to do this.
You shut your mouth!
Mama?
'Cause you're crippled to the point of worthlessness it ain't you down on that table.
As it is, I have to hurt Coover.
And I like Coover.
Mama, I love you.
Mama, I love you.
Mama, no!
We need to talk about what comes next.
I'm sorry, mama.
Oh, mama.
I love you.
I'm sorry.
Got to be shitting me, Loretta.
20 a gram for shake and seeds?
Plenty of other ways to get high, Levon.
You can always huff paint...
got plenty of practice at it.
I'll give you $15 for a dub.
Dime is $10.
Hence a dub is $20.
Simple math.
Oh, shit.
Five-O!
Loretta, I see you're keeping busy.
Marshal.
I had it in my head you weren't in the business of harassing growers and sellers of herbal relief.
Herbal relief, huh?
You'll notice I make no attempt to run or otherwise obstruct your investigation.
So I hope you'll take that into consideration before you start shooting.
That's funny.
Mind if I...?
So, if you're not here to roust me over the weed, might I inquire as to your intentions?
I know you don't trust me.
I don't fault you that, though I like to think my getting you out of Jimmy Earl Dean's trunk might have earned me some traction.
I kicked a hornets' nest last night.
And things may start to happen, and I need you to know if you find yourself in trouble...
any kind... you can call me.
I'll drop whatever I'm doing, and I will come for you.
You hear me?
Previously on "Justified"...
Mags:
It was already in the glass, not in the jar.
Walt:
Gaahh!
[ Wheezes ]
Mags:
I bet you're wondering why you had to stay at Doyle's last night and where your daddy is.
I decided to send him down south for a few weeks, handle some business for us.
Doyle:
I just find out you two are responsible for hijacking a shipment of oxy,
I got to kill two morons to keep your asses out of jail.
Cutter and Elrod told me it was you right before I killed them.
Do you know who that bus belonged to?
Dickie:
The boys up in Frankfort.
Doyle:
That's right.
Now, you really want to stir up that hornet's nest?
Dickie:
I ain't afraid of Frankfort.
Doyle:
Well, what about if mama found out?
You afraid of mama?
Raylan:
I also got call from Dewey Crowe's lawyer, says Dewey knows about some shit going down in Harlan that might be worth our while.
Kyle:
What would you say if someone had a friend who worked for the armored-car company who could provide engine trouble four days running, stalling deliveries so there would be $80,000 cash at one time?
Boyd:
Well, I'd say there's still no way to get down off this mountain without getting caught.
Kyle:
What if there's a way not only you not get caught but get treated like a hero?
All right, rise and shine!
Let's go, shit wit!
Dewey:
Help!
What's going on?
Blood test come back positive for TB.
Dewey:
T...
How in the hell did I get TB?
Do I look like a doctor?
You got to go to the infirmary for quarantine till tests come back clear.
Let's go!
Dewey:
Well, check my forehead.
That feel hot to you?
Open it up!
Dewey:
God damn it, Raylan!
I thought I was really sick.
Raylan:
Do you even know what TB is?
Dewey:
Well, all the masks and shit, I thought it was some kind of monkey virus, like in that movie.
Raylan:
We pulled you out for quarantine so we can talk without you taking a shiv for it.
But if you'd prefer to talk amongst your friends, we could...
Dewey:
No, no, no, no.
No, I'm good.
I'm good.
Raylan:
Then what's this about?
Dewey:
You got to get me out of here, marshal.
I can't deal with this kind of action.
Raylan:
Do you know what that is?
That's the world's smallest man playing "my heart bleeds for you" on a tiny violin.
Now, why don't you tell me why you dragged me down here?
Dewey:
I'll give you something good, you think I can get early release?
Raylan:
Well, that depends.
[ Sighs ]
If you're not full of shit...
Dewey:
Hand to God, marshal.
Raylan: ...
And if what you have to give me is in any way useful.
Dewey:
Well, for one thing, that town law fella you had bring me in?
Raylan:
Doyle Bennett?
Dewey:
He's a dirty cop, Raylan.
Raylan:
No!
Dewey:
Straight up.
Raylan:
Dewey, the way this works is, you have to tell me something I don't know.
And then we talk about you getting into a halfway house.
Dewey:
Okay, fine.
That... that... that pretty boy molester that you all are putting the federal boot heel to?
Raylan:
Jimmy Earl Dean.
Dewey:
Hates you like poison.
So when he found out what I did... you know, dressing up with the hat and all... well, we kind of formed a bond over it.
What fruit did this touching new relationship bear?
Dewey:
Well, he says you don't know half of what's going on down in Bennett.
He says if you did, you'd eat that hat, and he'd be the one to feed it to you.
Raylan:
Dean was the muscle for the Bennett weed trade?
Dewey:
He says no, that ain't all he was doing down there.
He says that the Bennetts are up to something big.
Raylan:
Did he happen to mention what that might be?
Dewey:
Well, not as such, but he...
he did let on it might have something to do with the daddy of that girl he was sweet on.
Raylan: "Sweet on"?
Is that why he tied up the 14-year-old girl and tossed her into the trunk of his car?
Dewey:
Told me she could pass as 16, easy.
Raylan:
Dewey.
Dewey:
What?
Raylan:
The girl's daddy...
What does it have to do with him?
Dewey:
When he first came by their house, he told 'em he was with the bank.
Raylan:
Bank?
Did he elaborate?
Dewey:
Yeah, he did.
H-he said, uh...
Uh, now, what'd he say?
He said he was with the bank.
And then he said...
It's kind of complicated.
He's with the bank.
Raylan:
Did you got confused?
Dewey:
Do you understand mortgages and shit?
I don't.
Raylan:
Well, seems you're not alone there.
Dewey:
Well, so, come on!
What do I get?
That's got to be worth something.
If you want to get into a halfway house, you got to give me more than that, Dewey.
Raylan:
Oh, come on, now.
Turn that frown around.
Hell, you give yourself a shave, I'll bet you could pass for 16.

Coover:
Hey, mama.
Loretta:
She ain't here.
Coover:
What do you mean, she ain't here?
Loretta:
I mean she ain't here.
Coover: [ Chuckling ] Well, who's minding the store, then?
What, you?
[ Snorts ]
Loretta:
She said she had affairs to attend to, be back after 4:00.
Coover:
Mm-hmm.
And I guess she just up and left you in charge.
I find that...
Very hard to believe.
Loretta:
Well, you're welcome to look around for her if it'll set your mind at ease.
Coover:
You ain't got to get mouthy with me, girl.
Mama ain't never left me in charge.
Dickie neither.
And here you sit?
Loretta:
Well, it ain't as glamorous as it looks.
Coover:
Mm-hmm.
Goodbye.
Loretta:
You're supposed to leave money for stuff you take.
She told me to tell you that.
Coover:
Well, you know what?
Now you can tell her that you told me, can't you?
[ Door opens ]
[ Door closes ]
Art:
I appreciate the courtesy.
Bye.
Raylan!
I just got a call that your daddy violated his tether again.
Raylan:
Well, if they find him, they can do with him as they see fit.
Art:
Hey, look what the cat dragged in.
Raylan:
Hey.
Who let you out of Harlan?
Tom:
Well, they told me to drop on by, see how you big-time federal police get it done.
Art:
Well, watch and learn, son.
Tom:
Yeah.
Listen, I got a question.
Art:
Shoot.
Tom:
What would it take for you to let me have marshal Givens back down to Harlan, do some more of that task-force stuff we've been running?
Art:
Ordinarily, I would say, "only if you promise to keep him."
But considering the epic backlog of work that he has, I got to ask, what for?
Tom:
Well, because it seems like that oxy bust is just sort of the tip of the iceberg as far as people trying to fill the Crowders' shoes down there.
Art:
And how exactly do you think Raylan here would be useful to you?
Tom:
Well, Art, I've been in Harlan 18 years.
People still look at me like I'm some kind of Yankee come down there to burn their crops.
But this guy...
Raylan:
I know my people.
Art:
You're like the hillbilly whisperer.
Put you on "Oprah."
Raylan:
I'll get my coat.
You can catch me up on the way down.
Art:
Just hold on, Cochise.
Now, Tom, I hear you.
And I know that Raylan here would probably prefer being down there running down this grudge, but I actually kind of need him here to do some marshal shit.
Raylan:
What are you talking about?
Art:
I'm talking about whatever this business is with the Bennetts.
It is beyond the purview of what I like to call your job.
Raylan:
Speaking of which, I stopped by up at their place the other day.
Art:
Yeah.
You stopped by to do some dynamite fishing and see what you could get to bob up to the surface.
Raylan:
On my own time.
Art:
Wearing your badge.
Raylan:
Anyway, I saw Loretta McCready.
Any sign of her daddy since we checked on him?
Tom:
You know, it's funny you should mention McCready, 'cause
I thought he'd popped back up in town last week or so.
Somebody's been cashing his state-benefit checks.
But if you have a nice, close look at these signatures, they're a little, uh, inconsistent.
Raylan:
Are you thinking a forgery?
Tom:
Kind of a shaky hand, wouldn't you say?
Raylan:
Standards appear to be slipping.
Art:
Gentlemen, this is really fascinating and strangely heartbreaking, but I just don't see what I get out of all this.
Mullen. [ Clears throat ]
No shit.
[ Chuckles ] Hold on a minute.
Well, they found your daddy.
Raylan:
Where?
Art:
Somewhere between the third and the fourth floor.
Raylan:
H-here?
Arlo:
There.
You happy now?
Raylan:
I don't know.
Should I be?
Arlo:
Well, you won, didn't you?
Beat an old man down, got your way.
Helen:
He's been at the wild turkey on the way up, so he's in a sulk.
Raylan:
Well, you violated your tether range coming up here, Arlo.
Arlo:
Brought you your damn money, so you can just cut this thing off my leg.
Raylan:
Well, math was never my prime subject, but this feels quite a bit south of $20,000.
Arlo: $6,000, thereabouts.
All I got left.
Take it or leave it.
Raylan:
Oh, I'll take it.
And you can take him to the cell.
Arlo:
What the hell?
It's something, ain't it?
Helen:
He hasn't got any more, Raylan.
That's it.
Raylan:
I'm not running a yard sale, Helen.
Arlo, you owe what you owe.
Arlo:
So, what?
I wasted my time, then?
Give me that money back.
Raylan:
You want to get out of your obligation, you give us the rest.
Or... maybe you got $14,000 in information, huh?
What we paid for in the first place.
Arlo:
Well, what you looking for?
Raylan:
Looking for who might trade in illegal papers... stolen government draw checks and such... in Harlan.
Arlo:
Now, why would I know anything about that?
Raylan:
Oh, I don't know.
Harlan county, petty bullshit crime, you?
Call it a hunch.
Helen:
What's the play look like?
Raylan:
Someone's been cashing a man's checks, and we don't think it's him.
Helen:
Raylan, this got anything to do with Mags Bennett?
Raylan: [ Clicks tongue ] I don't think so.
Arlo:
Can't help you.
Raylan:
Oh, why doesn't that surprise me?
Arlo:
Ask me something else.
Raylan:
I don't give a shit about "something else."
Helen:
Oh, for God's sake!
Arlo:
Helen, you shut your mouth.
Helen:
The hell I will.
I want you gone, and if this helps, good.
Raylan, there's only one man in three counties that'll give you anything like a fair deal on draw checks.
Raylan:
And that man would be?
Arlo:
Boning you in the ass.
Go ahead, woman.
You already yakked up this much.
Lay it on him.
Raylan:
Helen?
Helen:
Bowman Crowder.
Art:
Damn shame, man you want being dead in a box at the hands of your old girlfriend, wasn't it?
[ Chuckles ]
You let me know if you get him talking.
Be mighty interested to hear anything he's got to say.
Kyle:
All right, Boyd, one more time.
While you're taking the packets down to the splinter shaft, we're gonna transfer the cash to the truck.
Boyd:
Pruitt's gonna drive it down the mountain.
Kyle:
That's right.
And Marcus and I join you in the hole.
And then...
Marcus:
Boom.
Kyle:
Drop the ceiling between us and the surface.
Boyd:
Now, the man guarding his take...
Now, I've known this man for quite some time.
He will not easily part with company money.
Kyle:
Who, Shelby?
Shit, Boyd.
Dude's older than shit.
Boyd:
Yet again, he's a steady hand on that .44 he keeps right underneath his desk.
Kyle: [ Laughs ]
You ain't gonna have to worry about Shelby.
Boyd:
Yeah?
Why is that?
Marcus: 'Cause you're gonna kill him.
Boyd:
Well, now, you...
Never mentioned bloodshed.
Now, if you had brought this up earlier, I don't know if this conversation would be going on this long.
Kyle:
You've killed men for far less, Boyd.
Let's keep our eye on the prize.
Marcus:
Take Shelby down in the shaft until you set up the det.
Once it's wired, you lay a shovel upside his head real hard.
Cave-in will take care of the rest.
Kyle:
See?
That's the genius of the whole thing.
Everybody will think that he stole the money, tried to blow up the shaft behind him, but instead, premature detonation.
We was just the poor miners who got caught up in all of it.
Boyd:
Well, if this is gonna go down today, the devil lies in the details.
Kyle:
Stop worrying about the details.
Let me worry about the details, all right?
We're counting on you for one thing and one thing alone.
Boyd:
What's that?
Kyle:
You're the powderman, Boyd.
We need you to make sure this mountain don't come down on us and kill us.
Now, once you set it, we're gonna detonate remotely.
All right?
ATF will be all over this thing.
We don't need any extra det wire tipping 'em o... [ Telephone ringing ]
Off.
Boyd:
Well, I should probably get that.
Boyd:
Hello.
Why, hello, Ava.
Marcus:
Ain't that his girlfriend?
Kyle:
He should be so lucky.
Marcus:
We should all be so lucky.
Boyd:
Oh, I'm listening.
I hear that.
Kyle:
Come on.
All we got to do is charge this thing up.
We're ready to rock.
Let's go.
Pruitt:
Let's wrap it up, Boyd.
Boyd:
No.
That's just the TV.
I'm here all by myself.
Marcus:
You think he knows?
Kyle: [ Laughs ]
Don't worry about Boyd.
Marcus:
Kyle, what if he bails on us?
Kyle:
Then we do him now instead of later.
Marcus: [ Chuckles ]
Kyle:
When he goes down in the mine, we'll just blow him up.
Pruitt!
Boyd:
I got to go now, Ava.
Marcus:
Got you on a tight leash, huh?
Boyd:
Well, I wouldn't say that.
Kyle:
What's it gonna be, Boyd?
We're running out of time.
Boyd:
Well, what it is that you're asking of me to do, I can do.
But radio det adds a whole new host of complexities.
There's only one way this is gonna work.
Kyle:
How's that?
Boyd:
You and your boys, you do exactly what I say, when I say it.
That's the only way I can keep us all alive.
Kyle:
Well, hell, Boyd.
As many people as you robbed...
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Kyle:
What are you doing?
Boyd:
Dishes.
Kyle:
Is it charged?
Boyd:
No, Kyle, for the fifth time, it is not.
Kyle:
Who the hell is that?
Boyd:
That's the United States federal marshal.
Kyle:
Well, what's he doing re, Boyd?
!
Boyd:
I couldn't say.
Kyle:
Hey, Pruitt, what the hell is this?
Pruitt:
Kyle, get out here.
Raylan:
Hello, fellas.
Don't believe I've had the pleasure.
You don't need to know us.
We mind our own business.
Suppose it'd be best you do the same.
Raylan:
Well, that wouldn't be like me.
Kyle:
What do we do?
Boyd:
My play's always to stop him before he gets on the front porch.
Kyle:
Shit, Boyd.
Raylan:
Deputy U.S. marshal Raylan Givens.
Kyle:
Pleased to meet you, marshal.
We're Boyd's friends from the mine.
We just come to pick him up for work.
That's all.
Raylan:
Oh.
Nice to see Boyd's making acquaintances.
[ Beeping ]
Raylan:
I'm gonna step up to the door now, Kyle.
Do you see that as being a problem?
Boyd:
Step inside to do the dishes for two minutes...
Look who comes by to visit.
Raylan:
Boyd.
Your friends and I were just getting acquainted.
Boyd:
I can see that.
What brings you up to the holler, Raylan?
Raylan:
Just need a word.
Boyd:
Why don't you go make yourself at home on the porch?
Now, Boyd.
I've been doing this long enough.
I can spot outlaws at a thousand paces.
Your friends?
They're packing, one and all.
Boyd:
Well, I wouldn't know.
But I'm sure none of them is carrying with ill intent.
Raylan:
Well, that's good.
Boyd:
What are you after, Raylan?
Raylan: [ Clicks tongue ] Oh, your brother, bowman.
You know anything about him trading in stolen papers back when?
Draw checks and such?
Boyd:
Well, there's little by way of illicit activity in this county that my brother did not have his hands on in one way or another.
Raylan:
Which is why I'm here.
Boyd:
You never really knew my brother, bowman, did you, Raylan?
Raylan:
I saw him play football.
Boyd:
Gunned down in his prime by the very hand of the woman I now share his roof with.
Raylan:
Mm-hmm.
Boyd:
Not hard to fathom his end, given the life that he led.
My brother, Bowman, did not deal directly in paper, Raylan.
He handed it off to this Jesus freak.
Runs that Christian ATV place up in Grant's Holler.
Raylan:
You mean old Winston Baines?
Take an ATV tour and get, like, a sermon on the mount?
Boyd:
Steward of the earth, just like in Genesis.
Little twitchy.
I don't even know if he's still in the game or not.
Kyle:
Come on, Boyd!
Boyd:
Well, I guess me and these boys, we need to get on to work.
Anything else you need?
Raylan:
Not right now.
Boyd:
Well, you take care of yourself, Raylan.
Raylan:
You too, Boyd.
Kyle:
Well, what the hell was that about?
Boyd:
Just some questions about my dead brother, Bowman.
Kyle:
Is that right?
What kind of questions?
Boyd:
Well, it's personal.
Besides, we got more pressing issues to attend to.
Kyle:
Is that right?
Boyd:
The battery...
It's not taking a charge.
Don't know who you bought this thing from, but they must have seen you coming.
- Kyle:
Shit.
- Are you kidding me?
Marcus:
We got to pick up another one!
Kyle:
Hell no.
It's 90 minutes there and back.
We'll miss the shift.
Boyd:
Well, then we do it again next time.
Marcus:
There ain't gonna be no next time, Boyd!
This is the only chance we got!
Boyd:
The most important thing to know in this business is when to walk away.
Kyle:
We're not walking away.
We'll hit up the radio shack on the way there, try to rig something up.
All right?
Let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
What are you doing now?
Boyd:
Writing a note to Ava and letting her know I'm gonna be late.
Kyle: [ Sighs ] Damn, Boyd.
Boyd:
Done.
That didn't take long, did it?
If you want to make a living in this business, you got to know your ABC's.
"Always be cool."
[ Alarm buzzing ]
You sure your radio shack work-around's gonna do the trick?
I'd hate to drive all this way for nothing.
Kyle:
Don't worry about it.
Just focus on setting them charges right.
I don't want to suffocate down there.
Boyd:
You will not die down in that hole, Kyle.
You have my word on that.
Kyle:
And you have my word these batteries are gonna do their job.
God damn, Boyd.
We're about to be rich.
How you like that?
Raylan: "The church of the two-stroke Jesus." That's good.
It's a good angle with the tourists that come to see the Bible belt in action.
Honest-to-God church, sanctioned by the state.
Raylan:
Oh.
Two things important in life...
"Praise God and ride hard."
Raylan:
Amen.
I try to give each its due.
Raylan:
Was asking about checks from the state draw, turned up cashed.
Folks say you might be a person to talk to about such matters.
Well, there was a time that I might have helped out my fellow downtrodden
Kentuckians lay hands on their money.
Raylan:
You saying that time has passed?
The lord has seen fit to bless my little off-road business in recent years.
Folks tour mountaintop removal sites, and bears have started to come back.
Raylan:
So you wouldn't know anything about your signature matching up with the one of a Walt McCready, then... signed last week.
Say again? "McCready"?
Raylan:
Yeah, no, I got the checks here, with the, uh, samples of your first tour up at Big Sandy.
You want to take a look, maybe refresh your memory?
I need my glasses.
Raylan:
Oh.
Well.
Let's see.
[ Electricity crackles ]
Raylan: [ Grunting ]
[ Grunting ]
[ Taser charging ]
Raylan:
Sounds like it's back up to about 50%.
It takes a while after that wallop.
[ Straining ] Tased me in the nuts, you son of a bitch.
Raylan:
Oh, well, I tried to shoot you first.
I get up from here, I'm gonna grab that thing and cram it right up your... [ electricity crackles ] [ Grunts ]
Raylan:
Now it's back down to 30%.
[ Grunting ]
Raylan:
McCready.
Don't know no McCready.
Raylan:
You ever been tased in the mouth, Baines?
I'm just thinking that probably hurts worse than a jolt to the pecker.
Go ahead, then.
Do your worst.
I ain't telling you shit, or anybody else.
Marcus:
Man down!
Man down!
Boyd:
Shut her down!
Marcus:
We've got a man down.
Boyd:
Shut her down!
Marcus:
Come on.
We got it.
We got it.
He's got the angina.
He's got the angina.
He just needs some fresh air.
He'll be all right.
All right.
Watch out.
Marcus:
All right.
Watch out.
This way.
Marcus:
What are we waiting for, bitches?
Let's do this!
Boyd:
Hey, hey!
Cellphones.
Hand them over.
Marcus:
What the hell for, man?
!
Boyd:
Because, Marcus, we're about to set off a remote detonation.
That's 20 pounds of emulex triggered by a radio signal.
Wrong signal on our frequency, we're all shaking hands with Jesus.
So I'm just being overly cautious.
Look, you'll get them back.
I just want to make sure that they're off, for myself.
Let's go.
Hand them over.
Kyle:
Damn, Boyd.
Ava:
Damn it, Boyd.
"Call this number at exactly 6:05 PM.
Don't tell anyone.
Boyd."
What the hell?
Boyd:
Got it.
Kyle:
All right?
Let's go.
Marcus:
Hands up, fool!
This is a robbery!
Well, shit, son.
I can see that.
Kyle:
Don't get smart, Shelby.
Put your damn hands up.
Pruitt:
Whoo, doggy!
How you like that, you old fruit bat?
No call to be disrespectful.
Kyle:
Shut up, both of you.
Boyd.
Put those explosives in the brown bag.
Get down.
Open it.
You got the det.
Why don't you just blow it?
Kyle:
I'd just as soon decorate it with your face!
You got the combination.
Now open it.
Come on!
Hurry up, damn it!
Boyd:
Marcus, you're making me nervous.
Would you please back up?
Kyle:
Come on, open it.
Boyd, you about done?
Marcus:
Jesus Christ, old man.
How many numbers is it?
!
Open it!
Kyle:
Boyd, Boyd!
You almost done?
Boyd:
Almost done, Kyle.
Kyle:
Holy shit.
[ Laughs ]
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
We got the jackpot!
[ Laughs ]
Boyd, would you please put all that money in that green bag?
Come on.
[ Cellphone ringing ]
Pruitt:
What is that?
[ Ringing continues ]
Boyd:
It's goddamn cellphone.
Kyle:
No, you turned it off.
Boyd:
You trying to get us all killed, Kyle?
Kyle:
You turned this off.
Boyd:
Get out of the trailer.
Go on.
Get out of the trailer, Kyle.
Kyle:
Get all that money in that bag.
Come on.
Let's go.
[ Dog barking ]
Raylan:
These hillbilly doorbells really know a federal when they smell one, huh?
Coover: [ Coughs ] Aw, shit!
Better put the weed away.
Raylan:
Although, I got to tell you...
I'm surprised they can smell anything over that shit.
Coover:
Ah!
Dank and delicious.
Raylan:
Oh, I bet.
Coover: [ Coughing ]
Raylan:
That's quite a hack you got there.
Coover:
You don't cough, you don't get off.
Raylan:
So I've heard.
Coover: [ Laughs ] Yeah.
Raylan:
Listen, I know he ain't here, but you're in touch with Walt McCready, right?
Your mama said he was working for the family down south somewhere?
Coover:
That's what she said?
Well, then, that's what she said.
Raylan:
I know you're cashing his draw checks for him.
You sending him the money, or you keeping it for yourself?
Well, anyway, uh, if you see Walt, will you tell him I was asking after him?
Coover:
What for?
Raylan:
Just a few things to clear up in this earlier case with the molester...
Jimmy Earl Dean.
Just dotting the I's, that sort of thing.
Coover:
All right.
Raylan:
I'll let you get back to it.
[ Dog barking ]
Boyd:
All right, let's go.
Kyle:
That phone was off.
You checked it.
Boyd:
Yeah, then why did it ring?
I'll be holding on to that, in case one of you other dumbasses decide to let your cellphone ring.
These batteries will stay with me.
Hand him that shovel.
We're almost there.
Shelby, you're not gonna do something stupid and make me pop you in the gut and carry you down?
I will not.
Boyd:
Good.
You get this cash out of here.
I'll see you down in the hole.
Bring that detonator.
Kyle:
Put the money in the toolbox.
Boyd:
Let's go for a walk, Shelby.
Marcus:
Kyle, he's got the batteries.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Kyle:
Let me ask you something, Marcus.
How stupid do you think I am?
16 years in the boy scouts.
My daddy promised me a Marshall stack as long as I made eagle.
Well, howdy, I tell you what...
I rocked out that summer.
The only other thing I remember...
Ah!
Be prepared.
[ Both laugh ]
Take my batteries, I'll get another battery.
Boyd:
Turn down right here.
[ Panting ]
Boyd:
Face that wall.
What are you gonna do with those explosives?
You gonna cave in this mine?
Boyd:
You just stay right there.
God damn it, Boyd.
If you're gonna kill me, just kill me.
[ Beeping ]
Kyle:
You ready?
Marcus:
Hey, so long, there, Boyd!
[ Laughter ]
What would have happened if they'd checked that bag?
Boyd:
Then we'd be dead, Shelby.
[ Sighs ]
I'm sorry to get you mixed up in this.
It wasn't supposed to go down this way.
Well, son.
I'm walking away, as far as I know.
Unless you're planning on putting one in me.
Boyd:
No, sir, I am not.
Well, then I guess you saved my life.
I got nothing to complain about.
Who'd listen if I did?
Boyd:
Well, then might I be so bold as to ask you for a favor?
Name it.
Boyd:
The cops are gonna come.
ATF, dogs... everything our federal government has to bear.
Now, you tell them that I had to go home.
It was emergency, nothing else.
Do you understand?
Shelby?
Done, sir.
Coover:
No one here.
Dickie:
Yes, I am able see that, Coover.
Thank you.
Coover:
You think he told the federal we gave him the checks to cash?
Dickie:
Uh, maybe we should ask the federal.
Coover:
Oh, shit.
Do we run?
Dickie:
No, we do not run.
Reverend Baines must not have told him.
Otherwise, Raylan would be arresting us right now.
Coover:
But he knows.
Dickie:
Yeah, he knows, but he can't prove it.
Raylan Givens!
Raylan:
Dickie.
Dickie:
There he is.
Raylan:
How you doing, Coover?
Coover:
Raylan.
Dickie:
Eat shit.
Coover:
So, what do we do?
Dickie:
Well, we drive on out of here and give Doyle a call on the way.
[ Car door closes ]
Get in.
Come on.
Coover:
Yeah.
Let's go.
[ Engine turns over ]
Boyd:
Well, I can see by your face you're somewhat troubled.
I can only imagine what I had to do with that.
Ava: "Call this number at exactly 6:05 P.M.
Don't tell anybody."
Boyd:
Well...
I admit it was terse.
[ Sighs ]
I wrote it under some time pressure.
Ava:
Boyd, what the hell is this?
Boyd:
A favor.
Ava:
And what would have happened if I hadn't called?
Boyd:
Well, you wouldn't be speaking to me right now, Ava.
Ava:
Damn it, Boyd.
What the hell you gone and made me a part of?
Boyd:
Just saving my life.
Nothing else.
Tom:
What'd I miss?
Raylan:
Oh, Coover came by with brother Dickie.
Tom:
They were taking McCready's draw checks to Baines.
Raylan:
Mm-hmm.
I don't suppose Baines said anything to you, did he?
Tom:
Just some crazy story about you tasing him in the nuts.
Raylan:
I did.
Tom:
Nice.
So?
Raylan:
So either the Bennetts are just being neighborly, cashing McCready's checks for him and sending him the money...
Tom:
Or he's dead.
Raylan:
The more likely option.
Tom:
And I'm worried about that girl.
Raylan:
Me too.
Tom:
From what I understand about Loretta, she's a pretty tough kid.
Raylan:
She's 14.
Tom:
What were you like at 14, growing up around these parts?
Raylan: [ Scoffs ]
Tom:
Call child protection?
Raylan:
And say what?
She's being clothed and fed?
Tom: [ Scoffs ] Yeah.
Look, I got to get.
I got a world of shit coming off that explosion up at the plackett mine.
Raylan:
Yeah, I saw the, uh, fire-and-rescue trucks.
Collapse?
Tom:
No.
Somebody blew up a truck with emulex.
Looks like they were fixing to rob the payroll, had some sort of premature detonation.
Raylan:
Boyd?
Tom:
You mean is he dead, or did he rob it?
Raylan:
Either one.
Tom:
No sign of his body in the truck wreckage.
ATF's looking for him now.
I'll see you.
Boyd:
I don't believe they intended to let me live through the day.
Didn't think I was gonna find a way out.
Part of me just felt like... laying down,
letting it happen.
Ava:
But you killed them instead.
Boyd:
Well, I gave them a choice.
Now, if they hadn't have pulled that switch on me when I was down there in that hole, things would have gone down different.
So the way I see it, Ava, they killed themselves, with greed and avarice.
Ava:
When I called that cell, did I...
Boyd:
No.
It allowed me to kick them out of the trailer.
I put a little cash on the emulex, a little emulex on the cash, and I made sure that the blasting cap went in their packet and not mine.
Ava: [ Sighs ]
You could have run when Raylan came by, just lit out and let the chips fall.
Boyd:
What does it say about me that that thought never crossed my mind?
Ava:
Why did you agree to rob that mine in the first place?
Boyd:
Because it's what I do.
It's who I am, Ava... as hard as I've been trying to pretend otherwise.
Everybody else seems to know that but me.
Anyway, I came across that letter that you received from the bank.
Ava:
Boyd, I don't... [ Sighs ]
Boyd:
I violated your privacy.
For that transgression, I do apologize.
Ava:
So you know that they're after the house?
[ Chuckling ] I don't suppose any of that money survived the blast.
Boyd:
There should be at least $15,000 to $20,000 in there.
That's not enough to pay it off, but enough to buy you some security for a little while.
Ava:
Shit.
Boyd:
Ava, there's one more favor that I must ask of you.
Ava, you can help me...
Or you can refuse.
Either way, I will understand.
But I'm gonna need to know your answer right now.
Dickie:
Hey, here he comes.
Coover:
Oh, shit, mama's with him.
Hey, mama.
Mags:
We need to talk.
Dickie:
Can I get you something, mama?
Mags:
Nothing's gonna take the taste away from my boys going behind my back.
Coover:
Mama, w-we never went behind...
Mags:
Cashing McCready's draw checks?
How long did you think it'd take before that'd come back on us?
Coover:
Mama, that's that federal.
He's aiming for trouble with us, always has been.
Mags: 'Cause of your actions.
Starting with hiring that pederast to do a job I give you.
Coover:
I'm sorry, mama.
Mags:
Coover, I know you're sorry.
That's why it's gonna hurt so much to have to do this.
Coover: [ Groans ]
Dickie:
Hey, now!
Hey, hey, now!
Hey!
Hey!
Doyle:
Put your hand on the stump!
Put your hand on the stump!
Mags:
Take what's coming.
Coover:
Mama.
Mags:
I'm saving your gun hand, now.
Coover:
Mama, don't hurt me.
Mags:
Cross me again, and I will leave you nothing.
Coover:
Mama!
Dickie:
You ain't got to do this.
Mags:
You shut your mouth!
Coover:
Mama?
Mags: 'Cause you're crippled to the point of worthlessness it ain't you down on that table.
Coover: [ Grunting ]
Mags:
As it is, I have to hurt Coover.
[ Voice breaking ] And I like Coover.
Coover:
Mama, I love you.
Mama, I love you.
Mama, no!
[ Screaming ]
Mags: [ Panting ]
[ Sighs ]
We need to talk about what comes next.
Coover: [ Voice breaking ] I'm sorry, mama.
Oh, mama.
I love you.
I'm sorry.
Got to be shitting me, Loretta.
20 a gram for shake and seeds?
Loretta:
Plenty of other ways to get high, Levon.
You can always huff paint...
got plenty of practice at it.
I'll give you $15 for a dub.
Loretta:
Dime is $10.
Hence a dub is $20.
Simple math.
Oh, shit.
Five-O!
Loretta, I see you're keeping busy.
Loretta:
Marshal.
I had it in my head you weren't in the business of harassing growers and sellers of herbal relief.
Raylan:
Herbal relief, huh?
Loretta:
You'll notice I make no attempt to run or otherwise obstruct your investigation.
So I hope you'll take that into consideration before you start shooting.
Raylan:
That's funny.
Mind if I...?
Loretta:
So, if you're not here to roust me over the weed, might I inquire as to your intentions?
Raylan:
I know you don't trust me.
I don't fault you that, though I like to think my getting you out of Jimmy Earl Dean's trunk might have earned me some traction.
I kicked a hornets' nest last night.
And things may start to happen, and I need you to know if you find yourself in trouble...
any kind... you can call me.
I'll drop whatever I'm doing, and I will come for you.
You hear me?
Previously on "Justified"...
It was already in the glass, not in the jar.
Gaahh!
I bet you're wondering why you had to stay at Doyle's last night and where your daddy is.
I decided to send him down south for a few weeks, handle some business for us.
I just find out you two are responsible for hijacking a shipment of oxy,
I got to kill two morons to keep your asses out of jail.
Cutter and Elrod told me it was you right before I killed them.
Do you know who that bus belonged to?
- The boys up in Frankfort.
- That's right.
Now, you really want to stir up that hornet's nest?
I ain't afraid of Frankfort.
Well, what about if mama found out?
You afraid of mama?
I also got call from Dewey Crowe's lawyer, says Dewey knows about some shit going down in Harlan that might be worth our while.
What would you say if someone had a friend who worked for the armored-car company who could provide engine trouble four days running, stalling deliveries so there would be $80,000 cash at one time?
Well, I'd say there's still no way to get down off this mountain without getting caught.
What if there's a way not only you not get caught but get treated like a hero?
All right, rise and shine!
- Let's go, shit wit!
- Help!
What's going on?
Blood test come back positive for TB.
T...
How in the hell did I get TB?
Do I look like a doctor?
You got to go to the infirmary for quarantine till tests come back clear.
- Let's go!
- Well, check my forehead.
That feel hot to you?
Open it up!
God damn it, Raylan!
I thought I was really sick.
Do you even know what TB is?
Well, all the masks and shit, I thought it was some kind of monkey virus, like in that movie.
We pulled you out for quarantine so we can talk without you taking a shiv for it.
But if you'd prefer to talk amongst your friends, we could...
No, no, no, no.
No, I'm good.
I'm good.
Then what's this about?
You got to get me out of here, marshal.
I can't deal with this kind of action.
Do you know what that is?
That's the world's smallest man playing "my heart bleeds for you" on a tiny violin.
Now, why don't you tell me why you dragged me down here?
I'll give you something good, you think I can get early release?
Well, that depends.
- If you're not full of shit...
- Hand to God, marshal.
...And if what you have to give me is in any way useful.
Well, for one thing, that town law fella you had bring me in?
Doyle Bennett?
- He's a dirty cop, Raylan.
- No!
Straight up.
Dewey, the way this works is, you have to tell me something I don't know.
And then we talk about you getting into a halfway house.
Okay, fine.
That... that... that pretty boy molester that you all are putting the federal boot heel to?
Jimmy Earl Dean.
Hates you like poison.
So when he found out what I did... you know, dressing up with the hat and all... well, we kind of formed a bond over it.
What fruit did this touching new relationship bear?
Well, he says you don't know half of what's going on down in Bennett.
He says if you did, you'd eat that hat, and he'd be the one to feed it to you.
Dean was the muscle for the Bennett weed trade?
He says no, that ain't all he was doing down there.
He says that the Bennetts are up to something big.
Did he happen to mention what that might be?
Well, not as such, but he...
he did let on it might have something to do with the daddy of that girl he was sweet on.
"Sweet on"?
Is that why he tied up the 14-year-old girl and tossed her into the trunk of his car?
Told me she could pass as 16, easy.
- Dewey.
- What?
The girl's daddy...
What does it have to do with him?
When he first came by their house, he told 'em he was with the bank.
Bank?
Did he elaborate?
Yeah, he did.
H-he said, uh...
Uh, now, what'd he say?
He said he was with the bank.
And then he said...
It's kind of complicated.
He's with the bank.
Did you got confused?
Do you understand mortgages and shit?
I don't.
Well, seems you're not alone there.
Well, so, come on!
What do I get?
That's got to be worth something.
If you want to get into a halfway house, you got to give me more than that, Dewey.
Oh, come on, now.
Turn that frown around.
Hell, you give yourself a shave, I'll bet you could pass for 16.

Hey, mama.
She ain't here.
What do you mean, she ain't here?
I mean she ain't here.
Well, who's minding the store, then?
What, you?
She said she had affairs to attend to, be back after 4:00.
Mm-hmm.
And I guess she just up and left you in charge.
I find that...
Very hard to believe.
Well, you're welcome to look around for her if it'll set your mind at ease.
You ain't got to get mouthy with me, girl.
Mama ain't never left me in charge.
Dickie neither.
And here you sit?
Well, it ain't as glamorous as it looks.
Mm-hmm.
Goodbye.
You're supposed to leave money for stuff you take.
She told me to tell you that.
Well, you know what?
Now you can tell her that you told me, can't you?
I appreciate the courtesy.
Bye.
Raylan!
I just got a call that your daddy violated his tether again.
Well, if they find him, they can do with him as they see fit.
Hey, look what the cat dragged in.
Hey.
Who let you out of Harlan?
Well, they told me to drop on by, see how you big-time federal police get it done.
Well, watch and learn, son.
Yeah.
Listen, I got a question.
Shoot.
What would it take for you to let me have marshal Givens back down to Harlan, do some more of that task-force stuff we've been running?
Ordinarily, I would say, "only if you promise to keep him."
But considering the epic backlog of work that he has, I got to ask, what for?
Well, because it seems like that oxy bust is just sort of the tip of the iceberg as far as people trying to fill the Crowders' shoes down there.
And how exactly do you think Raylan here would be useful to you?
Well, Art, I've been in Harlan 18 years.
People still look at me like I'm some kind of Yankee come down there to burn their crops.
- But this guy...
- I know my people.
You're like the hillbilly whisperer.
Put you on "Oprah."
I'll get my coat.
You can catch me up on the way down.
Just hold on, Cochise.
Now, Tom, I hear you.
And I know that Raylan here would probably prefer being down there running down this grudge, but I actually kind of need him here to do some marshal shit.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about whatever this business is with the Bennetts.
It is beyond the purview of what I like to call your job.
Speaking of which, I stopped by up at their place the other day.
Yeah.
You stopped by to do some dynamite fishing and see what you could get to bob up to the surface.
On my own time.
Wearing your badge.
Anyway, I saw Loretta McCready.
Any sign of her daddy since we checked on him?
You know, it's funny you should mention McCready, 'cause
I thought he'd popped back up in town last week or so.
Somebody's been cashing his state-benefit checks.
But if you have a nice, close look at these signatures, they're a little, uh, inconsistent.
Are you thinking a forgery?
Kind of a shaky hand, wouldn't you say?
Standards appear to be slipping.
Gentlemen, this is really fascinating and strangely heartbreaking, but I just don't see what I get out of all this.
Mullen.
No shit.
Hold on a minute.
Well, they found your daddy.
Where?
Somewhere between the third and the fourth floor.
H-here?
There.
You happy now?
I don't know.
Should I be?
Well, you won, didn't you?
Beat an old man down, got your way.
He's been at the wild turkey on the way up, so he's in a sulk.
Well, you violated your tether range coming up here, Arlo.
Brought you your damn money, so you can just cut this thing off my leg.
Well, math was never my prime subject, but this feels quite a bit south of $20,000.
$6,000, thereabouts.
All I got left.
Take it or leave it.
Oh, I'll take it.
And you can take him to the cell.
What the hell?
It's something, ain't it?
He hasn't got any more, Raylan.
That's it.
I'm not running a yard sale, Helen.
Arlo, you owe what you owe.
So, what?
I wasted my time, then?
Give me that money back.
You want to get out of your obligation, you give us the rest.
Or... maybe you got $14,000 in information, huh?
What we paid for in the first place.
Well, what you looking for?
Looking for who might trade in illegal papers... stolen government draw checks and such... in Harlan.
Now, why would I know anything about that?
Oh, I don't know.
Harlan county, petty bullshit crime, you?
Call it a hunch.
- What's the play look like?
- Someone's been cashing a man's checks, and we don't think it's him.
Raylan, this got anything to do with Mags Bennett?
I don't think so.
Can't help you.
Oh, why doesn't that surprise me?
Ask me something else.
I don't give a shit about "something else."
- Oh, for God's sake!
- Helen, you shut your mouth.
The hell I will.
I want you gone, and if this helps, good.
Raylan, there's only one man in three counties that'll give you anything like a fair deal on draw checks.
And that man would be?
Boning you in the ass.
Go ahead, woman.
You already yakked up this much.
Lay it on him.
Helen?
Bowman Crowder.
Damn shame, man you want being dead in a box at the hands of your old girlfriend, wasn't it?
You let me know if you get him talking.
Be mighty interested to hear anything he's got to say.
All right, Boyd, one more time.
While you're taking the packets down to the splinter shaft, we're gonna transfer the cash to the truck.
Pruitt's gonna drive it down the mountain.
That's right.
And Marcus and I join you in the hole.
- And then...
- Boom.
Drop the ceiling between us and the surface.
Now, the man guarding his take...
Now, I've known this man for quite some time.
He will not easily part with company money.
Who, Shelby?
Shit, Boyd.
Dude's older than shit.
Yet again, he's a steady hand on that .44 he keeps right underneath his desk.
You ain't gonna have to worry about Shelby.
Yeah?
Why is that?
'Cause you're gonna kill him.
Well, now, you...
Never mentioned bloodshed.
Now, if you had brought this up earlier, I don't know if this conversation would be going on this long.
You've killed men for far less, Boyd.
Let's keep our eye on the prize.
Take Shelby down in the shaft until you set up the det.
Once it's wired, you lay a shovel upside his head real hard.
Cave-in will take care of the rest.
See?
That's the genius of the whole thing.
Everybody will think that he stole the money, tried to blow up the shaft behind him, but instead, premature detonation.
We was just the poor miners who got caught up in all of it.
Well, if this is gonna go down today, the devil lies in the details.
Stop worrying about the details.
Let me worry about the details, all right?
We're counting on you for one thing and one thing alone.
What's that?
You're the powderman, Boyd.
We need you to make sure this mountain don't come down on us and kill us.
Now, once you set it, we're gonna detonate remotely.
All right?
ATF will be all over this thing.
We don't need any extra det wire tipping 'em o...
Off.
Well, I should probably get that.
Hello.
Why, hello, Ava.
Ain't that his girlfriend?
He should be so lucky.
We should all be so lucky.
Oh, I'm listening.
I hear that.
Come on.
All we got to do is charge this thing up.
We're ready to rock.
Let's go.
Let's wrap it up, Boyd.
No.
That's just the TV.
I'm here all by myself.
You think he knows?
Don't worry about Boyd.
Kyle, what if he bails on us?
Then we do him now instead of later.
When he goes down in the mine, we'll just blow him up.
Pruitt!
I got to go now, Ava.
Got you on a tight leash, huh?
Well, I wouldn't say that.
What's it gonna be, Boyd?
We're running out of time.
Well, what it is that you're asking of me to do, I can do.
But radio det adds a whole new host of complexities.
There's only one way this is gonna work.
How's that?
You and your boys, you do exactly what I say, when I say it.
That's the only way I can keep us all alive.
Well, hell, Boyd.
As many people as you robbed...
I wouldn't have it any other way.
What are you doing?
Dishes.
Is it charged?
No, Kyle, for the fifth time, it is not.
Who the hell is that?
That's the United States federal marshal.
- Well, what's he doing re, Boyd?
!
- I couldn't say.
Hey, Pruitt, what the hell is this?
Kyle, get out here.
Hello, fellas.
Don't believe I've had the pleasure.
You don't need to know us.
We mind our own business.
Suppose it'd be best you do the same.
Well, that wouldn't be like me.
What do we do?
My play's always to stop him before he gets on the front porch.
Shit, Boyd.
Deputy U.S. marshal Raylan Givens.
Pleased to meet you, marshal.
We're Boyd's friends from the mine.
We just come to pick him up for work.
That's all.
Oh.
Nice to see Boyd's making acquaintances.
I'm gonna step up to the door now, Kyle.
Do you see that as being a problem?
Step inside to do the dishes for two minutes...
Look who comes by to visit.
Boyd.
Your friends and I were just getting acquainted.
I can see that.
What brings you up to the holler, Raylan?
Just need a word.
Why don't you go make yourself at home on the porch?
Now, Boyd.
I've been doing this long enough.
I can spot outlaws at a thousand paces.
Your friends?
They're packing, one and all.
Well, I wouldn't know.
But I'm sure none of them is carrying with ill intent.
Well, that's good.
What are you after, Raylan?
Oh, your brother, bowman.
You know anything about him trading in stolen papers back when?
Draw checks and such?
Well, there's little by way of illicit activity in this county that my brother did not have his hands on in one way or another.
Which is why I'm here.
You never really knew my brother, bowman, did you, Raylan?
I saw him play football.
Gunned down in his prime by the very hand of the woman I now share his roof with.
Mm-hmm.
Not hard to fathom his end, given the life that he led.
My brother, Bowman, did not deal directly in paper, Raylan.
He handed it off to this Jesus freak.
Runs that Christian ATV place up in Grant's Holler.
You mean old Winston Baines?
Take an ATV tour and get, like, a sermon on the mount?
Steward of the earth, just like in Genesis.
Little twitchy.
I don't even know if he's still in the game or not.
Come on, Boyd!
Well, I guess me and these boys, we need to get on to work.
Anything else you need?
Not right now.
Well, you take care of yourself, Raylan.
You too, Boyd.
Well, what the hell was that about?
Just some questions about my dead brother, Bowman.
Is that right?
What kind of questions?
Well, it's personal.
Besides, we got more pressing issues to attend to.
Is that right?
The battery...
It's not taking a charge.
Don't know who you bought this thing from, but they must have seen you coming.
- Shit.
- Are you kidding me?
We got to pick up another one!
Hell no.
It's 90 minutes there and back.
We'll miss the shift.
Well, then we do it again next time.
There ain't gonna be no next time, Boyd!
This is the only chance we got!
The most important thing to know in this business is when to walk away.
We're not walking away.
We'll hit up the radio shack on the way there, try to rig something up.
All right?
Let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
What are you doing now?
Writing a note to Ava and letting her know I'm gonna be late.
Damn, Boyd.
Done.
That didn't take long, did it?
If you want to make a living in this business, you got to know your ABC's.
"Always be cool."
You sure your radio shack work-around's gonna do the trick?
I'd hate to drive all this way for nothing.
Don't worry about it.
Just focus on setting them charges right.
I don't want to suffocate down there.
You will not die down in that hole, Kyle.
You have my word on that.
And you have my word these batteries are gonna do their job.
God damn, Boyd.
We're about to be rich.
How you like that?
"The church of the two-stroke Jesus." That's good.
It's a good angle with the tourists that come to see the Bible belt in action.
Honest-to-God church, sanctioned by the state.
Oh.
Two things important in life...
"Praise God and ride hard."
Amen.
I try to give each its due.
Was asking about checks from the state draw, turned up cashed.
Folks say you might be a person to talk to about such matters.
Well, there was a time that I might have helped out my fellow downtrodden
Kentuckians lay hands on their money.
You saying that time has passed?
The lord has seen fit to bless my little off-road business in recent years.
Folks tour mountaintop removal sites, and bears have started to come back.
So you wouldn't know anything about your signature matching up with the one of a Walt McCready, then... signed last week.
Say again? "McCready"?
Yeah, no, I got the checks here, with the, uh, samples of your first tour up at Big Sandy.
You want to take a look, maybe refresh your memory?
I need my glasses.
Oh.
Well.
Let's see.
Sounds like it's back up to about 50%.
It takes a while after that wallop.
Tased me in the nuts, you son of a bitch.
Oh, well, I tried to shoot you first.
I get up from here, I'm gonna grab that thing and cram it right up your...
Now it's back down to 30%.
McCready.
Don't know no McCready.
You ever been tased in the mouth, Baines?
I'm just thinking that probably hurts worse than a jolt to the pecker.
Go ahead, then.
Do your worst.
I ain't telling you shit, or anybody else.
Man down!
- Man down!
- Shut her down!
- We've got a man down.
- Shut her down!
Come on.
We got it.
We got it.
He's got the angina.
He's got the angina.
He just needs some fresh air.
He'll be all right.
All right.
Watch out.
All right.
Watch out.
This way.
What are we waiting for, bitches?
Let's do this!
Hey, hey!
Cellphones.
Hand them over.
What the hell for, man?
!
Because, Marcus, we're about to set off a remote detonation.
That's 20 pounds of emulex triggered by a radio signal.
Wrong signal on our frequency, we're all shaking hands with Jesus.
So I'm just being overly cautious.
Look, you'll get them back.
I just want to make sure that they're off, for myself.
Let's go.
Hand them over.
Damn, Boyd.
Damn it, Boyd.
"Call this number at exactly 6:05 PM.
Don't tell anyone.
Boyd."
What the hell?
Got it.
All right?
Let's go.
Hands up, fool!
This is a robbery!
Well, shit, son.
I can see that.
Don't get smart, Shelby.
Put your damn hands up.
Whoo, doggy!
How you like that, you old fruit bat?
- No call to be disrespectful.
- Shut up, both of you.
Boyd.
Put those explosives in the brown bag.
Get down.
Open it.
You got the det.
Why don't you just blow it?
I'd just as soon decorate it with your face!
You got the combination.
Now open it.
Come on!
Hurry up, damn it!
Marcus, you're making me nervous.
Would you please back up?
Come on, open it.
Boyd, you about done?
Jesus Christ, old man.
How many numbers is it?
!
Open it!
Boyd, Boyd!
You almost done?
Almost done, Kyle.
Holy shit.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
We got the jackpot!
Boyd, would you please put all that money in that green bag?
Come on.
What is that?
It's goddamn cellphone.
No, you turned it off.
You trying to get us all killed, Kyle?
You turned this off.
Get out of the trailer.
Go on.
Get out of the trailer, Kyle.
Get all that money in that bag.
Come on.
Let's go.
These hillbilly doorbells really know a federal when they smell one, huh?
Aw, shit!
Better put the weed away.
Although, I got to tell you...
I'm surprised they can smell anything over that shit.
Ah!
Dank and delicious.
Oh, I bet.
That's quite a hack you got there.
You don't cough, you don't get off.
So I've heard.
Yeah.
Listen, I know he ain't here, but you're in touch with Walt McCready, right?
Your mama said he was working for the family down south somewhere?
That's what she said?
Well, then, that's what she said.
I know you're cashing his draw checks for him.
You sending him the money, or you keeping it for yourself?
Well, anyway, uh, if you see Walt, will you tell him I was asking after him?
What for?
Just a few things to clear up in this earlier case with the molester...
Jimmy Earl Dean.
Just dotting the I's, that sort of thing.
All right.
I'll let you get back to it.
All right, let's go.
That phone was off.
You checked it.
Yeah, then why did it ring?
I'll be holding on to that, in case one of you other dumbasses decide to let your cellphone ring.
These batteries will stay with me.
Hand him that shovel.
We're almost there.
Shelby, you're not gonna do something stupid and make me pop you in the gut and carry you down?
- I will not.
- Good.
You get this cash out of here.
I'll see you down in the hole.
Bring that detonator.
Put the money in the toolbox.
Let's go for a walk, Shelby.
Kyle, he's got the batteries.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Let me ask you something, Marcus.
How stupid do you think I am?
16 years in the boy scouts.
My daddy promised me a Marshall stack as long as I made eagle.
Well, howdy, I tell you what...
I rocked out that summer.
The only other thing I remember...
Ah!
Be prepared.
Take my batteries, I'll get another battery.
Turn down right here.
Face that wall.
What are you gonna do with those explosives?
You gonna cave in this mine?
You just stay right there.
God damn it, Boyd.
If you're gonna kill me, just kill me.
You ready?
Hey, so long, there, Boyd!
What would have happened if they'd checked that bag?
Then we'd be dead, Shelby.
I'm sorry to get you mixed up in this.
It wasn't supposed to go down this way.
Well, son.
I'm walking away, as far as I know.
Unless you're planning on putting one in me.
No, sir, I am not.
Well, then I guess you saved my life.
I got nothing to complain about.
Who'd listen if I did?
Well, then might I be so bold as to ask you for a favor?
Name it.
The cops are gonna come.
ATF, dogs... everything our federal government has to bear.
Now, you tell them that I had to go home.
It was emergency, nothing else.
Do you understand?
Shelby?
Done, sir.
No one here.
Yes, I am able see that, Coover.
Thank you.
You think he told the federal we gave him the checks to cash?
Uh, maybe we should ask the federal.
Oh, shit.
Do we run?
No, we do not run.
Reverend Baines must not have told him.
Otherwise, Raylan would be arresting us right now.
But he knows.
Yeah, he knows, but he can't prove it.
Raylan Givens!
Dickie.
There he is.
How you doing, Coover?
Raylan.
Eat shit.
So, what do we do?
Well, we drive on out of here and give Doyle a call on the way.
Get in.
Come on.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Well, I can see by your face you're somewhat troubled.
I can only imagine what I had to do with that.
"Call this number at exactly 6:05 P.M.
Don't tell anybody."
Well...
I admit it was terse.
I wrote it under some time pressure.
Boyd, what the hell is this?
A favor.
And what would have happened if I hadn't called?
Well, you wouldn't be speaking to me right now, Ava.
Damn it, Boyd.
What the hell you gone and made me a part of?
Just saving my life.
Nothing else.
What'd I miss?
Oh, Coover came by with brother Dickie.
They were taking McCready's draw checks to Baines.
Mm-hmm.
I don't suppose Baines said anything to you, did he?
Just some crazy story about you tasing him in the nuts.
I did.
Nice.
So?
So either the Bennetts are just being neighborly, cashing McCready's checks for him and sending him the money...
Or he's dead.
The more likely option.
And I'm worried about that girl.
Me too.
From what I understand about Loretta, she's a pretty tough kid.
She's 14.
What were you like at 14, growing up around these parts?
Call child protection?
And say what?
She's being clothed and fed?
Yeah.
Look, I got to get.
I got a world of shit coming off that explosion up at the plackett mine.
Yeah, I saw the, uh, fire-and-rescue trucks.
- Collapse?
- No.
Somebody blew up a truck with emulex.
Looks like they were fixing to rob the payroll, had some sort of premature detonation.
Boyd?
You mean is he dead, or did he rob it?
Either one.
No sign of his body in the truck wreckage.
ATF's looking for him now.
I'll see you.
I don't believe they intended to let me live through the day.
Didn't think I was gonna find a way out.
Part of me just felt like... laying down,
letting it happen.
But you killed them instead.
Well, I gave them a choice.
Now, if they hadn't have pulled that switch on me when I was down there in that hole, things would have gone down different.
So the way I see it, Ava, they killed themselves, with greed and avarice.
- When I called that cell, did I...
- No.
It allowed me to kick them out of the trailer.
I put a little cash on the emulex, a little emulex on the cash, and I made sure that the blasting cap went in their packet and not mine.
You could have run when Raylan came by, just lit out and let the chips fall.
What does it say about me that that thought never crossed my mind?
Why did you agree to rob that mine in the first place?
Because it's what I do.
It's who I am, Ava... as hard as I've been trying to pretend otherwise.
Everybody else seems to know that but me.
Anyway, I came across that letter that you received from the bank.
Boyd, I don't...
I violated your privacy.
For that transgression, I do apologize.
So you know that they're after the house?
I don't suppose any of that money survived the blast.
There should be at least $15,000 to $20,000 in there.
That's not enough to pay it off, but enough to buy you some security for a little while.
Shit.
Ava, there's one more favor that I must ask of you.
Ava, you can help me...
Or you can refuse.
Either way, I will understand.
But I'm gonna need to know your answer right now.
Hey, here he comes.
Oh, shit, mama's with him.
Hey, mama.
We need to talk.
Can I get you something, mama?
Nothing's gonna take the taste away from my boys going behind my back.
- Mama, w-we never went behind...
- Cashing McCready's draw checks?
How long did you think it'd take before that'd come back on us?
Mama, that's that federal.
He's aiming for trouble with us, always has been.
'Cause of your actions.
Starting with hiring that pederast to do a job I give you.
I'm sorry, mama.
Coover, I know you're sorry.
That's why it's gonna hurt so much to have to do this.
Hey, now!
Hey, hey, now!
Hey!
Hey!
Put your hand on the stump!
Put your hand on the stump!
- Take what's coming.
- Mama.
I'm saving your gun hand, now.
Mama, don't hurt me.
Cross me again, and I will leave you nothing.
- Mama!
- You ain't got to do this.
You shut your mouth!
Mama?
'Cause you're crippled to the point of worthlessness it ain't you down on that table.
As it is, I have to hurt Coover.
And I like Coover.
Mama, I love you.
Mama, I love you.
Mama, no!
We need to talk about what comes next.
I'm sorry, mama.
Oh, mama.
I love you.
I'm sorry.
Got to be shitting me, Loretta.
20 a gram for shake and seeds?
Plenty of other ways to get high, Levon.
You can always huff paint...
got plenty of practice at it.
I'll give you $15 for a dub.
Dime is $10.
Hence a dub is $20.
Simple math.
Oh, shit.
Five-O!
Loretta, I see you're keeping busy.
Marshal.
I had it in my head you weren't in the business of harassing growers and sellers of herbal relief.
Herbal relief, huh?
You'll notice I make no attempt to run or otherwise obstruct your investigation.
So I hope you'll take that into consideration before you start shooting.
That's funny.
Mind if I...?
So, if you're not here to roust me over the weed, might I inquire as to your intentions?
I know you don't trust me.
I don't fault you that, though I like to think my getting you out of Jimmy Earl Dean's trunk might have earned me some traction.
I kicked a hornets' nest last night.
And things may start to happen, and I need you to know if you find yourself in trouble...
any kind... you can call me.
I'll drop whatever I'm doing, and I will come for you.
You hear me?
PREVIOUSLY ON "JUSTIFIED"...
MAGS:
IT WAS ALREADY IN THE GLASS, NOT IN THE JAR.
WALT:
GAAHH!
[ WHEEZES ]
MAGS:
I BET YOU'RE WONDERING WHY YOU HAD TO STAY AT DOYLE'S
LAST NIGHT AND WHERE YOUR DADDY IS.
I DECIDED TO SEND HIM DOWN SOUTH FOR A FEW WEEKS,
HANDLE SOME BUSINESS FOR US.
DOYLE:
I JUST FIND OUT YOU TWO ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR HIJACKING A SHIPMENT OF OXY,
I GOT TO KILL TWO MORONS TO KEEP YOUR ASSES OUT OF JAIL.
CUTTER AND ELROD TOLD ME IT WAS YOU RIGHT BEFORE I KILLED THEM.
DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT BUS BELONGED TO?
DICKIE:
THE BOYS UP IN FRANKFORT.
DOYLE:
THAT'S RIGHT.
NOW, YOU REALLY WANT TO STIR UP THAT HORNET'S NEST?
DICKIE:
I AIN'T AFRAID OF FRANKFORT.
DOYLE:
WELL, WHAT ABOUT IF MAMA FOUND OUT?
YOU AFRAID OF MAMA?
RAYLAN:
I ALSO GOT CALL FROM DEWEY CROWE'S LAWYER,
SAYS DEWEY KNOWS ABOUT SOME SHIT GOING DOWN IN HARLAN
THAT MIGHT BE WORTH OUR WHILE.
KYLE:
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF SOMEONE HAD A FRIEND WHO WORKED
FOR THE ARMORED-CAR COMPANY
WHO COULD PROVIDE ENGINE TROUBLE FOUR DAYS RUNNING,
STALLING DELIVERIES
SO THERE WOULD BE $80,000 CASH AT ONE TIME?
BOYD:
WELL, I'D SAY THERE'S STILL NO WAY TO GET DOWN OFF
THIS MOUNTAIN WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT.
KYLE:
WHAT IF THERE'S A WAY NOT ONLY YOU NOT GET CAUGHT
BUT GET TREATED LIKE A HERO?
ALL RIGHT, RISE AND SHINE!
LET'S GO, SHIT WIT!
DEWEY:
HELP!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
BLOOD TEST COME BACK POSITIVE FOR TB.
DEWEY:
T...
HOW IN THE HELL DID I GET TB?
DO I LOOK LIKE A DOCTOR?
YOU GOT TO GO TO THE INFIRMARY FOR QUARANTINE
TILL TESTS COME BACK CLEAR.
LET'S GO!
DEWEY:
WELL, CHECK MY FOREHEAD.
THAT FEEL HOT TO YOU?
OPEN IT UP!
DEWEY:
GOD DAMN IT, RAYLAN!
I THOUGHT I WAS REALLY SICK.
RAYLAN:
DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT TB IS?
DEWEY:
WELL, ALL THE MASKS AND SHIT, I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME
KIND OF MONKEY VIRUS, LIKE IN THAT MOVIE.
RAYLAN:
WE PULLED YOU OUT FOR QUARANTINE SO WE CAN TALK
WITHOUT YOU TAKING A SHIV FOR IT.
BUT IF YOU'D PREFER TO TALK AMONGST YOUR FRIENDS, WE COULD...
DEWEY:
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, I'M GOOD.
I'M GOOD.
RAYLAN:
THEN WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
DEWEY:
YOU GOT TO GET ME OUT OF HERE, MARSHAL.
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF ACTION.
RAYLAN:
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
THAT'S THE WORLD'S SMALLEST MAN PLAYING "MY HEART BLEEDS FOR YOU" ON A TINY VIOLIN.
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHY YOU DRAGGED ME DOWN HERE?
DEWEY:
I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING GOOD, YOU THINK I CAN GET EARLY RELEASE?
RAYLAN:
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.
[ SIGHS ]
IF YOU'RE NOT FULL OF SHIT...
DEWEY:
HAND TO GOD, MARSHAL.
RAYLAN: ...
AND IF WHAT YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME IS IN ANY WAY USEFUL.
DEWEY:
WELL, FOR ONE THING, THAT TOWN LAW FELLA YOU HAD BRING ME IN?
RAYLAN:
DOYLE BENNETT?
DEWEY:
HE'S A DIRTY COP, RAYLAN.
RAYLAN:
NO!
DEWEY:
STRAIGHT UP.
RAYLAN:
DEWEY, THE WAY THIS WORKS IS,
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW.
AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT YOU GETTING INTO A HALFWAY HOUSE.
DEWEY:
OKAY, FINE.
THAT...
THAT...
THAT PRETTY BOY MOLESTER THAT YOU ALL ARE PUTTING THE FEDERAL
BOOT HEEL TO?
RAYLAN:
JIMMY EARL DEAN.
DEWEY:
HATES YOU LIKE POISON.
SO WHEN HE FOUND OUT WHAT I DID...
YOU KNOW, DRESSING UP WITH THE HAT AND ALL...
WELL, WE KIND OF FORMED A BOND OVER IT.
WHAT FRUIT DID THIS TOUCHING NEW RELATIONSHIP BEAR?
DEWEY:
WELL, HE SAYS YOU DON'T KNOW HALF OF WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN IN BENNETT.
HE SAYS IF YOU DID, YOU'D EAT THAT HAT, AND HE'D BE THE ONE TO FEED IT TO YOU.
RAYLAN:
DEAN WAS THE MUSCLE FOR THE BENNETT WEED TRADE?
DEWEY:
HE SAYS NO, THAT AIN'T ALL HE WAS DOING DOWN THERE.
HE SAYS THAT THE BENNETTS ARE UP TO SOMETHING BIG.
RAYLAN:
DID HE HAPPEN TO MENTION WHAT THAT MIGHT BE?
DEWEY:
WELL, NOT AS SUCH, BUT HE...
HE DID LET ON IT MIGHT
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE DADDY OF THAT GIRL HE WAS SWEET ON.
RAYLAN: "SWEET ON"?
IS THAT WHY HE TIED UP THE 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL AND TOSSED HER INTO THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR?
DEWEY:
TOLD ME SHE COULD PASS AS 16, EASY.
RAYLAN:
DEWEY.
DEWEY:
WHAT?
RAYLAN:
THE GIRL'S DADDY...
WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH HIM?
DEWEY:
WHEN HE FIRST CAME BY THEIR HOUSE, HE TOLD 'EM HE WAS WITH THE BANK.
RAYLAN:
BANK?
DID HE ELABORATE?
DEWEY:
YEAH, HE DID.
H-HE SAID, UH...
UH, NOW, WHAT'D HE SAY?
HE SAID HE WAS WITH THE BANK.
AND THEN HE SAID...
IT'S KIND OF COMPLICATED.
HE'S WITH THE BANK.
RAYLAN:
DID YOU GOT CONFUSED?
DEWEY:
DO YOU UNDERSTAND MORTGAGES AND SHIT?
I DON'T.
RAYLAN:
WELL, SEEMS YOU'RE NOT ALONE THERE.
DEWEY:
WELL, SO, COME ON!
WHAT DO I GET?
THAT'S GOT TO BE WORTH SOMETHING.
IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO A HALFWAY HOUSE, YOU GOT TO GIVE ME MORE THAN THAT, DEWEY.
RAYLAN:
OH, COME ON, NOW.
TURN THAT FROWN AROUND.
HELL, YOU GIVE YOURSELF A SHAVE, I'LL BET YOU COULD PASS FOR 16.

LORETTA:
SHE AIN'T HERE.
COOVER:
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SHE AIN'T HERE?
LORETTA:
I MEAN SHE AIN'T HERE.
COOVER: [ CHUCKLING ] WELL, WHO'S MINDING THE STORE, THEN?
WHAT, YOU?
[ SNORTS ]
LORETTA:
SHE SAID SHE HAD AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO, BE BACK AFTER 4:00.
COOVER:
MM-HMM.
AND I GUESS SHE JUST UP AND LEFT YOU IN CHARGE.
I FIND THAT...
VERY HARD TO BELIEVE.
LORETTA:
WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME TO LOOK AROUND
FOR HER IF IT'LL SET YOUR MIND AT EASE.
COOVER:
YOU AIN'T GOT TO GET MOUTHY WITH ME, GIRL.
MAMA AIN'T NEVER LEFT ME IN CHARGE.
DICKIE NEITHER.
AND HERE YOU SIT?
LORETTA:
WELL, IT AIN'T AS GLAMOROUS AS IT LOOKS.
COOVER:
MM-HMM.
GOODBYE.

YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE MONEY FOR STUFF YOU TAKE.

[ DOOR OPENS ]
[ DOOR CLOSES ]
ART:
I APPRECIATE THE COURTESY.
BYE.
RAYLAN!
I JUST GOT A CALL THAT YOUR DADDY VIOLATED HIS TETHER AGAIN.
RAYLAN:
WELL, IF THEY FIND HIM, THEY CAN DO WITH HIM AS THEY SEE FIT.
ART:
HEY, LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED IN.
RAYLAN:
HEY.
WHO LET YOU OUT OF HARLAN?
TOM:
WELL, THEY TOLD ME TO DROP ON BY, SEE HOW YOU
BIG-TIME FEDERAL POLICE GET IT DONE.
ART:
WELL, WATCH AND LEARN, SON.
TOM:
YEAH.
LISTEN, I GOT A QUESTION.
ART:
SHOOT.
TOM:
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU TO LET ME HAVE MARSHAL GIVENS BACK DOWN TO HARLAN,
DO SOME MORE OF THAT TASK-FORCE STUFF WE'VE BEEN RUNNING?
ART:
ORDINARILY, I WOULD SAY, "ONLY IF YOU PROMISE TO KEEP HIM."
BUT CONSIDERING THE EPIC BACKLOG OF WORK THAT HE HAS, I GOT TO ASK, WHAT FOR?
TOM:
WELL, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THAT OXY BUST IS JUST SORT
OF THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG AS FAR AS PEOPLE TRYING TO FILL THE CROWDERS' SHOES DOWN THERE.
ART:
AND HOW EXACTLY DO YOU THINK RAYLAN HERE WOULD BE USEFUL TO YOU?
TOM:
WELL, ART, I'VE BEEN IN HARLAN 18 YEARS.
PEOPLE STILL LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M SOME KIND OF YANKEE COME DOWN
THERE TO BURN THEIR CROPS.
BUT THIS GUY...
RAYLAN:
I KNOW MY PEOPLE.
ART:
YOU'RE LIKE THE HILLBILLY WHISPERER.
PUT YOU ON "OPRAH."
RAYLAN:
I'LL GET MY COAT.
YOU CAN CATCH ME UP ON THE WAY DOWN.
ART:
JUST HOLD ON, COCHISE.
NOW, TOM, I HEAR YOU.
AND I KNOW THAT RAYLAN HERE WOULD PROBABLY PREFER BEING
DOWN THERE RUNNING DOWN THIS GRUDGE, BUT I ACTUALLY KIND
OF NEED HIM HERE TO DO SOME MARSHAL SHIT.
RAYLAN:
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
ART:
I'M TALKING ABOUT WHATEVER THIS BUSINESS IS WITH THE BENNETTS.
IT IS BEYOND THE PURVIEW OF WHAT I LIKE TO CALL YOUR JOB.
RAYLAN:
SPEAKING OF WHICH, I STOPPED BY UP AT THEIR PLACE THE OTHER DAY.
ART:
YEAH.
YOU STOPPED BY TO DO SOME DYNAMITE FISHING AND SEE WHAT
YOU COULD GET TO BOB UP TO THE SURFACE.
RAYLAN:
ON MY OWN TIME.
ART:
WEARING YOUR BADGE.
RAYLAN:
ANYWAY, I SAW LORETTA MCCREADY.
ANY SIGN OF HER DADDY SINCE WE CHECKED ON HIM?
TOM:
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD MENTION MCCREADY, 'CAUSE
I THOUGHT HE'D POPPED BACK UP IN TOWN LAST WEEK OR SO.
SOMEBODY'S BEEN CASHING HIS STATE-BENEFIT CHECKS.
BUT IF YOU HAVE A NICE, CLOSE LOOK AT THESE SIGNATURES, THEY'RE A LITTLE, UH,
INCONSISTENT.
RAYLAN:
ARE YOU THINKING A FORGERY?
TOM:
KIND OF A SHAKY HAND, WOULDN'T YOU SAY?
RAYLAN:
STANDARDS APPEAR TO BE SLIPPING.
ART:
GENTLEMEN, THIS IS REALLY FASCINATING AND STRANGELY
HEARTBREAKING, BUT I JUST DON'T SEE WHAT I GET OUT OF ALL THIS.
MULLEN. [ CLEARS THROAT ]
NO SHIT.
[ CHUCKLES ] HOLD ON A MINUTE.
WELL, THEY FOUND YOUR DADDY.
RAYLAN:
WHERE?
ART:
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE THIRD AND THE FOURTH FLOOR.
RAYLAN:
H-HERE?
ARLO:
THERE.
YOU HAPPY NOW?
RAYLAN:
I DON'T KNOW.
SHOULD I BE?
ARLO:
WELL, YOU WON, DIDN'T YOU?
BEAT AN OLD MAN DOWN, GOT YOUR WAY.
HELEN:
HE'S BEEN AT THE WILD TURKEY ON THE WAY UP, SO HE'S IN A SULK.
RAYLAN:
WELL, YOU VIOLATED YOUR TETHER RANGE COMING UP HERE, ARLO.
ARLO:
BROUGHT YOU YOUR DAMN MONEY,
SO YOU CAN JUST CUT THIS THING OFF MY LEG.
RAYLAN:
WELL, MATH WAS NEVER MY PRIME SUBJECT, BUT THIS FEELS
QUITE A BIT SOUTH OF $20,000.
ARLO: $6,000, THEREABOUTS.
ALL I GOT LEFT.
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.
RAYLAN:
OH, I'LL TAKE IT.
AND YOU CAN TAKE HIM TO THE CELL.
ARLO:
WHAT THE HELL?
IT'S SOMETHING, AIN'T IT?
HELEN:
HE HASN'T GOT ANY MORE, RAYLAN.
THAT'S IT.
RAYLAN:
I'M NOT RUNNING A YARD SALE, HELEN.
ARLO, YOU OWE WHAT YOU OWE.
ARLO:
SO, WHAT?
I WASTED MY TIME, THEN?
GIVE ME THAT MONEY BACK.
RAYLAN:
YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF YOUR OBLIGATION, YOU GIVE US THE REST.
OR...
MAYBE YOU GOT $14,000 IN INFORMATION, HUH?
WHAT WE PAID FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE.

WELL, WHAT YOU LOOKING FOR?
RAYLAN:
LOOKING FOR WHO MIGHT TRADE IN ILLEGAL PAPERS...

ASK ME SOMETHING ELSE.

I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT "SOMETHING ELSE."
HELEN:
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE!
ARLO:
HELEN, YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
HELEN:
THE HELL I WILL.
I WANT YOU GONE, AND IF THIS HELPS, GOOD.
RAYLAN, THERE'S ONLY ONE MAN IN THREE COUNTIES
THAT'LL GIVE YOU ANYTHING LIKE A FAIR DEAL ON DRAW CHECKS.
RAYLAN:
AND THAT MAN WOULD BE?
ARLO:
BONING YOU IN THE ASS.
GO AHEAD, WOMAN.
YOU ALREADY YAKKED UP THIS MUCH.
LAY IT ON HIM.
RAYLAN:
HELEN?
HELEN:
BOWMAN CROWDER.
ART:
DAMN SHAME, MAN YOU WANT BEING DEAD IN A BOX AT THE
HANDS OF YOUR OLD GIRLFRIEND, WASN'T IT?
[ CHUCKLES ]
YOU LET ME KNOW IF YOU GET HIM TALKING.
BE MIGHTY INTERESTED TO HEAR ANYTHING HE'S GOT TO SAY.
KYLE:
ALL RIGHT, BOYD, ONE MORE TIME.
WHILE YOU'RE TAKING THE PACKETS DOWN TO THE SPLINTER SHAFT,
WE'RE GONNA TRANSFER THE CASH TO THE TRUCK.
BOYD:
PRUITT'S GONNA DRIVE IT DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.
KYLE:
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND MARCUS AND I JOIN YOU IN THE HOLE.
AND THEN...
MARCUS:
BOOM.
KYLE:
DROP THE CEILING BETWEEN US AND THE SURFACE.
BOYD:
NOW, THE MAN GUARDING HIS TAKE...
NOW, I'VE KNOWN THIS MAN FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
HE WILL NOT EASILY PART WITH COMPANY MONEY.
KYLE:
WHO, SHELBY?
SHIT, BOYD.
DUDE'S OLDER THAN SHIT.
BOYD:
YET AGAIN, HE'S A STEADY HAND ON THAT .44
HE KEEPS
RIGHT UNDERNEATH HIS DESK.
KYLE: [ LAUGHS ]
YOU AIN'T GONNA HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SHELBY.
BOYD:
YEAH?
WHY IS THAT?
MARCUS: 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA KILL HIM.
BOYD:
WELL, NOW, YOU...
NEVER MENTIONED BLOODSHED.
NOW, IF YOU HAD BROUGHT THIS UP EARLIER, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS
CONVERSATION WOULD BE GOING ON THIS LONG.
KYLE:
YOU'VE KILLED MEN FOR FAR LESS, BOYD.
LET'S KEEP OUR EYE ON THE PRIZE.
MARCUS:
TAKE SHELBY DOWN IN THE SHAFT UNTIL YOU SET UP THE DET.
ONCE IT'S WIRED, YOU LAY A SHOVEL UPSIDE HIS HEAD REAL HARD.
CAVE-IN WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST.
KYLE:
SEE?
THAT'S THE GENIUS OF THE WHOLE THING.
EVERYBODY WILL THINK THAT HE STOLE THE MONEY, TRIED TO BLOW UP
THE SHAFT BEHIND HIM, BUT INSTEAD, PREMATURE DETONATION.
WE WAS JUST THE POOR MINERS WHO GOT CAUGHT UP IN ALL OF IT.
BOYD:
WELL, IF THIS IS GONNA GO DOWN TODAY,
THE DEVIL LIES IN THE DETAILS.
KYLE:
STOP WORRYING ABOUT THE DETAILS.
LET ME WORRY ABOUT THE DETAILS, ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU FOR ONE THING AND ONE THING ALONE.
BOYD:
WHAT'S THAT?
KYLE:
YOU'RE THE POWDERMAN, BOYD.
WE NEED YOU TO MAKE SURE THIS MOUNTAIN DON'T COME DOWN ON US AND KILL US.
NOW, ONCE YOU SET IT, WE'RE GONNA DETONATE REMOTELY.
ALL RIGHT?
ATF WILL BE ALL OVER THIS THING.
WE DON'T NEED ANY EXTRA DET WIRE TIPPING 'EM O... [ TELEPHONE RINGING ]
OFF.
BOYD:
WELL, I SHOULD PROBABLY GET THAT.
BOYD:
HELLO.
WHY, HELLO, AVA.
MARCUS:
AIN'T THAT HIS GIRLFRIEND?
KYLE:
HE SHOULD BE SO LUCKY.
MARCUS:
WE SHOULD ALL BE SO LUCKY.
BOYD:
OH, I'M LISTENING.
I HEAR THAT.
KYLE:
COME ON.
ALL WE GOT TO DO IS CHARGE THIS THING UP.
WE'RE READY TO ROCK.
LET'S GO.
PRUITT:
LET'S WRAP IT UP, BOYD.
BOYD:
NO.
THAT'S JUST THE TV.
I'M HERE ALL BY MYSELF.
MARCUS:
YOU THINK HE KNOWS?
KYLE: [ LAUGHS ]
DON'T WORRY ABOUT BOYD.
MARCUS:
KYLE, WHAT IF HE BAILS ON US?
KYLE:
THEN WE DO HIM NOW INSTEAD OF LATER.
MARCUS: [ CHUCKLES ]
KYLE:
WHEN HE GOES DOWN IN THE MINE, WE'LL JUST BLOW HIM UP.
PRUITT!
BOYD:
I GOT TO GO NOW, AVA.
MARCUS:
GOT YOU ON A TIGHT LEASH, HUH?
BOYD:
WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.
KYLE:
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, BOYD?
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
BOYD:
WELL, WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE ASKING OF ME TO DO, I CAN DO.
BUT RADIO DET ADDS A WHOLE NEW HOST OF COMPLEXITIES.
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY THIS IS GONNA WORK.
KYLE:
HOW'S THAT?
BOYD:
YOU AND YOUR BOYS, YOU DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAY, WHEN I SAY IT.
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN KEEP US ALL ALIVE.
KYLE:
WELL, HELL, BOYD.
AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU ROBBED...
I WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY.
KYLE:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
BOYD:
DISHES.
KYLE:
IS IT CHARGED?
BOYD:
NO, KYLE, FOR THE FIFTH TIME, IT IS NOT.
KYLE:
WHO THE HELL IS THAT?
BOYD:
THAT'S THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL MARSHAL.
KYLE:
WELL, WHAT'S HE DOING RE, BOYD?
!
BOYD:
I COULDN'T SAY.
KYLE:
HEY, PRUITT, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
PRUITT:
KYLE, GET OUT HERE.
RAYLAN:
HELLO, FELLAS.
DON'T BELIEVE I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE.
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW US.
WE MIND OUR OWN BUSINESS.
SUPPOSE IT'D BE BEST YOU DO THE SAME.
RAYLAN:
WELL, THAT WOULDN'T BE LIKE ME.
KYLE:
WHAT DO WE DO?
BOYD:
MY PLAY'S ALWAYS TO STOP HIM BEFORE HE GETS ON THE FRONT PORCH.
KYLE:
SHIT, BOYD.
RAYLAN:
DEPUTY U.S. MARSHAL RAYLAN GIVENS.
KYLE:
PLEASED TO MEET YOU, MARSHAL.
WE'RE BOYD'S FRIENDS FROM THE MINE.
WE JUST COME TO PICK HIM UP FOR WORK.
THAT'S ALL.
RAYLAN:
OH.
NICE TO SEE BOYD'S MAKING ACQUAINTANCES.
[ BEEPING ]
RAYLAN:
I'M GONNA STEP UP TO THE DOOR NOW, KYLE.
DO YOU SEE THAT AS BEING A PROBLEM?
BOYD:
STEP INSIDE TO DO THE DISHES FOR TWO MINUTES...
LOOK WHO COMES BY TO VISIT.
RAYLAN:
BOYD.
YOUR FRIENDS AND I WERE JUST GETTING ACQUAINTED.
BOYD:
I CAN SEE THAT.
WHAT BRINGS YOU UP TO THE HOLLER, RAYLAN?
RAYLAN:
JUST NEED A WORD.
BOYD:
WHY DON'T YOU GO MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME ON THE PORCH?
NOW, BOYD.
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS LONG ENOUGH.
I CAN SPOT OUTLAWS AT A THOUSAND PACES.
YOUR FRIENDS?
THEY'RE PACKING, ONE AND ALL.
BOYD:
WELL, I WOULDN'T KNOW.
BUT I'M SURE NONE OF THEM IS CARRYING WITH ILL INTENT.
RAYLAN:
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.
BOYD:
WHAT ARE YOU AFTER, RAYLAN?
RAYLAN: [ CLICKS TONGUE ] OH, YOUR BROTHER, BOWMAN.
YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM TRADING IN STOLEN PAPERS BACK WHEN?
DRAW CHECKS AND SUCH?
BOYD:
WELL, THERE'S LITTLE BY WAY OF ILLICIT ACTIVITY IN THIS COUNTY
THAT MY BROTHER DID NOT HAVE HIS HANDS ON IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
RAYLAN:
WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE.
BOYD:
YOU NEVER REALLY KNEW MY BROTHER, BOWMAN, DID YOU, RAYLAN?
RAYLAN:
I SAW HIM PLAY FOOTBALL.
BOYD:
GUNNED DOWN IN HIS PRIME
BY THE VERY HAND OF THE WOMAN I NOW SHARE HIS ROOF WITH.
RAYLAN:
MM-HMM.
BOYD:
NOT HARD TO FATHOM HIS END, GIVEN THE LIFE THAT HE LED.
MY BROTHER, BOWMAN, DID NOT DEAL DIRECTLY IN PAPER, RAYLAN.
HE HANDED IT OFF TO THIS JESUS FREAK.
RUNS THAT CHRISTIAN ATV PLACE UP IN GRANT'S HOLLER.
RAYLAN:
YOU MEAN OLD WINSTON BAINES?
TAKE AN ATV TOUR AND GET, LIKE, A SERMON ON THE MOUNT?
BOYD:
STEWARD OF THE EARTH, JUST LIKE IN GENESIS.
LITTLE TWITCHY.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE'S STILL IN THE GAME OR NOT.
KYLE:
COME ON, BOYD!
BOYD:
WELL, I GUESS ME AND THESE BOYS, WE NEED TO GET ON TO WORK.
ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED?
RAYLAN:
NOT RIGHT NOW.
BOYD:
WELL, YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, RAYLAN.
RAYLAN:
YOU TOO, BOYD.
KYLE:
WELL, WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ABOUT?
BOYD:
JUST SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT MY DEAD BROTHER, BOWMAN.
KYLE:
IS THAT RIGHT?
WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS?
BOYD:
WELL, IT'S PERSONAL.
BESIDES, WE GOT MORE PRESSING ISSUES TO ATTEND TO.
KYLE:
IS THAT RIGHT?
BOYD:
THE BATTERY...
IT'S NOT TAKING A CHARGE.
DON'T KNOW WHO YOU BOUGHT THIS THING FROM, BUT THEY MUST HAVE SEEN YOU COMING.
- KYLE:
SHIT.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
MARCUS:
WE GOT TO PICK UP ANOTHER ONE!
KYLE:
HELL NO.
IT'S 90 MINUTES THERE AND BACK.
WE'LL MISS THE SHIFT.
BOYD:
WELL, THEN WE DO IT AGAIN NEXT TIME.
MARCUS:
THERE AIN'T GONNA BE NO NEXT TIME, BOYD!
THIS IS THE ONLY CHANCE WE GOT!
BOYD:
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IN THIS BUSINESS IS WHEN TO WALK AWAY.
KYLE:
WE'RE NOT WALKING AWAY.
WE'LL HIT UP THE RADIO SHACK
ON THE WAY THERE, TRY TO RIG SOMETHING UP.
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S GO.
COME ON.
COME ON.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?
BOYD:
WRITING A NOTE TO AVA AND LETTING HER KNOW I'M GONNA BE LATE.
KYLE: [ SIGHS ] DAMN, BOYD.
BOYD:
DONE.
THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG, DID IT?
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A LIVING IN THIS BUSINESS, YOU GOT TO KNOW YOUR ABC'S.
"ALWAYS BE COOL."
[ ALARM BUZZING ]
YOU SURE YOUR RADIO SHACK WORK-AROUND'S GONNA DO THE TRICK?
I'D HATE TO DRIVE ALL THIS WAY FOR NOTHING.
KYLE:
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
JUST FOCUS ON SETTING THEM CHARGES RIGHT.
I DON'T WANT TO SUFFOCATE DOWN THERE.
BOYD:
YOU WILL NOT DIE DOWN IN THAT HOLE, KYLE.
YOU HAVE MY WORD ON THAT.
KYLE:
AND YOU HAVE MY WORD THESE BATTERIES ARE GONNA DO THEIR JOB.
GOD DAMN, BOYD.
WE'RE ABOUT TO BE RICH.
HOW YOU LIKE THAT?
RAYLAN: "THE CHURCH OF THE TWO-STROKE JESUS." THAT'S GOOD.
IT'S A GOOD ANGLE WITH THE TOURISTS THAT COME TO SEE THE BIBLE BELT IN ACTION.
HONEST-TO-GOD CHURCH, SANCTIONED BY THE STATE.
RAYLAN:
OH.
TWO THINGS IMPORTANT IN LIFE...
"PRAISE GOD AND RIDE HARD."
RAYLAN:
AMEN.
I TRY TO GIVE EACH ITS DUE.
RAYLAN:
WAS ASKING ABOUT CHECKS FROM THE STATE DRAW, TURNED UP CASHED.
FOLKS SAY YOU MIGHT BE A PERSON TO TALK TO ABOUT SUCH MATTERS.
WELL, THERE WAS A TIME THAT I
MIGHT HAVE HELPED OUT MY FELLOW DOWNTRODDEN
KENTUCKIANS LAY HANDS ON THEIR MONEY.
RAYLAN:
YOU SAYING THAT TIME HAS PASSED?
THE LORD HAS SEEN FIT TO BLESS MY LITTLE OFF-ROAD BUSINESS IN RECENT YEARS.
FOLKS TOUR MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL SITES, AND BEARS HAVE STARTED TO COME BACK.
RAYLAN:
SO YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR SIGNATURE
MATCHING UP WITH THE ONE OF A WALT MCCREADY, THEN...
SIGNED LAST WEEK.
SAY AGAIN? "MCCREADY"?
RAYLAN:
YEAH, NO, I GOT THE CHECKS HERE, WITH THE, UH,
SAMPLES OF YOUR FIRST TOUR UP AT BIG SANDY.
YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK, MAYBE REFRESH YOUR MEMORY?
I NEED MY GLASSES.
RAYLAN:
OH.
WELL.
LET'S SEE.
[ ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ]
RAYLAN: [ GRUNTING ]
[ GRUNTING ]
[ TASER CHARGING ]
RAYLAN:
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S BACK UP TO ABOUT 50%.
IT TAKES A WHILE AFTER THAT WALLOP.
[ STRAINING ] TASED ME IN THE NUTS, YOU SON OF A BITCH.
RAYLAN:
OH, WELL, I TRIED TO SHOOT YOU FIRST.

DON'T KNOW NO MCCREADY.
RAYLAN:
YOU EVER BEEN TASED IN THE MOUTH, BAINES?
I'M JUST THINKING THAT PROBABLY HURTS WORSE THAN A JOLT TO THE PECKER.
GO AHEAD, THEN.
DO YOUR WORST.
I AIN'T TELLING YOU SHIT, OR ANYBODY ELSE.
MARCUS:
MAN DOWN!
MAN DOWN!
BOYD:

BOYD:

MARCUS:

HE JUST NEEDS SOME FRESH AIR.
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

MARCUS:
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR, BITCHES?
LET'S DO THIS!
BOYD:
HEY, HEY!
CELLPHONES.
HAND THEM OVER.
MARCUS:
WHAT THE HELL FOR, MAN?
!
BOYD:
BECAUSE, MARCUS, WE'RE ABOUT TO SET OFF A REMOTE DETONATION.
THAT'S 20 POUNDS OF EMULEX TRIGGERED BY A RADIO SIGNAL.
WRONG SIGNAL ON OUR FREQUENCY, WE'RE ALL SHAKING HANDS WITH JESUS.
SO I'M JUST BEING OVERLY CAUTIOUS.
LOOK, YOU'LL GET THEM BACK.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE OFF, FOR MYSELF.
LET'S GO.
HAND THEM OVER.
KYLE:

RAYLAN:
ALTHOUGH, I GOT TO TELL YOU...
I'M SURPRISED THEY
CAN SMELL ANYTHING OVER THAT SHIT.
COOVER:
AH!
DANK AND DELICIOUS.
RAYLAN:
OH, I BET.
COOVER: [ COUGHING ]
RAYLAN:
THAT'S QUITE A HACK YOU GOT THERE.
COOVER:
YOU DON'T COUGH, YOU DON'T GET OFF.
RAYLAN:
SO I'VE HEARD.
COOVER: [ LAUGHS ] YEAH.
RAYLAN:
LISTEN, I KNOW HE AIN'T HERE,
BUT YOU'RE IN TOUCH WITH WALT MCCREADY, RIGHT?
YOUR MAMA SAID HE WAS WORKING FOR THE FAMILY DOWN SOUTH SOMEWHERE?
COOVER:
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID?
WELL, THEN, THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.
RAYLAN:
I KNOW YOU'RE CASHING HIS DRAW CHECKS FOR HIM.
YOU SENDING HIM THE MONEY, OR YOU KEEPING IT FOR YOURSELF?
WELL, ANYWAY, UH, IF YOU SEE WALT, WILL YOU TELL HIM I WAS ASKING AFTER HIM?
COOVER:
WHAT FOR?
RAYLAN:
JUST A FEW THINGS TO CLEAR UP IN THIS EARLIER CASE WITH THE MOLESTER...
JIMMY EARL DEAN.
JUST DOTTING THE I'S, THAT SORT OF THING.
COOVER:
ALL RIGHT.
RAYLAN:
I'LL LET YOU GET BACK TO IT.
[ DOG BARKING ]
BOYD:
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
KYLE:
THAT PHONE WAS OFF.
YOU CHECKED IT.
BOYD:
YEAH, THEN WHY DID IT RING?
I'LL BE HOLDING ON TO THAT, IN CASE ONE OF YOU OTHER
DUMBASSES DECIDE TO LET YOUR CELLPHONE RING.
THESE BATTERIES WILL STAY WITH ME.
HAND HIM THAT SHOVEL.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
SHELBY,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO SOMETHING STUPID AND MAKE ME POP YOU IN THE GUT AND CARRY YOU DOWN?
I WILL NOT.
BOYD:
GOOD.
YOU GET THIS CASH OUT OF HERE.
I'LL SEE YOU DOWN IN THE HOLE.
BRING THAT DETONATOR.
KYLE:
PUT THE MONEY IN THE TOOLBOX.
BOYD:
LET'S GO FOR A WALK, SHELBY.
MARCUS:
KYLE, HE'S GOT THE BATTERIES.
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE GONNA DO?
KYLE:
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, MARCUS.
HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK I AM?
16 YEARS IN THE BOY SCOUTS.
MY DADDY PROMISED ME A MARSHALL STACK AS LONG AS I MADE EAGLE.
WELL, HOWDY, I TELL YOU WHAT...
I ROCKED OUT THAT SUMMER.
THE ONLY OTHER THING I REMEMBER...
AH!
BE PREPARED.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
TAKE MY BATTERIES, I'LL GET ANOTHER BATTERY.
BOYD:

[ PANTING ]
BOYD:
FACE THAT WALL.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THOSE EXPLOSIVES?
YOU GONNA CAVE IN THIS MINE?
BOYD:

GOD DAMN IT, BOYD.
IF YOU'RE GONNA KILL ME, JUST KILL ME.
[ BEEPING ]
KYLE:
YOU READY?
MARCUS:
HEY, SO LONG, THERE, BOYD!
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY'D CHECKED THAT BAG?
BOYD:
THEN WE'D BE DEAD, SHELBY.
[ SIGHS ]
I'M SORRY TO GET YOU MIXED UP IN THIS.
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO GO DOWN THIS WAY.
WELL, SON.
I'M WALKING AWAY, AS FAR AS I KNOW.
UNLESS YOU'RE PLANNING ON PUTTING ONE IN ME.
BOYD:
NO, SIR, I AM NOT.
WELL, THEN I GUESS YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
I GOT NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT.
WHO'D LISTEN IF I DID?
BOYD:
WELL, THEN MIGHT I BE SO BOLD
AS TO ASK YOU FOR A FAVOR?
NAME IT.
BOYD:
THE COPS ARE GONNA COME.
ATF, DOGS...
EVERYTHING OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TO BEAR.
NOW, YOU TELL THEM THAT I HAD TO GO HOME.
IT WAS EMERGENCY, NOTHING ELSE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
SHELBY?
DONE, SIR.
COOVER:
NO ONE HERE.
DICKIE:
YES, I AM ABLE SEE THAT, COOVER.
THANK YOU.
COOVER:
YOU THINK HE TOLD THE FEDERAL WE GAVE HIM THE CHECKS TO CASH?
DICKIE:
UH, MAYBE WE SHOULD ASK THE FEDERAL.
COOVER:
OH, SHIT.
DO WE RUN?
DICKIE:
NO, WE DO NOT RUN.
REVEREND BAINES MUST NOT HAVE TOLD HIM.
OTHERWISE, RAYLAN WOULD BE ARRESTING US RIGHT NOW.
COOVER:
BUT HE KNOWS.
DICKIE:
YEAH, HE KNOWS, BUT HE CAN'T PROVE IT.
RAYLAN GIVENS!
RAYLAN:

WELL, WE DRIVE ON OUT OF HERE AND GIVE DOYLE A CALL ON THE WAY.
[ CAR DOOR CLOSES ]
GET IN.
COME ON.
COOVER:
YEAH.
LET'S GO.
[ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]
BOYD:
WELL, I CAN SEE BY YOUR FACE YOU'RE SOMEWHAT TROUBLED.
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT I HAD TO DO WITH THAT.
AVA: "CALL THIS NUMBER AT EXACTLY 6:05 P.M.
DON'T TELL ANYBODY."
BOYD:
WELL...
I ADMIT IT WAS TERSE.
[ SIGHS ]
I WROTE IT UNDER SOME TIME PRESSURE.
AVA:
BOYD, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
BOYD:
A FAVOR.
AVA:
AND WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I HADN'T CALLED?
BOYD:
WELL, YOU WOULDN'T BE SPEAKING TO ME RIGHT NOW, AVA.
AVA:
DAMN IT, BOYD.
WHAT THE HELL YOU GONE AND MADE ME A PART OF?
BOYD:
JUST SAVING MY LIFE.
NOTHING ELSE.
TOM:
WHAT'D I MISS?
RAYLAN:
OH, COOVER CAME BY WITH BROTHER DICKIE.
TOM:
THEY WERE TAKING MCCREADY'S DRAW CHECKS TO BAINES.
RAYLAN:
MM-HMM.
I DON'T SUPPOSE BAINES SAID ANYTHING TO YOU, DID HE?
TOM:
JUST SOME CRAZY STORY ABOUT YOU TASING HIM IN THE NUTS.
RAYLAN:
I DID.
TOM:
NICE.
SO?
RAYLAN:
SO EITHER THE BENNETTS ARE JUST BEING NEIGHBORLY,
CASHING MCCREADY'S CHECKS FOR HIM AND SENDING HIM THE MONEY...
TOM:
OR HE'S DEAD.
RAYLAN:
THE MORE LIKELY OPTION.
TOM:
AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT THAT GIRL.
RAYLAN:
ME TOO.
TOM:
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND ABOUT LORETTA, SHE'S A PRETTY TOUGH KID.
RAYLAN:
SHE'S 14.
TOM:
WHAT WERE YOU LIKE AT 14, GROWING UP AROUND THESE PARTS?
RAYLAN: [ SCOFFS ]
TOM:
CALL CHILD PROTECTION?
RAYLAN:
AND SAY WHAT?
SHE'S BEING CLOTHED AND FED?
TOM: [ SCOFFS ] YEAH.
LOOK, I GOT TO GET.
I GOT A WORLD OF SHIT COMING OFF THAT EXPLOSION UP AT THE PLACKETT MINE.
RAYLAN:
YEAH, I SAW THE, UH, FIRE-AND-RESCUE TRUCKS.
COLLAPSE?
TOM:
NO.
SOMEBODY BLEW UP A TRUCK WITH EMULEX.
LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE FIXING TO ROB THE PAYROLL, HAD SOME SORT
OF PREMATURE DETONATION.
RAYLAN:
BOYD?
TOM:
YOU MEAN IS HE DEAD, OR DID HE ROB IT?
RAYLAN:
EITHER ONE.
TOM:
NO SIGN OF HIS BODY IN THE TRUCK WRECKAGE.
ATF'S LOOKING FOR HIM NOW.
I'LL SEE YOU.
BOYD:
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY INTENDED TO LET ME LIVE THROUGH THE DAY.
DIDN'T THINK I WAS GONNA FIND A WAY OUT.
PART OF ME JUST FELT LIKE...
LAYING DOWN,
LETTING IT HAPPEN.
AVA:
BUT YOU KILLED THEM INSTEAD.
BOYD:
WELL, I GAVE THEM A CHOICE.
NOW, IF THEY HADN'T HAVE PULLED THAT SWITCH ON ME WHEN I WAS
DOWN THERE IN THAT HOLE, THINGS WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN DIFFERENT.
SO THE WAY I SEE IT, AVA, THEY KILLED THEMSELVES, WITH GREED AND AVARICE.
AVA:
WHEN I CALLED THAT CELL, DID I...
BOYD:
NO.
IT ALLOWED ME TO KICK THEM OUT OF THE TRAILER.
I PUT A LITTLE CASH ON THE EMULEX, A LITTLE EMULEX ON THE CASH,
AND I MADE SURE THAT THE BLASTING CAP WENT IN THEIR PACKET AND NOT MINE.
AVA: [ SIGHS ]
YOU COULD HAVE RUN WHEN RAYLAN CAME BY, JUST LIT OUT AND LET THE CHIPS FALL.
BOYD:
WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT ME THAT THAT THOUGHT NEVER CROSSED MY MIND?
AVA:
WHY DID YOU AGREE TO ROB THAT MINE IN THE FIRST PLACE?
BOYD:
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT I DO.
IT'S WHO I AM, AVA...
AS HARD AS I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PRETEND OTHERWISE.
EVERYBODY ELSE SEEMS TO KNOW THAT BUT ME.
ANYWAY, I CAME ACROSS THAT LETTER
THAT YOU RECEIVED FROM THE BANK.
AVA:
BOYD, I DON'T... [ SIGHS ]
BOYD:
I VIOLATED YOUR PRIVACY.
FOR THAT TRANSGRESSION, I DO APOLOGIZE.
AVA:
SO YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE AFTER THE HOUSE?
[ CHUCKLING ] I DON'T SUPPOSE ANY OF THAT MONEY SURVIVED THE BLAST.
BOYD:
THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST $15,000 TO $20,000 IN THERE.
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO PAY IT OFF, BUT ENOUGH TO BUY YOU SOME
SECURITY FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
AVA:
SHIT.
BOYD:
AVA, THERE'S ONE MORE FAVOR THAT I MUST ASK OF YOU.
AVA, YOU CAN HELP ME...
OR YOU CAN REFUSE.
EITHER WAY, I WILL UNDERSTAND.
BUT I'M GONNA NEED TO KNOW YOUR ANSWER RIGHT NOW.
DICKIE:
HEY, HERE HE COMES.
COOVER:
OH, SHIT, MAMA'S WITH HIM.
HEY, MAMA.
MAGS:
WE NEED TO TALK.
DICKIE:
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING, MAMA?
MAGS:
NOTHING'S GONNA TAKE THE TASTE AWAY FROM MY BOYS GOING BEHIND MY BACK.
COOVER:
MAMA, W-WE NEVER WENT BEHIND...
MAGS:
CASHING MCCREADY'S DRAW CHECKS?
HOW LONG DID YOU THINK IT'D TAKE BEFORE THAT'D COME BACK ON US?
COOVER:
MAMA, THAT'S THAT FEDERAL.
HE'S AIMING FOR TROUBLE WITH US, ALWAYS HAS BEEN.
MAGS: 'CAUSE OF YOUR ACTIONS.
STARTING WITH HIRING THAT PEDERAST TO DO A JOB I GIVE YOU.
COOVER:
I'M SORRY, MAMA.
MAGS:

THAT'S WHY IT'S GONNA HURT SO MUCH TO HAVE TO DO THIS.

YOU AIN'T GOT TO DO THIS.

YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
COOVER:

I'LL GIVE YOU $15 FOR A DUB.
LORETTA:

OH, SHIT.

LORETTA, I SEE YOU'RE KEEPING BUSY.

OBSTRUCT YOUR INVESTIGATION.
SO I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION BEFORE YOU START SHOOTING.
RAYLAN:
THAT'S FUNNY.
MIND IF I...?
LORETTA:
SO, IF YOU'RE NOT HERE TO ROUST ME OVER THE WEED,
MIGHT I INQUIRE AS TO YOUR INTENTIONS?
RAYLAN:
I KNOW YOU DON'T TRUST ME.
I DON'T FAULT YOU THAT, THOUGH I LIKE TO THINK MY GETTING YOU
OUT OF JIMMY EARL DEAN'S TRUNK MIGHT HAVE EARNED ME SOME TRACTION.
I KICKED A HORNETS' NEST LAST NIGHT.
AND THINGS MAY START TO HAPPEN, AND I NEED YOU TO KNOW
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN TROUBLE...
ANY KIND...
YOU CAN CALL ME.
I'LL DROP WHATEVER I'M DOING, AND I WILL COME FOR YOU.
YOU HEAR ME?
Previously on The Hard Times of RJ Berger...
I've never really had a zit before.
Ever?
I'm sure you have so much in common with that vapid coose Jenny.
Do you have lady gaga?
Or Katy Perry?
I don't have...those.
Ow!
Whoa.
This place is dangerous, Berger.
No wonder why I never come in here.
Good one, Max.
Every once in a while
Max remembers the school has a library, so I'm forced to study with Miles.
Hey, does sex feel like this?
Or like this?
In times like these,
I normally consider my home a fortress of studious solitude, but ever since my parents split,
I feel like my world's been splitting with them.
All those channels for free?
Even the dirty ones?
Whoever will I watch them with?
Can I get you some wine?
They say divorce turns parents into children and children into parents.
Come on, God, give Ricky some boob tube.
What they don't tell you is that it turns everyone into train wrecks.
What are we watching?
Only channel the motel gets.
And this particular train has wrecked right into my grades.
I'm disappointed, RJ.
That's the third straight decline.
But a big fat "a" for you, Miles.
Thanks.
My name is RJ Berger, and my life is literally rotting my brain.
Mrs. K really boils the man gravy, huh?
Ah, she's the hottest sub ever.
I'm gonna miss her.
These grades don't make any sense.
Did you even study for this?
Hells no!
I don't even know what this test is about!
Eyes up front please.
You don't have to ask me twice, Mrs. K.
So you plan on getting in Jenny's pink sometime this century?
I don't know.
I guess so.
"I guess so"?
Are you nuts?
You've been wanting to lay strings across that mug since you were a kid.
It's your destiny.
Honestly, Miles, I don't know anymore.
Jenny's been really weird lately.
First there was the lock-in, then the whole zit incident.
And now, on top of that, my grades are dropping like a...
Like a...
Nothing.
I got nothing.
Dude, who cares?
It's time for you to stop thinking and start boning.
Mr. Jenner.
Oh, crap.
Miles, please come and see me during my free period.
RJ, hey, wait up.
Hey.
Hey, Mr. Mopey.
Guess what?
My parents are going out of town Friday.
You know what that means.
Yeah, assuming I'm ever allowed out of the apartment again.
What?
I'm practically flunking all of my classes, and I just found out that my parents are coming in for a crisis meeting about my grades.
I'm sure you'll find a way to fix it.
They haven't been in the same room together in weeks, and the first time they do, it's to discuss their idiot son.
Maybe it'll be good for them to see each other.
Good for them to see each other?
It is going to be a battle royale.
It's gonna be a bloodbath!
It's...
It's gonna be, fine, RJ.
Look, I'm sorry.
I know you've had a tough few weeks.
I mean, we kind of hit our own little rough patch.
That's why I want to make Friday night really special.
Me and you are finally gonna lose our virginity.
Our virginity.
Can't wait.
There's more where that came from.
Oh, so now it's my fault that he can't study at your flea bag hooker motel.
Mom, dad, please!
Don't tell me there aren't hookers there, because we used to pick them up together.
Mr. and Mrs. Berger!
This is a counselor-parent meeting.
Save that crap for Montel.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Now, I called you in today because it's apparent...
No, I take that back.
It's friggin' obvious that RJ's home life is affecting his grades.
Well...
I'm putting RJ on academic probation.
RJ, you're gonna be meeting in the library for tutoring three days a week, effective immediately.
What?
No, no, no, but... but...
Butts are for toilet seats, Berger.
Now I'm gonna be checking in with his...teachers daily...
And...
And reporting back to you regularly.
In the meantime, you two keep that crap bottled up when you're around his impressionable young mind.
Fine.
Try and tone it down.
I, uh, appreciate you coming in, Mrs. Berger.
Well, thank you, coach Sinclair.
It's nice to know there are still a few gentlemen left in the world.
You're welcome.
And, please, call me Jeriba.
Jeriba.

Uh, yes.
Yes.
I'm...
I am here to see a...tutor.
Yeah, were you just picturing me naked?
What?
No...
is...
I would...
Girls can tell when you're doing that, you know.
Well, sorry.
I...
I was not doing...
Yeah?
You can tell when I do that?
I can.
And stop saying "I'm sorry."
- It makes people hate you.
- Sorry.
RJ, right?
I'm Amy, and you're coming with me.
Okay, so it says here you're smart.
At least you used to be.
Till recently.
Okay, so what's your deal?
Drugs, or...?
You mean why are my grades dropping like...
Like...
Like preteen panties at a Justin Bieber concert.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, uh...
My parents are getting divorced, and, um, uh, my girlfriend doesn't get it, and everyone else just sort of thinks I'm a loser, so it's just kind of hard.
Wow.
That is pathetic.
What?
Hey, you might as well have just said,
"I'm in high school."
You know, everybody has those problems.
They do?
Yeah, I mean, my parents got divorced last year, and, yeah, I thought it was all my fault, and, yeah, it really messed me up.
I'm sorry.
But then, you know, things got better, right?
It got worse.
It got way worse.
Yeah, but then you have to realize that, you know, that stuff is their life, and you have to live yours.
That's all you can do.
That's it?
That's it.
All right, now let's see what Mr. Python Pants' big old bulging brain can do when he's not worrying about everyone else in the world.
You know about that?
Yeah, everybody knows about that.
Mrs. K, you wanted to see me?
Would you excuse us, please?
Okay, Mrs. K. I'll wait in the hall.
Look, Mrs. K, if this is about me talking,
I just want you to know that it's not gonna happen agai...
Shut up, Miles.
Whoa.
- Put your arms up.
- Hmm?
Oh, God.
Oh, would you look at that.
Hey, if this is some fat hate crime...
Mm.
I have been watching you walk that sweet doughy ass in and out of my class for the last three weeks, and I can't stand the thought of leaving without a taste.
Then taste me.
Taste me!
Ugh, you're like a Teddy Bear made out of marshmallows.
Ooh, I can barely get my leg around you.
Yeah!
Ooh, no.
Not yet.
It has to be perfect.
This is perfect.
I love this.
I have six pornos where this exact thing happens.
Oh, Miles, Miles, my sweet, sweet Goliath, this will happen.
Meet me after lunch tomorrow.
Eat hearty.
Have seconds.
I will.
You like this cannoli, right?
Uh, yeah, looks pretty go...
Well, I have something much, much sweeter, and you are gonna eat it all up, big boy.
Dude, we are completely boob to boob.
I mean, I'm flagpoling just thinking about it.
She's into big guys, RJ.
She's a teacher, Miles.
Mr. Bonaventure is a teacher.
Sir.
- Mrs. K, she's a tilf.
- A tilf?
Yeah, teacher I'd like to...
Okay, look, I know this is the most awesome thing that's ever happened to you, but bear in mind, nothing good will come of this.
Wow, RJ.
Can't you just be happy for me for once?
It's my turn to get the "v" monkey off my back.
You've already busted your cherry.
Yes, with a girl my own age.
Yeah, with a girl on her deathbed.
Aah.
Please keep that down.
If Jenny hears, I'm dead.
Oh, and while you're busy judging me,
I'll bet our friendship that you've already fantasized about two-timing with your tutor.
Amy is different, okay?
She's 17, she's a tutor...
She... and you know what?
She's just a cool chick.
RJ, 99% of the world's great calamities began with the words, "she's just a cool chick."

It's a good thing you're cute, because that was hands down the nerdiest thing I have ever heard.
Hey, RJ.
Hey.
Um, I'm sorry.
This is my...
my tutor, Amy.
Amy Bresner.
Hi...
Amy.
Um, I just wanted to talk to you about Friday night.
But I guess you're busy, so...
You want to talk later?
I will talk to you later.
- Okay.
- Cool.
So you and Jenny Swanson...
It's weird, I know.
Oh, it's...
Why is it weird?
No, I mean, she's hot, and you're, like, the coolest guy in school.
You think I'm the coolest guy in school?
No.
No.
And she definitely doesn't seem like the type of girl who gets off on epic polynomial end values.
She doesn't.
Believe me.
So I ask again, you and Jenny Swanson?
You did it in the broom closet?
No, just her vagina.
No, no, no, I mean...
Never mind.
Wow.
Man, sex is not like squeezing a pastry at all, is it?
Not too much.
You know, I think I was good at it.
That's good for you.
Kind of makes your junk itch though, huh?
Um, no?
Really?
Some sort of bug.
Dude!
Oh, my God!
You have crabs.
RJ, calm down.
It's just one tiny, little...
Holy shit!
I got crabs.
I get laid one time.
One time!
And boom, my balls are an exhibit at crustacean nation.
Dude, Mrs. K lied to you.
Uh, it was more like a sin of omission.
Plus you don't understand what Mrs. K and I have.
Yes, I do.
You have little animals living in your pubes.
Whatever, dude.
Here.
I need you to grab my pants so I can foam 'em up and shave 'em down.
You can't be serious.
What?
I'd do it for you.
Come on, RJ.
I got to kill these boner biters and get back to the monkey business.
Come on.
Here...
If I were a dick, I'd say "I told you so."
- Ooh.
- Oh!
Let's do this.
This is without a doubt the most disgusting thing I've ever done.
It's for a good cause, bro.
The cause of getting laid.
Hey, you patsies aren't here to chat.
You're here to haul crab.
Now get to it.
Dude, those are on your junk!
Not for long.
Man overboard!
Help me!
It's so gross, Miles!
The foam cannon!
Get to the foam cannon!
It's not working!
Then there's only one thing left to do.
Okay.
That sucked.
I am never having sex again.
Oh.
Sorry.
♪ Scratch my way ♪

Excellent work, RJ.
Best score in the entire class.
That tutor must be working out really well for you.
Mrs. K...
Oh, yes, my sweet, sweet sugar bear.
We're through.
But, Miles, let's not waste what little time we still have left together.
Look, lady, a trip to your patch turned my crotch into a shrimp shack.
Happens once, crabs on me.
Happens twice...
Totally gross.
You'll always be my ice cream man.
Hey, Lily.
Hey, um, do you mind if I ask you a question?
Yeah, as long as it's not about that special Friday night when RJ tickles your intestines.
I'm just busting your labia.
Of course that's what you're asking me about.
Shoot.
Well, what do I need to know?
I mean, this is my first time.
Say what?
I thought you were a total slut.
Why does everybody think that?
This is gonna be like taking a jackhammer to a Barbie doll.
I know.
I mean, RJ isn't exactly average.
Speaking from personal experience, the only reason I was able to handle RJ was because...
Well, "A," I was half dead...
And, "B," my pelvis was shattered into, like, a million little pieces so...
Wait a minute.
You two slept together?
I'm never gonna see another cannoli with getting half-chub again.
Oh, which reminds me,
I think it's time for me to pass the boner baton to you.
Tonight's the big night with Jenny, huh?
Yeah, I guess so.
I don't know.
I'm starting to think...
I've been wrong all along.
And, you know, maybe Jenny's not the perfect girl after all.
What...?
Hey, that is the pre-sex nerves talking.
You're gonna do fine, bro.
Just breathe in and try not to put a hole through her stomach.
Hey, asshole.
You didn't tell her about us?
And you didn't tell me you didn't tell her about us?
You better move to another life.
You told her?
She asked about your cherry, which is my trophy.
I'd claw your eyes out if I didn't know she was about to do it for me.
RJ?
Hey.
You lied to me?
No, I didn't...
I didn't lie to you.
It was more of a sin of omission.
Get him in a body bag!
Body bag.
You're supposed to be different from them.
But you're not.
You're not even worth it.
Ooh.
Aw...
My name is RJ Berger, and my life is literally breaking my heart.
Oh, bit early, aren't you?
Has she already let you in?
What are you wearing?
Oi, don't just stand there.
We've got work to do.
Damn you, tequila.
Hello, earth to Darren.
Give me a hand?
What, is she making us take our shoes off?
Darren.
Darren, you still here?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Em...
Oh, sorry!
I didn't know you were here.
Did Darren let you in?
Yeah.
Sorry, love.
I'm Ollie.
Hey, you can see her knickers.
I know.
Well, get yourself sorted, I'll be down in a minute.
Darren, I'll sort us some food in a sec.
OK, thanks.
What?
I said I was hungry.
Shall we get going then, unload?
Bit eager, aren't you?
Sorry, love, just going to nip to the van, get some more stuff.
OK.
I'm just gonna help him.
Oh, OK.
What she need to know that for?
Why does she need to know you're doing it?
Well, I'm in her house, aren't I?
It's common courtesy.
There you go - common courtesy.
You haven't got any painkillers, have you?
My head's killing me.
Seriously, Darren, what are you wearing?
I'm willing to listen to other ideas, I am, but Hair Of The Dog, it's dead.
Ian, I...
No, Emma, it's not making money and I can't afford to lose any more.
It's a dodo.
OK, OK.
Well, I've got lots of other ideas you can invest in.
There's Fish And Dips, we serve fish with...
No.
Coney Island...
Irish stew in ice-cream cones.
Ridiculous.
Hungry Like The Wolf?
What's that?
Well, it's a song, isn't it, by those Rio guys?
It's a themed restaurant.
And what's it serve?
Wolf.
Goodbye.
Toast.
Toast.
The Toast Office.
Beans on toast with luxury beans, cheese on toast with cheeses from around the world, all served with champagne to toast your toast.
Toast your toast.
Interesting.
I like the sound of that.
Have you got a business plan?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
OK.
So I have a couple more meetings and then I've got to get the 5.16 back to London so I can meet you here at 4.00pm when you can pitch to me, OK?
OK.
And Emma, here at 4.00pm, last chance.
Ian, everyone loves toast.
You can't keep doing this, coming to the office all hungover.
Office?
Yeah, work, a day at the office, that's what people call it.
That's what people who work in offices call it.
Had a tough day at the office?
Never heard that?
Yeah I've heard loads of people say it.
They all worked in offices.
Just a common phrase, Darren.
You're just obsessed.
Wasn't your restaurant idea an office thing?
Yeah.
The Toast Office.
Not going to happen now though, is it?
Yeah, well, good cos it will break your dad's heart.
She's pretty fit, though, isn't she?
She's massively out of your league.
No, she's not, we're both nines.
You're both...
You're a low seven at best.
Oh, thought about it, have you?
No.
You said it.
Can't take it back now.
You think I'm a seven.
A low seven.
Doesn't matter, it's out there.
You want me and I'm sorry to say, but as a low seven, four points out of your league.
Grow up.
Sexual harassment in the workplace, that is, checking me out whilst I do my job.
Why is there a suit?
You don't actually think this is an office?
It's my dad's, from the dry-cleaners.
They are some pimp lapels.
Yeah, I know.
He bought it in '78.
"One good suit to last you your whole life, son." Jesus.
Yeah, I know.
Darren?
I've rustled us up some coffee and croissants.
OK, I'm just helping here, there's a lot of stuff to carry.
OK, well don't be too long.
I won't.
What was that about?
Oh, yes.
Hello. 'Hi, listen, that idea you had, the Toast Office,' do you have a business plan?
Yeah, sort of, why?
OK, great.
Listen, where are you?
I'm coming over. 'I'm working.' Yeah, well, I need the address.
I've found an investor.
How'd you manage that?
'It's a business contact.'
Look, can you tell me where you are?
I've driven round this roundabout four times.
Well, let's meet for dinner.
No, I've got to pitch this at 4.00 today.
I can't, I'll be working.
I don't need you, I'll pitch it myself.
Listen, it's my idea, I'll pitch it.
All right, just tell me where your business plan is and hurry up
- I feel sick.
It's in my house, in the lounge, in the top drawer of the sideboard?
OK, great, I'm coming over.
Toast Office, baby!
Come on!
Was that the hospital?
Cleared you of knob-rot, have they?
Ha-ha!
Come on, give us a hand with this.
Sure thing.
No worries, boss, whatever you need.
A question - the lady who lives here, don't suppose you know her name?
I've been racking my brains all morning.
What?
What are you talking about?
OK, just there.
What are you doing, why are you helping him?
I'm just being nice...
Miss L McKeith.
Why, thank you, Mr D Brown.
Why hasn't it got her first name?
I don't know, it just doesn't.
Bollocks.
Louise?
Liz?
I hope not, that's my sister's name.
Nice place you got here.
How long you been here?
About three years.
Darren, brunch is ready.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are YOU going?
Brunch.
We've got work to do.
Just let me have a pastry and then I'll help.
No, Darren, it's a two-man job.
Got to be out of here by 4.00.
Why, what are you doing?
Going to the hospital to deal with my knob-rot.
Darren, seriously, what are you wearing?
OK, that's a Top Shop blouse.
Listen, I spilt a drink on myself before you came here and she leant it to me.
That's not appropriate.
I shouldn't find you wearing a client's clothes.
I caught your dad trying on a bra once.
No, you didn't.
Did you?
So I've had to take the day off for the handyman.
Do you fancy sticking around?
Not if you've got to go to work.
Yeah, yeah, I'll stick around for a bit.
Oh, perfect, I wasn't sure if you'd be needed today or not.
Must be nice to be the boss.
Sorry, sorry, he's...
He's the what now?
Darren, he runs his own firm.
Oh, my God!
Oh, God, Darren.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Quick, quick, get a cloth.
Coffee stain.
Oh, all right.
Coffee stain.
I shagged her last night.
I met her in a club.
I was sneaking out this morning and you were at the front door.
Oh, hang on, what?
Last night.
I nailed her.
You nailed her?
Twice.
And they say romance is dead.
I'm sorry, I'm so clumsy.
Don't worry about it, it's no biggie.
What?
She doesn't know I'm a handyman.
Why not?
I don't know, I just made stuff up.
She doesn't know I know you.
All done.
Brilliant.
Oh, crap!
What are you doing?
!
I'm so sorry!
You'll need a bigger cloth.
Oh, I am, am I?
You get it, it's your mess, you clean it up.
Under the kitchen sink.
Ollie, do you want to give us a hand?
Why do you need him?
I don't know why he's stood here.
I'm paying you to work.
Fireplace.
Yeah, sorry.
I'm just going to go and get those papers.
Oi, what did you lie for?
I just made stuff up to get her into bed.
Stuff like what?
I don't know, I can't remember.
Oh, oh, ashamed of being a handyman, are you, eh?
Not good enough for you, are we?
Here are those documents you said you'd look at for me.
Do you mind?
Not at all.
Great.
Sounds very important.
What is it you do for a living, Darren?
Sorry, would you just mind getting on with your work, please.
Oh, come on, I'm just interested in what it is you do for a living.
What's your, er...
What's your job?
Are you just going to annoy my friend or fit my fireplace?
Yes, I'm glad I'm not employing you if this is what you're going to be like.
I was just asking Oliver to pop round next week and give me a quote on my pool house.
I'm retiling my pool house, but he says he's really bad at tiling... and plumbing.
Strange, I thought that'd be just another day at the office for you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I might have to take this.
Bloody cowboys.
Are you wearing my blouse?
Yeah.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Oliver Curry speaking, how can I help?
"Sorry to keep you waiting, Oliver Curry speaking."
You sound like a dick.
Sorry, I thought you were someone else.
What, someone who's a dick?
Dad, did you withhold your number?
I didn't want anyone listening in, it's a private call.
It makes the number private, it doesn't make...
You know, it doesn't matter.
What's up?
Nothing much, just thought I'd ring for a chat, you know, see how you are.
And... oh, yes, I need you to go to the bookies for me, place a bet.
No.
It's important, I've tried Darren but I couldn't get hold of him.
I need you to do it before 3.00.
Dad, I'm working, go yourself.
Look, it's just one bet, Ollie.
I need you to do this.
Dad, I'm not going to the bookies, end of.
Hi, Ollie said I should come over.
You're not pregnant, are you?
What, no, why would I...?
Always worth asking.
What can I do for you?
I need to get his business...
some paperwork.
I know where it is, can I get it?
Go for your life.
A-ha, bingo...
Oh, my God - this is rubbish!
Oh, he's going to make me look like an idiot.
Where's he working?
I need to see him now.
You know what,
I could do with yelling at him myself.
Give us a lift and we'll both go.
OK.
How tall are you?
Six foot, five and a half.
Why?
No reason.
"Property claim?" What do you think that is?
Estate agent, maybe I'm an estate agent.
I'll tell you what you are - a handyman, so give me a hand.
"Purchase of plant equipment?"
I never would have said I'm a gardener, that's worse than a handyman.
What did I say I do?
I don't care, right?
Just get this sorted before it gets worse.
Hey up!
It's worse.
I need a word.
Me too.
What are you doing here?
Darren, I...
Oh, who are you?
Don't worry, we won't come in.
Messy shoes, don't want to ruin the carpet.
I'm sorry, this is my dad, this is Emma.
I'm dealing with it.
OK, I'm Lucy.
Lucy!
This is Lucy.
What are you doing here?
Your dad told me where you were so we drove over.
In your car?
Not now, Darren.
Do you two know each other?
Yeah,
I did some work for her dad.
It was a problem with a tree.
Wasn't it the bathroom?
Yeah, the tree was blocking the light to the bathroom.
Right.
Yeah.
I read your proposal, it is shocking.
It needs focussing, formatting.
Not now.
We need to sort it.
It doesn't just affect you!
Fine, outside.
Please, just give me a minute, please.
Hey, what's he up to?
I think she might be up the duff.
Emma, I can't do this now, I've got to be working...
Oh, my God!
Did you put my dad in that car?
He's supposed to be relaxing.
Your plan is rubbish!
You may as well have signed it with a thumbprint!
Why can't we rearrange for tomorrow?
Jesus, Ollie, you don't get it!
It's got to be today, Ollie, today!
Right, calm down.
I brought the fireplace adhesive you need.
What adhesive?
I didn't ask for adhesive.
Darren rang me.
How else you planning on attaching it to the wall?
I'm just...
Don't tell me you were going to nail it on?
Oh, my God, you were!
Here you are, let's have a look.
I know what this is about - beans on toast with luxury bloody beans.
What, we're not good enough for you now?
Cheers, sis.
What is his problem?
Where's he going?
Brunch.
Will somebody please tell me what the hell is going on?
Exactly.
Emma thinks she might have found me an investor.
You know, for the Toast Office.
She's got to meet the guy at 4.00.
Thank God for that.
I thought you'd knocked her up.
What?
What?
What?
I haven't.
He really hasn't.
I should have known better.
I mean she's a ten, you're a four at best.
A four?
!
You're OK with this though, Dad, the restaurant thing?
Yeah, sounds like a good opportunity.
Tony!
Where's the meeting?
On the High Street.
That's perfect - right near the bookies!
I need this put on by 3.00.
OK, but the meeting's at 4.00.
The cash and details are inside.
Dad, why can't you just put the bet on yourself?
Politics.
Now, look here!
She's not paying you to stand around and gossip, you know.
I'll place the bloody bet, if only to get away Sideshow Bob for an hour.
I'll go and tell Lucy.
Great, I'll give you a lift.
You're going to have fit this fireplace.
What is going on?
So if it's on the party wall then the regulations are different, aren't they?
If you like.
Right, I'm going to have to nip out for a bit.
What about my fireplace?
My dad's going to take over.
Listen, Dad, take it easy.
Comprende!
All right?
Use Darren as much as you can.
Right then, numb nuts, give us a hand with this.
Er, Tony...
Darren!
Oh, my God, do you know everyone?
No.
So how do you two know each other?
Bloody tequila.
I'll go to the cafe, start the business plan, you place the bet then meet me.
Right, I won't be long.
All right?
Just this, please, love.
What's that?
Him?
He's banned.
We think he's the ringleader of a local betting syndicate.
The ringleader?
Horses run badly for races, then when the odds are stupid-to-one they let it run properly and make a wedge of cash.
What, it's a scam?
We've got their number.
They all bet a load of money, say 200 quid each, loads of them at a load of different bookies about an hour before the race is due to be run.
It's tricky to catch it.
Do you know that guy?
Who, him?
Nah, never seen him before in my life.
Fair enough.
So what can I do for you?
Erm...
Ach, you know, I don't think I'm going to bet today after all.
Oh, really?
!
But you've got the slip all filled out.
Yeah, change of heart.
You've got to be strong - it is an addiction.
Show me that slip.
No.
Why not?
Private.
After what I told you, suddenly you don't want to bet?
Changed my mind.
Haven't got the money.
Yeah, you do, it's there in your hand.
I'd say that looks like, what, 200 quid?
Well, thanks anyway, love, it's been lovely to talk to you, but I've got to get going.
Ronnie!
You can't be serious, what are you going to do?
Darren, I know you like helping people, but this is getting stupid.
Yeah, I...
Hello.
Hello, Dad, it's me.
I'm not able to make it back to work today.
I'm being held at the bookies.
'Any thoughts why?
'
What's up?
Ollie's being held at the bookies, they won't let him leave.
If they keep him there, he'll miss his meeting.
Genius.
No.
No, I can't, it's his dream.
Sorry love, I've got to go.
No, no, no, this is...
I can't take another day off work.
He said it was a one-day job.
Can't be helped.
Me son's in a pickle.
This needs finishing!
There's not a lot we can do, is there?
Of course there is.
Darren, can't you help?
You're a lawyer.
Lawyer, I'm a lawyer!
I'm a lawyer.
Don't try nothing funny or Ronnie'll have you.
I-I came in to place a bet, right, and I changed my mind and then I wanted to leave.
You can't just hold me here against my will.
You know as well as I do that was a dodgy bet.
So tell me who runs the scam!
I don't know.
Right, show me some ID.
Come on!
Oliver Josh Curry.
Posh.
Well, not really, my dad wanted to call me Rogan.
Rogan Josh Curry.
Don't mess with me.
I'm not.
You don't know me dad.
Who's this fella?
I've never seen him before in my life.
Ollie, where are you?
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
This is illegal, you know, I've got to be somewhere.
Then tell me who he is!
You're not going nowhere till you do.
Right!
Darren Brown.
Brown and Brown... and, er, Brown...
lawyers?
Got a card.
This is for a dry-cleaners.
Yeah.
Yeah, we share an office.
Together, we're cleaning up this town.
No?
I'm here to represent him, so can somebody please tell me what the God damn hell is going on?
!
Am I allowed a moment alone with my client?
Isn't that what usually happens?
Whatever.
You've got two minutes.
I'll just go and see if I've got any knickers that need washing.
Maybe you can take them back to the office with you.
What?
Oh, yeah, thanks.
They'll be happy for the work.
I want a name.
Ronnie!
What are you doing?
Is that my dad's suit?
Are they my sunglasses?
Yeah they are, I'm just trying...
Oi.
Where are the lenses?
I pushed them out.
What for?
Well, I'm trying to look clever.
Darren, what are you doing here?
I couldn't help it.
You rang and then what's-her-face insisted we come down and help you.
She really wants a fireplace.
How are you going to help?
Well, apparently, I'm a lawyer.
I think we've got a really strong case.
Darren, you're not an actual lawyer.
Ssh, I know, just stay strong.
Darren, I don't care.
Just get me out of here, I'm going to be late.
What, for your investor thing?
I should leave you here so you miss it.
Why don't you then?
I mean, days like these and you wonder why I want to do something else?
It's not about you.
It's about your dad.
It didn't bother him earlier.
And you believed him?
Ollie, it's your dad.
You don't get it, right, the business is only thing keeping him going.
Right, time's up.
Fine.
So, I ask you again, who were you putting that bet on for?
My client was putting the bet on for himself.
No, he wasn't, he's part of a scam.
No, he's not.
Look at him.
He couldn't pull a scam, he's not all there.
Are you taking the piss?
Hey, hey, whoa, no, no, no.
No, I'm not, no...
I just think it's nice that they let him out once in a while.
Why's he here again?
Cos Ronnie'll break his legs if he leaves.
See, now I KNOW that that's illegal, someone tried to do that to me once.
Hang on, so you've kept him here for over an hour-and-a-half and even I know that's kidnapping, and that's a crime.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah!
Nice suit.
How did it go?
I'm a legal genius.
Knew it.
They're idiots in there.
Yeah.
Quick, I need the van keys, I've got to go.
Hurry up.
Are you lot still here?
What the f...?
It's bloody you.
I've never seen him before in my life.
Ronnie!
I'll meet you in the pub, Darren.
What about my fireplace?
So what this is, this is your business plan!
I have silent partner, Ollie, he's meant to be here.
OK, so where is he?
Why don't you give him a call?
Well, I've tried, but my phone's being an idiot, I keep having to use the payphone.
Maybe it's been cut off.
You have been paying the bill, haven't you?
Ah-ha-ha!
That'll be it, I've been cut off.
I'm just going to pop outside and see if I can get some reception.
OK.
Liz!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
OK, OK, I need you to do me a favour.
And here she is.
My business partner Liz.
Er, yeah, Liz, business partner.
Right.
I thought we were expecting Ollie?
Yes, short for Olivia, Olizia.
Ollie, Liz, she uses both.
Hmm.
And I thought that SHE was going to be a he.
Post-op.
What?
Erm, hey, Emma, why don't you tell him that funny story about when you met Ollie?
Er, that's me.
I don't think Ian has time.
No, no.
I'd be quite interested to hear that story of how you two met.
Yeah, we went to catering college together, that's WHEN we met.
Tell him HOW we met.
When we first met, I was dressed as a clown.
Happy?
It's brilliant.
I love that story.
Yeah.
It's...
It's really funny.
Erm, Toast Office?
Yes, I...
Yeah, you know what?
I stole that off an old mate of mine.
I'll text you his number, Em, you should get him on board.
We need to sort this out now...
You know what?
You should invest.
It's a brilliant idea, but do yourself a favour and get the brains on board.
I'll leave you with this clown.
Em, I thought Olizia was the brains?
She has issues.
Evidently.
Look, to be honest with you, I like the idea, and Maplebury seems like a wonderful area, but really...
Yeah, no, no.
Have another drink, I'm buying...
Wait, wait, wait.
You save your money.
I've a feeling you're going to need it.
I tell you what, I'll give you a call.
Oh, urgh!
Ollie!
'Ollie, it's Emma.
I've got to be quick, I'm using a payphone.
'Where the hell are you?
Oh!
I'm running out of money.'
No, no, no!
It's not my fault!
'You dick, it took a lot for me to set this up, 'so don't you dare leave me here in a phone box that stinks of piss.
It's too important.
Oh, crap!
'
Shit!
'I can't believe you've done this!
I'm making excuses, but Ian's leaving.
This is not acceptable.
'And you owe me for all these calls, you wanker.'
Perfect!
Yes, that's me, I'm the wanker.
Go to the bookies!
I'll miss my meeting, don't worry!
It was only a chance of a lifetime.
This is me.
I'm the white van man.
Brilliant!
Jesus Christ!
I'm sorry.
Where the hell were you?
It wasn't my fault.
It never is.
I've had a nightmare.
Well, that's all you'll get from now on.
How could you do this to me?
I didn't mean to do...
I wake up in a shitty room that used to be mine.
What?
My phone's been cut off.
I think.
It's hard to say cos the reception is shocking.
What network are you on?
They were going to give you money, Ollie.
I got here on time, I had the business plan and for once I was letting you in.
Letting you in and you did this to me.
And my Christian Louboutin's are covered in tramp piss.
Sorry.
Don't laugh at me!
Argh!
And, do you know what?
Hair Of The Dog, shit idea.
It's not a shit idea.
It's brilliant.
You look good.
Thanks.
I got another date.
I told this one I was a brain surgeon.
Brain surgeons wear suits, right?
Anyway, as your lawyer, I feel I should remind you that was just one investor.
There are loads more and someone will give you the cash.
Just do it for yourself.
It's your idea, the Toast Office.
That's a good business investment.
Thanks, Dad.
But then so's Curry's Home Maintenance.
I'm just saying.
Oh, cheers, mate, thank you.
Doesn't he want paying?
Nah.
They've been on the house all night, mate.
I told the landlord I'd look at some legal documents.
I'm a lawyer, don't you know.
See, that's all day I've got that.
There's no wonder I retired, is there?
Darren, have you had a look in the mirror?
Serious.
Jealous?
!
Previously on Damages...
HEWES:
I saw your client on Charlie Rose.
His English is better than his French.
Mr. Coupet, did you personally oversee the development of a vaccine called Tranzec?
COUPET:
We conduct clinical trials for every drug we develop.
HEWES:
Did you ever have occasion to hear the term, "adverse event"?
SHAW:
A wrongful death suit was filed against you and High Star in federal court.
The plaintiff's attorney is Ellen Parsons.
The brief lists a single witness, Christopher Sanchez.
PARSONS:
Mr. Sanchez came forward as a witness.
He claimed that High Star was involved in illegal activity that led to the deaths of three men.
ERICKSON:
I never liked that last mission.
CARTER:
Lawsuit's been filed.
The company cannot have you talking.
PARSONS:
Mr. Sanchez, in previous conversations, do you recall stating that you were involved in an illegal operation?
I don't ever recall saying that.
What are you doing?
I told them what you wanted!
(door slams)
PARSONS:
They got him to lie.
I think they were going after somebody over there.

(static hissing)
ERICKSON (over TV):
Praise God... and good evening.
It fills my heart with joy to be here with you tonight.
This week my six-year-old son made a Christmas card for me.
It said, "Peace on Earth, good will to all men."
Peace on Earth.
(elevator bell dings)
PARSONS:
Chris?
I didn't know you were home.
How are you?
SANCHEZ:
I'm good.
PARSONS:
What are you doing here?
SANCHEZ:
I had to come back.
PARSONS:
Why?
SANCHEZ (softly):
You know why.
(phone ringing)
(sighs)
PARSONS:
Hey!
EVERETT:
I missed you last night.
PARSONS:
Oh.
I got hung up at work.
Sorry.
EVERETT:
You spent the night at your desk, didn't you?
PARSONS:
Where are you?
Let's, uh, have lunch later.
EVERETT:
I'm on my way to the airport.
PARSONS:
Right.
Of course.
Have a good time at your folks.
Wish them "Merry Christmas" for me.
Travel safe.
EVERETT:
Merry Christmas, Ellen.
PARSONS:
Merry Christmas.
BOORMAN:
Ho-ho-ho.
(man chanting prayers in Pashto)
GIROTTO:
This is bullshit, Patty.
You have no respect for my client.
You know, if you insist on additional days to depose
Mr. Coupet, you have to do it in a timely manner.
HEWES:
I'm not gonna depose him until I'm fully prepared.
GIROTTO:
Fine.
I'm gonna get the judge to compel you.
HEWES:
Good.
Give it your best shot.
I'm sure the judge will understand that it takes a a little time to read ten-years worth of clinical trials.
GIROTTO:
You've had time.
HEWES:
A month, Jim.
Springtime in Paris is not so bad.
PARSONS:
It looks like that went well.
I don't want you to have to jeopardize your other case by helping me.
HEWES:
Don't worry about it.
It's good to let them stew.
What's wrong?
PARSONS:
It's Chris.
I don't know if he's safe.
I don't even know if he's alive.
HEWES:
Are you getting emotionally involved?
PARSONS:
No.
No.
HEWES:
Don't.
It'll affect your judgment.
You'll make mistakes.
(elevator bell dings)
NASIM MARWAT:
I'm here to see Ellen Parsons.
And your name is, sir?
MARWAT:
Christopher Sanchez.
You can wait in here.
MARWAT:
Thank you.
And there's coffee and tea right out there.
Help yourself.
HEWES:
Ellen...
I want you to seriously reconsider pursuing this case.
PARSONS:
I appreciate you concern, Patty, I do, but it's fine.
MAGGIE:
Ms. Parsons.
PARSONS:
Yes?
MAGGIE:
There's a Mr. Sanchez waiting for you in conference room two.
MARWAT:
Ms. Parsons?
PARSONS:
Who are you?
MARWAT:
My name is Nasim Marwat.
That is for you.
PARSONS:
Did you tell reception you were Chris Sanchez?
MARWAT:
Only so I could see you.
PARSONS:
Call security, please.
MARWAT:
No, no, please.
Chris Sanchez sent me.
I'm his friend.
You see?
This is from Chris.
ERICKSON:
She's a real pretty lady, this church.
The restoration's picture- perfect.
YATES:
Well, that was only possible because of you.
We're all grateful.
ERICKSON:
There's no need to thank me.
I'm happy to do it.
YATES:
So what's on your you mind?
ERICKSON:
I've been struggling with Christmas Eve.
YATES:
You're having second thoughts about giving the guest sermon?
ERICKSON:
No, no.
I'm-I'm honored to do that.
I just want to be sure I have something worthwhile to talk about.
YATES:
Of course.
ERICKSON:
When Mary Alice was alive, she was my ears for this sort of thing.
I'm kinda lost without her.
I must've filled a dozen wastebaskets with-with crumpled paper. (Chuckles)
YATES:
It happens to all of us.
ERICKSON:
I've been reading my Bible, studying my favorite passages.
I don't just want to talk about what matters to me.
I want to speak to the whole congregation.
YATES:
Howard, that's my job.
You're a unique man with a unique perspective.
That's why I asked you to speak.
The congregation can be enlightened by your point of view.
ERICKSON:
I don't know about that.
YATES:
Trust that God can lead you down the right path.
And remember that the faithful heart never errs.
PARSONS:
Where did you get this?
MARWAT:
Chris gave it to my father so that I could bring it to you.
PARSONS:
And how do you know Chris?
MARWAT:
I helped him with his work-
- The missions.
I would scout the region, I talk to the people, I translate, I gather information.
HEWES:
Mr. Marwat, are you employed by High Star?
MARWAT:
No.
I only do this for Chris.
My family and Chris, we have the same enemy.
You see, my father, he was educated in the West.
We love our country, but the Taliban, they destroy it.
PARSONS:
On Chris's last mission, three of his men were killed.
MARWAT:
Yes, that is true.
PARSONS:
Do you know the purpose of that mission?
MARWAT:
They go to a village, and then they take someone away.
PARSONS:
Who did they take?
MARWAT:
An Afghan.
And that's all I know.
HEWES:
And why did they take him?
MARWAT:
Every mission they take someone away.
Dangerous men who have knowledge.
What did Chris's unit do with these men?
MARWAT:
Interrogate them.
They asked them questions to find out what they knew.
Chris explained this to my father.
And now my father is dead.
That company is responsible for murdering my father.
PARSONS:
I'm so sorry, Mr. Marwat.
Do you know where Chris is now?
MARWAT:
Um, no.
I looked, but he is nowhere.
HEWES:
Did anyone else know that you were assisting Mr. Sanchez?
MARWAT:
No, no one.
PARSONS:
Chris's unit that you were referring to, was it... these men?
MARWAT:
Yes.
But, um, on the final mission, there was another--
An American that I've never seen before.
I'm sorry I do not have more information.
I've only seen him once, and he never saw me.
PARSONS:
So they were interrogating terror suspects.
HEWES:
Sounds like it.
Unfortunately, Marwat is worthless as a witness.
PARSONS:
I know.
It's all hearsay unless we can find some other way to confirm his story.
If High Star was running some sort of terrorist extraction program, they couldn't have done it alone.
Someone in the government would have had to have known about it.
(phone buzzing)
PARSONS:
Sorry.
It's my mom.
I was supposed to meet her to do some Christmas shopping.
HEWES:
Go ahead, talk to her.
I'm going to go out.
I think I know someone who might be able to help us.
PARSONS:
I'll come with you.
HEWES:
No, no.
That'd be a little tricky.
Check in with me later.
PARSONS:
Hey, Mom.
Are you there?
DENISE:
Where are you?
Are you okay?
PARSONS:
I'm fine.
I was going to call you.
I got stuck in a meeting.
DENISE:
Are you going to come shopping?
PARSONS:
I don't think I can.
DENISE:
I'm looking at these bracelets again.
They're all so pretty.
I can't decide which one Aunt Laurie would like.
I need your eye, Ellie.
PARSONS:
I'm sorry, Mom, I just-
- I don't think I'm going to make it today.
DENISE:
That's okay, sweetheart.
I know your work's important.
PARSONS:
Listen, we'll pick something out for Laurie tomorrow, okay?
A potential witness has just shown up out of nowhere.
DENISE:
Ooh, exciting.
Who is it?
PARSONS:
Mom, you know I can't talk about it.
DENISE:
You always keep the juicy details from me.
PARSONS:
An Afghani man.
But that's all I can say.
DENISE:
Well, good luck.
I'll take a rain check for tomorrow.
PARSONS:
Bye, Mom.
ERICKSON:
That's impossible.
BOORMAN:
Who else at High Star knew about the program?
ERICKSON:
Carter and Sanchez.
You knew that.
BOORMAN:
I know that's what you told me.
ERICKSON:
I've withheld nothing from you.
BOORMAN:
Well, somehow there's a new witness in town.
ERICKSON:
We got to find out who this guy is.
I'm supposed to be meeting with the Defense Department next week.
There's $60 million in contracts on the line here.
BOORMAN:
Any chance Chris Sanchez had something to do with this?
ERICKSON:
Carter has Sanchez locked down.
BOORMAN:
Sanchez could have sent someone back here.
ERICKSON:
Maybe.
BOORMAN:
Shouldn't be too tough to find out.
You know how to get answers.
ERICKSON:
Sanchez is an American citizen.
BOORMAN:
There are no rules.
We need information.
Who the fuck cares how we get it?
ERICKSON:
I'm not going to do that to one of my own men.
I'm not going to give that order.
BOORMAN:
You either believe in what we're doing or you don't, Howard.
I'm going to go check with my sources.
HERNDON:
Hey, next one's on me, Blondie.
What's your poison?
HEWES:
It's 11:00 a.m.
HERNDON:
Oh, I know, I know.
I could have been here earlier, except I couldn't find my socks.
(chuckles)
Which reminds me of a story about the chimp with the clap.
HEWES:
No one wants to hear it, Bill.
HERNDON:
Holy shit.
Patty Hewes.
HEWES:
Your landlord gave me a couple of suggestions of where you might be drowning yourself, so, uh...
I came by for a little conversation.
HERNDON:
What conversation?
About what?
HEWES:
About something near and dear to your heart.
HERNDON:
That's not possible.
HEWES:
What about extraordinary rendition?
I assume that in between drinks, you've been following Howard Erickson and High Star.
HERNDON:
What about them?
HEWES:
I've been hearing rumors that Erickson may be running his own in-house operation.
Seizing and interrogating terror suspects.
HERNDON:
Mm...
Erickson would be insane to go that far off the reservation.
High Star's not sanctioned for intelligence operations.
He'd lose his company, that ever got out.
HEWES:
Yeah, but what if Erickson was being protected?
HERNDON:
The schmuck had better be if he's going to run a program like that.
So, what are we saying here?
You got your sights set on taking down High Star?
HEWES:
No.
Not me.
One of my associates-- Ellen Parsons.
HERNDON:
Never heard of her.
HEWES:
Well, if she wanted confirmation that High Star was running a program like that, how would she get it?
HERNDON:
Patty, nobody's taken my calls for the last 15 years.
Including you.
How the fuck do I know how she'd get it?
HEWES:
You know, I'm sure you still have a few drinking buddies lurking in the shadows of D.C.
You owe me, Bill.
Buy yourself a couple of rounds.
Think about it.
GUL:
Boormanjahn.
What can I do for you?
BOORMAN:
How are your ties in the Afghan community?
GUL:
I have some eyes and ears.
BOORMAN:
How's your Pashto?
GUL:
A little rusty.
What have you got?
BOORMAN:
Someone has just arrived from Afghanistan.
He's dangerous.
I need you to find him before he does any damage.
GUL:
Some details would be helpful.
BOORMAN:
I'm guessing he's from the Kunar Province, or at least he spent time just south of the Hindu Kush.
As for his tribe, I'd say Kom Nuristani.
Start there.
That's all I got.
(speaks foreign language)
GUL:
Excellent.
I-I will be happy to look for the next year.
BOORMAN:
You don't find him, I'll be happy to revoke your immigration status.
GUL:
Boormanjahn, there's no need to talk like this.
I will search.
BOORMAN:
Your Uncle Sam thanks you for your vigilance.

I did not come to bring peace, but a sword."
(phone ringing)
A.C.
CARTER:
Sir, base camp said you were trying to get in touch with me.
ERICKSON:
We got ourselves a situation here.
An individual arrived from Afghanistan.
He's in New York talking to lawyers.
Any idea who this could be?
CARTER:
No, sir.
ERICKSON:
Is it possible Sanchez sent someone stateside?
CARTER:
He spoke to that contact of his.
ERICKSON:
Find out what they talked about.
See if Sanchez set anything in motion.
CARTER:
Yes, sir.
ERICKSON:
A.C., this is important.
Top priority, understand?
CARTER:
Sir, just to clarify, you're asking me to talk to him.
Sir?
ERICKSON:
Yes, just talk to him.
See if he'll listen to reason.
(sighs)
"Join with me in suffering like a good soldier of Christ...
Jesus."
"Join with me in suffering..."
(smooching)
PARSONS:
You miss Chris, don't you, girl?
Let's get this back on you.
Come here.
(smooching) Come here.
MARWAT:
Your food, it tastes like home.
I have visited.
It's very beautiful.
Please come back.
You're welcome anytime.
(speaks Pashto)
MARWAT:
You are sure you're not hungry?
PARSONS:
I'm fine, thank you.
I, uh, I was hoping you could help me with something.
Have you ever seen these initials before?
MARWAT:
Certainly.
This is the Double Dees.
PARSONS:
- The Double Dees?
MARWAT:
- Chris and his men, they call themselves this.
PARSONS:
What does it mean?
MARWAT:
I do not know.
PARSONS:
I really appreciate you coming all this way, Mr. Marwat.
MARWAT:
You should thank Chris.
He told my father to send me here.
PARSONS:
The last time I saw Chris, he, uh, he was going through a very difficult time.
Did your father say anything about his state of mind?
MARWAT:
When, um, when Chris came to visit my father, he, he wished to apologize.
PARSONS:
For what?
MARWAT:
For the company, for the work, for the taking of the men who do not return.
PARSONS:
Do you believe that High Star tortured the men that they took?
MARWAT:
Chris, he did not speak to me of this.
But you know, sometimes it happens that they take the wrong men.
The men who are innocent.
Chris, he, uh, he explained this regret to my father.
I see Chris means a lot to you.
To me also.
I will do whatever I can to help him.
PARSONS:
Thank you.
SANCHEZ:
I'm telling you, man, I don't know what you're talking about.
CARTER:
Then why did you want to meet with Zafar Marwat alone?
SANCHEZ:
He's my own personal contact; he's a friend!
CARTER:
Your friend?
SANCHEZ:
Yeah!
CARTER:
Your friends are my friends.
Aren't we all on the same side?
SANCHEZ:
Marwat-
- He's plugged into tribal politics.
If he knows something about Nur Taraki, I just wanted to make him feel comfortable with telling me, so I went alone, okay?
CARTER:
Sorry, man, I just don't buy it.
(Sanchez sighs)
Did you have the old man pass on a message about the Double Dees for you?
SANCHEZ:
- No!
CARTER:
- You understand why I can't trust you, right, Chris?
No, you started this thing.
You sidestepped company channels and you talked to a lawyer.
What you did may directly jeopardize High Star's ability to protect our country.
SANCHEZ:
Protect our country?
CARTER:
Yes.
SANCHEZ:
Protect our country.
You really think that's what we were doing?
CARTER:
- Absolutely.
SANCHEZ:
- Uh-uh.
No, it's not so simple, A.C.
CARTER:
Chris...
(Carter sighs)
Come on, man.
Don't make this any harder than it has to be.
Now, you sent someone to New York with information.
Give me a name.
SANCHEZ:
Or what?
What are you gonna do to me?
(men speaking Pashto)
GUL:
Thanks for the call.
A man has come in several times.
He says he's recently arrived from Laghman.
GUL:
What's he look like?
See for yourself.
HERNDON:
My God, how much money you spend on this place?
I mean, it's nice.
A little antiseptic, could use a bit more flash. (Chuckles)
But you did good.
HEWES:
I'm glad you approve.
HERNDON:
Can I get some of this bourbon?
HEWES:
No.
(knocking)
PARSONS:
You wanted to see me?
HEWES:
Yes.
Ellen Parsons, William Herndon.
HERNDON:
- Wow.
HEWES:
- Don't.
HERNDON:
Relax, I learned my lesson.
We behave in the workplace now, don't we?
Pleasure.
PARSONS:
Likewise.
HEWES:
Mr. Herndon can make some inquires about High Star on your behalf.
HERNDON:
Let me brass tack it for you.
If I can get someone to talk... you're going to have a hell of a bull's-eye on your back.
PARSONS:
I understand.
HERNDON:
Bullshit.
Bullshit you understand.
You fuck this up, and your career will be flushed down the shitter faster than you can say,
"The American people have a right to know."
PARSONS:
I get it.
HERNDON:
You've got a life ahead of you, huh?
So you make damn sure this is what you want before I go any further.
HEWES:
It's your call, Ellen.
We don't have to go through with this.
PARSONS:
If this is the only way to confirm Mr. Marwat's story, then... please, get all the facts that you can.
I'll handle the consequences.
(doors slide open)
(man reciting prayer in Arabic)
(prayer continues)
PARSONS:
Who the hell was that?
HEWES:
My first job out of law school was at a firm where Bill was a junior partner.
PARSONS:
How come I have never heard of him?
HEWES:
Because about ten years ago he made a decision that cost him his practice.
He was disbarred.
Now he...
He drinks.
PARSONS:
Why do we want him involved in this case?
HEWES:
Because he's the only person I know who could possibly get us the information that we need.
PARSONS:
Can we trust him?
HEWES:
I certainly hope so.
(car approaching)
OWEN:
Get in the car.
BOORMAN:
The agency's got a tail on me now?
OWEN:
What are you doing hanging around a mosque?
BOORMAN:
My job-- Following up on a tip.
And you just screwed it up for me.
OWEN:
File your goddamn reports, I won't have to shanghai you on the street.
BOORMAN:
You know I always take off for holidays.
OWEN:
So what's going on with this wrongful death suit against High Star?
BOORMAN:
It's got nothing to do with us.
A couple of High Star contractors were K.I.A.
Now some ambulance chasers are going after the company.
OWEN:
So the case isn't related to Double Dee?
BOORMAN:
Of course not.
The program was already over.
The brass went and yanked the plug on it.
So, now the war's entering its second decade, and all you geniuses are getting promoted.
OWEN:
Boorman, I don't know whose dick you greased to get this far, but if I find out that you're lying to me, you're withholding intel, you're so much as farting without filing a report, you are done.
You'll never be heard from again.
Is that clear?
BOORMAN:
No, can you repeat it?
OWEN:
Get the fuck out of my car.
ERICKSON:
Praise God.
And good evening.
It fills my heart with joy being with your...
(clearing throat) being here with you tonight.
I'd like to express my gratitude to Pastor Yates for giving me this opportunity.
(phone ringing)
Fuck.
Yeah.
BOORMAN:
I saw the son of a bitch, but I lost him.
ERICKSON:
Who is he?
BOORMAN:
I don't know his name-
- Just what he looks like.
You get anything from Sanchez?
ERICKSON:
Nothing we can use.
BOORMAN:
What the fuck are you doing, Howard?
A man is running around this goddamn city talking to lawyers.
Push harder.
ERICKSON:
Calm yourself, Jerry.
BOORMAN:
Stop being sentimental about Sanchez.
It's information.
It don't mean a lick of shit who you get it from.
Now, pull your head out of your ass and give the order.
DENISE:
So, Chris Sanchez is involved in your case.
PARSONS:
Which one?
DENISE:
That one, the blue one.
My gosh, that boy broke your heart junior year.
Tore it in two.
PARSONS:
Broke my heart?
That's a little strong, Mom.
It's good.
DENISE:
Your father and I thought you'd never stop crying.
PARSONS:
I don't remember that.
DENISE:
You really think Aunt Laurie would like it?
PARSONS:
Yeah, it's lovely, mom; you should get it.
(Denise murmurs)
HEWES:
Because you've been good.
CATHERINE:
I've been really good.
HEWES:
You have been really good.
How many cookies do you think Santa wants?
How many-
- You think three?
(phone ringing)
That's a good idea.
Want to put them on his plate?
Hello?
PARSONS:
Any word from Herndon?
HEWES:
No.
Bill hasn't gotten in touch yet.
I think we're just going to have to wait.
PARSONS:
Well, I can't-
- I can't just wait around anymore.
Where can I find him?
(church organ playing "Oh, Come, All Ye Faithful")
(phone line ringing)
CARTER:
Sir.
ERICKSON:
Merry Christmas.
CARTER:
Sorry, sir, still nothing.
ERICKSON:
I'm not diddling around here, Carter.
We need details.
Step it up.
CARTER:
What do you mean?
ERICKSON:
You know what I mean.
CARTER:
- Sir?
ERICKSON:
- National security is on the line here.
It's not a time for hesitation.
We need to know how our security has been breached, and you're the only one who can find out.
I'm giving you an order.
CARTER:
How far do you want me to go?
ERICKSON:
As far as you have to.
(organ plays "Silent Night")
YATES:
Matthew 5:9.
ERICKSON:
I know it's a well-worn passage.
Not very original.
YATES:
Well, there's nothing in the scripture that doesn't warrant further exploration.
ERICKSON:
I want to make sure that you approve of my interpretation.
Did you like the speech?
YATES:
Do you believe in what you wrote?
You have doubts.
ERICKSON:
No.
That's what I believe.
YATES:
Then you need to share it.
PARSONS:
I don't see him.
DENISE:
What does he look like?
PARSONS:
He's in his 70s, kinda rumpled.
DENISE:
Is that him?
PARSONS:
Mr. Herndon?
HERNDON:
Ah, look, it's Nancy Drew.
Let me buy you a drink.
PARSONS:
Uh, no, thanks.
HERNDON:
Cash me out, will you, Stu?
PARSONS:
Mr. Herndon, we haven't heard from you.
Did you find anything on High Star?
HERNDON:
Oh, shit.
This will never cover it.
Hey, do me a favor.
Spot me, will ya, sweetheart?
I'll get you back next time.
PARSONS:
Did you find anything?
HERNDON:
Oh, sorry, I struck out.
PARSONS:
Mr. Herndon...
HERNDON:
Hey, listen,
I gotta go.
It's Christmas eve.
Got a lot of chimneys to hit, you know?
Oh, hey, thanks for picking up the check.
And make sure Stu gets a nice tip.
And-and who are you?
DENISE:
Her mother.
HERNDON:
Yeah.
Why not?
Bye.
ERICKSON:
Praise God.
And good evening.
It fills my heart with joy to be here with you tonight.
This week, my six-year-old son made me a Christmas card in art class.
It said, "Peace on Earth, good will to all men."
Peace on Earth.
SANCHEZ:
You're making a mistake.
CARTER:
Someone...
is talking to that attorney in New York.
I want you to give me a name.
SANCHEZ:
I don't have a name.
I didn't send anyone.
CARTER:
If you didn't, who who did?
You know...
Nothing has to happen to you that you don't want to.
But you know that I'm not gonna stop...
until I get a name.
SANCHEZ:
Fuck you.
CARTER:
I am sorry, brother, 'cause I didn't want it to go this way.
(Sanchez groans)
ERICKSON:
Jesus told us "Blessed be the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God."
But how far are we willing to go for peace?
Surely, it is not enough just to wish for it.
Jesus understood this.
To redeem mankind, he had to suffer, to withstand torture and death in order to wash clean the world.
He teaches us there is no peace without suffering.
No one knows this better than a soldier.
This Christmas, I find myself thinking of the soldiers overseas who make the ultimate sacrifice for peace.
As did Our Savior, they put their lives on the line to fulfill their promise.
They bear their burden with courage and faith because they know that to suffer in war is to honor Jesus' suffering on the cross and carry out God's will.
To those who have taken on this holy cause to protect and defend this great nation,
to my men who have endured pain and hardship to achieve peace,
I tell you your suffering is not in vain.
It is an act of love.
A testament to your faith.
The pain you endure, no matter how unbearable... will bring you closer to God.
(organ playing)
A.C., what's the report?
HERNDON:
He's a tough son of a bitch.
ERICKSON:
Yeah?
What'd you get from him?
CARTER:
The guy's name is Nasim Marwat.
ERICKSON:
All right, nice work, A.C.
(phone ringing)
PARSONS:
Hello?
MARWAT:
It is Nasim.
PARSONS:
Is everything okay?
MARWAT:
No.
I need to see you.
PARSONS:
Okay.
Stay calm, Mr. Marwat.
Where are you?
MARWAT:
Miss Parsons, the other American from Chris' mission, the one I told you about, he is here in New York.
PARSONS:
Are you certain it was the same person?
MARWAT:
I saw him.
He was following me.
I wanted to tell you this before I return to Afghanistan.
PARSONS:
Mr. Marwat, you can't go back yet.
I need to get your testimony.
MARWAT:
I have already lost my father.
My family cannot afford to lose me.
PARSONS:
I understand your concern, but I'm asking you to just give us a little more time.
ERICKSON:
I got a name.
BOORMAN:
Don't matter.
Don't need it anymore.
ERICKSON:
What do you mean, you don't need it?
BOORMAN:
I'm looking at our guy right now.
PARSONS:
Trust me...
Hey, Dad, great speech.
That was, that was really cool.
ERICKSON:
Thank you.
Go round up your brothers.
Yes, sir.
YATES:
That was very moving, Howard.
ERICKSON:
Thank you.
YATES:
What's wrong?
You were inspiring.
It was a beautiful sermon.
Deacon Charles videotaped it.
I'll get you a copy.
(elevator bell dings)
HERNDON:
Santa wants to know if you've been nice, Patty.
Because Howard Erickson has been very, very, very naughty.
HEWES:
You were able to confirm our witness' story?
HERNDON:
Now that...
would be something of an understatement.
High Star was extracting terror suspects for the CIA.
HERNDON:
And I don't have to tell you there's a whole world of people who would prefer to, uh, keep that from going public.
HEWES:
Thank you for your help.
HERNDON:
So what are you gonna do?
I mean, you can't share that with your little, uh, protege.
The girl's in way over her head.
HEWES:
Yeah, she is.
HERNDON:
She can't handle that.
So you keep that for yourself and, uh...
get rid of her.
And remember what I taught you about dead weight.
ERICKSON:
I tell you, your suffering is not in vain.
The pain you endure, no matter how unbearable... will bring you closer to God.

Previously on Damages...
I saw your client on Charlie Rose.
His English is better than his French.
Mr. Coupet, did you personally oversee the development of a vaccine called Tranzec?
We conduct clinical trials for every drug we develop.
Did you ever have occasion to hear the term, "adverse event"?
A wrongful death suit was filed against you and High Star in federal court.
The plaintiff's attorney is Ellen Parsons.
The brief lists a single witness, Christopher Sanchez.
Mr. Sanchez came forward as a witness.
He claimed that High Star was involved in illegal activity that led to the deaths of three men.
I never liked that last mission.
Lawsuit's been filed.
The company cannot have you talking.
Mr. Sanchez, in previous conversations, do you recall stating that you were involved in an illegal operation?
I don't ever recall saying that.
What are you doing?
I told them what you wanted!
They got him to lie.
I think they were going after somebody over there.

Damages - 4x04 "The Next One's On Me, Blondie"
Praise God... and good evening.
It fills my heart with joy to be here with you tonight.
This week my six-year-old son made a Christmas card for me.
It said, "Peace on Earth, good will to all men."
Peace on Earth.
Chris?
I didn't know you were home.
How are you?
I'm good.
What are you doing here?
I had to come back.
Why?
You know why.
Hey!
I missed you last night.
Oh.
I got hung up at work.
Sorry.
You spent the night at your desk, didn't you?
Where are you?
Let's, uh, have lunch later.
I'm on my way to the airport.
Right.
Of course.
Have a good time at your folks.
Wish them "Merry Christmas" for me.
Travel safe.
- Merry Christmas, Ellen.
- Merry Christmas.
Ho-ho-ho.
This is bullshit, Patty.
You have no respect for my client.
You know, if you insist on additional days to depose
Mr. Coupet, you have to do it in a timely manner.
I'm not gonna depose him until I'm fully prepared.
Fine.
I'm gonna get the judge to compel you.
Good.
Give it your best shot.
I'm sure the judge will understand that it takes a a little time to read ten-years worth of clinical trials.
- You've had time.
- A month, Jim.
Springtime in Paris is not so bad.
It looks like that went well.
I don't want you to have to jeopardize your other case by helping me.
Don't worry about it.
It's good to let them stew.
What's wrong?
It's Chris.
I don't know if he's safe.
I don't even know if he's alive.
Are you getting emotionally involved?
No.
No.
Don't.
It'll affect your judgment.
You'll make mistakes.
I'm here to see Ellen Parsons.
And your name is, sir?
Christopher Sanchez.
- You can wait in here.
- Thank you.
And there's coffee and tea right out there.
Help yourself.
Ellen...
I want you to seriously reconsider pursuing this case.
I appreciate you concern, Patty, I do, but it's fine.
- Ms. Parsons.
- Yes?
There's a Mr. Sanchez waiting for you in conference room two.
- Ms. Parsons?
- Who are you?
My name is Nasim Marwat.
That is for you.
Did you tell reception you were Chris Sanchez?
Only so I could see you.
Call security, please.
No, no, please.
Chris Sanchez sent me.
I'm his friend.
You see?
This is from Chris.
She's a real pretty lady, this church.
The restoration's picture- perfect.
Well, that was only possible because of you.
We're all grateful.
There's no need to thank me.
I'm happy to do it.
So what's on your you mind?
I've been struggling with Christmas Eve.
You're having second thoughts about giving the guest sermon?
No, no.
I'm-I'm honored to do that.
I just want to be sure I have something worthwhile to talk about.
Of course.
When Mary Alice was alive, she was my ears for this sort of thing.
I'm kinda lost without her.
I must've filled a dozen wastebaskets with-with crumpled paper.
It happens to all of us.
I've been reading my Bible, studying my favorite passages.
I don't just want to talk about what matters to me.
I want to speak to the whole congregation.
Howard, that's my job.
You're a unique man with a unique perspective.
That's why I asked you to speak.
The congregation can be enlightened by your point of view.
I don't know about that.
Trust that God can lead you down the right path.
And remember that the faithful heart never errs.
Where did you get this?
Chris gave it to my father so that I could bring it to you.
And how do you know Chris?
I helped him with his work-
- The missions.
I would scout the region, I talk to the people, I translate, I gather information.
Mr. Marwat, are you employed by High Star?
No.
I only do this for Chris.
My family and Chris, we have the same enemy.
You see, my father, he was educated in the West.
We love our country, but the Taliban, they destroy it.
On Chris's last mission, three of his men were killed.
- Yes, that is true.
- Do you know the purpose of that mission?
They go to a village, and then they take someone away.
Who did they take?
An Afghan.
And that's all I know.
And why did they take him?
Every mission they take someone away.
Dangerous men who have knowledge.
What did Chris's unit do with these men?
Interrogate them.
They asked them questions to find out what they knew.
Chris explained this to my father.
And now my father is dead.
That company is responsible for murdering my father.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Marwat.
Do you know where Chris is now?
Um, no.
I looked, but he is nowhere.
Did anyone else know that you were assisting Mr. Sanchez?
No, no one.
Chris's unit that you were referring to, was it... these men?
Yes.
But, um, on the final mission, there was another--
An American that I've never seen before.
I'm sorry I do not have more information.
I've only seen him once, and he never saw me.
So they were interrogating terror suspects.
Sounds like it.
Unfortunately, Marwat is worthless as a witness.
I know.
It's all hearsay unless we can find some other way to confirm his story.
If High Star was running some sort of terrorist extraction program, they couldn't have done it alone.
Someone in the government would have had to have known about it.
Sorry.
It's my mom.
I was supposed to meet her to do some Christmas shopping.
Go ahead, talk to her.
I'm going to go out.
I think I know someone who might be able to help us.
- I'll come with you.
- No, no.
That'd be a little tricky.
Check in with me later.
Hey, Mom.
Are you there?
Where are you?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I was going to call you.
I got stuck in a meeting.
Are you going to come shopping?
I don't think I can.
I'm looking at these bracelets again.
They're all so pretty.
I can't decide which one Aunt Laurie would like.
I need your eye, Ellie.
I'm sorry, Mom, I just-
- I don't think I'm going to make it today.
That's okay, sweetheart.
I know your work's important.
Listen, we'll pick something out for Laurie tomorrow, okay?
A potential witness has just shown up out of nowhere.
Ooh, exciting.
Who is it?
Mom, you know I can't talk about it.
You always keep the juicy details from me.
An Afghani man.
But that's all I can say.
Well, good luck.
I'll take a rain check for tomorrow.
Bye, Mom.
That's impossible.
Who else at High Star knew about the program?
Carter and Sanchez.
You knew that.
I know that's what you told me.
I've withheld nothing from you.
Well, somehow there's a new witness in town.
We got to find out who this guy is.
I'm supposed to be meeting with the Defense Department next week.
There's $60 million in contracts on the line here.
Any chance Chris Sanchez had something to do with this?
Carter has Sanchez locked down.
Sanchez could have sent someone back here.
Maybe.
Shouldn't be too tough to find out.
You know how to get answers.
Sanchez is an American citizen.
There are no rules.
We need information.
Who the fuck cares how we get it?
I'm not going to do that to one of my own men.
I'm not going to give that order.
You either believe in what we're doing or you don't, Howard.
I'm going to go check with my sources.
Hey, next one's on me, Blondie.
What's your poison?
It's 11:00 a.m.
Oh, I know, I know.
I could have been here earlier, except I couldn't find my socks.
Which reminds me of a story about the chimp with the clap.
No one wants to hear it, Bill.
Holy shit.
Patty Hewes.
Your landlord gave me a couple of suggestions of where you might be drowning yourself, so, uh...
I came by for a little conversation.
What conversation?
About what?
About something near and dear to your heart.
That's not possible.
What about extraordinary rendition?
I assume that in between drinks, you've been following Howard Erickson and High Star.
What about them?
I've been hearing rumors that Erickson may be running his own in-house operation.
Seizing and interrogating terror suspects.
Mm...
Erickson would be insane to go that far off the reservation.
High Star's not sanctioned for intelligence operations.
He'd lose his company, that ever got out.
Yeah, but what if Erickson was being protected?
The schmuck had better be if he's going to run a program like that.
So, what are we saying here?
You got your sights set on taking down High Star?
No.
Not me.
One of my associates-- Ellen Parsons.
Never heard of her.
Well, if she wanted confirmation that High Star was running a program like that, how would she get it?
Patty, nobody's taken my calls for the last 15 years.
Including you.
How the fuck do I know how she'd get it?
You know, I'm sure you still have a few drinking buddies lurking in the shadows of D.C.
You owe me, Bill.
Buy yourself a couple of rounds.
Think about it.
Boormanjahn.
What can I do for you?
How are your ties in the Afghan community?
I have some eyes and ears.
- How's your Pashto?
- A little rusty.
What have you got?
Someone has just arrived from Afghanistan.
He's dangerous.
I need you to find him before he does any damage.
Some details would be helpful.
I'm guessing he's from the Kunar Province, or at least he spent time just south of the Hindu Kush.
As for his tribe, I'd say Kom Nuristani.
Start there.
That's all I got.
Excellent.
I-I will be happy to look for the next year.
You don't find him, I'll be happy to revoke your immigration status.
Boormanjahn, there's no need to talk like this.
I will search.
Your Uncle Sam thanks you for your vigilance.

Sir, base camp said you were trying to get in touch with me.
We got ourselves a situation here.
An individual arrived from Afghanistan.
He's in New York talking to lawyers.
Any idea who this could be?
No, sir.
Is it possible Sanchez sent someone stateside?
He spoke to that contact of his.
Find out what they talked about.
See if Sanchez set anything in motion.
Yes, sir.
A.C., this is important.
Top priority, understand?
Sir, just to clarify, you're asking me to talk to him.
Sir?
Yes, just talk to him.
See if he'll listen to reason.
"Join with me in suffering like a good soldier of Christ...
Jesus."
"Join with me in suffering..."
You miss Chris, don't you, girl?
Let's get this back on you.
Come here.
Come here.
Your food, it tastes like home.
I have visited.
It's very beautiful.
Please come back.
You're welcome anytime.
You are sure you're not hungry?
I'm fine, thank you.
I, uh, I was hoping you could help me with something.
Have you ever seen these initials before?
Certainly.
This is the Double Dees.
-
- The Double Dees?
- Chris and his men, they call themselves this.
- What does it mean?
- I do not know.
I really appreciate you coming all this way, Mr. Marwat.
You should thank Chris.
He told my father to send me here.
The last time I saw Chris, he, uh, he was going through a very difficult time.
Did your father say anything about his state of mind?
When, um, when Chris came to visit my father, he, he wished to apologize.
For what?
For the company, for the work, for the taking of the men who do not return.
Do you believe that High Star tortured the men that they took?
Chris, he did not speak to me of this.
But you know, sometimes it happens that they take the wrong men.
The men who are innocent.
Chris, he, uh, he explained this regret to my father.
I see Chris means a lot to you.
To me also.
I will do whatever I can to help him.
Thank you.
I'm telling you, man, I don't know what you're talking about.
Then why did you want to meet with Zafar Marwat alone?
He's my own personal contact; he's a friend!
- Your friend?
- Yeah!
Your friends are my friends.
Aren't we all on the same side?
Marwat-
- He's plugged into tribal politics.
If he knows something about Nur Taraki, I just wanted to make him feel comfortable with telling me, so I went alone, okay?
Sorry, man, I just don't buy it.
Did you have the old man pass on a message about the Double Dees for you?
- No!
- You understand why I can't trust you, right, Chris?
No, you started this thing.
You sidestepped company channels and you talked to a lawyer.
What you did may directly jeopardize High Star's ability to protect our country.
- Protect our country?
- Yes.
Protect our country.
You really think that's what we were doing?
- Absolutely.
- Uh-uh.
No, it's not so simple, A.C.
Chris...
Come on, man.
Don't make this any harder than it has to be.
Now, you sent someone to New York with information.
- Give me a name.
- Or what?
What are you gonna do to me?
Thanks for the call.
A man has come in several times.
He says he's recently arrived from Laghman.
What's he look like?
See for yourself.
My God, how much money you spend on this place?
I mean, it's nice.
A little antiseptic, could use a bit more flash.
But you did good.
I'm glad you approve.
- Can I get some of this bourbon?
- No.
You wanted to see me?
Yes.
Ellen Parsons, William Herndon.
- Wow.
- Don't.
Relax, I learned my lesson.
We behave in the workplace now, don't we?
- Pleasure.
- Likewise.
Mr. Herndon can make some inquires about High Star on your behalf.
Let me brass tack it for you.
If I can get someone to talk... you're going to have a hell of a bull's-eye on your back.
I understand.
Bullshit.
Bullshit you understand.
You fuck this up, and your career will be flushed down the shitter faster than you can say,
"The American people have a right to know."
I get it.
You've got a life ahead of you, huh?
So you make damn sure this is what you want before I go any further.
It's your call, Ellen.
We don't have to go through with this.
If this is the only way to confirm Mr. Marwat's story, then... please, get all the facts that you can.
I'll handle the consequences.
Who the hell was that?
My first job out of law school was at a firm where Bill was a junior partner.
How come I have never heard of him?
Because about ten years ago he made a decision that cost him his practice.
He was disbarred.
Now he...
He drinks.
Why do we want him involved in this case?
Because he's the only person I know who could possibly get us the information that we need.
- Can we trust him?
- I certainly hope so.
Get in the car.
The agency's got a tail on me now?
What are you doing hanging around a mosque?
My job-- Following up on a tip.
And you just screwed it up for me.
File your goddamn reports, I won't have to shanghai you on the street.
You know I always take off for holidays.
So what's going on with this wrongful death suit against High Star?
It's got nothing to do with us.
A couple of High Star contractors were K.I.A.
Now some ambulance chasers are going after the company.
So the case isn't related to Double Dee?
Of course not.
The program was already over.
The brass went and yanked the plug on it.
So, now the war's entering its second decade, and all you geniuses are getting promoted.
Boorman, I don't know whose dick you greased to get this far, but if I find out that you're lying to me, you're withholding intel, you're so much as farting without filing a report, you are done.
You'll never be heard from again.
Is that clear?
No, can you repeat it?
Get the fuck out of my car.
Praise God.
And good evening.
It fills my heart with joy being with your... being here with you tonight.
I'd like to express my gratitude to Pastor Yates for giving me this opportunity.
Fuck.
Yeah.
I saw the son of a bitch, but I lost him.
Who is he?
I don't know his name-
- Just what he looks like.
You get anything from Sanchez?
Nothing we can use.
What the fuck are you doing, Howard?
A man is running around this goddamn city talking to lawyers.
Push harder.
Calm yourself, Jerry.
Stop being sentimental about Sanchez.
It's information.
It don't mean a lick of shit who you get it from.
Now, pull your head out of your ass and give the order.
So, Chris Sanchez is involved in your case.
- Which one?
- That one, the blue one.
My gosh, that boy broke your heart junior year.
Tore it in two.
Broke my heart?
That's a little strong, Mom.
It's good.
Your father and I thought you'd never stop crying.
I don't remember that.
You really think Aunt Laurie would like it?
Yeah, it's lovely, mom; you should get it.
Because you've been good.
I've been really good.
You have been really good.
How many cookies do you think Santa wants?
How many-
- You think three?
That's a good idea.
Want to put them on his plate?
Hello?
Any word from Herndon?
No.
Bill hasn't gotten in touch yet.
I think we're just going to have to wait.
Well, I can't-
- I can't just wait around anymore.
Where can I find him?
- Sir.
- Merry Christmas.
Sorry, sir, still nothing.
I'm not diddling around here, Carter.
We need details.
Step it up.
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
- Sir?
- National security is on the line here.
It's not a time for hesitation.
We need to know how our security has been breached, and you're the only one who can find out.
I'm giving you an order.
How far do you want me to go?
As far as you have to.
Matthew 5:9.
I know it's a well-worn passage.
Not very original.
Well, there's nothing in the scripture that doesn't warrant further exploration.
I want to make sure that you approve of my interpretation.
Did you like the speech?
Do you believe in what you wrote?
You have doubts.
No.
That's what I believe.
Then you need to share it.
- I don't see him.
- What does he look like?
He's in his 70s, kinda rumpled.
Is that him?
- Mr. Herndon?
- Ah, look, it's Nancy Drew.
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Uh, no, thanks.
Cash me out, will you, Stu?
Mr. Herndon, we haven't heard from you.
Did you find anything on High Star?
Oh, shit.
This will never cover it.
Hey, do me a favor.
Spot me, will ya, sweetheart?
I'll get you back next time.
Did you find anything?
Oh, sorry, I struck out.
- Mr. Herndon...
- Hey, listen,
I gotta go.
It's Christmas eve.
Got a lot of chimneys to hit, you know?
Oh, hey, thanks for picking up the check.
And make sure Stu gets a nice tip.
- And-and who are you?
- Her mother.
Yeah.
Why not?
Bye.
Praise God.
And good evening.
It fills my heart with joy to be here with you tonight.
This week, my six-year-old son made me a Christmas card in art class.
It said, "Peace on Earth, good will to all men."
Peace on Earth.
You're making a mistake.
Someone...
is talking to that attorney in New York.
I want you to give me a name.
I don't have a name.
I didn't send anyone.
If you didn't, who who did?
You know...
Nothing has to happen to you that you don't want to.
But you know that I'm not gonna stop...
until I get a name.
Fuck you.
I am sorry, brother, 'cause I didn't want it to go this way.
Jesus told us "Blessed be the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God."
But how far are we willing to go for peace?
Surely, it is not enough just to wish for it.
Jesus understood this.
To redeem mankind, he had to suffer, to withstand torture and death in order to wash clean the world.
He teaches us there is no peace without suffering.
No one knows this better than a soldier.
This Christmas, I find myself thinking of the soldiers overseas who make the ultimate sacrifice for peace.
As did Our Savior, they put their lives on the line to fulfill their promise.
They bear their burden with courage and faith because they know that to suffer in war is to honor Jesus' suffering on the cross and carry out God's will.
To those who have taken on this holy cause to protect and defend this great nation,
to my men who have endured pain and hardship to achieve peace,
I tell you your suffering is not in vain.
It is an act of love.
A testament to your faith.
The pain you endure, no matter how unbearable... will bring you closer to God.
A.C., what's the report?
He's a tough son of a bitch.
Yeah?
What'd you get from him?
The guy's name is Nasim Marwat.
All right, nice work, A.C.
- Hello?
- It is Nasim.
- Is everything okay?
- No.
I need to see you.
Okay.
Stay calm, Mr. Marwat.
Where are you?
Miss Parsons, the other American from Chris' mission, the one I told you about, he is here in New York.
Are you certain it was the same person?
I saw him.
He was following me.
I wanted to tell you this before I return to Afghanistan.
Mr. Marwat, you can't go back yet.
I need to get your testimony.
I have already lost my father.
My family cannot afford to lose me.
I understand your concern, but I'm asking you to just give us a little more time.
I got a name.
Don't matter.
Don't need it anymore.
What do you mean, you don't need it?
I'm looking at our guy right now.
Trust me...
Hey, Dad, great speech.
That was, that was really cool.
Thank you.
Go round up your brothers.
Yes, sir.
That was very moving, Howard.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
You were inspiring.
It was a beautiful sermon.
Deacon Charles videotaped it.
I'll get you a copy.
Santa wants to know if you've been nice, Patty.
Because Howard Erickson has been very, very, very naughty.
You were able to confirm our witness' story?
Now that...
would be something of an understatement.
High Star was extracting terror suspects for the CIA.
And I don't have to tell you there's a whole world of people who would prefer to, uh, keep that from going public.
Thank you for your help.
So what are you gonna do?
I mean, you can't share that with your little, uh, protege.
The girl's in way over her head.
Yeah, she is.
She can't handle that.
So you keep that for yourself and, uh...
get rid of her.
And remember what I taught you about dead weight.
I tell you, your suffering is not in vain.
The pain you endure, no matter how unbearable... will bring you closer to God.

Previously on Damages...
I saw your client on Charlie Rose.
His English is better than his French.
Mr Coupet, did you personally oversee the development of a vaccine called Tranzec?
We conduct clinical trials for every drug we develop.
Did you ever have occasion to hear the term "adverse event"?
A wrongful death suit was filed against you and High Star in federal court.
The plaintiff's attorney is Ellen Parsons.
The brief lists a single witness, Christopher Sanchez.
Mr Sanchez came forward as a witness.
He claimed that High Star was involved in illegal activity that led to the deaths of three men.
I never liked that last mission.
Lawsuit's been filed.
The company cannot have you talking.
Mr Sanchez, in previous conversations, do you recall stating that you were involved in an illegal operation?
I don't ever recall saying that.
What are you doing?
I told them what you wanted!
They got him to lie.
I think they were going after somebody over there.

It fills my heart with joy to be here with you tonight.
This week, my six-year-old son made a Christmas card for me.
It said, "Peace on Earth, good will to all men".
Peace on Earth.
Chris?
I didn't know you were home.
How are you?
I'm good.
What are you doing here?
- I had to come back.
- Why?
You know why.
- Hey!
- I missed you last night.
I got hung up at work.
Sorry.
You spent the night at your desk, didn't you?
Where are you?
Let's have lunch later.
I'm on my way to the airport.
Right.
Of course.
Have a good time at your folks.
Wish them Merry Christmas for me.
Travel safe.
- Merry Christmas, Ellen.
- Merry Christmas.
This is bullshit, Patty.
You have no respect for my client.
You know, if you insist on additional days to depose Mr Coupet, you have to do it in a timely manner.
I'm not going to depose him until I'm fully prepared.
Fine.
I'm going to get the judge to compel you.
Good.
Give it your best shot.
I'm sure the judge will understand that it takes a little time to read 10 years worth of clinical trials.
- You've had time.
- A month, Jim.
Springtime in Paris is not so bad.
It looks like that went well.
I don't want you to have to jeopardise your other case by helping me.
Don't worry about it.
It's good to let them stew.
What's wrong?
It's Chris.
I don't know if he's safe.
I don't even know if he's alive.
Are you getting emotionally involved?
No.
No.
Don't.
It'll affect your judgement.
You'll make mistakes.
I'm here to see Ellen Parsons.
- And your name is, sir?
- Christopher Sanchez.
- You can wait in here.
- Thank you.
And there's coffee and tea right out there.
Help yourself.
Ellen.
I want you to seriously reconsider pursuing this case.
I appreciate your concern, Patty, I do, but it's fine.
- Ms Parsons.
- Yes?
There's a Mr Sanchez waiting for you in conference room two.
- Ms Parsons?
- Who are you?
My name is Nasim Marwat.
That is for you.
Did you tell reception you were Chris Sanchez?
Only so I could see you.
- Call security, please.
- No, no, please.
Chris Sanchez sent me.
I'm his friend.
You see?
This is from Chris.
She's a real pretty lady, this church.
The restoration's picture perfect.
Well, that was only possible because of you.
We're all grateful.
There's no need to thank me.
I'm happy to do it.
So what's on your mind?
I've been struggling with Christmas Eve.
You're having second thoughts about giving the guest sermon?
No, no.
I'm honoured to do that.
I just want to be sure I have something worthwhile to talk about.
Of course.
When Mary-Alice was alive, she was my ears for this sort of thing.
I'm kind of lost without her.
I must've filled a dozen wastebaskets with crumpled paper.
It happens to all of us.
I've been reading my Bible, studying my favourite passages.
I don't just want to talk about what matters to me.
I want to speak to the whole congregation.
Howard, that's my job.
You're a unique man with a unique perspective.
It's why I asked you to speak.
The congregation can be enlightened by your point of view.
I don't know about that.
Trust that God can lead you down the right path.
And remember that the faithful heart never errs.
Where did you get this?
Chris gave it to my father so that I could bring it to you.
And how do you know Chris?
I helped him with his work, the missions.
I will scout the region, I talk to the people, I translate, I gather information.
Mr Marwat, are you employed by High Star?
No.
I only do this for Chris.
My family and Chris, we have the same enemy.
You see, my father, he was educated in the west.
We love our country, but the Taliban, they destroy it.
On Chris' last mission, three of his men were killed.
- Yes, that is true.
- Do you know the purpose of that mission?
They go to a village, and then they take someone away.
Who did they take?
An Afghan.
And that's all I know.
And why did they take him?
Every mission, they take someone away.
Dangerous men who have knowledge.
What did Chris' unit do with these men?
Interrogate them.
They asked them questions to find out what they knew.
Chris explained this to my father.
And now, my father is dead.
That company is responsible for murdering my father.
I'm so sorry, Mr Marwat.
Do you know where Chris is now?
No.
I looked, but he is nowhere.
Did anyone else know that you were assisting Mr Sanchez?
No, no one.
Chris' unit that you were referring to, was it these men?
Yes.
But on the final mission, there was another, an American that I've never seen before.
I'm sorry I do not have more information.
I've only seen him once, and he never saw me.
So they were interrogating terror suspects.
Sounds like it.
Unfortunately, Marwat is worthless as a witness.
I know.
It's all hearsay unless we can find some other way to confirm his story.
If High Star was running some sort of terrorist extraction programme, they couldn't have done it alone.
Someone in the government would have had to have known about it.
Sorry.
It's my mom.
I was supposed to meet her to do some Christmas shopping.
Go ahead, talk to her.
I'm going to go out.
I think I know someone who might be able to help us.
- I'll come with you.
- No, no.
That'd be a little tricky.
Check in with me later.
Hey, Mom.
Mom, are you there?
Where are you?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I'm sorry, I was going to call you.
- I got stuck in a meeting.
- Are you going to come shopping?
I don't think I can.
I'm looking at these bracelets again.
They're all so pretty.
I can't decide which one Aunt Laurie would like.
I need your eye, Ellie.
I'm sorry, Mom, I just...
I don't think I'm going to make it today.
That's okay, sweetheart.
I know your work's important.
Listen, we'll pick something out for Laurie tomorrow, okay?
A potential witness has just shown up out of nowhere.
Exciting.
Who is it?
Mom, you know I can't talk about it.
You always keep the juicy details from me.
An Afghani man.
- But that's all I can say.
- Well, good luck.
- I'll take a rain check for tomorrow.
- Bye, Mom.
That's impossible.
Who else at High Star knew about the programme?
Carter and Sanchez.
You knew that.
I know that's what you told me.
I've withheld nothing from you.
Well, somehow there's a new witness in town.
We got to find out who this guy is.
I'm supposed to be meeting with the Defence Department next week.
There's 60 million in contracts on the line here.
Any chance Chris Sanchez had something to do with this?
Carter has Sanchez locked down.
Sanchez could have sent someone back here.
Maybe.
Shouldn't be too tough to find out.
You know how to get answers.
Sanchez is an American citizen.
There are no rules.
We need information.
Who the fuck cares how we get it?
I'm not going to do that to one of my own men.
I'm not going to give that order.
You either believe in what we're doing or you don't, Howard.
I'm going to go check with my sources.
Hey, next one's on me, blondie.
What's your poison?
- It's 11:00 a. m.
- I know, I know.
I could have been here earlier, except I couldn't find my socks.
Which reminds me of a story about the chimp with the clap.
No one wants to hear it, Bill.
Holy shit.
Patty Hewes.
Your landlord gave me a couple of suggestions of where you might be drowning yourself,
so I came by for a little conversation.
Little conversation?
About what?
About something near and dear to your heart.
That's not possible.
What about extraordinary rendition?
I assume that in between drinks, you've been following Howard Erickson and High Star.
What about them?
I've been hearing rumours that Erickson may be running his own in-house operation.
Seizing and interrogating terror suspects.
Erickson would be insane to go that far off the reservation.
High Star's not sanctioned for intelligence operations.
He'd lose his company if that ever got out.
Yeah, but what if Erickson was being protected?
The schmuck had better be if he's going to run a programme like that.
So, what are we saying here?
You got your sights set on taking down High Star?
No.
Not me.
One of my associates, Ellen Parsons.
Never heard of her.
Well, if she wanted confirmation that High Star was running a programme like that, how would she get it?
Patty, nobody's taken my calls for the last 15 years, including you.
How the fuck do I know how she'd get it?
You know, I'm sure you must still have a few drinking buddies lurking in the shadows of D.C.
You owe me, Bill.
Buy yourself a couple of rounds.
Think about it.
What can I do for you?
How are your ties in the Afghan community?
I have some eyes and ears.
- How's your Pashto?
- A little rusty.
What have you got?
Someone has just arrived from Afghanistan.
He's dangerous.
I need you to find him before he does any damage.
Some details would be helpful.
I'm guessing he's from the Kunar Province, or at least he spent time just south of the Hindu Kush.
As for his tribe, I'd say Kom Nuristani.
Start there.
That's all I got.
Excellent.
I will be happy to look for the next year.
You don't find him,
I'll be happy to revoke your immigration status.
There's no need to talk like this.
I will search.
Your Uncle Sam thanks you for your vigilance.

"Join with me in suffering".
Yeah.
You miss Chris, don't you, girl?
Let's get this back on you.
Come here.
Come here.
Your food, it tastes like home.
You are from Kunar Province?
Very close.
Laghman.
I am from Bamyan Valley.
I have visited.
It's very beautiful.
Please come back.
You're welcome anytime.
- You are sure you're not hungry?
- I'm fine, thank you.
I was hoping you could help me with something.
Have you ever seen these initials before?
- Certainly.
This is the Double Dees.
- The Double Dees?
Chris and his men, they call themselves this.
- What does it mean?
- I do not know.
I really appreciate you coming all this way, Mr Marwat.
You should thank Chris.
He told my father to send me here.
The last time I saw Chris, he was going through a very difficult time.
Did your father say anything about his state of mind?
When Chris came to visit my father, he wished to apologise.
For what?
For the company, for the work, for the taking of the men who do not return.
Do you believe that High Star tortured the men that they took?
Chris, he did not speak to me of this.
But, you know, sometimes it happens that they take the wrong men.
The men who are innocent.
Chris, he explained this regret to my father.
I see Chris means a lot to you.
To me, also.
I will do whatever I can to help him.
Thank you.
I'm telling you, man, I don't know what you're talking about.
Then why did you want to meet with Zafar Marwat alone?
He's my own personal contact, he's a friend!
- Your friend?
- Yeah!
Your friends are my friends.
Aren't we all on the same side?
Marwat, he's plugged into tribal politics.
If he knows something about Nur Taraki, I just wanted to make him feel comfortable with telling me, so I went alone, okay?
Sorry, man, I just don't buy it.
Did you have the old man pass on a message about the Double Dees for you?
No!
You understand why I can't trust you, right, Chris?
No, you started this thing.
You sidestepped company channels, and you talked to a lawyer.
What you did may directly jeopardise High Star's ability to protect our country.
- Protect our country?
- Yes.
Protect our country?
!
- You really think that's what we were doing?
- Absolutely.
No, it's not so simple, AC.
Chris.
Come on, man.
Don't make this any harder than it has to be.
Now, you sent someone to New York with information.
- Give me a name.
- Or what?
What are you going to do to me?
- Thanks for the call.
- A man has come in several times.
He says he's recently arrived from Laghman.
What's he look like?
See for yourself.
My God, how much money you spend on this place?
I mean, it's nice.
A little antiseptic, could use a bit more flash.
- But you did good.
- I'm glad you approve.
- Can I get some of this bourbon?
- No.
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.
Ellen Parsons, William Herndon.
- Wow.
- Don't.
Relax, I learned my lesson.
We behave in the workplace now, don't we?
- Pleasure.
- Likewise.
Mr Herndon can make some inquires about High Star on your behalf.
Let me brass tack it for you.
If I can get someone to talk, you're going to have a hell of a bull's-eye on your back.
- I understand.
- Bullshit.
Bullshit you understand.
You fuck this up, and your career will be flushed down the shitter faster than you can say,
"The American people have a right to know".
I get it.
You've got a life ahead of you, huh?
So you make damn sure this is what you want before I go any further.
It's your call, Ellen.
We don't have to go through with this.
If this is the only way to confirm Mr Marwat's story, then please, get all the facts that you can.
I'll handle the consequences.
Who the hell was that?
My first job out of law school was at a firm where Bill was a junior partner.
How come I have never heard of him?
Because about 10 years ago, he made a decision that cost him his practice.
He was disbarred.
Now, he drinks.
Why do we want him involved in this case?
Because he's the only person I know who could possibly get us the information that we need.
Can we trust him?
I certainly hope so.
Get in the car.
The agency's got a tail on me now?
What are you doing hanging around a mosque?
My job, following up on a tip.
And you just screwed it up for me.
File your goddamn reports, I won't have to shanghai you on the street.
You know I always take off for holidays.
So what's going on with this wrongful death suit against High Star?
It's got nothing to do with us.
A couple of High Star contractors were KIA.
Now, some ambulance chasers are going after the company.
So the case isn't related to Double Dee?
Of course not.
The programme was already over.
The brass went and yanked the plug on it.
So, now the war's entering its second decade, and all you geniuses are getting promoted.
Boorman, I don't know whose dick you greased to get this far, but if I find out that you're lying to me, you're withholding intel, you're so much as farting without filing a report, you are done.
You'll never be heard from again.
Is that clear?
- No, can you repeat it?
- Get the fuck out of my car.
Praise God.
And good evening.
It fills my heart with joy being with your...
Being here with you tonight.
I'd like to express my gratitude to Pastor Yates for giving me this opportunity.
Fuck.
- Yeah.
- I saw the son of a bitch, but I lost him.
Who is he?
I don't know his name, just what he looks like.
- You get anything from Sanchez?
- Nothing we can use.
What the fuck are you doing, Howard?
A man is running around this goddamn city talking to lawyers.
- Push harder.
- Calm yourself, Jerry.
Stop being sentimental about Sanchez.
It's information.
It don't mean a lick of shit who you get it from.
Now, pull your head out of your ass and give the order.
So, Chris Sanchez is involved in your case.
- Which one?
- That one, the blue one.
My gosh, that boy broke your heart junior year.
Tore it in two.
Broke my heart?
That's a little strong, Mom.
It's good.
Your father and I thought you'd never stop crying.
- I don't remember that.
- You really think Aunt Laurie would like it?
Yeah, it's lovely, Mom.
You should get it.
Great!
- Because you've been good.
- I've been really good.
You have been really good.
How many cookies do you think Santa wants?
How many?
You think three?
That's a good idea.
Want to put them on his plate?
- Hello?
- Any word from Herndon?
No.
Bill hasn't gotten in touch yet.
I think we're just going to have to wait.
Well, I can't just wait around anymore.
Where can I find him?
- Sir.
- Merry Christmas.
Sorry, sir, still nothing.
I'm not diddling around here, Carter.
We need details.
Step it up.
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
Sir?
National security is on the line here.
It's not a time for hesitation.
We need to know how our security has been breached, and you're the only one who can find out.
I'm giving you an order.
How far do you want me to go?
As far as you have to.
Matthew 5:9?
I know it's a well-worn passage.
Not very original.
Well, there's nothing in the scripture that doesn't warrant further exploration.
I want to make sure that you approve of my interpretation.
Did you like the speech?
Do you believe in what you wrote?
- You have doubts.
- No.
- That's what I believe.
- Then you need to share it.
- I don't see him.
- What does he look like?
He's in his 70s, kind of rumpled.
- Is that him?
- Mr Herndon?
Look, it's Nancy Drew.
- Let me buy you a drink.
- No, thanks.
Cash me out, will you, Stu?
Mr Herndon, we haven't heard from you.
Did you find anything on High Star?
Shit.
This will never cover it.
Hey, do me a favour.
Spot me, will you, sweetheart?
- I'll get you back next time.
- Did you find anything?
Sorry, I struck out.
- Mr Herndon...
- Hey, listen, I gotta go.
It's Christmas Eve.
Got a lot of chimneys to hit, you know?
Hey, thanks for picking up the cheque.
And make sure Stu gets a nice tip.
- And who are you?
- Her mother.
Yeah.
Why not?
Bye!
Praise God.
And good evening.
It fills my heart with joy to be here with you tonight.
This week, my six-year-old son made me a Christmas card in art class.
It said, "Peace on Earth, good will to all men".
Peace on Earth.
You're making a mistake.
Someone... is talking to that attorney in New York.
I want you to give me a name.
I don't have a name.
I didn't send anyone.
If you didn't, who did?
You know, nothing has to happen to you that you don't want to.
But you know that I'm not going to stop until I get a name.
Fuck you.
I am sorry, brother, 'cause I didn't want it to go this way.
Jesus told us, "Blessed be the peacemakers,
"for they shall be called the children of God".
But how far are we willing to go for peace?
Surely, it is not enough just to wish for it.
Jesus understood this.
To redeem mankind, he had to suffer, to withstand torture and death in order to wash clean the world.
He teaches us there is no peace without suffering.
No one knows this better than a soldier.
This Christmas, I find myself thinking of the soldiers overseas who make the ultimate sacrifice for peace.
As did our saviour, they put their lives on the line to fulfil their promise.
They bear their burden with courage and faith, because they know that to suffer in war is to honour Jesus' suffering on the cross and carry out God's will.
To those who have taken on this holy cause to protect and defend this great nation,
to my men who have endured pain and hardship to achieve peace,
I tell you your suffering is not in vain.
It is an act of love.
A testament to your faith.
The pain you endure, no matter how unbearable, will bring you closer to God.
- AC, what's the report?
- He's a tough son of a bitch.
Yeah?
What'd you get from him?
The guy's name is Nasim Marwat.
All right, nice work, AC.
- Hello?
- It is Nasim.
- Is everything okay?
- No.
I need to see you.
Okay.
Stay calm, Mr Marwat.
Where are you?
Ms Parsons, the other American from Chris' mission, the one I told you about, he is here in New York.
- Are you certain it was the same person?
- I saw him.
He was following me.
I wanted to tell you this before I return to Afghanistan.
Mr Marwat, you can't go back yet.
I need to get your testimony.
I have already lost my father.
My family cannot afford to lose me.
I understand your concern, but I'm asking you to just give us a little more time.
I am not safe.
I got a name.
Don't matter.
Don't need it any more.
What do you mean, you don't need it?
I'm looking at our guy right now.
Trust me.
Hey, Dad, great speech.
That was really cool.
Thank you.
Go round up your brothers.
- Yes, sir.
- That was very moving, Howard.
- Thank you.
- What's wrong?
You were inspiring.
It was a beautiful sermon.
Deacon Charles videotaped it.
I'll get you a copy.
Santa wants to know if you've been nice, Patty.
Because Howard Erickson has been very, very, very naughty.
You were able to confirm our witness' story?
Now that would be something of an understatement.
High Star was extracting terror suspects for the CIA.
And I don't have to tell you there's a whole world of people who would prefer to keep that from going public.
Thank you for your help.
So what are you going to do?
I mean, you can't share that with your little protégé.
The girl's in way over her head.
Yeah, she is.
She can't handle that.
So you keep that for yourself and get rid of her.
And remember what I taught you about dead weight.
I tell you, your suffering is not in vain.
The pain you endure, no matter how unbearable, will bring you closer to God.
I saw your client on Charlie Rose.
His English is better than his French.
Mr. Coupet, did you personally oversee the development of a vaccine called Tranzec?
We conduct clinical trials for every drug we develop.
Did you ever have occasion to hear the term, "adverse event"?
A wrongful death suit was filed against you and High Star in federal court.
The plaintiff's attorney is Ellen Parsons.
The brief lists a single witness, Christopher Sanchez.
Mr. Sanchez came forward as a witness.
He claimed that High Star was involved in illegal activity that led to the deaths of three men.
I never liked that last mission.
Lawsuit's been filed.
The company cannot have you talking.
Mr. Sanchez, in previous conversations, do you recall stating that you were involved in an illegal operation?
I don't ever recall saying that.
What are you doing?
I told them what you wanted!
They got him to lie.
I think they were going after somebody over there.

Damages - 4x04 "The Next One's On Me, Blondie"
Praise God... and good evening.
It fills my heart with joy to be here with you tonight.
This week my six-year-old son made a Christmas card for me.
It said, "Peace on Earth, good will to all men."
Peace on Earth.
Chris?
I didn't know you were home.
How are you?
I'm good.
What are you doing here?
I had to come back.
Why?
You know why.
Hey!
I missed you last night.
Oh.
I got hung up at work.
Sorry.
You spent the night at your desk, didn't you?
Where are you?
Let's, uh, have lunch later.
I'm on my way to the airport.
Right.
Of course.
Have a good time at your folks.
Wish them "Merry Christmas" for me.
Travel safe.
- Merry Christmas, Ellen.
- Merry Christmas.
Ho-ho-ho.
This is bullshit, Patty.
You have no respect for my client.
You know, if you insist on additional days to depose
Mr. Coupet, you have to do it in a timely manner.
I'm not gonna depose him until I'm fully prepared.
Fine.
I'm gonna get the judge to compel you.
Good.
Give it your best shot.
I'm sure the judge will understand that it takes a a little time to read ten-years worth of clinical trials.
- You've had time.
- A month, Jim.
Springtime in Paris is not so bad.
It looks like that went well.
I don't want you to have to jeopardize your other case by helping me.
Don't worry about it.
It's good to let them stew.
What's wrong?
It's Chris.
I don't know if he's safe.
I don't even know if he's alive.
Are you getting emotionally involved?
No.
No.
Don't.
It'll affect your judgment.
You'll make mistakes.
I'm here to see Ellen Parsons.
And your name is, sir?
Christopher Sanchez.
- You can wait in here.
- Thank you.
And there's coffee and tea right out there.
Help yourself.
Ellen...
I want you to seriously reconsider pursuing this case.
I appreciate you concern, Patty, I do, but it's fine.
- Ms. Parsons.
- Yes?
There's a Mr. Sanchez waiting for you in conference room two.
- Ms. Parsons?
- Who are you?
My name is Nasim Marwat.
That is for you.
Did you tell reception you were Chris Sanchez?
Only so I could see you.
Call security, please.
No, no, please.
Chris Sanchez sent me.
I'm his friend.
You see?
This is from Chris.
She's a real pretty lady, this church.
The restoration's picture- perfect.
Well, that was only possible because of you.
We're all grateful.
There's no need to thank me.
I'm happy to do it.
So what's on your you mind?
I've been struggling with Christmas Eve.
You're having second thoughts about giving the guest sermon?
No, no.
I'm-I'm honored to do that.
I just want to be sure I have something worthwhile to talk about.
Of course.
When Mary Alice was alive, she was my ears for this sort of thing.
I'm kinda lost without her.
I must've filled a dozen wastebaskets with-with crumpled paper.
It happens to all of us.
I've been reading my Bible, studying my favorite passages.
I don't just want to talk about what matters to me.
I want to speak to the whole congregation.
Howard, that's my job.
You're a unique man with a unique perspective.
That's why I asked you to speak.
The congregation can be enlightened by your point of view.
I don't know about that.
Trust that God can lead you down the right path.
And remember that the faithful heart never errs.
Where did you get this?
Chris gave it to my father so that I could bring it to you.
And how do you know Chris?
I helped him with his work-
- The missions.
I would scout the region, I talk to the people, I translate, I gather information.
Mr. Marwat, are you employed by High Star?
No.
I only do this for Chris.
My family and Chris, we have the same enemy.
You see, my father, he was educated in the West.
We love our country, but the Taliban, they destroy it.
On Chris's last mission, three of his men were killed.
- Yes, that is true.
- Do you know the purpose of that mission?
They go to a village, and then they take someone away.
Who did they take?
An Afghan.
And that's all I know.
And why did they take him?
Every mission they take someone away.
Dangerous men who have knowledge.
What did Chris's unit do with these men?
Interrogate them.
They asked them questions to find out what they knew.
Chris explained this to my father.
And now my father is dead.
That company is responsible for murdering my father.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Marwat.
Do you know where Chris is now?
Um, no.
I looked, but he is nowhere.
Did anyone else know that you were assisting Mr. Sanchez?
No, no one.
Chris's unit that you were referring to, was it... these men?
Yes.
But, um, on the final mission, there was another--
An American that I've never seen before.
I'm sorry I do not have more information.
I've only seen him once, and he never saw me.
So they were interrogating terror suspects.
Sounds like it.
Unfortunately, Marwat is worthless as a witness.
I know.
It's all hearsay unless we can find some other way to confirm his story.
If High Star was running some sort of terrorist extraction program, they couldn't have done it alone.
Someone in the government would have had to have known about it.
Sorry.
It's my mom.
I was supposed to meet her to do some Christmas shopping.
Go ahead, talk to her.
I'm going to go out.
I think I know someone who might be able to help us.
- I'll come with you.
- No, no.
That'd be a little tricky.
Check in with me later.
Hey, Mom.
Are you there?
Where are you?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I was going to call you.
I got stuck in a meeting.
Are you going to come shopping?
I don't think I can.
I'm looking at these bracelets again.
They're all so pretty.
I can't decide which one Aunt Laurie would like.
I need your eye, Ellie.
I'm sorry, Mom, I just-
- I don't think I'm going to make it today.
That's okay, sweetheart.
I know your work's important.
Listen, we'll pick something out for Laurie tomorrow, okay?
A potential witness has just shown up out of nowhere.
Ooh, exciting.
Who is it?
Mom, you know I can't talk about it.
You always keep the juicy details from me.
An Afghani man.
But that's all I can say.
Well, good luck.
I'll take a rain check for tomorrow.
Bye, Mom.
That's impossible.
Who else at High Star knew about the program?
Carter and Sanchez.
You knew that.
I know that's what you told me.
I've withheld nothing from you.
Well, somehow there's a new witness in town.
We got to find out who this guy is.
I'm supposed to be meeting with the Defense Department next week.
There's $60 million in contracts on the line here.
Any chance Chris Sanchez had something to do with this?
Carter has Sanchez locked down.
Sanchez could have sent someone back here.
Maybe.
Shouldn't be too tough to find out.
You know how to get answers.
Sanchez is an American citizen.
There are no rules.
We need information.
Who the fuck cares how we get it?
I'm not going to do that to one of my own men.
I'm not going to give that order.
You either believe in what we're doing or you don't, Howard.
I'm going to go check with my sources.
Hey, next one's on me, Blondie.
What's your poison?
It's 11:00 a.m.
Oh, I know, I know.
I could have been here earlier, except I couldn't find my socks.
Which reminds me of a story about the chimp with the clap.
No one wants to hear it, Bill.
Holy shit.
Patty Hewes.
Your landlord gave me a couple of suggestions of where you might be drowning yourself, so, uh...
I came by for a little conversation.
What conversation?
About what?
About something near and dear to your heart.
That's not possible.
What about extraordinary rendition?
I assume that in between drinks, you've been following Howard Erickson and High Star.
What about them?
I've been hearing rumors that Erickson may be running his own in-house operation.
Seizing and interrogating terror suspects.
Mm...
Erickson would be insane to go that far off the reservation.
High Star's not sanctioned for intelligence operations.
He'd lose his company, that ever got out.
Yeah, but what if Erickson was being protected?
The schmuck had better be if he's going to run a program like that.
So, what are we saying here?
You got your sights set on taking down High Star?
No.
Not me.
One of my associates-- Ellen Parsons.
Never heard of her.
Well, if she wanted confirmation that High Star was running a program like that, how would she get it?
Patty, nobody's taken my calls for the last 15 years.
Including you.
How the fuck do I know how she'd get it?
You know, I'm sure you still have a few drinking buddies lurking in the shadows of D.C.
You owe me, Bill.
Buy yourself a couple of rounds.
Think about it.
Boormanjahn.
What can I do for you?
How are your ties in the Afghan community?
I have some eyes and ears.
- How's your Pashto?
- A little rusty.
What have you got?
Someone has just arrived from Afghanistan.
He's dangerous.
I need you to find him before he does any damage.
Some details would be helpful.
I'm guessing he's from the Kunar Province, or at least he spent time just south of the Hindu Kush.
As for his tribe, I'd say Kom Nuristani.
Start there.
That's all I got.
Excellent.
I-I will be happy to look for the next year.
You don't find him, I'll be happy to revoke your immigration status.
Boormanjahn, there's no need to talk like this.
I will search.
Your Uncle Sam thanks you for your vigilance.

- What does it mean?
- I do not know.
I really appreciate you coming all this way, Mr. Marwat.
You should thank Chris.
He told my father to send me here.
The last time I saw Chris, he, uh, he was going through a very difficult time.
Did your father say anything about his state of mind?
When, um, when Chris came to visit my father, he, he wished to apologize.
For what?
For the company, for the work, for the taking of the men who do not return.
Do you believe that High Star tortured the men that they took?
Chris, he did not speak to me of this.
But you know, sometimes it happens that they take the wrong men.
The men who are innocent.
Chris, he, uh, he explained this regret to my father.
I see Chris means a lot to you.
To me also.
I will do whatever I can to help him.
Thank you.
I'm telling you, man, I don't know what you're talking about.
Then why did you want to meet with Zafar Marwat alone?
He's my own personal contact; he's a friend!
- Your friend?
- Yeah!
Your friends are my friends.
Aren't we all on the same side?
Marwat-
- He's plugged into tribal politics.
If he knows something about Nur Taraki, I just wanted to make him feel comfortable with telling me, so I went alone, okay?
Sorry, man, I just don't buy it.
Did you have the old man pass on a message about the Double Dees for you?
- No!
- You understand why I can't trust you, right, Chris?
No, you started this thing.
You sidestepped company channels and you talked to a lawyer.
What you did may directly jeopardize High Star's ability to protect our country.
- Protect our country?
- Yes.
Protect our country.
You really think that's what we were doing?
- Absolutely.
- Uh-uh.
No, it's not so simple, A.C.
Chris...
Come on, man.
Don't make this any harder than it has to be.
Now, you sent someone to New York with information.

How many cookies do you think Santa wants?
How many-
- You think three?
That's a good idea.
Want to put them on his plate?
Hello?
Any word from Herndon?
No.
Bill hasn't gotten in touch yet.
I think we're just going to have to wait.
Well, I can't-
- I can't just wait around anymore.
Where can I find him?
- Sir.
- Merry Christmas.
Sorry, sir, still nothing.
I'm not diddling around here, Carter.
We need details.
Step it up.
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
- Sir?
- National security is on the line here.
It's not a time for hesitation.
We need to know how our security has been breached, and you're the only one who can find out.
I'm giving you an order.
How far do you want me to go?
As far as you have to.
Matthew 5:9.
I know it's a well-worn passage.
Not very original.
Well, there's nothing in the scripture that doesn't warrant further exploration.
I want to make sure that you approve of my interpretation.
Did you like the speech?
Do you believe in what you wrote?
You have doubts.
No.
That's what I believe.
Then you need to share it.
- I don't see him.
- What does he look like?
He's in his 70s, kinda rumpled.
Is that him?
- Mr. Herndon?
- Ah, look, it's Nancy Drew.
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Uh, no, thanks.
Cash me out, will you, Stu?
Mr. Herndon, we haven't heard from you.
Did you find anything on High Star?
Oh, shit.
This will never cover it.
Hey, do me a favor.
Spot me, will ya, sweetheart?
I'll get you back next time.
Did you find anything?
Oh, sorry, I struck out.
- Mr. Herndon...
- Hey, listen,
I gotta go.
It's Christmas eve.
Got a lot of chimneys to hit, you know?
Oh, hey, thanks for picking up the check.
And make sure Stu gets a nice tip.
- And-and who are you?
- Her mother.
Yeah.
Why not?
Bye.
Praise God.
And good evening.
It fills my heart with joy to be here with you tonight.
This week, my six-year-old son made me a Christmas card in art class.
It said, "Peace on Earth, good will to all men."
Peace on Earth.
You're making a mistake.
Someone...
is talking to that attorney in New York.
I want you to give me a name.
I don't have a name.
I didn't send anyone.
If you didn't, who who did?
You know...
Nothing has to happen to you that you don't want to.
But you know that I'm not gonna stop...
until I get a name.
Fuck you.
I am sorry, brother, 'cause I didn't want it to go this way.
Jesus told us "Blessed be the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God."
But how far are we willing to go for peace?
Surely, it is not enough just to wish for it.
Jesus understood this.
To redeem mankind, he had to suffer, to withstand torture and death in order to wash clean the world.
He teaches us there is no peace without suffering.
No one knows this better than a soldier.
This Christmas, I find myself thinking of the soldiers overseas who make the ultimate sacrifice for peace.
As did Our Savior, they put their lives on the line to fulfill their promise.
They bear their burden with courage and faith because they know that to suffer in war is to honor Jesus' suffering on the cross and carry out God's will.
To those who have taken on this holy cause to protect and defend this great nation,
to my men who have endured pain and hardship to achieve peace,
I tell you your suffering is not in vain.
It is an act of love.
A testament to your faith.
The pain you endure, no matter how unbearable... will bring you closer to God.
A.C., what's the report?
He's a tough son of a bitch.
Yeah?
What'd you get from him?
The guy's name is Nasim Marwat.
All right, nice work, A.C.
- Hello?
- It is Nasim.
- Is everything okay?
- No.
I need to see you.
Okay.
Stay calm, Mr. Marwat.
Where are you?
Miss Parsons, the other American from Chris' mission, the one I told you about, he is here in New York.
Are you certain it was the same person?
I saw him.
He was following me.
I wanted to tell you this before I return to Afghanistan.
Mr. Marwat, you can't go back yet.
I need to get your testimony.
I have already lost my father.
My family cannot afford to lose me.
I understand your concern, but I'm asking you to just give us a little more time.
I got a name.
Don't matter.
Don't need it anymore.
What do you mean, you don't need it?
I'm looking at our guy right now.
Trust me...
Hey, Dad, great speech.
That was, that was really cool.
Thank you.
Go round up your brothers.
Yes, sir.
That was very moving, Howard.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
You were inspiring.
It was a beautiful sermon.
Deacon Charles videotaped it.
I'll get you a copy.
Santa wants to know if you've been nice, Patty.
Because Howard Erickson has been very, very, very naughty.
You were able to confirm our witness' story?
Now that...
would be something of an understatement.
High Star was extracting terror suspects for the CIA.
And I don't have to tell you there's a whole world of people who would prefer to, uh, keep that from going public.
Thank you for your help.
So what are you gonna do?
I mean, you can't share that with your little, uh, protege.
The girl's in way over her head.
Yeah, she is.
She can't handle that.
So you keep that for yourself and, uh...
get rid of her.
And remember what I taught you about dead weight.
I tell you, your suffering is not in vain.
The pain you endure, no matter how unbearable... will bring you closer to God.

The music that she was making, it turned everything into this incredible light show.
You sure you weren't just at the Planetarium?
Maybe it was synesthesia this really interesting mental condition a lot of geniuses have.
Oh yeah it's where like one sense crosses over into another.
Mhm, except... she would see music, as opposed to hearing it.
Like is she going to hear a Van Gogh or see a Jay-Z tune...
kind of genius really.
This not so much;
she forgot her bow.
Yeah, right, that's uhm... that's one way to put it.
911 what is the nature of your emergency?
My name is Dmitri Volkov, I have just killed my father.
Is that medieval, is that baroque or gothic?
Somebody got killed with a silver bullet I'm hearing.
That's like a werewolf.
- That's not vampires?
- No, it's a werewolf.
You know what you're talking about or are you making it up?
Do you know any vampires?
Personally?
Yeah.
Not since high school.
Okay now see, now the wheels won't come down.
Tell me why they need to replace the old stretchers.
You want state-of-the-art you pay the price.
Come on.
Oh sure, it works for you.
We hate this thing.
Hey, where's the victim?
In the living room.
Got a deceased in there as well; coroner's just declared.
Oh nice place.
Belongs to the Russian Consul General.
He's lying on the floor inside with his head caved in.
Right here is the injured guy.
You really need to take off these cuffs.
I don't know if that's a good idea.
I don't think he'll give you any trouble.
Detective, we'll be taking over from here.
That's it?
You just take my case?
Yeah, it's not a problem is it?
You kidding?
We love coming to crime scenes and just leaving.
Do you have any idea the amount of paperwork a case like this is going to generate?
Always looking out for us.
Thanks Michelle...
Good luck.
Get the cuffs off.
That's a nice looking uniform you got there.
Gallery opening.
I'm going to take his pressure in the rig.
All right, just going to walk him out?
Yeah.
With the stretcher?
Yeah.
- Let's get him out of here.
- All right.
So IIB gets called in on a political hot potato and you lose your night off.
Yeah, pretty much...
lucky for me this seems pretty open and shut, right Mr. Volkov?
He tried to kill me.
I had no choice.
Okay.
Is there anyone else here?
Not according to new reports.
I think you open and shut case is about to get a lot more complicated.
Alright there Mr. Volkov
Watch your feet there, okay.
Now he's all yours officer.
All right.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
There's no one to take care of Paval he's alone...
Dev?
Yeah.
What do you have on the deceased?
Fyodor Volkov entered the diplomatic service in 1975... 1985 to '88 he was with the Embassy in Ottawa.
He transferred to Toronto as the Deputy Minister of
Foreign Affairs, and get this...three years ago?
He was named the Consul General.
Are you hungry?
I'd really kill for like some avacados and banana fosters.
What are you like pregnant?
What about the son?
Dmitri Volkov.
He´s 27, he was born in Russia, raised in Toronto and he's a accountant executive at a Bay Street brokerage firm.
No priors, not even a little toe over the line this guy.
Any previous domestic trouble?
No, nothing in the file but who's to say some strings haven't been pulled.
It's about Mexican.
Yeah, I'll meet you.
Wait a sec...
I did a little reading on Dmitri... so far all I got is he keeps saying something about this guy named Paval.
Any idea of age?
I can stir him up...
I know, I'm still not used to getting my information from someone who wasn't even there.
Got to park right here.
Dmitri why did you attack your father?
I told him to stay out of my life.
And why did you want him to stay out of your life?
Because he was become the father who would attack his son with a letter opener.
Okay look I won't insult your intelligence as long as you don't insult mine.
We know that there was someone else in that house besides you and your father.
I have no idea what you are talking about.
There's someone at the desk saying he is Mr. Volkov's lawyer.
Oh.
Did you get anything?
Yeah I saw the Dmitri wiping down a statue.
Why would he wipe down the murder weapon and then call and confess?
Well maybe he was trying to protect the person who really used it.
Listen I gotta get back.
Thanks.
Sgt. McCluskey IIB, you must be Mr. Volkov's attorney.
I'm also his brother.
You're...
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
You can't imagine how difficult this is, not only for me, for all of us.
Our father he was an extraordinary man.
Is Dmitri all right?
Yeah he's fine under the circumstances.
I want to see for myself.
Have you been questioning him?
With his consent.
I'm sure you were most professional but he was not fit to be interviewed given what has occurred.
I disagree.
Further his counsel was not present for your questioning and finally as a Russian citizen and a son of a Diplomat he has...
Diplomatic immunity.
Yeah that's the first thing we looked into.
I should warn you though, we may contest that.
You say we just watch him, we get on a plane and fly back to Russia.
The Russians want him on a plane,
Ottawa wants him on a plane.
Why don't you want him on a plane?
Last I heard there was a great court system in Moscow.
You remember the Russian diplomat in the fatal hit and run back in Ottawa?
I know where you're going with this.
He claimed diplomatic, went back home and skated on it.
I'm not going to let that happen.
This is murder;
the guy confessed.
He's not going to skate.
You don't know that.
Listen, this is a done deal, so unless you know something I don't know you know something I don't know?
I think there might have been someone else involved.
A partner or someone he was covering for, I'm not sure yet.
Based on?
Cop's sense.
Oh what judge wouldn't buy that.
I'm just asking if we can hold on to him for a few days while we check this out.
Michelle there are two Ministers coming in from
Ottawa this morning and they got he entire staff on red alert.
And I know how much you love a challenge.
I have complete faith in you.
I have a love/hate relationship with you... mostly hate.
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.
Absolutely.
Mom, mom, can you just....?
Hold on, hold on.
Oh so it turns out to true, there's two brothers okay.
The lawyer friend that we know, Yuri and also another who goes by the name of Paval.
Yeah.
I got to tell you right now, this thing is not... is not reliable.
Why can't we just say thanks but no thanks.
There's been uptake in back injury claims over the last year so like it or not we're stuck with it.
It works when you do it, great.
All right, so the manual says that it's idiot proof, so who would like to test it out?
Anyone like to volunteer?
Any one at all?
Yeah, I'd love to, yeah I'll do it, sure, great.
All right.
Way to take one for the team Mr. Bay.
Yea, for the team.
I'm not covering anyone's shift for a month, thank you very much.
Hi...
Hey, what time do you get off?
I got off in about ten minutes, why?
We found Paval.
Really?
you want me to listen in on the interview?
Yeah if you can get away.
Hey officer, it slunk.
Yeah, I think I'll have no problem.
Do you want to wait a minute?
- Sure.
- Cool.
It's a nice place.
Yeah, it's Dmitri's, Paval lives here with his brother.
How can I help you?
Sgt. McCluskey, IIB.
This is Toby Logan.
Can we have a word?
Uhm, please come in.
It's about Dmitri isn't it?
Yes it is, Ms...
Uhm...
Renyeska,
Yekaterina Renyeska, but you call me Katja.
So what's your connection to the family?
Are you a relative?
Uhm...
No...
I look after Paval.
Paval suffers from a severe form of autism.
Autism, really.
Can we speak with him?
What about?
His brother.
Of course but I'm sure you're not going to hear anything from him.
Okay thank you.
Ms. Ra...
Ray...
Renyeska, Sgt. McCluskey.
Thank you.
Have there been any arguments between Dmitri and his father?
No, none!
That is what's so odd.
This is you?
Yeah.
You're very photogenic.
Thank you, I used to model.
Now you're a fulltime nanny?
Well it's a fulltime job to look after Paval.
Hey Paval.
Hi.
I'm Toby.
This is a really amazing train set.
Did you build this?
Wow, look at all your people.
That's very cool.
Who's this here?
Huh, huh, huh...
It's okay.
Paval it's okay.
That's Dmitri and Yuri, the picture was taken back in Russia.
Fyodor and...
Their mother.
She died soon after the picture.
And Paval?
Born to another woman, Canadian woman.
She left.
Autistic boy was too much for her so he goes to a special school and I look after him the rest of the time.
Where were you last night?
- With Paval.
- Here?
Yeah.
Why doesn't he live with his father?
He was travelling so much he couldn't take good care of him, that's why he lives with us.
Hey, hey, Paval it's okay.
Hey, it's okay... no.
Paval!
Are you okay?
Oh my God, what did you do to him?
I just touched him on the knee and he freaked out.
He cannot stand to be touched.
I'm sorry.
I think you need to leave now.
Sorry.
Paval...
Slide gusset collar to release auto lock.
Do not place unnecessary fingers into hinge mechanism.
It sounds like it was translated from another language by someone who doesn't speak English.
Somebody's going to hurt themselves on this stupid machine.
Nobody's going to hurt themselves.
Would you mind taking your shoes off please?
Hey you talked to that little brother right?
Hm... he's autistic.
I had a hard time getting through but he, he's actually amazingly focused on his own thing.
You know I have a cousin who's autistic.
Oh yeah?
Yeah my uncle Eric on my mother's side; he married a woman with a lovely little daughter named Eva.
You could name any date in history and she would tell you what day of the week it fell on.
It was sweet but kind of creepy.
I was inside the kid's mind for a few seconds;
it was amazing 'cause it's like he was living inside his train set.
Yeah it sounds like Eva, the way she would find a safe place in her own mind.
Listen to this...
Do you know any other notes?
Do you have any good news for me?
None, not on the home front.
It seems Fyodor and Dmitri are like any father and son; a few spats here and there but nothing out of the ordinary.
What about Yuri?
Same and Paval's virtually catatonic so that all but eliminates him.
Do you think Katja's involved?
Here's the thing; there is nothing indicating she even exists.
An illegal immigrant.
Yeah and oh, turns out the Consulate General is quite the entrepreneur.
I love it when you dish.
One of his companies is a talent agency specializing in Russian models.
Katja was a model.
You have no interest in visiting Russian models, do you Dev?
I would like to visit Russian models.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
It's alright to smile...
You were asking about?
Fyodor Valkov.
Terrible news; he was one of my investors.
He didn't own it outright?
No, no, no, it was partnership.
He supplied the capital, I found the talent.
This talent, they all come from Russia?
There is an unlimited pool of beautiful young women there.
Tatyana, Tatyana, keep smiling.
And all your women, they all have visas and work permits?
I can only assume sir.
...you have lovely cheekbones.
I also have a lovely badge.
How involved was Mr. Volkov with the talent?
Well there's no secret Fyodor had an eye for the ladies.
In fact he took one of them away from me and gave her a job; something she was good for.
What was this woman's name?
Katja Renyeska.
Don't, don't say it.
That's what you saw;
synapses firing with nothing to stop him... sensory overload.
That's acute autism.
Oz was just telling me about his has this autistic cousin and she takes comfort in creating order.
Mhmm.
Those kids, they find their refuges.
Problem is they're wired to keep the rest of the world out.
So all I have to do is find a way into this boy's world.
Mhmm, just don't underestimate how difficult that is.
I never do.
Right.
I'm vibrating.
Yeah, so am I.
I should probably look at this.
I have to take this.
Hello?
Sgt. McCluskey.
Hey, I got another job for you.
What have you got?
I need to know exactly what the relationship between Fyodor and Katja was.
You think you can come up with a reason to go talk to her again?
Yeah, I think I can come up with something.
Hey, hi.
Hi.
I just, I was wondering how Paval's doing.
He is fine, under the circumstances.
Right I feel bad about yesterday.
It's okay.
I uhm...
I brought him a little something.
Hope I can make it up to him.
Come in, you can give it to him yourself.
Ah, thank you.
Hey.
It's Toby, remember me?
I brought you a...
I brought you some figures, some policemen.
I thought maybe I'd put them here.
This is Michelle.
Remember Michelle?
I'm going to pop her right here.
And this is me, your buddy.
I'm going to put myself right there.
♪]
Who's this?
Who's the Station master?
It's you...
Whoa, that's cool.
Who's underground?
Is that your father?
Why is your father...?
It's okay.
Hey...
Dmitri I know what it's like to have a volatile relationship with a father.
I can tell that you really loved him.
What would he want you to do right now?
He would want me to accept responsibility for what
I have done and I have.
Forensics found smudge marks beneath your fingerprints on the murder weapon.
You wiped it down before you handled it.
Why would you do that unless you were trying...
The cleaning lady must have wiped it down.
See, I just find this very odd.
Here I am offering you an out and you're not taking it.
Dimitri perhaps...
English.
My client stands by his previous statement.
Then I guess this interview is over.
No, not yet.
Tell me about Miranov Talent.
Never heard of it.
Really?
Your father was an investor in it.
Our father had many investments.
Well this one was special;
it is where he met Katja.
And isn't it true that his interest in her was beyond simply being Paval's nanny?
Wait a minute, Katja had nothing to do with this.
I said I was guilty; why would I lie about that?
You tell me.
I think it's enough for today.
His train set means everything to him.
Fyodor loved watching him play.
So his father was around a lot.
Not a lot but he would check with me on the phone almost every day.
So you and Fyodor were close?
You're a beautiful woman, was there...?
He was my employer.
Well, I should get going.
Thank you for letting me see him.
Hey Paval, thank you, bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Katja and Dmitri were lovers.
That certainly explains a lot.
He has every reason to protect her... he has diplomatic immunity and she doesn't.
So we're looking at a love triangle...
Right, which always ends well.
Okay Fyodor finds out about Dmitri, argues with
Katja, she hits him, panics, calls Dmitri for help.
He arrives, he sees what's happened and he acts fast.
Comes over, wipes down the murder weapon and calls the police.
Too bad we don't have one sliver of evidence.
I actually have to get back to my day job.
Thank you.
I'm putting together a timeline on Katja on the day of the killing;
I think you might find it interesting.
So where were you the night of the murder?
You picked up Paval at his school and according to his teacher you were taking him to visit his father?
So were you at Fyodor's house?
All right, we were there.
I dropped him home at six, I picked him up at nine, the same as every week.
And when you came to pick him up did you actually see Fyodor?
Yeah, of course.
He seemed a little troubled but, other than that he was fine.
That was at, um, nine...?
Yeah.
The Coroner said that he died no later than 8:30.
Well the Coroner is obviously wrong.
We checked with Immigration Canada, we know you are here illegally and we know you're lying.
You have a chance to help yourself out if you just tell us the truth.
Listen, I've told you everything I know.
So to be clear the Coroner's reports aren't in, right?
No.
That was good.
You're in charge of lying from now on.
So this is our prank victim.
Yeah, you know it's just flesh wounds.
A little superglue, toilet and genius.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you just going to leave me here?
We'll get you bed okay, just keep a lid on it...
You need a bed.
Yeah.
Wow.
Must have been some party.
This is kind of like really embarrassing.
Don't let it tank your whole college experience, okay.
So how do they get this off?
It's like a Brazilian but for your butt.
I got to take this...
You are being so brave.
Hey what's up?
So it turns out Paval was watching a movie with his father the night of the murder.
We're going to bring Katja in for questioning.
Can you meet me at IIB?
Yeah sure.
Do you think she knows something?
Yeah, and we need to see what that is.
All right.
This thing supposed to be sinking?
Hang on a second;
I got it.
Oh, oh man.
You all right?
Oh.. are you all right?
My back...
My back, my back.
You all right?
What did you do man?
I didn't do anything.
Touched the button?
No.
Come on, this thing...
I know, I know.
Come on...
Guys...
The nurse will be right with you....
Guys!
Hello?
Just touch here if you can hear me.
All right, I'm ready.
Got yourself in a bit of a spot here Katja;
you know that don't you?
Yes.
We know that Fyodor was in love with you.
Was he upset about your relationship with Dmitri?
Did you two argue about that?
No!
There were feelings between us but a different kind.
Dmitri was the one who I fell in love with and even then me and Fyodor, we never fought, never.
Besides he knew that I'm good for Paval.
If you cared about Fyodor at all why don't you just help us get to the bottom of this?
What happened on the night of the murder?
Fyodor, Fyodor...
I think she found the body.
He was already dead when you found him, wasn't he?
He was laying there, blood everywhere.
And what happened?
Oh my God!
She may have called Dmitri to come over.
We've checked Dmitri's phone records.
He received a call from Fyodor's that night.
That was you calling him, wasn't it?
Wasn't it?
He came over and helped you clean up.
How did he get cut?
He made me do it to him so it would look like they fought.
So who actually killed Fyodor?
It was Paval.
Katja, it was Paval wasn't it?
He didn't know what he was doing, I'm sure of it.
No way!
The kid?
Yeah.
No wonder Dmitri took the rap for him.
He'd do anything to protect him, but I just don't buy it.
Are you going to be able to make it up the stairs?
Yeah, I'm good, I'm golden, come on.
So did your uncle every get through to your autistic cousin?
Yeah, actually he bought her this universal calendar, put it up on her wall and it kind of became this thing they shared, you know, like a common ground.
Common ground.
Mr. Bay did you hurt your back?
Yes sir, a little bit.
Then why haven't you filled out a 5B or a 7D?
Oh well I don't think that's necessary.
It's nonsense.
Get down here.
Okay.
Okay we'll try your theory that there was someone else in the room besides Paval.
Let's hope this works.
Hi Paval, it's Toby.
I know everything must be really strange right now but I'm going to help you.
I know how much you love your train set... couldn't bring everything but I brought you a few things.
This is a tree.
This is a park bench.
Just like in your train set.
Now this is you.
You can turn the bench.
And you're going to be joined by your father.
It's okay, it's all right.
You guys are watching television just like on movie night.
The last time you were watching television someone came by, didn't they?
It's okay Paval, it's okay because this is me.
Look, this is me.
The person who came, they hurt your father.
What is it Paval?
Look up at them.
It's okay.
Who hurt your father?
Okay.
I'll get rid of him.
It's okay, it's safe.
Good work.
There's absolutely nothing that connects Yuri to the murder.
That's it, see something's bugging me about my reads.
I think that the statue might have been wiped down twice.
And you have the cloth that Dmitri used.
Yeah we collected it as evidence.
Yuri used another cloth.
You find that cloth and you connect Yuri to the whole thing.
Hey guys, I think I got something.
Get this...
I cross-referenced our good friend Yuri with our case and I got a hit.
Connecting the dots... two years ago, Yuri represented a Sasha Miranov in a case of living off the avails of prostitution.
Small world.
Very.
And you don't believe in coincidence.
No, but I believe in proof.
And what do we have here;
we have an eyewitness who doesn't communicate with the world and you... no offense.
So given the circumstances we, like you, want what's best for Paval.
You can claim Diplomatic immunity for him or he can face trial here.
The crown says they won't pursue jail time.
So he'd be institutionalized.
Yeah.
But, we have some great institutions here in Canada...
I think that would be preferable.
Dmitri and I would be able to visit him.
Great.
Thank you for your help.
Any time.
Hey Sarge, want to go claw fishing?
Mr. Volkov.
Sgt. McCluskey.
You know there are rare days when a Mountie gets her man and wishes she hadn't.
This is one of them.
I appreciate that.
There's just one little problem I'm having.
What's that?
When forensics examined the statue for trace evidence, two different fibers were found... two different cloths.
Someone wiped it down before Dmitri.
What are you implying?
Whoever killed Fyodor tried to frame Paval.
Don't worry...
our entire team is on it.
We will find him.
Well this is most unexpected but it gives me hope.
Thank you Sergeant.
You get anything?
Yeah...
Hello Mr. Volkov.
You have news already?
We do.
We found that cloth and preliminary forensics has linked it to you.
Preliminary forensics...
so you have nothing.
Why would I harm the father I loved?
Hmm?
Now if you'll excuse me.
Sasha Miranov had a scheme to bring girls into the country.
He offered to cut you in for a lot... that sound familiar?
I was his lawyer, it was legitimate.
Investments.
Yeah but you didn't have any money.
Bank records show that you were poaching off your father's account.
I'm guessing he didn't like that.
You two argued, one thing led to another...
Look if there are inquires I will face them in my country.
Are you sure?
You might be a lot better off in a nice safe Canadian prison.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
It was an accident.
I didn't do anything criminal.
You killed your father and tried to frame your autistic brother.
You want to tell me why that's okay?
Come on.
Here I'll take that.
Oh wait, what's going on with the slug?
It failed its field test on a number of issues, but the biggest one here was Mr. Bay injuring his back.
Well I mean back injuries were the whole point of testing these things in the first place, am I right?
Ah, oh, still go the spasms?
Yeah, but they're getting better sir.
Now always remember, lift with your legs.
Yes, absolutely.
I'll remember that sir.
Safety first.
Oh, ah!
Us one, slug zero.
You were faking.
Well something had to be done; that thing was a menace.
I'm sorry to take advantage of our little arrangement but I did what was necessary.
No, no, what was necessary...
me waiting on you hand and foot.
Well, you know, I had to stay in character.
It's not like I asked you to give me a sponge bath or anything.
No, I got other things to do.
What?
What do you have to do?
I've got these other friends, who need me.
Fine, go... go to your other friends and...
See you later buddy.
So how is your citizenship application going?
So far, so good.
Good, you'll get it.
Look guys, more help.
Hello Toby.
A little gift for Paval.
By all means.
I brought you something.
You remember this?
You gotta remember your father just like that
Paval, only like this.
Thank you.
The music that she was making, it turned everything into this incredible light show.
You sure you weren't just at the Planetarium?
Maybe it was synesthesia this really interesting mental condition a lot of geniuses have.
Oh yeah it's where like one sense crosses over into another.
Mhm, except she would see music, as opposed to hearing it.
Like is she going to hear a Van Gogh or see a Jay-Z tune...
kind of genius really.
This not so much;
she forgot her bow.
Yeah, right, that's uhm... that's one way to put it.
911 what is the nature of your emergency?
My name is Dmitri Volkov, I have just killed my father.
Is that medieval, is that baroque or gothic?
Somebody got killed with a silver bullet I'm hearing.
That's like a werewolf.
- That's not vampires?
- No, it's a werewolf.
You know what you're talking about or are you making it up?
Do you know any vampires?
Personally?
Yeah.
Not since high school.
Okay now see, now the wheels won't come down.
Tell me why they need to replace the old stretchers.
You want state-of-the-art you pay the price.
Come on.
Oh sure, it works for you.
We hate this thing.
Hey, where's the victim?
In the living room.
Got a deceased in there as well; coroner's just declared.
Oh nice place.
Belongs to the Russian Consul General.
He's lying on the floor inside with his head caved in.
Right here is the injured guy.
You really need to take off these cuffs.
I don't know if that's a good idea.
I don't think he'll give you any trouble.
Detective, we'll be taking over from here.
That's it?
You just take my case?
Yeah, it's not a problem is it?
You kidding?
We love coming to crime scenes and just leaving.
Do you have any idea the amount of paperwork a case like this is going to generate?
Always looking out for us.
Thanks Michelle...
Good luck.
Get the cuffs off.
That's a nice looking uniform you got there.
Gallery opening.
I'm going to take his pressure in the rig.
All right, just going to walk him out?
Yeah.
With the stretcher?
Yeah.
- Let's get him out of here.
- All right.
So IIB gets called in on a political hot potato and you lose your night off.
Yeah, pretty much...
lucky for me this seems pretty open and shut, right Mr. Volkov?
He tried to kill me.
I had no choice.
Okay.
Is there anyone else here?
Not according to new reports.
I think you open and shut case is about to get a lot more complicated.
Alright there Mr. Volkov
Watch your feet there, okay.
Now he's all yours officer.
All right.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
There's no one to take care of Paval he's alone...
Dev?
Yeah.
What do you have on the deceased?
Fyodor Volkov entered the diplomatic service in 1975... 1985 to '88 he was with the Embassy in Ottawa.
He transferred to Toronto as the Deputy Minister of
Foreign Affairs, and get this...three years ago?
He was named the Consul General.
Are you hungry?
I'd really kill for like some avacados and banana fosters.
What are you like pregnant?
What about the son?
Dmitri Volkov.
He´s 27, he was born in Russia, raised in Toronto and he's a accountant executive at a Bay Street brokerage firm.
No priors, not even a little toe over the line this guy.
Any previous domestic trouble?
No, nothing in the file but who's to say some strings haven't been pulled.
It's about Mexican.
Yeah, I'll meet you.
Wait a sec...
I did a little reading on Dmitri... so far all I got is he keeps saying something about this guy named Paval.
Any idea of age?
I can stir him up...
I know, I'm still not used to getting my information from someone who wasn't even there.
Got to park right here.
Dmitri why did you attack your father?
I told him to stay out of my life.
And why did you want him to stay out of your life?
Because he was become the father who would attack his son with a letter opener.
Okay look I won't insult your intelligence as long as you don't insult mine.
We know that there was someone else in that house besides you and your father.
I have no idea what you are talking about.
There's someone at the desk saying he is Mr. Volkov's lawyer.
Oh.
Did you get anything?
Yeah I saw the Dmitri wiping down a statue.
Why would he wipe down the murder weapon and then call and confess?
Well maybe he was trying to protect the person who really used it.
Listen I gotta get back.
Thanks.
Sgt. McCluskey IIB, you must be Mr. Volkov's attorney.
I'm also his brother.
You're...
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
You can't imagine how difficult this is, not only for me, for all of us.
Our father he was an extraordinary man.
Is Dmitri all right?
Yeah he's fine under the circumstances.
I want to see for myself.
Have you been questioning him?
With his consent.
I'm sure you were most professional but he was not fit to be interviewed given what has occurred.
I disagree.
Further his counsel was not present for your questioning and finally as a Russian citizen and a son of a Diplomat he has...
Diplomatic immunity.
Yeah that's the first thing we looked into.
I should warn you though, we may contest that.
You say we just watch him, we get on a plane and fly back to Russia.
The Russians want him on a plane,
Ottawa wants him on a plane.
Why don't you want him on a plane?
Last I heard there was a great court system in Moscow.
You remember the Russian diplomat in the fatal hit and run back in Ottawa?
I know where you're going with this.
He claimed diplomatic, went back home and skated on it.
I'm not going to let that happen.
This is murder;
the guy confessed.
He's not going to skate.
You don't know that.
Listen, this is a done deal, so unless you know something I don't know you know something I don't know?
I think there might have been someone else involved.
A partner or someone he was covering for, I'm not sure yet.
Based on?
Cop's sense.
Oh what judge wouldn't buy that.
I'm just asking if we can hold on to him for a few days while we check this out.
Michelle there are two Ministers coming in from
Ottawa this morning and they got he entire staff on red alert.
And I know how much you love a challenge.
I have complete faith in you.
I have a love/hate relationship with you... mostly hate.
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.
Absolutely.
Mom, mom, can you just....?
Hold on, hold on.
Oh so it turns out to true, there's two brothers okay.
The lawyer friend that we know, Yuri and also another who goes by the name of Paval.
Yeah.
I got to tell you right now, this thing is not... is not reliable.
Why can't we just say thanks but no thanks.
There's been uptake in back injury claims over the last year so like it or not we're stuck with it.
It works when you do it, great.
All right, so the manual says that it's idiot proof, so who would like to test it out?
Anyone like to volunteer?
Any one at all?
Yeah, I'd love to, yeah I'll do it, sure, great.
All right.
Way to take one for the team Mr. Bay.
Yea, for the team.
I'm not covering anyone's shift for a month, thank you very much.
Hi...
Hey, what time do you get off?
I got off in about ten minutes, why?
We found Paval.
Really?
you want me to listen in on the interview?
Yeah if you can get away.
Hey officer, it slunk.
Yeah, I think I'll have no problem.
Do you want to wait a minute?
- Sure.
- Cool.
It's a nice place.
Yeah, it's Dmitri's, Paval lives here with his brother.
How can I help you?
Sgt. McCluskey, IIB.
This is Toby Logan.
Can we have a word?
Uhm, please come in.
It's about Dmitri isn't it?
Yes it is, Ms...
Uhm...
Renyeska,
Yekaterina Renyeska, but you call me Katja.
So what's your connection to the family?
Are you a relative?
Uhm...
No...
I look after Paval.
Paval suffers from a severe form of autism.
Autism, really.
Can we speak with him?
What about?
His brother.
Of course but I'm sure you're not going to hear anything from him.
Okay thank you.
Ms. Ra...
Ray...
Renyeska, Sgt. McCluskey.
Thank you.
Have there been any arguments between Dmitri and his father?
No, none!
That is what's so odd.
This is you?
Yeah.
You're very photogenic.
Thank you, I used to model.
Now you're a fulltime nanny?
Well it's a fulltime job to look after Paval.
Hey Paval.
Hi.
I'm Toby.
This is a really amazing train set.
Did you build this?
Wow, look at all your people.
That's very cool.
Who's this here?
Huh, huh, huh...
It's okay.
Paval it's okay.
That's Dmitri and Yuri, the picture was taken back in Russia.
Fyodor and...
Their mother.
She died soon after the picture.
And Paval?
Born to another woman, Canadian woman.
She left.
Autistic boy was too much for her so he goes to a special school and I look after him the rest of the time.
Where were you last night?
- With Paval.
- Here?
Yeah.
Why doesn't he live with his father?
He was travelling so much he couldn't take good care of him, that's why he lives with us.
Hey, hey, Paval it's okay.
Hey, it's okay... no.
Paval!
Are you okay?
Oh my God, what did you do to him?
I just touched him on the knee and he freaked out.
He cannot stand to be touched.
I'm sorry.
I think you need to leave now.
Sorry.
Paval...
Slide gusset collar to release auto lock.
Do not place unnecessary fingers into hinge mechanism.
It sounds like it was translated from another language by someone who doesn't speak English.
Somebody's going to hurt themselves on this stupid machine.
Nobody's going to hurt themselves.
Would you mind taking your shoes off please?
Hey you talked to that little brother right?
Hm... he's autistic.
I had a hard time getting through but he, he's actually amazingly focused on his own thing.
You know I have a cousin who's autistic.
Oh yeah?
Yeah my uncle Eric on my mother's side; he married a woman with a lovely little daughter named Eva.
You could name any date in history and she would tell you what day of the week it fell on.
It was sweet but kind of creepy.
I was inside the kid's mind for a few seconds;
it was amazing 'cause it's like he was living inside his train set.
Yeah it sounds like Eva, the way she would find a safe place in her own mind.
Listen to this...
Do you know any other notes?
Do you have any good news for me?
None, not on the home front.
It seems Fyodor and Dmitri are like any father and son; a few spats here and there but nothing out of the ordinary.
What about Yuri?
Same and Paval's virtually catatonic so that all but eliminates him.
Do you think Katja's involved?
Here's the thing; there is nothing indicating she even exists.
An illegal immigrant.
Yeah and oh, turns out the Consulate General is quite the entrepreneur.
I love it when you dish.
One of his companies is a talent agency specializing in Russian models.
Katja was a model.
You have no interest in visiting Russian models, do you Dev?
I would like to visit Russian models.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
It's alright to smile...
You were asking about?
Fyodor Valkov.
Terrible news; he was one of my investors.
He didn't own it outright?
No, no, no, it was partnership.
He supplied the capital, I found the talent.
This talent, they all come from Russia?
There is an unlimited pool of beautiful young women there.
Tatyana, Tatyana, keep smiling.
And all your women, they all have visas and work permits?
I can only assume sir.
...you have lovely cheekbones.
I also have a lovely badge.
How involved was Mr. Volkov with the talent?
Well there's no secret Fyodor had an eye for the ladies.
In fact he took one of them away from me and gave her a job; something she was good for.
What was this woman's name?
Katja Renyeska.
Don't, don't say it.
That's what you saw;
synapses firing with nothing to stop him... sensory overload.
That's acute autism.
Oz was just telling me about his has this autistic cousin and she takes comfort in creating order.
Mhmm.
Those kids, they find their refuges.
Problem is they're wired to keep the rest of the world out.
So all I have to do is find a way into this boy's world.
Mhmm, just don't underestimate how difficult that is.
I never do.
Right.
I'm vibrating.
Yeah, so am I.
I should probably look at this.
I have to take this.
Hello?
Sgt. McCluskey.
Hey, I got another job for you.
What have you got?
I need to know exactly what the relationship between Fyodor and Katja was.
You think you can come up with a reason to go talk to her again?
Yeah, I think I can come up with something.
Hey, hi.
Hi.
I just, I was wondering how Paval's doing.
He is fine, under the circumstances.
Right I feel bad about yesterday.
It's okay.
I uhm...
I brought him a little something.
Hope I can make it up to him.
Come in, you can give it to him yourself.
Ah, thank you.
Hey.
It's Toby, remember me?
I brought you a...
I brought you some figures, some policemen.
I thought maybe I'd put them here.
This is Michelle.
Remember Michelle?
I'm going to pop her right here.
And this is me, your buddy.
I'm going to put myself right there.
♪]
Who's this?
Who's the Station master?
It's you...
Whoa, that's cool.
Who's underground?
Is that your father?
Why is your father...?
It's okay.
Hey...
Dmitri I know what it's like to have a volatile relationship with a father.
I can tell that you really loved him.
What would he want you to do right now?
He would want me to accept responsibility for what
I have done and I have.
Forensics found smudge marks beneath your fingerprints on the murder weapon.
You wiped it down before you handled it.
Why would you do that unless you were trying...
The cleaning lady must have wiped it down.
See, I just find this very odd.
Here I am offering you an out and you're not taking it.
Dimitri perhaps...
English.
My client stands by his previous statement.
Then I guess this interview is over.
No, not yet.
Tell me about Miranov Talent.
Never heard of it.
Really?
Your father was an investor in it.
Our father had many investments.
Well this one was special;
it is where he met Katja.
And isn't it true that his interest in her was beyond simply being Paval's nanny?
Wait a minute, Katja had nothing to do with this.
I said I was guilty; why would I lie about that?
You tell me.
I think it's enough for today.
His train set means everything to him.
Fyodor loved watching him play.
So his father was around a lot.
Not a lot but he would check with me on the phone almost every day.
So you and Fyodor were close?
You're a beautiful woman, was there...?
He was my employer.
Well, I should get going.
Thank you for letting me see him.
Hey Paval, thank you, bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Katja and Dmitri were lovers.
That certainly explains a lot.
He has every reason to protect her... he has diplomatic immunity and she doesn't.
So we're looking at a love triangle...
Right, which always ends well.
Okay Fyodor finds out about Dmitri, argues with
Katja, she hits him, panics, calls Dmitri for help.
He arrives, he sees what's happened and he acts fast.
Comes over, wipes down the murder weapon and calls the police.
Too bad we don't have one sliver of evidence.
I actually have to get back to my day job.
Thank you.
I'm putting together a timeline on Katja on the day of the killing;
I think you might find it interesting.
So where were you the night of the murder?
You picked up Paval at his school and according to his teacher you were taking him to visit his father?
So were you at Fyodor's house?
All right, we were there.
I dropped him home at six, I picked him up at nine, the same as every week.
And when you came to pick him up did you actually see Fyodor?
Yeah, of course.
He seemed a little troubled but, other than that he was fine.
That was at, um, nine...?
Yeah.
The Coroner said that he died no later than 8:30.
Well the Coroner is obviously wrong.
We checked with Immigration Canada, we know you are here illegally and we know you're lying.
You have a chance to help yourself out if you just tell us the truth.
Listen, I've told you everything I know.
So to be clear the Coroner's reports aren't in, right?
No.
That was good.
You're in charge of lying from now on.
So this is our prank victim.
Yeah, you know it's just flesh wounds.
A little superglue, toilet and genius.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you just going to leave me here?
We'll get you bed okay, just keep a lid on it...
You need a bed.
Yeah.
Wow.
Must have been some party.
This is kind of like really embarrassing.
Don't let it tank your whole college experience, okay.
So how do they get this off?
It's like a Brazilian but for your butt.
I got to take this...
You are being so brave.
Hey what's up?
So it turns out Paval was watching a movie with his father the night of the murder.
We're going to bring Katja in for questioning.
Can you meet me at IIB?
Yeah sure.
Do you think she knows something?
Yeah, and we need to see what that is.
All right.
This thing supposed to be sinking?
Hang on a second;
I got it.
Oh, oh man.
You all right?
Oh.. are you all right?
My back...
My back, my back.
You all right?
What did you do man?
I didn't do anything.
Touched the button?
No.
Come on, this thing...
I know, I know.
Come on...
Guys...
The nurse will be right with you....
Guys!
Hello?
Just touch here if you can hear me.
All right, I'm ready.
Got yourself in a bit of a spot here Katja;
you know that don't you?
Yes.
We know that Fyodor was in love with you.
Was he upset about your relationship with Dmitri?
Did you two argue about that?
No!
There were feelings between us but a different kind.
Dmitri was the one who I fell in love with and even then me and Fyodor, we never fought, never.
Besides he knew that I'm good for Paval.
If you cared about Fyodor at all why don't you just help us get to the bottom of this?
What happened on the night of the murder?
Fyodor, Fyodor...
I think she found the body.
He was already dead when you found him, wasn't he?
He was laying there, blood everywhere.
And what happened?
Oh my God!
She may have called Dmitri to come over.
We've checked Dmitri's phone records.
He received a call from Fyodor's that night.
That was you calling him, wasn't it?
Wasn't it?
He came over and helped you clean up.
How did he get cut?
He made me do it to him so it would look like they fought.
So who actually killed Fyodor?
It was Paval.
Katja, it was Paval wasn't it?
He didn't know what he was doing, I'm sure of it.
No way!
The kid?
Yeah.
No wonder Dmitri took the rap for him.
He'd do anything to protect him, but I just don't buy it.
Are you going to be able to make it up the stairs?
Yeah, I'm good, I'm golden, come on.
So did your uncle every get through to your autistic cousin?
Yeah, actually he bought her this universal calendar, put it up on her wall and it kind of became this thing they shared, you know, like a common ground.
Common ground.
Mr. Bay did you hurt your back?
Yes sir, a little bit.
Then why haven't you filled out a 5B or a 7D?
Oh well I don't think that's necessary.
It's nonsense.
Get down here.
Okay.
Okay we'll try your theory that there was someone else in the room besides Paval.
Let's hope this works.
Hi Paval, it's Toby.
I know everything must be really strange right now but I'm going to help you.
I know how much you love your train set... couldn't bring everything but I brought you a few things.
This is a tree.
This is a park bench.
Just like in your train set.
Now this is you.
You can turn the bench.
And you're going to be joined by your father.
It's okay, it's all right.
You guys are watching television just like on movie night.
The last time you were watching television someone came by, didn't they?
It's okay Paval, it's okay because this is me.
Look, this is me.
The person who came, they hurt your father.
What is it Paval?
Look up at them.
It's okay.
Who hurt your father?
Okay.
I'll get rid of him.
It's okay, it's safe.
Good work.
There's absolutely nothing that connects Yuri to the murder.
That's it, see something's bugging me about my reads.
I think that the statue might have been wiped down twice.
And you have the cloth that Dmitri used.
Yeah we collected it as evidence.
Yuri used another cloth.
You find that cloth and you connect Yuri to the whole thing.
Hey guys, I think I got something.
Get this...
I cross-referenced our good friend Yuri with our case and I got a hit.
Connecting the dots... two years ago, Yuri represented a Sasha Miranov in a case of living off the avails of prostitution.
Small world.
Very.
And you don't believe in coincidence.
No, but I believe in proof.
And what do we have here;
we have an eyewitness who doesn't communicate with the world and you... no offense.
So given the circumstances we, like you, want what's best for Paval.
You can claim Diplomatic immunity for him or he can face trial here.
The crown says they won't pursue jail time.
So he'd be institutionalized.
Yeah.
But, we have some great institutions here in Canada...
I think that would be preferable.
Dmitri and I would be able to visit him.
Great.
Thank you for your help.
Any time.
Hey Sarge, want to go claw fishing?
Mr. Volkov.
Sgt. McCluskey.
You know there are rare days when a Mountie gets her man and wishes she hadn't.
This is one of them.
I appreciate that.
There's just one little problem I'm having.
What's that?
When forensics examined the statue for trace evidence, two different fibers were found... two different cloths.
Someone wiped it down before Dmitri.
What are you implying?
Whoever killed Fyodor tried to frame Paval.
Don't worry...
our entire team is on it.
We will find him.
Well this is most unexpected but it gives me hope.
Thank you Sergeant.
You get anything?
Yeah...
Hello Mr. Volkov.
You have news already?
We do.
We found that cloth and preliminary forensics has linked it to you.
Preliminary forensics...
so you have nothing.
Why would I harm the father I loved?
Hmm?
Now if you'll excuse me.
Sasha Miranov had a scheme to bring girls into the country.
He offered to cut you in for a lot... that sound familiar?
I was his lawyer, it was legitimate.
Investments.
Yeah but you didn't have any money.
Bank records show that you were poaching off your father's account.
I'm guessing he didn't like that.
You two argued, one thing led to another...
Look if there are inquires I will face them in my country.
Are you sure?
You might be a lot better off in a nice safe Canadian prison.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
It was an accident.
I didn't do anything criminal.
You killed your father and tried to frame your autistic brother.
You want to tell me why that's okay?
Come on.
Here I'll take that.
Oh wait, what's going on with the slug?
It failed its field test on a number of issues, but the biggest one here was Mr. Bay injuring his back.
Well I mean back injuries were the whole point of testing these things in the first place, am I right?
Ah, oh, still go the spasms?
Yeah, but they're getting better sir.
Now always remember, lift with your legs.
Yes, absolutely.
I'll remember that sir.
Safety first.
Oh, ah!
Us one, slug zero.
You were faking.
Well something had to be done; that thing was a menace.
I'm sorry to take advantage of our little arrangement but I did what was necessary.
No, no, what was necessary...
me waiting on you hand and foot.
Well, you know, I had to stay in character.
It's not like I asked you to give me a sponge bath or anything.
No, I got other things to do.
What?
What do you have to do?
I've got these other friends, who need me.
Fine, go... go to your other friends and...
See you later buddy.
So how is your citizenship application going?
So far, so good.
Good, you'll get it.
Look guys, more help.
Hello Toby.
A little gift for Paval.
By all means.
I brought you something.
You remember this?
You gotta remember your father just like that
Paval, only like this.
Thank you.
The music that she was making, it turned everything into this incredible light show.
You sure you weren't just at the Planetarium?
Maybe it was synesthesia this really interesting mental condition a lot of geniuses have.
Oh yeah it's where like one sense crosses over into another.
Mhm, except she would see music, as opposed to hearing it.
Like is she going to hear a Van Gogh or see a Jay-Z tune...
kind of genius really.
This not so much;
she forgot her bow.
Yeah, right, that's uhm... that's one way to put it.
911 what is the nature of your emergency?
My name is Dmitri Volkov, I have just killed my father.
Is that medieval, is that baroque or gothic?
Somebody got killed with a silver bullet I'm hearing.
That's like a werewolf.
- That's not vampires?
- No, it's a werewolf.
You know what you're talking about or are you making it up?
Do you know any vampires?
Personally?
Yeah.
Not since high school.
Okay now see, now the wheels won't come down.
Tell me why they need to replace the old stretchers.
You want state-of-the-art you pay the price.
Come on.
Oh sure, it works for you.
We hate this thing.
Hey, where's the victim?
In the living room.
Got a deceased in there as well; coroner's just declared.
Oh nice place.
Belongs to the Russian Consul General.
He's lying on the floor inside with his head caved in.
Right here is the injured guy.
You really need to take off these cuffs.
I don't know if that's a good idea.
I don't think he'll give you any trouble.
Detective, we'll be taking over from here.
That's it?
You just take my case?
Yeah, it's not a problem is it?
You kidding?
We love coming to crime scenes and just leaving.
Do you have any idea the amount of paperwork a case like this is going to generate?
Always looking out for us.
Thanks Michelle...
Good luck.
Get the cuffs off.
That's a nice looking uniform you got there.
Gallery opening.
I'm going to take his pressure in the rig.
All right, just going to walk him out?
Yeah.
With the stretcher?
Yeah.
- Let's get him out of here.
- All right.
So IIB gets called in on a political hot potato and you lose your night off.
Yeah, pretty much...
lucky for me this seems pretty open and shut, right Mr. Volkov?
He tried to kill me.
I had no choice.
Okay.
Is there anyone else here?
Not according to new reports.
I think you open and shut case is about to get a lot more complicated.
Alright there Mr. Volkov
Watch your feet there, okay.
Now he's all yours officer.
All right.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
There's no one to take care of Paval he's alone...
Dev?
Yeah.
What do you have on the deceased?
Fyodor Volkov entered the diplomatic service in 1975... 1985 to '88 he was with the Embassy in Ottawa.
He transferred to Toronto as the Deputy Minister of
Foreign Affairs, and get this...three years ago?
He was named the Consul General.
Are you hungry?
I'd really kill for like some avacados and banana fosters.
What are you like pregnant?
What about the son?
Dmitri Volkov.
He´s 27, he was born in Russia, raised in Toronto and he's a accountant executive at a Bay Street brokerage firm.
No priors, not even a little toe over the line this guy.
Any previous domestic trouble?
No, nothing in the file but who's to say some strings haven't been pulled.
It's about Mexican.
Yeah, I'll meet you.
Wait a sec...
I did a little reading on Dmitri... so far all I got is he keeps saying something about this guy named Paval.
Any idea of age?
I can stir him up...
I know, I'm still not used to getting my information from someone who wasn't even there.
Got to park right here.
Dmitri why did you attack your father?
I told him to stay out of my life.
And why did you want him to stay out of your life?
Because he was become the father who would attack his son with a letter opener.
Okay look I won't insult your intelligence as long as you don't insult mine.
We know that there was someone else in that house besides you and your father.
I have no idea what you are talking about.
There's someone at the desk saying he is Mr. Volkov's lawyer.
Oh.
Did you get anything?
Yeah I saw the Dmitri wiping down a statue.
Why would he wipe down the murder weapon and then call and confess?
Well maybe he was trying to protect the person who really used it.
Listen I gotta get back.
Thanks.
Sgt. McCluskey IIB, you must be Mr. Volkov's attorney.
I'm also his brother.
You're...
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
You can't imagine how difficult this is, not only for me, for all of us.
Our father he was an extraordinary man.
Is Dmitri all right?
Yeah he's fine under the circumstances.
I want to see for myself.
Have you been questioning him?
With his consent.
I'm sure you were most professional but he was not fit to be interviewed given what has occurred.
I disagree.
Further his counsel was not present for your questioning and finally as a Russian citizen and a son of a Diplomat he has...
Diplomatic immunity.
Yeah that's the first thing we looked into.
I should warn you though, we may contest that.
You say we just watch him, we get on a plane and fly back to Russia.
The Russians want him on a plane,
Ottawa wants him on a plane.
Why don't you want him on a plane?
Last I heard there was a great court system in Moscow.
You remember the Russian diplomat in the fatal hit and run back in Ottawa?
I know where you're going with this.
He claimed diplomatic, went back home and skated on it.
I'm not going to let that happen.
This is murder;
the guy confessed.
He's not going to skate.
You don't know that.
Listen, this is a done deal, so unless you know something I don't know you know something I don't know?
I think there might have been someone else involved.
A partner or someone he was covering for, I'm not sure yet.
Based on?
Cop's sense.
Oh what judge wouldn't buy that.
I'm just asking if we can hold on to him for a few days while we check this out.
Michelle there are two Ministers coming in from
Ottawa this morning and they got he entire staff on red alert.
And I know how much you love a challenge.
I have complete faith in you.
I have a love/hate relationship with you... mostly hate.
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.
Absolutely.
Mom, mom, can you just....?
Hold on, hold on.
Oh so it turns out to true, there's two brothers okay.
The lawyer friend that we know, Yuri and also another who goes by the name of Paval.
Yeah.
I got to tell you right now, this thing is not... is not reliable.
Why can't we just say thanks but no thanks.
There's been uptake in back injury claims over the last year so like it or not we're stuck with it.
It works when you do it, great.
All right, so the manual says that it's idiot proof, so who would like to test it out?
Anyone like to volunteer?
Any one at all?
Yeah, I'd love to, yeah I'll do it, sure, great.
All right.
Way to take one for the team Mr. Bay.
Yea, for the team.
I'm not covering anyone's shift for a month, thank you very much.
Hi...
Hey, what time do you get off?
I got off in about ten minutes, why?
We found Paval.
Really?
you want me to listen in on the interview?
Yeah if you can get away.
Hey officer, it slunk.
Yeah, I think I'll have no problem.
Do you want to wait a minute?
- Sure.
- Cool.
It's a nice place.
Yeah, it's Dmitri's, Paval lives here with his brother.
How can I help you?
Sgt. McCluskey, IIB.
This is Toby Logan.
Can we have a word?
Uhm, please come in.
It's about Dmitri isn't it?
Yes it is, Ms...
Uhm...
Renyeska,
Yekaterina Renyeska, but you call me Katja.
So what's your connection to the family?
Are you a relative?
Uhm...
No...
I look after Paval.
Paval suffers from a severe form of autism.
Autism, really.
Can we speak with him?
What about?
His brother.
Of course but I'm sure you're not going to hear anything from him.
Okay thank you.
Ms. Ra...
Ray...
Renyeska, Sgt. McCluskey.
Thank you.
Have there been any arguments between Dmitri and his father?
No, none!
That is what's so odd.
This is you?
Yeah.
You're very photogenic.
Thank you, I used to model.
Now you're a fulltime nanny?
Well it's a fulltime job to look after Paval.
Hey Paval.
Hi.
I'm Toby.
This is a really amazing train set.
Did you build this?
Wow, look at all your people.
That's very cool.
Who's this here?
Huh, huh, huh...
It's okay.
Paval it's okay.
That's Dmitri and Yuri, the picture was taken back in Russia.
Fyodor and...
Their mother.
She died soon after the picture.
And Paval?
Born to another woman, Canadian woman.
She left.
Autistic boy was too much for her so he goes to a special school and I look after him the rest of the time.
Where were you last night?
- With Paval.
- Here?
Yeah.
Why doesn't he live with his father?
He was travelling so much he couldn't take good care of him, that's why he lives with us.
Hey, hey, Paval it's okay.
Hey, it's okay... no.
Paval!
Are you okay?
Oh my God, what did you do to him?
I just touched him on the knee and he freaked out.
He cannot stand to be touched.
I'm sorry.
I think you need to leave now.
Sorry.
Paval...
Slide gusset collar to release auto lock.
Do not place unnecessary fingers into hinge mechanism.
It sounds like it was translated from another language by someone who doesn't speak English.
Somebody's going to hurt themselves on this stupid machine.
Nobody's going to hurt themselves.
Would you mind taking your shoes off please?
Hey you talked to that little brother right?
Hm... he's autistic.
I had a hard time getting through but he, he's actually amazingly focused on his own thing.
You know I have a cousin who's autistic.
Oh yeah?
Yeah my uncle Eric on my mother's side; he married a woman with a lovely little daughter named Eva.
You could name any date in history and she would tell you what day of the week it fell on.
It was sweet but kind of creepy.
I was inside the kid's mind for a few seconds;
it was amazing 'cause it's like he was living inside his train set.
Yeah it sounds like Eva, the way she would find a safe place in her own mind.
Listen to this...
Do you know any other notes?
Do you have any good news for me?
None, not on the home front.
It seems Fyodor and Dmitri are like any father and son; a few spats here and there but nothing out of the ordinary.
What about Yuri?
Same and Paval's virtually catatonic so that all but eliminates him.
Do you think Katja's involved?
Here's the thing; there is nothing indicating she even exists.
An illegal immigrant.
Yeah and oh, turns out the Consulate General is quite the entrepreneur.
I love it when you dish.
One of his companies is a talent agency specializing in Russian models.
Katja was a model.
You have no interest in visiting Russian models, do you Dev?
I would like to visit Russian models.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
It's alright to smile...
You were asking about?
Fyodor Valkov.
Terrible news; he was one of my investors.
He didn't own it outright?
No, no, no, it was partnership.
He supplied the capital, I found the talent.
This talent, they all come from Russia?
There is an unlimited pool of beautiful young women there.
Tatyana, Tatyana, keep smiling.
And all your women, they all have visas and work permits?
I can only assume sir.
...you have lovely cheekbones.
I also have a lovely badge.
How involved was Mr. Volkov with the talent?
Well there's no secret Fyodor had an eye for the ladies.
In fact he took one of them away from me and gave her a job; something she was good for.
What was this woman's name?
Katja Renyeska.
Don't, don't say it.
That's what you saw;
synapses firing with nothing to stop him... sensory overload.
That's acute autism.
Oz was just telling me about his has this autistic cousin and she takes comfort in creating order.
Mhmm.
Those kids, they find their refuges.
Problem is they're wired to keep the rest of the world out.
So all I have to do is find a way into this boy's world.
Mhmm, just don't underestimate how difficult that is.
I never do.
Right.
I'm vibrating.
Yeah, so am I.
I should probably look at this.
I have to take this.
Hello?
Sgt. McCluskey.
Hey, I got another job for you.
What have you got?
I need to know exactly what the relationship between Fyodor and Katja was.
You think you can come up with a reason to go talk to her again?
Yeah, I think I can come up with something.
Hey, hi.
Hi.
I just, I was wondering how Paval's doing.
He is fine, under the circumstances.
Right I feel bad about yesterday.
It's okay.
I uhm...
I brought him a little something.
Hope I can make it up to him.
Come in, you can give it to him yourself.
Ah, thank you.
Hey.
It's Toby, remember me?
I brought you a...
I brought you some figures, some policemen.
I thought maybe I'd put them here.
This is Michelle.
Remember Michelle?
I'm going to pop her right here.
And this is me, your buddy.
I'm going to put myself right there.
♪]
Who's this?
Who's the Station master?
It's you...
Whoa, that's cool.
Who's underground?
Is that your father?
Why is your father...?
It's okay.
Hey...
Dmitri I know what it's like to have a volatile relationship with a father.
I can tell that you really loved him.
What would he want you to do right now?
He would want me to accept responsibility for what
I have done and I have.
Forensics found smudge marks beneath your fingerprints on the murder weapon.
You wiped it down before you handled it.
Why would you do that unless you were trying...
The cleaning lady must have wiped it down.
See, I just find this very odd.
Here I am offering you an out and you're not taking it.
Dimitri perhaps...
English.
My client stands by his previous statement.
Then I guess this interview is over.
No, not yet.
Tell me about Miranov Talent.
Never heard of it.
Really?
Your father was an investor in it.
Our father had many investments.
Well this one was special;
it is where he met Katja.
And isn't it true that his interest in her was beyond simply being Paval's nanny?
Wait a minute, Katja had nothing to do with this.
I said I was guilty; why would I lie about that?
You tell me.
I think it's enough for today.
His train set means everything to him.
Fyodor loved watching him play.
So his father was around a lot.
Not a lot but he would check with me on the phone almost every day.
So you and Fyodor were close?
You're a beautiful woman, was there...?
He was my employer.
Well, I should get going.
Thank you for letting me see him.
Hey Paval, thank you, bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Katja and Dmitri were lovers.
That certainly explains a lot.
He has every reason to protect her... he has diplomatic immunity and she doesn't.
So we're looking at a love triangle...
Right, which always ends well.
Okay Fyodor finds out about Dmitri, argues with
Katja, she hits him, panics, calls Dmitri for help.
He arrives, he sees what's happened and he acts fast.
Comes over, wipes down the murder weapon and calls the police.
Too bad we don't have one sliver of evidence.
I actually have to get back to my day job.
Thank you.
I'm putting together a timeline on Katja on the day of the killing;
I think you might find it interesting.
So where were you the night of the murder?
You picked up Paval at his school and according to his teacher you were taking him to visit his father?
So were you at Fyodor's house?
All right, we were there.
I dropped him home at six, I picked him up at nine, the same as every week.
And when you came to pick him up did you actually see Fyodor?
Yeah, of course.
He seemed a little troubled but, other than that he was fine.
That was at, um, nine...?
Yeah.
The Coroner said that he died no later than 8:30.
Well the Coroner is obviously wrong.
We checked with Immigration Canada, we know you are here illegally and we know you're lying.
You have a chance to help yourself out if you just tell us the truth.
Listen, I've told you everything I know.
So to be clear the Coroner's reports aren't in, right?
No.
That was good.
You're in charge of lying from now on.
So this is our prank victim.
Yeah, you know it's just flesh wounds.
A little superglue, toilet and genius.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you just going to leave me here?
We'll get you bed okay, just keep a lid on it...
You need a bed.
Yeah.
Wow.
Must have been some party.
This is kind of like really embarrassing.
Don't let it tank your whole college experience, okay.
So how do they get this off?
It's like a Brazilian but for your butt.
I got to take this...
You are being so brave.
Hey what's up?
So it turns out Paval was watching a movie with his father the night of the murder.
We're going to bring Katja in for questioning.
Can you meet me at IIB?
Yeah sure.
Do you think she knows something?
Yeah, and we need to see what that is.
All right.
This thing supposed to be sinking?
Hang on a second;
I got it.
Oh, oh man.
You all right?
Oh.. are you all right?
My back...
My back, my back.
You all right?
What did you do man?
I didn't do anything.
Touched the button?
No.
Come on, this thing...
I know, I know.
Come on...
Guys...
The nurse will be right with you....
Guys!
Hello?
Just touch here if you can hear me.
All right, I'm ready.
Got yourself in a bit of a spot here Katja;
you know that don't you?
Yes.
We know that Fyodor was in love with you.
Was he upset about your relationship with Dmitri?
Did you two argue about that?
No!
There were feelings between us but a different kind.
Dmitri was the one who I fell in love with and even then me and Fyodor, we never fought, never.
Besides he knew that I'm good for Paval.
If you cared about Fyodor at all why don't you just help us get to the bottom of this?
What happened on the night of the murder?
Fyodor, Fyodor...
I think she found the body.
He was already dead when you found him, wasn't he?
He was laying there, blood everywhere.
And what happened?
Oh my God!
She may have called Dmitri to come over.
We've checked Dmitri's phone records.
He received a call from Fyodor's that night.
That was you calling him, wasn't it?
Wasn't it?
He came over and helped you clean up.
How did he get cut?
He made me do it to him so it would look like they fought.
So who actually killed Fyodor?
It was Paval.
Katja, it was Paval wasn't it?
He didn't know what he was doing, I'm sure of it.
No way!
The kid?
Yeah.
No wonder Dmitri took the rap for him.
He'd do anything to protect him, but I just don't buy it.
Are you going to be able to make it up the stairs?
Yeah, I'm good, I'm golden, come on.
So did your uncle every get through to your autistic cousin?
Yeah, actually he bought her this universal calendar, put it up on her wall and it kind of became this thing they shared, you know, like a common ground.
Common ground.
Mr. Bay did you hurt your back?
Yes sir, a little bit.
Then why haven't you filled out a 5B or a 7D?
Oh well I don't think that's necessary.
It's nonsense.
Get down here.
Okay.
Okay we'll try your theory that there was someone else in the room besides Paval.
Let's hope this works.
Hi Paval, it's Toby.
I know everything must be really strange right now but I'm going to help you.
I know how much you love your train set... couldn't bring everything but I brought you a few things.
This is a tree.
This is a park bench.
Just like in your train set.
Now this is you.
You can turn the bench.
And you're going to be joined by your father.
It's okay, it's all right.
You guys are watching television just like on movie night.
The last time you were watching television someone came by, didn't they?
It's okay Paval, it's okay because this is me.
Look, this is me.
The person who came, they hurt your father.
What is it Paval?
Look up at them.
It's okay.
Who hurt your father?
Okay.
I'll get rid of him.
It's okay, it's safe.
Good work.
There's absolutely nothing that connects Yuri to the murder.
That's it, see something's bugging me about my reads.
I think that the statue might have been wiped down twice.
And you have the cloth that Dmitri used.
Yeah we collected it as evidence.
Yuri used another cloth.
You find that cloth and you connect Yuri to the whole thing.
Hey guys, I think I got something.
Get this...
I cross-referenced our good friend Yuri with our case and I got a hit.
Connecting the dots... two years ago, Yuri represented a Sasha Miranov in a case of living off the avails of prostitution.
Small world.
Very.
And you don't believe in coincidence.
No, but I believe in proof.
And what do we have here;
we have an eyewitness who doesn't communicate with the world and you... no offense.
So given the circumstances we, like you, want what's best for Paval.
You can claim Diplomatic immunity for him or he can face trial here.
The crown says they won't pursue jail time.
So he'd be institutionalized.
Yeah.
But, we have some great institutions here in Canada...
I think that would be preferable.
Dmitri and I would be able to visit him.
Great.
Thank you for your help.
Any time.
Hey Sarge, want to go claw fishing?
Mr. Volkov.
Sgt. McCluskey.
You know there are rare days when a Mountie gets her man and wishes she hadn't.
This is one of them.
I appreciate that.
There's just one little problem I'm having.
What's that?
When forensics examined the statue for trace evidence, two different fibers were found... two different cloths.
Someone wiped it down before Dmitri.
What are you implying?
Whoever killed Fyodor tried to frame Paval.
Don't worry...
our entire team is on it.
We will find him.
Well this is most unexpected but it gives me hope.
Thank you Sergeant.
You get anything?
Yeah...
Hello Mr. Volkov.
You have news already?
We do.
We found that cloth and preliminary forensics has linked it to you.
Preliminary forensics...
so you have nothing.
Why would I harm the father I loved?
Hmm?
Now if you'll excuse me.
Sasha Miranov had a scheme to bring girls into the country.
He offered to cut you in for a lot... that sound familiar?
I was his lawyer, it was legitimate.
Investments.
Yeah but you didn't have any money.
Bank records show that you were poaching off your father's account.
I'm guessing he didn't like that.
You two argued, one thing led to another...
Look if there are inquires I will face them in my country.
Are you sure?
You might be a lot better off in a nice safe Canadian prison.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
It was an accident.
I didn't do anything criminal.
You killed your father and tried to frame your autistic brother.
You want to tell me why that's okay?
Come on.
Here I'll take that.
Oh wait, what's going on with the slug?
It failed its field test on a number of issues, but the biggest one here was Mr. Bay injuring his back.
Well I mean back injuries were the whole point of testing these things in the first place, am I right?
Ah, oh, still go the spasms?
Yeah, but they're getting better sir.
Now always remember, lift with your legs.
Yes, absolutely.
I'll remember that sir.
Safety first.
Oh, ah!
Us one, slug zero.
You were faking.
Well something had to be done; that thing was a menace.
I'm sorry to take advantage of our little arrangement but I did what was necessary.
No, no, what was necessary...
me waiting on you hand and foot.
Well, you know, I had to stay in character.
It's not like I asked you to give me a sponge bath or anything.
No, I got other things to do.
What?
What do you have to do?
I've got these other friends, who need me.
Fine, go... go to your other friends and...
See you later buddy.
So how is your citizenship application going?
So far, so good.
Good, you'll get it.
Look guys, more help.
Hello Toby.
A little gift for Paval.
By all means.
I brought you something.
You remember this?
You gotta remember your father just like that
Paval, only like this.
Thank you.
Beautiful, it's really beautiful.
A very beautiful season.
It is the season of love.
There are beautiful cuisines.
-=Can a man be recycled?
=-
There is also Alex's gift, the love candles, for tonight.
Love candles, use them with Motorcyle.
It'll be very romantic.
We've always been very romantic even without using these.
Thank you!
This is really a romantic night.
I'm late, but you'll definitely forgive me!
Chateau de la Perriere.
(Well-known French red wine)
Look, another bottle.
How much was that?
Don't ask about the price.
You will faint after hearing it.
Hyeon Ju?
She spent the entire hour looking for a beautiful form, rearranging this and that on the plate.
The food will end up tasting like her.
You're here already.
A juicy baked silver carp with Hollandaise sauce... 10 more minutes.
What a pity.
If only it was a man was here, then it would be perfect.
It is even better without a man.
Am I right?
Of course.
Is everyone prepared for the pajamas party?
To celebrate Seon U In Yeong's separation!
I wish Seon U In Yeong all the best for her newfound freedom!
All men, wait for me.
I'll passionately embrace you all, cheers!
This scene shows the pajamas party that marked the end of my 10 years of love with that man.
It feels so good to drink wine.
It's better without Kim Seong Su.
There are more than a few benefits.
Previously, I wasn't aware that my bed was so big and comfortable.
Previously, I wasn't aware that my bed was so big and comfortable.
When I would almost fall asleep,
Kim Seong Su would just show up and I would have to wash.
Brush my teeth again.
Put on my nightgown...
It has to be sexy.
I knew it...
Do you know what the best part is?
Before I've only managed to read 5 books in a month.
But now, I've finished reading 5 books within a week.
During my relationship with Kim Seong Su, if I had fully utilized my potential then,
I would have already become the CEO of a hotel.
Hey, is that an age spot under your eye?
What?
I have an age spot?
Really?
I don't think so.
You have to manage yourself well.
Or you'll be sorry.
You never know when you might bump into Kim Seong Su.
It's true.
When you break up with a man, do you know what is the most embarrassing is?
He is still handsome, but you are hopelessly aging.
That's right.
Remember Park Jung En?
The guy I dated in college?
Even after we broke up,
I never forgot to put on mascara.
But since we have already broke up, do I still need to worry about him that much?
Hey silly.
It's because he isn't yours.
That's why you have to consider it more.
If he was yours, why would you bother?
No matter what he was yours already.
Aren't you upset?
I was so upset when I read at that news article.
Those two are dating.
Yun Kang Hui and him.
It wasn't for them to find happiness together.
That wasn't why I broke up with him.
I wanted him to experience some hardship after we broke up.
That's why I left him.
To let him really know what a great a woman I am.
I wanted him to be distraught.
That's why I broke up with him.
Director Kim, we heard that you were in a relationship with another woman before this.
Is this true?
She is my classmate from primary school.
Even now, we often keep in touch.
As far as I'm concerned, she is more like a sister than a friend.
I can even say who she is.
Seon U In Yeong, thank you for blessings us!
Let's get a closer picture of you 2.
Don't tell me he is going to do that!
I was originally a fan of Yun Kang Hui, but those two look very good together.
So I'll just step out quietly.
Congratulations to you both.
I saw both of them at the GVC theater.
Wow, this is the first time that I've seen a perfectly matched couple.
A strong couple.
Really, this is such a wonderful online world.
Recently, the weather has been good.
Are all the haters on vacation?
Well okay.
If it's like this, then I'll just write something.
Isn't the age difference between them too large.
Kim Seong Su, you bastard...
Where's your conscience!
?
Yun Kang Hui had breast implants.
It's a valley in there.
Such a noisy couple!
I don't think they'll last long.
I bet they won't even last 3 months.
It looks like you're very stressed.
You can't even give your blessing to a couple in love.
Go grab a mirror.
It?
s time to self-reflect, okay?
When I was in my 20s, I had never imagined that
I would become this 30 years-old person.
Are you all kidding me or what?
!
What exactly happened?
General Manager, I'm sorry.
Save your apologies, trainee manager.
Do you still intend to work here?
I called you on the phone yesterday and stressed this matter!
I didn't get the final confirmation.
If I had not came, then what were you going to do?
The president will be arriving in 10 minutes.
Do you want to see me write my resignation letter?
I will replace everything.
Since its already like this, we might as well try to replace what we can quickly.
Where is my phone?
Hello?
What?
I understand.
I'm hanging up.
15 minutes. 15 minutes!
Trainee Manager, I have 3 children.
Two of them haven't gone to college yet.
Later, wait and see, you're going to be dead.
Sunbae, what did I...
That room is for the president of Hyoyeom Electrical Company.
Change all the electrical appliances to the Hyoyeom brand.
TV, refrigerator, microwave oven, electric cooker, hair dryer, and...
We only have Hwangkim electrical appliances.
What should we do?
What should we do?
What are we going to do?
Yesterday, I saw Alex's room...
I'll do that.
The stereo system must be changed too, and I'll inform Manager Park.
Once I find the electric kettle, I'll go over there immediately.
15 minutes left, 15 minutes.
Alex, Alex, Alex!
Did something happen?
Hold on!
Hold on!
In Yeong, what's wrong?
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Alex, you're a hotel guest.
I'm on the staff here, right? But we are friends first, right?
We're friends.
I need that to make ramen.
What are you doing?
Alex, I need to borrow this for a while.
Hey, that's mine!
Not the hotel's...
Yes, I am Bae Seung Hyeon.
All has been prepared.
I understand.
He is in the elevator right now.
All of you, quickly leave, leave, quickly.
Kim Seong Su!
Right after breaking up with me, he came to the hotel with Yun Kang Hui!
Furthermore, it's the hotel where I work!
Both of you are going to die today.
Hey, don't you have a conscience?
He is not Kim Seong Su, and she is not Yun Kang Hui, either.
What are you doing?
I'm very sorry, guests.
I wish you all a pleasant time.
I'm sorry.
I'm going crazy.
-=Three days ago=-
Kim Seong Su.
-=Two days ago=-
That is Kim Seong Su.
-=This morning=-
That is Kim Seong Su.
Didn't I tell you this was very important?
I even drew 5 stars on it.
All appliances must be changed to his company's brand whenever he stays here.
I told you to discuss with the housekeeping's manager and buy those appliances that we don't have!
What exactly were you thinking?
Sunbae, you never informed me about that.
What do you mean I didn't tell you?
Seung Hyeon, do you still want to work here?
Yesterday, I clearly said here...
Have you had a sleepless nights recently?
Your eyes look bad.
Did something happen with Mr. Motorcycle?
This is melatonin.
A type of nutrient.
Take 2.
It can help you restore your body rhythm.
Take them.
I'm going out for a while.
Driver ajussi, your lips really look like Kim Seong Su's lips.
Even those hands look exactly like Kim Seong Su's hands.
I might as well just stare at the ground.
Those are Kim Seong Su's shoes.
I better close my eyes.
Then I won't see anything anymore.
Seong Su, long time no see!
Has anything happened?
Did you sell the car?
Sorry!
Sorry!
I really want to crash into the wall and die to end it all.
Wait for a minute.
Why do I have to die?
Why should I?
Those two are doing so well.
Why do I have to die?
I have to live well to show them.
Yes.
This is where Yun Kang Hui gets her hair done, right?
Please come this way.
I'm going bald, bald!
I don't have hair here.
There's a bald spot.
Have you heard of premature hair loss?
I am like this... because I am too stressed.
Now I have a hair loss problem!
I always have to apply this and take this medicine.
But luckily, you still have your bangs.
Recently, there have been a lot of attractive wigs, In Yeong.
Hey, can I get compensation for this?
Because of him I'm having this hair loss problem.
Compensation for the cost of buying these things and also for mental damages.
Can I do that?
What does this have to do with Seong Su?
For all the things he has done to me, there is no compensation?
Yes, I've endured a lot.
Even if he was in love with another person after breaking up with me, does he have to make so much noise about it?
The guy with no loyalty to others.
The guy with no courtesy to others.
No consideration of others at all.
Bad guy!
Love will change people.
He is on fire with Yun Kang Hui right now.
He is not thinking about you at the moment.
Hey, don't nag.
It's not attractive.
Pick yourself up.
What, am I being ugly?
Oh yes, you're getting married, whereas I broke up with my man.
This woman, omo!
Can't you keep your cool?
If I really go bald, you guys will never see me again.
Don't you regret it when I'm dead!
Bad girls!
That is the man who broke up with Seo Yeon 3 months ago.
Hey!
Hey!
Did you see?
What's going on?
It looks like she's going to birth soon, but he claimed it was sibling love.
That means when he broke up with you, that woman was already pregnant.
Was he cheating?
Or... he was a married man to start with!
Did you know about this before?
Wine... give me 1 glass, please.
Park Seo Yeon began to date at 14 years old.
Until now, she has never been infatuated with any man.
Although there have been numerous men before, normally Seo Yeon would wipe them off blindly.
But she actually thought about getting married to that man.
What was the reason he gave for breaking up with you?
He must go to Mongolia and find the Dalai Lama.
To not live life physically but rather to live life spiritually.
Right?
Right?
Three months ago, she broke up with that man.
But now, he is with a woman who is already 9 months pregnant.
We can tell right away the woman with him is his wife.
I want to be clear with all of you.
I did not think of marrying that man, ok?
Of course, we know that.
Just like that, we've once again confirmed that we are the best of friends.
But ultimately, a person suffers alone.
Why must it be a bald spot?
It's already 2 a.m. Another sleepless night for me.
Kim Seong Su gave me that clock.
Kim Seong Su bought this doll for me.
Kim Seong Su bought that guitar!
His razor, his toothbrush, and his clothes.
The doll he bought for me.
His skin lotions.
Right now I have no use for you.
But you will never know.
The world is very wide.
I am still young, and there are a plenty of men out there.
I can't lose hope.
You just wait and see.
We will definitely meet again.
That's right.
Throw everything out and start all over again!
Seon U In Yeong, fighting!
To tell you the truth I was very angry with you.
So I didn't want to come.
But I couldn't sleep.
I haven't been sleeping at all.
How could you easily say you wanted to break up?
Don't you regret it at all?
Can you let me sleep here tonight?
If you were by my side,
I feel like I would be able to sleep.
Didn't you want to break up with me?
You jerk!
Didn't you say the only thing left was a sense of obligation?
You bad guy!
Didn't you say you want to be with Yun Kang Hui?
Why should I care if you can sleep or not?
That night...the person who met again with an ex-boyfriend... was not only me.
Seo Yeon.
What is it?
I miss you, so I came to see you.
Didn't you see me enough at the wine bar?
I see those flower pots are still there.
Those are the potted flowers that we bought together at the nursery, right?
So?
I thought you had thrown those away.
Does your wife know what you're doing here?
Don't be too presumptuous.
Get lost.
If you're not gone in 5 minutes, I'm calling the police.
Seo Yeon, I have something to say to you.
Please, just for a moment.
So?
Why did you let him in?
Are you crazy?
!
He said his wife doesn't care.
They only got married because she was pregnant.
Come to your senses!
He already has a wife!
He is a married man!
He said he can't forget me.
Are you a bird brain?
How can you believe what he says?
At times like these don't you know I'll lose all rationality?
=That's why I called you on the phone.=
=Tell me.
I'll do what you say.=
At times like this, I'm driven by emotion.
Let me borrow your rational mind, okay?
What should I do?
Go into the room, and tell him get out immediately!
Get out now!
Did you hear me?
I told you to get out.
I said it already.
Did he leave?
Not yet.
He's just looking at me.
His clothes!
Throw all of his clothes outside!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Get out!
Get out!
Seo Yeon, Seo Yeon!
What's wrong!
?
It's over.
Thank you.
Seo Yeon felt relieved that everything had ended.
But that was not the case for Hyeon Ju.
She is becoming distressed wondering why she doesn't have a passionate moment like that.
Then she made a decision.
Change.
I need to make changes.
I can't just trust a man and wait for him.
I'll personally create the moment.
If the man won't come his own, then I'll just need to make him come over.
Dear, it's me.
What are you doing?
You haven't left the office yet?
That's great.
Do you want to come over to my place?
It's nothing.
I'm thinking about rearranging my place a little bit.
I can't move things by myself because they're too heavy.
I'm so tired!
My dear, help me just a little.
What?
You must work all night?
Morning then?
Can you come over in the morning?
Yes, if you stay up all night, you'll be too tired in the morning.
Then how about the afternoon?
Is the afternoon okay?
Really?
Okay, I understand.
It can't be helped then.
Keep up the good work.
Just a second.
Wait a moment.
Why is no one answering the phone?
I hurt my back and now I can't move.
Come over quickly.
I'm really busy right now.
I have been very busy as of late.
The house is in a mess because I have been working late.
For 10 years, Kim Seong Su has always cut my toenails.
Even though our heartbeats no longer race, both of us feel very comfortable with each other.
Isn't this another kind of love?
Thinking about it, I feel like things are actually very simple.
Hyeon Ju also got what she wished for, a moment of hotness.
Doctor, it's very hot.
Just endure it for a moment, okay?
And... doctor!
Yes, is this a moving company?
I would like to hire a few workers.
But that day was one of the busiest days of the year.
I would like to move a few things.
This is a moving company, right?
Send me a few workers, okay?
Just a few.
There's not even 1 person available?
Is there no one available at all?
I know, I know.
Today is fully booked.
I know there is no one.
Hyeon Ju called more than 50 moving companies but could not find even 1 worker.
-=Need a disposable man?
=-
Contact us immediately.
Good!
Again, move closer.
Good, really beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, great!
See here, good, good.
A disposable man?
They are willing to do anything for single women.
What do you mean by 'anything'?
For those times when we need a man to do things.
Let's say like changing a light bulb, curtains, installing a TV with a stereo.
I hear there's a grandmother who asked to have a bandage put on her back.
Did a grandmother want her back scratched?
But, he looked so handsome.
Hello, I'm from this Disposable Men's Club, Kim Deok Su.
I heard you need some items moved.
You need to organize this room here and inside that room a little bit.
Put that here.
This goes here and the books go on the second shelf.
Do you want me to get you a cup of coffee?
Well, I would be delighted to drink your coffee.
Excuse me, the coffee...
What do I do?
What do I do?
Where are you touching?
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Do I look okay to you?
What should I do?
Do you want me get you some ice?
Or burn ointment?
Plaster, plaster, will do.
Not good?
Ah, Kang Hyeon Ju, you're killing a good man.
Now I'm wishing that hot man is Kim Tae U.
Seo Yeon is coming.
The shooting went well?
After finishing here, let's go back together.
I must go back to the office to take care of something.
I'm going to the sauna.
So hateful!
I should have known the moment we came here.
She is always like that.
Jun Hui, aren't you tired working with her?
Of course I'm tired.
She is arrogant, eccentric, and impulsive.
No advantages at all?
No advantages at all.
I hate that type of women.
A selfish and an opinionated woman.
I'm leaving first.
What a temper!
Wasn't there a time that, even with a cold, Seo Yeon still had to take pictures in the water?
I know, right?
Hey, want to hang out here for a little longer?
No thanks.
Seo Yeon said she would give me the swimsuit she was just wearing.
My friends, I intend to volunteer for some environmental groups.
Look at these.
You can have one.
You too.
From now on, don't use plastic bags when grocery shopping.
Use this bag.
This eco-bag is very beautiful, right?
This is a mug.
This is a tumbler.
So pretty.
Do you know how much it costs to process disposable cups?
In the future, all of you have to start using recycled products.
The best thing is not to buy new things but to reuse.
I have an awesome reusable item these days.
- Really, what is that?
- A man.
Are you crazy?
You both broke up already.
Why did you do that?
Just a moment ago, didn't you ask us to support recycling?
Hey, it depends on what you recycle too.
Not just any man, but a man whose heart belongs to another woman.
In Yeong, back then when you were still with Kim Seong Su, didn't I say it already?
In my opinion, it was better for you to split up.
Why must you be with him again?
No, I think it doesn't matter.
No matter what, there are a lot of benefits to using recycled things.
We're able to protect the earth.
But recycling a man, what are the benefits?
There is no distinction between good and bad.
When it's good, it's good.
And also, the resources are quite limited.
There are not many men in this world that are up to my standards.
You give up on some, you take back some.
I think it's fine to have another go at an old relationship.
What's wrong?
This isn't like you at all!
?
Didn't you end the affair a few days ago?
He is a married man!
No matter what, recycling is very good.
Oh well.
We can go to the mall now.
Get rid of it.
Get rid of it.
You shouldn't recycle a used man.
You should get rid of it.
Do you understand?
Pay attention and listen to me carefully.
What Kang Hyeon Ju said is not necessarily true!
The responses are really good, aren't they?
Seong Su, you must be feeling happy.
The problem is that all the upcoming works are romantic comedies.
I like romantic comedies very much.
You don't like them?
How can there be a romance like that in the real world?
Everybody wants a romance like that.
Wouldn't it be nice to have one?
Let me go wash my hands.
It smells a bit like melon.
Did he go to see Yun Kang Hui?
Today at 11:36 a.m.,
Yun Kang Hui called him.
The call duration was 42 seconds.
Director, where are you right now?
I'm near the office.
Do you want to eat lunch together?
Forget it.
Why would I want to see you?
I'm very busy now.
Hang up.
No, last night we weren't together.
What to do?
Even though I saw you last night, I still miss you.
Me too.
Alright, do you want to have lunch together?
I'm at the front of the office.
Come out, okay?
This rice soup is really delicious.
Your skills are becoming better.
All this is because of you.
Since you don't like to eat outside, right?
I like eating at home together with you.
The kimchi is delicious.
Try it.
This tenderloin is also very delicious.
Try it.
Really delicious.
I also like the tenderloin too.
Today's sirloin steak is not that tasty.
Do you want to swap?
No it's fine.
This is also very delicious.
Thank you director.
Director, you have always been very attentive.
Yes, men who are kind to me will also be kind to other women.
Get rid of it.
You shouldn't recycle a used man.
You must throw him away.
Understand?
What's wrong?
Is the kimchi bad?
What?
No, no, it's delicious!
After we finish eating, let's go out.
I want to show you something.
What is it?
Is this really your car?
!
Your company gave you such a nice car.
It seems like you're really getting famous.
Could it be you thought that I'll be a bum and rely on you forever?
No!
I knew you would succeed eventually!
Wow, this car is really big!
Let's get going.
After driving around, I feel more carefree.
You go and wash up.
Don't mind about the dishes.
I'll do it.
Oh, my cell phone.
I think it's in the car.
I saw you holding it just now.
No need, no need, I'll go.
Just look at me.
I'm so excited because of the car.
Yun Kang Hui's hair clip?
He let Yun kang Hui in the car first.
They must have done something in this car for her to have dropped her hair clip.
I shouldn't have renewed this relationship with Kim Seong Su.
Now I understand that men cannot be recycled.
But it wasn't the same for Hyeon Ju.
How do you do?
Congratulations to you.
So pretty.
Congratulations.
You came.
How do you do?
Thank you!
Hyeon Ju had no choice but to recycle her man.
Is he here?
!
What is wrong with Tae U?
The ceremony is starting soon.
He is not answering his phone.
Did something happen?
What did his parents say?
Looks like they're trying to hide something.
What?
What is it exactly?
I heard he didn't come home last night.
Did something happen?
He won't come.
Looks like he's not coming.
I asked one of his friends.
They said he didn't show up for his bachelor party.
Didn't you call him yesterday?
A text message.
It should be from Tae U.
That jerk Kim Tae U!
He has gone completely crazy!
What did he say?
Is he crazy or what?
That son of a bitch!
This bastard!
Where is he right now?
-=Sorry...=-
Hyeon Ju.
Mom!
The Dean of South Korea University.
At my piano recital before, you met him in the art galleries, right?
Yes, I remember.
The bride is really beautiful.
Such an absurd moment like this, Hyeon Ju must face a lot of people.
What are you thinking of in your heart?
Since we were 14, we've been friends.
But I have never been able to predict what she will do next.
It was always something absurd and preposterous.
Her decisions never fail to surprise everyone.
You're really beautiful!
Really?
Oh, thank you.
Congratulations!
We have to go first.
The groom is not here yet?
He is on his way.
Hyeon Ju.
What do you think you're doing?
Why did you say that?
Hello?
Is this the Disposable Men's Club?
Is there a member called Kim Deok Su there?
Yes?
Hello, do you remember me?
This is the woman who spilled coffee on your pants before.
Yes, do you have time today?
Alright then.
I'd like to ask you to become my husband.
Just for today, okay?
Are you insane?
!
You're still normal, right?
Wait for a moment.
I hate complications.
The problem is very simple.
I am a classy lady.
A wedding ceremony without a groom is unacceptable, right?
What did you just say?
In Yeong, get her to see a doctor.
Look at her talking in her sleep.
It seems like she's gone crazy sick.
Why not?
After getting married,
I have to go on a honeymoon!
No matter how much they make out or change their angle, the hair clip would not have fallen off.
Something... strong.
A strong impact.
I didn't tell you yet?
I bought a house.
You bought a house? When did you buy it?
Last month.
He didn't even say a word to me before buying the house.
They want to interview you as part of their Women's Success Stories feature.
Did you two really sleep together?
Yes, we did sleep together.
I'm going to sue you and Kang Do Gyeong for adultery.

Even though I broke up with a long-time lover, not much has changed.
I wake up at 5 in the morning to study English.
And during lunch, I play tennis with Alex.
After work, I cook.
I watched 2 movies in a row at the theater.
By the time I get home, it's one in the morning.
I became a little busier and a little brighter.
It's not my style to become sloppy because of a break-up.
It's just over with one man.
Everything is really okay.
Even though I broke up with Kim Sung Soo, I'm moving on.
When the day is over, night arrives.
Night is the problem.
I can't fall asleep.
It's been a week.
Hey, In Young.
Were you sleeping?
Sounds like you were sleeping.
Were you sleeping?
You bastard.
You can sleep after cheating on me?
I can't sleep.
No matter how much I try, I just can't sleep.
So you can't sleep either.
And why did you answer my call?
I told you not to answer.
Fine.
I won't answer your calls.
I won't sleep either.
So I threw away my cell phone.
I won't call him ever again.
I told you not to answer my call.
Why do you keep answering my calls?
Are you trying to tease me?
I didn't know you were calling.
Did you get a new phone?
Tonight, I really won't call him.
Wake up.
I told you not to sleep.
You said you wouldn't.
Why are you sleeping, huh?
Shocked, right?
You probably are.
I'm still shocked by what you did.
Why didn't you change your password?
It's my birthday.
Why didn't you change it?
In Young, let's sleep.
Are you crazy?
Why would I sleep with you?
What do you want me to do?
You do this every night.
Can you live like this?
Say you're sorry.
You should be sorry.
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
Wow.
So robotic.
Why didn't you say you love me?
Where are you going?
Why didn't you say you love me?
Don't you love me anymore?
It's not like that.
Then why can't you say it?
Because the one you love is Yoon Kang Hee?
No.
Let's stop.
Then who's the one you love?
Did you really mean that you're sorry?
Why did you do something you'd be sorry for?
Why?
If I did the same thing you did, could you forgive me?
Answer me.
Answer me!
Answer me.
Why won't you answer me?
Wow, I can't believe it.
You're wearing the t-shirt I bought you.
Woah.
You cheat on me and then wear the t-shirt I bought you?
Take it off, take it off right now.
I bought you too many things.
Drink it.
Drink it and...
And then should I die?
That way you'll sleep peacefully, right?
You shouldn't sleep for an entire week.
I'm totally crazy right now.
Did you like sleeping with her?
Did you?
You know I kissed another man too.
It felt really, really good.
Your kiss?
You call that a kiss?
You think I didn't have any men to cheat with?
Do you think I stayed with you for 10 years because I had no one else?
Tell me.
Tell me!
Cat got your tongue?
I wish someone would drag me home and tie me up.
From now on, you'll suffer a lot.
You'll never be able to sleep because of me.
Until you die, I'm going to follow you around and bother you like this.
I've totally gone crazy.
I'm going to have to kill myself when I get home.
The next day, I definitely fell asleep.
Miss?
Miss!
We're here.
But when I woke up, I was in a taxi.
That will be 6 dollars.
Miss?
Could I use your phone?
I should have killed myself yesterday.
Where are you going looking like that?
That's none of your business.
You don't have any bus fare.
Whatever.
Worry about yourself.
What will you do if Yoon Kang Hee finds you?
I don't care if she sees.
What does it matter?
Oh, she doesn't matter?
She was with you even though you had another woman.
Take my car.
I'll take you there.
No.
I'm going alone.
I won't get in a tainted car.
In Young, please.
It smells like Kim Sung Soo.
I forgot it's over between us.
Come over and eat.
Come here.
Eat.
Did you buy groceries this morning?
Yeah.
I went to the shop owned by the lady from Gunsan.
Don't drink alcohol.
I threw out all the beer in your fridge.
I won't be home tonight.
I'm not going anymore.
I won't go.
I'm going to a workshop with the writer and production team.
I tried to change the date, but it wasn't possible.
I don't care where you go or who you go with anymore.
No matter what you say, I won't believe you.
I promised myself that I would never go to his home again.
Or so I thought.
But I find myself doing this to Kim Sung Soo's car.
It's not my fault.
It's his fault for not taking the car with him to the workshop.
It's his fault, it's his fault, it's his fault.
It's Yoon Kang Hee's car.
The quote for the 2 cars will be pretty high.
Things must have been difficult for you.
Things were fine for me.
Yes, I scratched them a bit.
I was mad.
Mad at who?
Why would you be mad?
Isn't that a bit childish?
You should have confronted me than do this to the car.
Do you think it's my fault?
No, it's not your fault.
You've done nothing wrong so you can live comfortably without feeling guilty.
But, Yoon Kang Hee.
You've come up a little short.
Things are fine?
How could things have been fine?
What's that supposed to mean?
The night Kim Sung Soo drove me home, where were you?
What were you doing alone?
Weren't you humiliated when he left you to come to me?
So fascinating.
Is your head damaged?
How could things be fine?
Are you saying this because I'm young?
That's right.
You're only 23.
Act naively if you're young.
I would never have acted like this at your age.
Didn't you know we loved each other?
Do you hate me?
Yes, I hate you.
I hate you too.
Why did you meet him before I did?
Why did you love him first?
I hate you for that.
Do you want to see me hurt?
If you do, then you'll have to pathetically, not as if everything's okay.
Do you really want to know what happened that night?
Yes, I was left alone.
I was hurt.
I'm 23 now.
I'm 23.
I never wanted a love like this.
But I'm an actress.
I thought if I ever have a scene like this, I could do it well.
And that was all.
I know you won't be able to forget him easily.
But my feelings aren't fake.
I had moments that you don't know about.
I'll have more opportunities in the future.
We like the same things, and we do the same work.
We're working on the same movie.
This child really loves Kim Sung Soo.
I won't say anything from now on.
You can scratch it again if you want.
This child loves Kim Sung Soo much more than I do.
You have this much on your list?
Yes.
I put it together after careful deliberation.
What's the skill that you thought of?
First, he has to wear European-brand jeans without getting them altered.
Second, he needs a body where his chest muscles slightly show when he wears a t-shirt.
Third is personality.
He's intelligent yet cheerful.
The fourth condition is kind of detailed.
But I like a man with an attractive lower back.
His fashion doesn't matter, but I'd like it if his taste in shoes is similar to mine.
Why?
Do you need more?
All wrong.
I don't know how I'm supposed to teach you.
You need a philosophy at your age.
What's that?
Listen carefully.
First.
You can't get a man who's related to your work.
Why not?
This man is a judge.
These guys are prosecutors and he's a lawyer.
But you're going to keep meeting him.
It'll be awkward if you see him in court.
Erase it.
Second, exclude all married men, unless you want me to lecture.
That's right.
Third, get rid of all men who talk too much.
Why?
He'll go around bragging that he slept with you.
You're right.
This bastard talks a lot.
This guy too.
How many are left?
Oh, this is good.
Only one.
Park Gun Ho.
Sleep with him.
I can't sleep with him.
Why?
He thinks I'm married.
He came to the wedding.
You still didn't tell them?
Everyone thinks I'm married.
They're all waiting for a housewarming party.
You really don't have one?
I don't.
Who can I sleep with?
Should I go to a nightclub?
It's dangerous to do that with a strange man.
Now what?
AIDS!
Who am I supposed to sleep with?
When you pick the guy, hypnotize him.
How?
Look closely.
There's a man you want to seduce.
After you see him, raise your chin.
Like this?
Act a little bit haughty.
An irresistible confidence.
Like this?
Stretch out your right hand.
What is this?
We're hypnotizing him.
You are falling for my spell.
You can't escape my charm.
Tonight, you're falling for my charm.
Tonight, you're falling for my charm.
Hey!
Don't laugh.
This really works.
Be sexy.
He's a prosecutor, he's married.
Him...
I think he got a job after he failed the exam.
Why aren't there any men?
Who's that?
Oh, it's me.
Kim Duk Soo.
Yes, what's up?
Well...
Come in.
What's that?
Ah, your wedding picture.
We had a wedding that time.
That picture came to my house.
Ah.
Did the pictures turn out nice?
Take a look.
Ta-da.
I was really pretty that day, wasn't I?
I was going to throw it out...
No not at all.
I'm glad you have it.
I'm going to need it for my housewarming.
Since you're here, can you put these up for me?
Sure.
Why not?
Here please.
How much will that be?
Is 5 dollars enough?
I don't do that anymore Miss Hyun Joo.
You should still take it.
Otherwise, I feel bad.
You're a friend.
It doesn't matter.
If you need anymore handiwork, call me.
I have a power drill at home.
I'll bring it.
Really?
There's something the laundry room that needs to be fixed.
I have to put up a shelf.
Give me a call when you're free.
Oh, and you should stop by the ping-pong hall some time.
Sure.
Thanks.
Bye.
Be careful on your way out.
Yes.
Goodbye.
That's right.
Hyun Joo has Kim Duk Soo.
He's not related to my work, and he's not a married man.
And he seems discreet.
And he probably doesn't have AIDS.
He has...
AIDS!
How's that man?
That's right.
If I'm going to sleep with a man, it might as well be my husband.
No.
That's how Kang Hyun Joo became a member of the ping-pong club.
But she had no interest in the game.
Only in the player.
Oh my.
Lean and long legs.
Those confident wrists.
But Kim Duk Soo was only interested in the game.
Okay, I'm going to hold you from the back.
Oh yeah.
Get a bit lower.
Like this.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Move the paddle like this.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
The sound of his breath.
What do I do?
Oh my God, what do I do?
That's how you do it.
You're falling for my spell.
What's that?
Oh, it's nothing Duk Soo.
Oh, my wrist hurts.
Let's stop for today.
Should we?
What time are you coming tomorrow?
By the way...
How tall are you?
187 cm.
Oh.
You're taller than I thought.
How about your weight?
72-74 kg.
Have you read Gustave Flaubert by any chance?
Who's that?
Madame Bovery.
Sentimental Education.
Don't you know?
Do you know Kant?
You know him right?
Right?
Immanuel Kant, the German philosopher.
Yes, well his name...
What do you think of a motive without motivation?
What's that?
Critique of Judgment.
Haven't you read it?
He's so stupid.
He's stupid.
Do you want to make a baby with him?
I'm the sort of person who keeps beautiful form in mind when I buy toothbrushes.
Here she goes again.
There you go.
How are we going to talk?
We have nothing in common.
We need something to talk about.
Need to talk with a man?
You talk to a man with your body.
But this is my first.
If Kim Duk Soo is a toothbrush, he's a useful one.
When you buy something useful, do you care about beautiful form?
She would think of that.
No matter how useful it needs to be, she cares about beauty.
The most important thing for a one night stand is sexiness.
You said he's sexy.
But I don't want anything animalistic.
Humans are animals and love is beastly rage.
But I have a dream.
I bet you do.
If you didn't, you wouldn't be Kang Hyun Joo.
This is my first time.
Everything needs to be perfect.
We need to be at the best hotel.
There needs to be music and candles.
For flowers, I prefer white lilies over roses.
The flowers need to be white.
Ones that were grown in the purest soil.
And the pillow needs a drop of organic lavender essential oil.
Does it really have to be essential oil?
Just be quiet.
The sleeping gown will be white.
Don't forget to attach wings.
I hope he treats me preciously.
I want to feel as though I'm loved.
I don't want to be animalistic.
I wanted to be treated with dignity.
Just because you're sexy, does that mean you'll forfeit your dignity?
Then what is it you want?
That's right.
Well, at 4 in the morning, inside a red telephone booth.
Why 4 in the morning?
That's the sexiest time.
I don't like it when it's too dark or too bright.
I like the lighting to reflect just enough on the window glass.
What about the man?
Tony Leung?
Liang Zhao Wei?
That's just a fantasy.
That's right.
There are no more telephone booths.
By the way, it's Liang Zhao Wei.
He's still alive.
Okay, good luck with that.
Fighting.
Yay!
How about you In Young?
I want a beach during sunset.
I don't need music.
I like the sound of waves more.
There's a table on the sand.
After we read together, we have a glass of wine.
When we feel relaxed, we lay on the beach together.
Aren't you going to put down a blanket?
Oh, we should do that.
But who's going to set up and clear the table?
That kind of stuff isn't important.
That's right.
The important thing is the man.
Who is it?
Who do you think?
It's none other than Kim Sung Soo.
Kim Sung Soo?
That, Kim Sung Soo?
That's right.
I'm still thinking of Kim Sung Soo.
Still, Kim Sung Soo.
Change your fantasy man.
I agree.
Okay.
Who should it be?
Bae Sung Hyun!
Yeah!
Hey!
Aren't you the ones who want him?
You said he's a good kisser.
I may not know much, but I know good kissers are good at doing you-know-what.
Oh my.
How might you know that?
I read it in a book.
Oh really.
It's not ready yet.
Just wait.
Don't goof around.
I'm tired.
Alex.
Yeah.
Alex.
Motorcycle cheated on me.
I tell my friends everything.
But...
I can't tell anyone about this.
I thought about why I can't tell this to my friends.
The thing is...
And this is really embarrassing.
I don't think it's over between the two of us.
I know what you mean.
It must be hard for you.
Does this make sense?
Why can't I just end it?
Isn't it because you still love him?
The bigger problem is that the other woman loves Kim Sung Soo more than I do.
This girl has endured humiliation.
She's fine even though her pride's been wounded.
I can't beat her.
Even if I forgive him, I don't think things can go back to normal because of Yoon Kang Hee.
In Young.
Are you miserable?
Then cry.
Korean people are so strange.
Why don't they cry when they're miserable?
You need to cry to resolve the problem.
Don't you think?
Should I cry?
Will you accept me if I cry?
Of course, we're friends.
I'm crying.
I'm really going to cry, okay?
Yes, cry.
It's okay, it's okay.
In Young.
In Young.
Should I tell you what to do when you're miserable?
Shave off your eyebrows.
These eyebrows?
If you shave your eyebrows, the next day, your worries go away.
After that, only one worry stays with you.
You only worry about the eyebrow that disappeared.
You think, if only I had eyebrows, all my worries will go away.
Fight misery with misery?
You create an even bigger problem.
So that your current probably totally goes away.
Just like this.
A house concert.
House concert?
You are invited to In Young's house concert.
Fight misery.
I'm crazy.
Now I'm in big trouble.
Oh, I just saw it.
What's with her?
I don't know.
Why a house concert all of a sudden?
Okay.
Bye.
What's a house concert?
Oh, you just invite some people over...
Duk Soo.
My friend is having a house concert.
Want to come?
D.
D, D. Triangle, triangle.
One, two, three, four.
Raise it, raise it.
G.
One, two, three...
How do I do it?
Raise this.
I'm crazy.
I should have shaved my eyebrows.
It's okay.
Just take your time.
Okay, ready?
Again, again.
Just press down here.
Alex was right.
After I sent out the invitation, all I cared about was the house concert.
I sometimes thought about Kim Sung Soo, but I forgot him right away.
Your second chord was wrong.
It's not D. It's D minor.
And the song doesn't suit your voice.
Change the song.
Where is he?
Now what?
Do you have business in this neighborhood?
Why would I be in this neighborhood?
I went to the hotel, but it was your day off.
Why would I...
Why didn't you call?
If I had called, would you have answered?
Of course.
Why wouldn't I?
I've heard of a good musical.
Want to go see it?
Yes, let's go.
What?
When is it?
Is it today?
I was just saying.
Why you...
Does that mean you're not going?
Let's go.
Hurry, let's go.
Why do you keep smiling?
Is that Motorcycle's car?
Did you two fight?
Yeah.
Kind of.
Are you using me for a lover's quarrel?
Are you trying to get under his skin?
If you know, then stay quiet.
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to kiss you?
Just on the cheek.
Just a peck.
Hurry up and do it.
Are you crazy?
Anyway, you're indebted to me.
I'll pay you back.
You can go now.
See you later fool.
I'll come for you later.
Yeah, yeah.
I bought something for you to eat.
Go in and eat.
Okay.
Hurry and go.
Bye!
What are you doing here?
Did you bring an estimate for the car?
Let's talk inside.
Why would you go in my house?
Let's go in.
Don't touch me.
You saw him kissing me right?
He likes me you know.
He's the one who kissed me.
I'm going to go out with him soon.
Then I'm going to sleep with him.
With him.
Don't do it.
You can't.
What?
What can't I do?
The thing you've decided to do.
Don't do it.
How come you can and I can't?
Do you have to do this?
You're so ridiculous, Kim Sung Soo.
Didn't you cheat so you could end things with me?
I was wrong.
I said I'm sorry.
I know I'm wrong.
But I don't want to lose you.
Stop it.
If you didn't want to lose me, then you shouldn't have done it.
You shouldn't have done it.
Don't do it.
Just don't do it.
Write on your forehead that you're a fucking douchebag.
You thickheaded motherfucker.
You have to play the game.
My house is teeth versus bread.
You're teeth, I'm bread.
You've made a fool of me twice.
Is this what love is to you?
How are you and I different?
How about you?
Do you love me?
Whatever I did, I didn't want to break up with you.
But you always try to break up with me.
Disgusting.
Can't you be cool?
Just tell me you fell in love with another woman and move on.
Then at least I'll have memories.
Go, I don't want to see you.
You're not going?
Do you want to hear more?
Don't meet him.
I was out of my mind.
I was wrong.
Even if you push me away a hundred times...
I'm going to come back.
You're the one who needs to come her senses.
Don't do it.
You can't.
If you asked me to come, shouldn't you offer me a drink?
We have some herb tea over there, but we don't have coffee.
I'm not saying I want a drink.
Why are you here?
Come back to the office.
I think I told you that I don't want to work with women like you.
I know my personal life is complicated.
But why would that make you not want to work for me?
It's not your personal life I don't like.
I don't like you or working with you.
I'm a professional.
We should be professional if we work together.
You're a pro?
I know that you have your own exhibitions and operations.
But I'm the one who pays you.
Your photographs are works of art, but photographs for money are nothing to you.
If I ask you to stay an hour later, you just leave.
You call yourself a pro?
You half-ass the shoot because your eyes are bloodshot from working all night on your art.
You think you're the only artist?
I'm an artist too.
What's a pro?
Does sleeping with a married man disqualify me as a pro?
A pro is someone who focuses on work, no matter how many lovers they've had.
You're here to lecture me, right?
No, what I mean is...
Let's work this out.
What should I change?
What is it you don't like?
If I tell you, will you change it?
Tell me your conditions.
Don't speak to me informally.
I'm 2 years older than you.
What else?
I can only work twice a week.
But to make up for it, I won't leave early.
You need to pay me the same.
I don't have much time to get ready.
Fine.
What else?
Change your perfume.
When I come in to work with you, my head hurts.
Wearing a perfume that strong isn't being polite to the other person.
You're not the only one using this air.
Okay.
Sir.
Do you have free time twice a month?
I want you to be a model.
It's difficult to find a charismatic woman who isn't afraid of the camera.
I won't be able to pay you much.
You don't pay me much either.
No, but that...
Okay.
Twice a month.
I'll be your model.
But I have a condition too.
Don't tell my employers about it.
The thing with the married man.
I won't tell them.
I can trust you, right?
I said don't speak informally.
Yes, sir.
I believe you.
Hey, is the chicken and beer coming?
I was just about to call them.
Make sure we have alcohol.
Duk Soo, come help me.
Yes, I'll do it.
Where should I put it?
Over there.
It's Kim Sung Soo.
What is?
I asked In Young if Sung Soo is coming, and she didn't say anything.
Why wouldn't she say?
Something must be wrong.
Hi, Alex.
You're here.
Let me introduce you all.
This here is Alex.
This is Seo Yeon.
Hi.
This is Hyun Joo.
Hi.
Hello.
Over here is Hyun Joo's husband.
Nice to meet you.
He's cute.
Mind your husband.
I call dibs.
Bang!
The day finally arrived.
{\1cHD0AAFF\2cHFFFFFF\k4}♪ Even when he looks at me ♪
She's good.
She must have practiced a lot.
What's their relationship?
Oh, they're just friends.
That day, I had a realization.
I realized I was already happy.
I knew if I wasn't happy in that moment, I never would be.
Ah, he's so good looking.
Exactly my style.
You're falling for my spell.
You...
Don't do that.
What is that?
Just something.
He came.
Kim Sung Soo came.
Ta-da!
How could you spend your last 4 paychecks on a guitar?
Isn't it nice?
It's a really nice one that the pros use.
Once you start to play the guitar, you'll realize how great it sounds.
I never asked you to buy me a guitar.
I think women who play the guitar are cool.
I think it suits you too.
You don't like it?
Do you want something else?
I'm so upset.
You weren't able to sleep for 4 months.
Stop making movies.
Why don't you just work at my hotel?
You can speak English too.
Ah, I'm so upset.
Why did you buy something for me?
You should have bought some shoes.
Your sneakers are falling apart.
Your clothes are getting so loose.
You should buy clothes that fit you.
Learn the guitar.
Learn it.
Seriously.
Let's learn it.
Okay?
He came.
I decided how things would be between me and Sung Soo.
I decided to smile.
I'm going to smile.
I'm going to smile.
As if he's a long time friend.
As if we never loved each other.
The reason is simple.
I don't want myself to be ruined because of Kim Sung Soo.
If he thinks this means I forgive him, so be it.
This is a sort of apology.
The next day, I met Bae Sung Hyun.
I was so shocked when they called me on stage.
But they were so good.
I had fun.
How about you?
Did you like it?
I liked that you enjoyed it.
I'm serious.
I like it when you smile.
You're prettiest when you smile.
Do you really want to go out with me?
Isn't that what we're doing?
Can you do what I want?
I can't promise anything.
But I'm going to do my best.
What do you want from me?
Tell me what you want.
Romance.
I need romance.
Wait.
I told you to practice.
Why didn't you?
If I tell you to get softer, you get slower.
If I tell you to get louder you scream.
How are we ever going to record at this rate?
Go easy on them.
They said they didn't even eat.
Take a 30 minute break.
Hey!
No food.
If you're full you won't be able to sing.
I'm the drummer...
It's worse for you.
If you're full you won't have any strength.
Get some fresh air on the roof, then come back and practice.
Yes.
Hey!
No bread either!
I think this will last until dawn.
Should we at least feed them some pizza?
That's nonsense.
If they get full, they become pigs.
And lose all emotion.
I'm going to go eat.
Alone?
Hey, what about me?
~Episode 2~
After passing 30, I'm getting more ruthless.
Come here.
These guys, without any manners...
Do you know how disgusting this is?
What girls hate the most is when guys come out of the bathroom without zipping their pants up.
What's so important that you leave before doing that?
The things that I was embarrassed about when I was 20 years old...
Now they're nothing.
[Do You Want to Sleep in My Room Sometimes?
]
-Alright, the most important thing now is doing it slowly.
-Don't do it willy-nilly and just try shaking it once so that nothing gets mixed up.
You're very late.
I get more shameless as time goes on.
I'm sorry.
Now, we will learn about the three different ways of producing coffee.
Ah..wait
Me.
So..by any chance...
So..that is...
Did we kiss too?
Hmm...did we?
We probably did.
When?
Were we dating?
How did we end up kissing?
Did we date for a long time?
Why in the world am I like this?
Just how many men have you dated that you don't remember a man you've kissed?
Yes.
I knowthatyou are disappointed.
But.
We haven't kissed.
I've never dated you before.
Then how do you know me?
I saw you a few weeks ago in that coffee class.
Coffee King.
But how did you get here from the coffee shop?
I think you should worry about yourself more than me.
I think it's a good idea to get a brain test.
Even now.
Did you forget about that table?
Omo, what to do?
!
Alright, shall we try putting the coffee in now?
It's okay.
That level of embarrassment is the usual for me now.
When you pour coffee, you stop after about thirty seconds.
And if you stop pouring it like this...
Slowly...slowly...
It seems you usually don't keep up with time that well.
Did it go well with that man?
There's no way it would go well since he saw the whole incident.
Well, a woman who came late and then chatted with another man probably wouldn't be that well liked.
Fighting.
You should pour the water carefully, not letting all of coffee be flooded.
At the lowest possible position.
I'll have an Americano.
Mocha.
Welcome.
A latte and an americano please.
Hey!
-These guys, without any kind of fear...!
I told you not to eat!
I told you not to eat anything!
I'll see you at the recording studio.
You're all dead!
It's just..if you're full, you can't sing well.
They're in the middle of recording...
What is it?
You've got some of the ground coffee spread here.
It's like a mustache.
Clean it yourself.
This is 33 years old.
The age where you have to clean everything that gets around your lips yourself.
Will you die if you touch my face?
Looks like you'll get a bruise on your forehead.
I'm not embarrassed at all.
I'm at an age where being embarrassed is embarrassing now.
The age where I used embarrassment to be cute has already passed.
30,000 years ago.
Would this be bad for my skin?
Why are you asking me something so obvious?
Is there proof of such thing?
There's nothing like that.
Could you please ask me why I got a bruise on my forehead?
You probably bonked into something.
Even if I put red pepper paste on my face and walked around,
I would never be able to get attract a man's attention.
That's not the only thing.
Lee Byung Gyu.
Lee Byung Gyu.
-He's coming out.
That's right, Lee Byung Gyu should come out.
This time use the bat and get a homerun in one hit!
Please.
Please.
Lee Byung Gyu, homerun!
Lee Byung Gyu, homerun!
Lee Byung Gyu, homerun!
Homerun!
Homerun!
Homerun!
Homerun!
-It's going out of the park!
It's going far!
-It's going, it's going!
Yeah!
It's a homerun!
ThisisNOTokay.
Why?
It's been so long;
let's watch the interview too!
Yoon Suk Hyun-sshi.
This is not okay.
It's been more than 3 years since we broke up.
So what?
I'd like it if you didn't hug me and kiss me and do things like that.
Why all of a sudden?
Do you really not know?
We broke up.
Now we're just friends.
Who decided that?
I never had one thought of breaking up with you.
Why are you being like this?
How can I be friends with you?
If you were a man, would you be able to accept the fact that a woman this sexy is just your friend?
I am really sexy, aren't I?
It's a dream.
It was a dream!
It's a dream...
But I even moaned!
I'm going crazy.
Ican'tbelieveIhadsuchanexplicitdream.
Ican'tbelievemylife hasbecomethisvulgar.
Oh, you're up?
Where are you going?
It's none of your business!
Let's go too.
TheSpinsterHysteriamusthave aconnectiontosexualfrustration.
Thisisaconclusionderivedfrompersonalexperience.
Aren't you tired?
I have to get rid of all this strength.
So that I don't have any useless energy.
Why?
I can't sleep well.
I have all these weird dreams.
What kind of dream?
A dream where I kissed you.
I liked it even though it was just a dream.
What kind of dream?
A dream with a man who kept on clinging to me.
Is that a wish list?
No, it's a man who I don't really like.
That's denying the truth.
That's why he came into your dreams.
You're interested in that man.
There's no way!
What kind of man is he?
This kind!
A very mean, indifferent, cold-hearted, selfish man!
How badly did you want to do it?
It's not like that.
It's not like I'm having a hard time just because I haven't been doing it.
The night just went on too long, that's all.
That's right.
Of course you want to think like that.
But your body doesn't.
But it ended so disappointingly.
We were just about to go past kissing but I suddenly woke up right then!
It's a dream anyway; it should go to the end.
So disappointing.
I thought we'd go on, but it just had to end right there!
It seems like you want to get back together with Seok Hyun.
Could that be why you had that kind of dream?
On top of that, your whole body trembled just by him touching your nose.
Yet you say that you don't want to date him again?
What should she do?
The answer is right there; what else?
-Just sleep with him!
-Hul!
Just tell him truthfully.
Tell him what?
That she missed his body so much that she even dreamed about him?
It scares men when women speak that directly.
Do you think he would be able to pass it over?
Since being erotic doesn't suit you, just say it like you're joking.
"Come and sleep in my room sometimes."
Indifferently and coolly.
How's it sound?
Come and sleep in my room sometimes.
You look easy.
If you think about it openly, it's no different from sports.
-Sports?
-Sports?
Seducing him is like the sport Catch.
Think of it as a game of catch and just get to the point.
"I want to sleep with you.
Do you want to play catch with me?"
Just like this, casually.
Casually...
Yoon Seok Hyun.
My body's a bit sore.
Shall we straighten it out in my room?
Okay.
Anyway, with your body so sore...
I'll make it disappear.
Say something that makes sense!
What doesn't make sense?
Sex is just sex.
It's no different from playing catch.
You touch bodies, you sweat, and after you do it you shower and wake up.
But you share feelings.
That's right.You share love and it's a pure ritual.
What's so pure about it?
Well it's not like we're animals.
It's good because we aren't animals.
Even when we are not ovulating, we can do it, and birth control is in our hands.
But I still want to do it with the person that I love.
While being loved.
Hallelujah.
It's because you have that fantasy that you don't have enough sex.
It's this complicated to figure out who'll suggest it first.
Is that real love?
Calculating that means it isn't love from the get-go.
I can't agree with you.
There's no relationship that's 100% pure.
I use my brain a lot when I go to meet Ho Joon!
There's no use in you using your head!
You use your head in weird ways.
No.
Even though I may look like this, I am a professional when it comes to pushing and pulling.
Oh so you are a professional?
How do you push and pull?
I call it the three-step method.
The three-step method?
Be careful on your way back, Ho Joon.
How can you just leave?
Huh?
You surprised me!
What are you going to do if someone sees us?
I pushed him away once.
Drive carefully, Ho Joo-
What?
You aren't leaving?
I pulled him in once.
Can't you give me a cup of coffee?
Come on, I'll just drink the coffee and leave.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Woo Ji Hee!
You don't trust me yet?
When you push them away the second time, men get a little bit annoyed.
When that happens, pull them back in right away!
You know how much I like you, right?
The third step is receiving it!
Of course, you resist it a little at first.
Can't you just do it from the beginning?
The second time will definitely...
That's the problem, he always catches on.
Then why aren't you sleeping with Ho Joon?
He didn't want you during those three times?
That's a different problem.
I'm not an easy woman.
I'm hard-to-get.
I'm so mediocre compared to you guys.
You are a former model who now is married to the famous news broadcaster Lee Jang Woo and also has her own company.
You are a composer and a music producer for movies.
So?
I am a normal person who gets paychecks every month.
Since my specialty isn't being pretty or sexy.
Innocence and purity is what I have to compete with.
This is my concept.
You are innocent but you are not ordinary.
Sometimes, you strike me.
Really hard too.
Anyway, I am appealing my kindness to Ho Joon.
As a trophy wife who is a good cook!
Do you know when men look for a kind woman?
When?
When he is getting his coffin ready.
When he is looking for his gravesite and shrouds.
When he has no strength left after looking for sexy women.
That's right.
But Ji Hee still stuck to her own way.
You could have waited downstairs, I would have come out.
Ta-dah!
Thank you!
It's Pretty
Something smells good.
I was cooking some food.
Come Inside
It's a bit small, isn't it?
No, it's natural and nice.
Wow, there's nothing my darling can't cook.
Mm, it looks delicious.
It's not done!
I'll bring it out soon; the bathroom is that way.
Wow, you used this to make it?
Wow, you used something like this to make it.
Alright, stand back.
I'll help you out with it.
All right, soy sauce!
Okay, I'll pour in the soy sauce.
Next, you have to put sesame oil on the noodles first so that they don't absorb water.
Mix it well like this.
And then you sprinkle some ground sesame mixed with salt.
Now do you just have to mix it altogether?
Is that all you have to do?
I'm the one who fried all the ingredients.
And you call yourself the Queen of Cooking?
Honestly tell me.
The sandwiches you brought for me last time, you bought those at the cafe on the first floor of the hospital, right?
You are so sly.
You just brought the tupperware to put the sandwiches in.
No
I have eaten those sandwiches so many times.
How else would they taste the same?
Stop teasing me.
You're so cute.
Why are you doing this?
You just made fun of me so easily...
No, where are you going to go?
Don't do it; we have to eat.
I don't want to.
Alright!
Going up!
Okay!
W-wait!
Let's eat first, okay?
Don't pretend to be innocent and just do it.
Wow, did Jae Kyung design these shoes?
Wow, she's really good!
When is the launching?
I heard it but I forgot.
I think it is pretty soon.
There's nothing I can help with?
Yeah, I'm not going to make the sauce but just use the one from the store.
So just sit...
Isn't your hair in the way?
This is really unfair.
Why is your hair all out?
It makes those who see it uncomfortable.
Now I'm getting aroused just by his fingers touching my hair.
Whoknows?
Nowevenmytoenailscanget mearousedtoo.
It's because I've been without a man for too long.
I want to believe that.
All I have to do is wash this, right?
Yea, wash it, wash it.
You stare at my face a lot these days.
Do you have something to say to me?
No, I don't have any.
Is something wrong?
You know, Yoon Seok Hyun...
What?
Do you want to come sleep in my room sometimes?
Why would I leave my room and go to yours?
There are cocktail shrimps in the freezer, right?
Yes.
And also the clams...
What is this?
This is my privacy!
Hey, why do you need that?
Do you buy emergency medicine to use right now?
You are so impudent!
Are you not embarassed when something like that is in a woman's fridge?
Who's the shameless one?
I'm coming to see that this is all because of you!
I taught you that?
You really must've forgotten everything.
Are you not done yet?
No, I'm done.
Are you going to buy that as well?
Do you not remember?
This is ridiculous.
It was you Yoon Suk Hyun who introduced me to the world of birth control.
What are you doing?
Yeol Mae, you can't cross this line.
If you do, I won't be responsible.
So you sleep here, and I sleep there.
Got it?
I crossed it.
You're asking for it.
I totally crossed it.
What are you doing to do?
Aren't you going to get up?
I'm a pure man.
Absolutely nothing will happen tonight, absolutely!
Oppa.
You know that I'm a wild sleeper.
In the morning when I open my eyes, I could find myself laying on your chest.
Stopplayingaround.
Youdon'tevenknowanything.
I'll go wash up and come back.
Ipurposelyworeanewpairofunderwear.
Yeol Mae, get me my toothbrush from my bag.
Hey, not there--!
What is this?
Give it here.
-Is this "that"?
!
-No
You're really funny, Seok Hyun!
You got this ready beforehand, didn't you?
Tell me, tell me.
You got it ready beforehand, didn't you?
Don't be like this.
Thismanis so sly.
What,don'tcross theline?
Don'tseduceme ?
Are you really an innocent man?
Aigoo, aigoo.
Don't do this.
-I told you not to do it, didn't I?
-Do what?
Itoldyounot todothis.
Itold youthatIcan'tbe responsibleforwhatwill happen.
So at the end, you used it.
And that is our first night together, at a Gangwon-do inn.
Did something happen to your brain?
How is it that our first night together was at Jungsun, Gangwon-do?
Omo, then where was it?
When I was in the army at Pocheon.
I didn't even forget the name of the motel.
Evergreen Motel.
I'm going crazy.
Our first night was five months before that, at Jungsun, Gangwon-do.
We just held hands and slept then.
I'll give you ten seconds, so think it over.
This is really important to me!
Would a woman not be able to remember her first night?
You're not the usual woman.
We had noodles that next day.
I have never heard of such noodles in my lifetime.
Oh, really!
Who is that?
I can't even tell him that my nose has changed into an erogenous zone.
It's Ji Hee.
Why would Ji Hee come here?
She said she was with Ho Joo today.
Did you already have dinner?
Yes.
Sorry, Sunbae.
Can you get me a glass of water?
Okay.
Why?
Is something wrong?
You said that you invited Ho Joo over today.
He didn't go?
He came and then left.
He left?
After it was over, he left.
Sunbae.
Come over here.
I have something to ask you.
Just talk amongst yourselves.
Sunbae, when you slept with Yeol Mae for the first time, how did you feel?
I was happy, because I loved her.
Right?
Right?
!
Then what about you?
Well...
I don't really remember...
You liked it.
Did I?
Right?
You liked it, right?
Right?
I'm so upset.
I'm really upset!
So why?
It wasn't fun at all.
It was pretty romantic because he brought me flowers.
Introduction?
It was good.
Rising action?
It wasn't bad.
Crisis?
From this moment, it started to be boring.
Then, without climax, when it became a bit hot..
He just... ended it.
I'll be back.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Are you okay?
It was empty.
It wasn't fun and I didn't feel anything.
It was just empty.
It was an anticlimatic sad ending.
You don't have that many experiences either.
But, I knew that he wouldn't be able to do it.
I felt it.
I'm so upset.
Everything else is right.
He's affectionate and handsome;
moreover, he's a doctor.
That's all good, it's all really good but...
But how could that not be right?
What do you think, Sunbae?
Say something as a man.
Right, if that doesn't match up, it would be hard.
I don't know about other things, but that should.
Right?
That's right, yep.
We matched each other very well on that.
Yoon Seok Hyun... was really good at kissing.
I know how erotic those hands feel.
Especially..
I climaxed... so often.
Are you going to keep looking at my face?
I can't even look at what I want?
The bigger problem is that he layed there for about an hour and then went home.
He said he had to go on a business trip to Jeju Island and get on the plane early in the morning!
I mean, it's not anything else; it's our first night!
We should be together until the next morning.
Isn't that right?
Maybe he left because he caught on that you didn't enjoy it.
That would hurt a man.
He probably didn't know that I wasn't satisfied.
Hey, he probably could tell; how wouldn't he?
You didn't possibly pretend like it was good, did you?
You're crazy!
So you did!
No, I mean...how...?
You can pretend?
Is that possible?
It's possible for women, sometimes.
I didn't act!
I really liked it, satisfied?
You really didn't act?
I said I didn't!
In the end, we could all be acting in our lives somehow.
Underourthickmaskscalledfaces .
I think that Jae Kyung's support for her husband is tremendous.
To be truthful, I was really worried when you two got married.
I also worried that I wouldn't match him, so I changed a lot.
It would be extra difficult when you enter the political world.
Do you have confidence?
I'm lacking, but if you give me a chance I'll work really hard!
My wife is currently attending an academy for politics.
Omo!
Is that so?
Let's go.
Customer, you've had a hard time.
It's fine.
Stop.
Why?
Do you want me to prepare a bath for you?
Jang Woo ssi.
You know the head of JK, Um Sang Hyun, right?
Yes.
He was a sunbae at university.
Why?
Are you close?
I still see him once or twice every week.
I sent a proposal to their investment team.
But they said that their investment plan for the second half of the year is full.
Do you want me to give him a call?
That would be wonderful.
It would be more wonderful if you arranged dinner for us too.
You fox.
Do you want to have a glass of wine?
Yes, that would be good.

Howgoodis it ... thatsheis moaninglikethat ?
Iwascurious.
What are you doing?
Huh?
Why are you standing like that in front of another person's room?
What is it?
This is the soap smell that I like.
Joo Yeol Mae.
Huh?
Did you lose your mind somewhere?
Won't you put your head on straight?
Let go of me!
You have a woman in here, right?
You used my emergency medicine without permission, right?
Then what are those shoes?
Those are the shoes you got from Jae Kyung.
Oh, those?
Oh, those?
Oh my shoes?
Do you want to put this in a place where so much food is stored?
I really wanted to die.
Why have I become this kind of woman?
Or was I like this from the start?
All women, like men, are animals too.
Don't try to interpret your body with your brain.
Even until the day you die, you will never be able to define it.
What about Ji Hee?
She's probably already there.
She sent me a text a while ago saying that she's five minutes away.
Really?
Yeol Mae.
Yeah?
Call Ji Hee to come outside.
Why?
Didn't you make a reservation here because this place is good?
Just call her.
There is a reason for that.
This is good.
JiHeeis at thesameplaceasyou .
Let's go somewhere else.
Get in.
What is up with you guys?
What are you guys doing?
You guys know something I don't know, right?
Yeol...
I said let's go somewhere else.
-Are you uncomfortable?
-No.
Should we go someplace else?
I'm fine.
Hello.
Lee Jang Woo ssi.
Hello Yeol Mae ssi.
You are here too, Ji Hee ssi.
Say hello.
They are my wife's friends.
Hello.
She is my cousin who just came to Korea last week.
Ah, yes...
Let's get out of here.
Let's go.
Where should we go?
I thought of someplace nice.
Let's go!
Really...
You always bring them home.
Jae Kyung wanted to come.
I didn't force them to.
Who's first?
Okay.
Sun Jae Kyung you first.
Thanks.
Don't you think you guys are too old to fight with each other?
I mean, you guys are over 30 now.
Who wants to make us laugh in this situation?
-Me!
Me!
-Ok.
The sun cried.
Do you know how to shrink this into three words?
What is it?
Hae Un Dae.
That's a bad one.
Another person?
Are you joking right now?
There is a limit to being nonchalant.
This isn't something to ignore.
Sun Jae Kyung, your husband is cheating on you.
It's his cousin!
Is that how your in-laws' traditions are?
Cousins kissing, smooching, and touching each other?
I didn't want to mention this, but I saw a post online that someone saw your husband at the duty free stores in Singapore.
Apparently he was shopping with a younger girl in his arms.
We are different from you guys.
Rumors about us are everywhere.
That one about your husband is without a doubt true.
That was when he went to Singapore for a shooting.
I hang out just as much.
Hang out?
What do you mean, hang out?
What are you talking about?
I hang out with other men just as much as he does with women.
Why would I need birth control pills?
I haven't slept with him in two years.
Are you crazy?
How could you be like this too?
You...stay quiet.
It was three months after we got married?
He had another woman.
I bet if you count all of his past women, you could fill up an entire truck.
That's no excuse.
I'm sorry to say this, but you are doing the exact same thing as he is doing.
Then if Lee Jang Woo is making Jae Kyung miserable, then should she just stay miserable?
Jae Kyung has the right to be happy by herself.
So having an affair to avenge is making herself happy?
It's better than rotting away while blaming Lee Jang Woo.
Think if your wife was doing the exact same thing!
Think if your husband is a jerk like Lee Jang Woo!
Why are you two guys fighting?
This isn't the time for that.
Stop it, will you?
Sunbae is right.
Should I do nothing but cry just because he can't make me happy?
Just divorce him.
I will.
-When?
-When?
When?
When I am done with the launching of my company, then I will report him to the authorities for adultery.
Then are you not commiting adultery?
Does Lee Jang Woo not know that you have a man?
I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know in his dreams.
Don't worry about me.
He will never find out.
Never.
You are late.
Yeah, a little.
You should have been more careful in a public place like that.
Yeah, I should've.
Why did you go there out of all places?
It's going pretty steady this time.
It's that girl you went to Singapore with last time, right?
Are you jealous?
That doesn't suit you.
Do you like it?
What are you saying?
I am just playing around.
What did Yeol Mae ssi say?
You told her that she was your cousin.
So I told her the same thing.
Thanks.
You are more incredible than I had thought you were.
Wash up.
I picked a good wife.
Thereisamomentwhen apersonclosetoyoufeels far away.
TheJaeKyungIsawjustnow wassomeonewhoinhabitedinadifferentdimension,andIfelt likeI didn 'tknow heratall.
Howmuchdo IknowaboutJaeKyung?
Did you clean up everything?
Do you want to have another drink?
I just want to die.
Was I too harsh on Jae Kyung today?
Yup.
Why did you corner someone who didn't want to talk about it?
Yeah, I know.
What is wrong with my temper?
I will let it go until today, but you better fix it starting tomorrow.
But that Jae Kyung is cheating on her husband, do you think it is true?
Well...
Even though Jae Kyung did have a lot of men, she never cheated on any of them.
Oh, this is nice.
Everything about you is great but you need to think about other people's feelings in desperate times.
Do I have to hear that from Yoon Suk Hyun ssi?
The person who only cares about himself?
I guess that's true.
-But Joo Yeol Mae.
-What?
There's this kind of thing.
Normally, your life is the most important thing.
And of course, your feelings are what matter the most.
Everyone has the right to do what he/she wants.
Don't nag at me.
I am selfish from birth.
But in life, there are not only normal times but also desperate times.
When everything is fine, then your feelings are the most important.
But when your friend has an emergency, then you set aside your personal feelings.
And you can match your feelings to your friend's feelings.
You are really bad at that.
You know that, right?
I'm going through an emergency right now.
I know.
That's why I am respecting your feelings.

But look.
I am not shy about saying thank you.
You're right.
That's something good about you.
Why are you smiling?
Just because.
I suddenly really like you, oppa.
I get really weak when someone calls me oppa.
I know that really well, that you are like that.
I love this song!
Joo Yeol Mae.
You make music for a living, but how come...
So what if the dance doesn't match the song?
I like it.
Today is my emergency, so you better respect how I feel.

What is that?
You have to do it like this.
Yoon Suk Hyun.
Yeah?
Nothing.
Joo Yeol Mae.
Do you want to sleep in my room sometimes?
It doesn't always have to be your room.
My room, from time to time.
How is that?
How should I interprete this?
I wouldn't feel so ridiculous like this even if I woke up after sleeping on a street road.
- That's because you guys are not dating.
- What?
You are not dating.
- Do you know how painful it was?
- It will be fun!
If you hated it that much, you should've said so honestly.
You're a totally con man, Joo Yeol Mae.
Omo, it's good!
I will have a lunch too.
I'll treat you!
Since I'm quite full, I'm going to have some pasta.
- I'll have the course A.
[$320]
- Oppa, you have a guest.
- Why did you let a stranger in?
It's a woman.
Are you naive or stupid?
Or crazy?
Come later.
You, don't mind other's business!
How dare do you butt in here?
"My Man's Kissing Style"
Episode 5 "My Man's Kissing Style"
President Oh of Jae Jil Paper Company is checking in this afternoon.
Put a bath towel over the sofa.
He doesn't brush his teeth with tap water, so put some mineral water next to the bathroom sink.
You go to the casino.
I'll call the ambulance.
Yes.
Is this 911?
Sung Hyun, I called the ambulance.
How long has he been at the casino?
Tell the casino they have to cooperate.
Call me as soon as they do.
Hey, Bae Sung Hyun, this person had a cardiac disorder.
This is a medical record from 3 years ago.
It's Han Il Hospital.
She was at the casino for 13 hours.
All she had was two cups of water.
No, you call the husband.
The front desk says he went on an overnight business trip in Busan.
Reach out to him in Busan.
Whether it's through the hotel or his company, tell him to come quickly.
Okay, got it.
It's okay.
We're going to go back to the hospital.
We called, and we'll reach your husband soon.
Hey, did you call?
I called the Busan and the Seoul Branch, but they don't have an office in Busan.
They say they don't have business there.
They say there's a high probability that he might be in a hotel with another woman.
Find him.
Call all the Busan hotels and the ones nearby.
I'll look into the ones in Seoul and Gyeongi Do.
In case he's using an alias, I'll ask the front desk to help me out.
Okay.
Your husband's in a meeting right now.
We'll find him and bring him over.
What a relief.
The husband was in Seoul, so we worked with the hotel to bring him to the hospital.
The surgery's been completed.
We should make sure people with weak health don't stay too long at the casino.
Good work.
Both of your quick thinking saved a person's life.
Sir.
He said he wants to meet you.
Did your wife's surgery go well?
Who called the ambulance for my wife?
These two.
Has your wife recovered?
I took her to the hospital.
What's wrong with you?
Do you know how much my wife's diamond ring costs?
Find it in the next 24 hours.
Mark my words!
You have 24 hours!
At times like this, I want to throw in the towel.
A salaryman's greatest power is that he can quit his job whenever he wants.
But if I quit now, I can't see these numbers grow.
Why did I set up a 5-year periodic deposit plan?
I have two years left.
My youth is passing by as my savings go up.
Letter of Resignation
It's Bae Sung Hyun's letter of resignation.
It really is his letter of resignation.
So ridiculous.
We save his wife's life, and he asks us to find him a treasure.
We found the ring.
It was in the swimming pool locker room.
The pool sent it to the front desk, and then they called the casino.
He even talked with Midori before she fainted.
He gave it to the front desk and said he'd pick it up at the casino.
They put it in a safety box.
How could he slap someone and not even apologize?
Is this the sort of service you were talking about?
Ah.
What is this?
The timing is bad.
Why are you quitting?
Why so suddenly?
Is it a personal reason?
After you got home that day, you lay on the bed and thought, 'What am I doing?
.'
Is it right to live life repetitively from the hotel to home, hotel to home?
You suddenly came to your senses.
Not only that, your senior got slapped in the face.
Plus, it's been exactly a year since you started.
Listen here 1-year employee.
Things can go fine for 3 years, and suddenly you might want to quit.
I've been through this before.
Today's my last day.
I won't change my mind.
How's your cheek?
Weren't you shocked?
I was very shocked.
I'm traumatized because of this.
Why are you quitting?
Why?
You know what's worse than being slapped or being accused of stealing?
Your letter of resignation makes me feel sad and depressed.
Do you know that?
I really liked working with you this year.
I grew fond of you.
Think about it.
We were a great team.
We even saved a life.
Now I have to take someone else and train them.
And then that one will quit.
Then quit again and again.
Then again and again.
Stop that.
You'll hurt yourself.
Don't quit Sung Hyun.
I'm begging you.
In Young.
Should we go on a vacation?
Let's go on a vacation.
What?
Don't you know I'm practically married?
Do you like me?
You're quitting the hotel because of me, huh?
I'm sorry.
I knew how you felt about me all along, but I pretended not to notice.
Really, this woman...
Why?
It's funny.
I want to try it too.
There are no men who like me.
None!
What would you do if there was a man that do?
I'll have an affair of course.
Without Motorcycle knowing.
You like me.
Let's go out, huh?
I never had an affair and became this age.
I'm 33, 33.
Why aren't you drinking?
You're not going to drink at all?
Fine, then I'll drink it all.
Drink slowly.
In some ways, I might have known that the car had stopped even while I was asleep.
In Young.
In my sleep, I thought, 'What a warm and gentle voice.'
Was this the moment I woke up?
Or was it the moment when the scent of Sung Hyun's skin came nearer?
All I know for certain is that when Sung Hyun's hand caressed my cheek.
I was definitely awake.
Right now, Sung Hyun's hand has stopped at my lips.
Even with my eyes closed, I could feel the movement of his hands.
Oh...
I just woke up.
When I woke up, you were looking straight ahead.
When did we get here?
Is there something in the alley?
Things walk through here sometimes.
Cats too.
I can't do this.
I have a man I love.
I shouldn't do this.
I'll go inside.
No, go ahead.
I'll just go inside.
Go inside.
Ah!
- What?
What?
- Hide!
It's Motorcycle!
He even has a key?
What?
What?
We've been together for 10 years, of course he has a key.
I'm sorry.
But why should I be sorry?
Let's mind our manners and speak formally.
You're not my senior any more.
Either we both speak informally or both speak formally.
What a rotten personality...
Fine, then we'll both speak informally.
Let's go out.
You said it yourself when you were drinking.
You regret becoming 33 without ever having an affair.
Have one before it's too late.
Though I don't like calling it an affair.
Do... you really like me?
Do you love me?
Is that how it was?
Most women would ask if I was interested in them.
But since you're a strange woman, I'll just say I loved you...
Ah.
Did you just hit me?
That's right.
I hit you.
You're joking around with an older woman.
I wasn't finished.
You don't want to lose this chance either.
You don't want to break up with him right?
There's something I want to keep too.
Isn't that fair?
So what?
So let's go out for a year without anyone knowing.
After a year, we'll probably grow sick of each other.
Fine.
Let's do that.
Since we just kissed, should we go and have sex?
"Motorcycle"
Don't answer it.
We're not finished talking.
Hey, honey.
Oh, I'm on my way home.
I'll be there soon.
That must be our house.
I see your car over there.
Okay, I'll be there soon.
See that?
Our relationship is great.
An affair?
Don't joke around.
When I was 6, you were 1.
When I was in college, you were in middle school.
Hurry up and go home.
The script?
What about it?
The female lead is a hotelier.
I was hoping you would look over it.
It's a romantic comedy?
I thought you weren't going to do that anymore.
I didn't want to, but the script was good.
Could you look over it?
Okay.
It's funny.
Is it really like this?
Yeah, it's accurate.
The writer must have done some research.
I thought this part was fun.
Oh.
Oh.
Why are they kissing here?
Isn't it possible?
They didn't like each other for the entire first half.
But he suddenly kisses her in this scene.
Men are like that if it's the right atmosphere.
Men are visually impressionable.
If a man is seduced or if she looks too beautiful.
or if she's breathtakingly sexy.
It's hard for men not to fall for women in that situation.
There's only one thought in your head.
What thought?
You think, "I need to have this woman."
If one of the two has a partner.
Can a man still do that?
Of course if the woman leads the man on.
How do women act?
Not sure.
Why did I act that way?
What?
No, it's nothing.
Women are a little different.
How are they different?
They're just different.
That's what I think.
Did you drink today?
A little.
I like the smell of alcohol.
What did you drink?
Sake.
Come here.
Hold on Sung Soo.
Touch me here like this.
The earlobes too.
Like this?
Keep going.
For how long?
A long time.
Keep going.
I'm sorry Kim Sung Soo.
For what?
Just stuff.
Here's your chance Sunwoo In Young.
Entertain me.
Fine, get ready Kim Sung Soo.
It's gonna be hot tonight!
You kissed 2 men in one night?
Two in one night.
Does that make any sense?
It's because of her that I don't have a man.
Which one was better?
It's a bit complicated.
But I liked both.
Evil girl.
She has no conscience.
For me, it's easy to choose which is better.
You've done that before too?
I've been dating for 20 years.
I've done it all.
When Bae Sung Hyun came towards me, I did think about Sung Soo for a moment.
But then he just disappeared from my thoughts.
Kissing Sung Hyun was so electrifying.
Soft and gentle.
Moist.
I like it rough.
Especially a man with facial hair.
Even when they shave in the morning, it grows stubbly by nighttime.
I love that stubble scratching at my skin.
I really, really like it.
For me, hands are important when kissing.
Rather than his lips, I was more excited by Kim Tae Woo's hands.
When his hand reached my butt...
It was the best!
That guy touched your butt, but he wouldn't sleep with you?
Right?
It's difficult for a guy to stop there.
But Kim Tae Woo's spit goes everywhere.
All over my face.
Why?
I like spit.
Even better is moaning.
Are there men who moan when they kiss?
I'm very sexy you know.
What I found out is that the lip's texture and touch is more important than the tongue.
The lips have to be moist.
Kim Sung Soo's lips aren't moist.
Oh, you've discovered your preference.
If you had never been adventurous, you would have thought Sung Soo's lips were the best.
This is why you need to date around.
That's how you know what you want.
Now what do I do?
I'll think of Sung Hyun every time I kiss Sung Soo.
This is why you need 3 men.
The first man for money, the second for comfort.
The third man is for our body's desires.
It's impossible to find a man who fulfills all 3 roles.
That's right.
Mission impossible.
Hello?
Yes.
You found him?
I'll be there in 30 minutes.
What?
They found the bastard.
That spineless bastard?
We're going with you.
No!
This is between the two of us.
We have to punish him.
I'm going to step all over the punk.
Girls, our separation must be beautiful.
The ending punctuation must be placed properly for the next sentence to be beautiful.
How beautiful must it be when someone turns their back to say goodbye?
The love that I fought so hard for is slipping away.
The diverging of scattered blossoms, we bless our inevitable departure.
Now it's time to go.
Towards the fruit-bearing autumn...
My youth, like a flower, dies.
Were you attacked?
This is illegal.
Kidnap, confinement, assault.
How could a lawyer do this?
They said you fell when you tried ran away.
No one hit you.
I told them not to touch you.
But...
I may commit murder tonight.
You ran away.
Why didn't you show up to the wedding?
I can't tell you.
Tell me why not.
Why didn't you come?
Why?
I was so pretty that day.
Everything was perfect.
Everything.
Everything was perfect, but the groom didn't show up.
Tell me...
Was there another woman?
Do you really have to know?
Of course I do.
There's a woman, right?
I don't have a woman.
Then what is it?
Is something wrong with me?
There's only one thing wrong with you.
It's a very important detail.
What is that?
You're not sexy at all.
What... what did you just say?
You don't excite me.
Are you talking about my breasts being too small?
How could this handle anything bigger?
It's not about your breasts.
I'm talking about your entire being.
You've got to be kidding...
You never even slept with me.
My breasts are small, but my butt is fine.
You even touched it.
Forget your butt.
I'd have to want to see it to want to sleep with you.
What are you talking about?
How many times have you and I kissed?
Over 5 hundred times.
But not once did my body feel anything.
What feeling?
When men get excited, a part of their body changes.
You know, right?
Do you think I'm stupid?
My body didn't change.
My body would have to react for me to sleep with you.
Weren't you just trying to protect me?
Is someone going to steal you?
Why would I protect you?
Are you a cultural asset?
I'm a treasure!
A national monument!
I'm a rarity in this world, a 30-something virgin.
Intellectual compatibility is important, but the body's important too.
How could I marry a woman who doesn't sexually turn me on?
Hold on.
Stop there.
Do you have more to say?
Why haven't you paid me my money?
What money?
You borrowed from me a month ago when we bought shoes at Apkujung.
Ah.
The 2 hundred dollars?
Fine, I'll pay you.
As we part, our fingers tremble.
Our flower petals fall away one by one.
My love, my farewell.
My soul saddens as spring fades under the snow of the land.
Hyun Joo had to go alone to the restaurant for which she had made a reservation.
Please give me course A.
And two glasses of house wine.
Shall I serve you when your guest comes?
No, I'm going to eat it alone.
Yes, I'll bring it over.
I've already spoken to the manager.
I'd like to request Chopin's Waltz No. 9, the Farewell Waltz.
True to her philosophy, Hyun Joo created a lovely farewell.
I loved you Tae Woo.
Live happily.
Cruel bastard.
I hope you meet a sexy woman and you bleed to death.
Hyun Joo spent the entire night crying.
But the next morning, she waited in front of the courthouse for Seo Yeon.
Why are you so late?
I told you to hurry.
Take off that necklace.
What about it?
You have to look as virtuous as possible.
Take it off!
If I wear this necklace, I'm a homewrecker.
And if I wear a proper necklace, I'm a virtuous woman?
Oh my God.
You're wearing perfume too?
How would the judge recognize a bachelor?
Shut your mouth and be still.
Just watch what I do closely.
Take it off!
Eventually, Seo Yeon stood before the court as an adulterer.
According to the plaintiff, Park Seo Yeon has admitted to adultery with Kang Do Kyung.
Is this true?
Well...
It's not true.
The defendant never admitted to adultery with Kang Do Kyung.
Nowhere in the plaintiff's deposition does it state that her husband Kang Do Kyung had sex.
In fact, we couldn't find a word that infers sex.
All the defendant did was let a former lover sleep over when he appeared drunk at her home.
This is not Park Seo Yeon's style.
The plaintiff states, "The two people slept together according to that woman."
I asked her, "Did you two really sleep together?"
The defendant replied, "Yes I did sleep with him."
Upon that statement, she decided it was adultery.
My client is a responsible business owner and respectable citizen.
Park Seo Yeon's pride was wounded by the fact that her adultery was evaded rather than admitted.
We expected that the defendant would make this argument.
Here is further evidence.
This is a statement the plaintiff's husband Kang Do Kyung wrote admitting to his adultery.
Hey!
Why did you lie?
I told you that I slept with him.
Good for you.
I admit if I do something.
I take responsibility for my actions.
I'll get the punishment if I deserve it.
That's the way it should be.
That's so great of you.
Go inside.
I have another case I have to take care of.
Hey, do you know how humiliated I felt because of you?
How about me?
You think I don't have ethics or morals?
If you weren't my friend, I would want to tie you up and beat you.
Now go!
At that moment, Seo Yeon made an important decision.
So humiliating.
If I ever sleep with a married man again, I'm going to the monastery.
That's right.
Let's just think of this as business.
I thought you had run away, but you didn't go very far.
Do you know you should feel shame?
Wasn't that a bit childish?
Since you had admitted it so coolly, I thought you wouldn't be a hypocrite.
You said adultery wasn't a big deal.
But why?
Are you scared of the law?
That lawyer was my friend.
That's right.
Even in court, it's not easy to send your kind to jail.
I sued you anyway so that you can suffer a thousandth of what I have to suffer.
Aren't you going to marry a man you love?
Do you know what family means to me?
I thought we would live happily ever after when this child was born.
But before this child is even born...
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
You're sorry?
Now you're sorry?
Don't be so mad.
It can't be healthy for the child.
How could you sleep with my husband when I have a child inside me?
Is it fine as long as it's kept secret?
If it has to happen, it's better if it's kept secret.
I understand you're upset, but please stop.
I'm really sorry.
Should I get down on my knees?
What are you saying?
You whore!
Why are you doing this?
How could you be so bold?
I said I'm sorry.
Oh my God!
Are you okay?
Oh no.
Is the baby coming out?
Do you have labor pain?
Someone please help!
Come inside my car.
Hurry and get up.
Let go.
You can kill me later.
You're in pain right now.
I can't live either if something happens to the child.
Troublemaker Park Seo Yeon.
She has no idea what's ahead of her.
Hold on a bit longer.
Seo Yeon rushed off with the woman in the car.
I think her contractions have started.
Yes, we're on our way.
All we have to do is get there in 2 hours.
Hold on a bit longer.
Shut up, you fucking bitch!
Okay, okay.
Where is your husband right now?
We have to call him.
He's not answering my calls, that bastard.
See that?
He doesn't answer my calls.
He doesn't answer my calls.
We're over now, so please forgive us and cancel the charge...
Park Seo Yeon, do you want me to kill you?
I've done all I can.
Going to jail won't undo what happened.
And I've made a decision.
From now on, I'm not even going to look at a married man.
My phone.
It's in my bag.
Number 1.
Number 1.
Hey, you bastard!
Why aren't you answering my calls?
How come you only answer your wife?
Why are you...
Hey, your wife's about to give birth!
What's wrong with you?
Let go of me!
Miss Sunwoo In Young?
Yes, over here.
Meanwhile, I received a package.
Answer my calls on this from now on.
I don't want to share cell phones with Motorcycle.
See if I take your call.
Hello?
Hello?
It's me.
Go ahead.
In Young.
Hey, Sung Soo.
What?
Spaghetti?
12-25.
My birthday.
I love punching that in every time.
Oh, what is that?
Couple aprons?
He must want to help me out.
This is definitely a woman's lipstick.
Yoon Kang Hee.
This witch came back.
Sung Soo?
Oh, it's you In Young.
What are you doing here?
Our interview was published, so I wanted to leave it for him.
Want to see the article?
The picture turned out nice...
How did you know the password?
Sung Soo couldn't have told you.
Who knows?
I told Sung Soo that I don't like you stopping by here.
Sung Soo wouldn't have done something I don't like.
That's true.
I looked over his shoulder.
It's 12-25.
It's my birthday.
Oh really.
So it was a special day...
If that's all, just leave it and go.
Oh, it's spaghetti.
I love spaghetti.
Go and buy some.
There are some good places around here.
Let's eat together.
All you need is more noodles.
If you want spaghetti, call me unni (older sister).
Don't call me In Young.
I'm not your friend.
Yes, Unni!
Hateful girl.
Should I go and slap her?
So what if she calls me Unni?
She hasn't tried to help me once.
Is the coffee done?
She only makes one for herself.
Such trash.
Do you have shrimp?
I like it with shrimp.
Kang Hee.
Can you go and buy some anchovies?
I forgot to buy them.
Sung Soo really loves anchovies.
Okay, Unni.
I'm letting her know I have a brain too.
It's me.
Can you buy some anchovies when you come?
Unni was home when I came.
Yes.
Hurry up.
We're almost done with the spaghetti.
Okay.
Who did you just call?
The director.
Hey!
Yoon Kang Hee!
Yes?
Are you going to keep playing around?
I can be mean when I want to.
Why are you suddenly like this?
You were playing around at the duty-free when you declared war.
I'm mean, but I have a good character, so I let it pass.
You'll get hurt if you do it again.
Just stick to today.
Did I do anything wrong?
I think it's meaningless for two girls to fight over one man.
It's not about you and me, but me and Kim Sung Soo.
But if you start something when the two of us are fine.
I don't like to waste my energy, but fine, I can fight you.
Look closely.
This is the front kick.
Want to see the side kick?
They had a brick wall in the basement parking lot.
Want to go?
No, no Unni.
Be careful, I can do Tae Kwon Do.
Third degree!
My father was a Tae Kwon Do master.
Don't play around.
If I make spaghetti, help make the sauce.
Got it?
Yes.
Hey, Kang Hee.
You're here Sung Soo.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Are you crying?
It's nothing.
You are crying.
What's wrong?
What's wrong with her?
How would I know?
Why are you crying?
Why?
I'm not crying.
Is the spaghetti finished Unni?
It'll take 5 minutes.
Sung Soo, go and change.
Okay.
Here.
I can't help it if I'm crying from fear.
Good for you.
So fragile that you cry easily.
Come and pour some water.
Okay.
But whose idea was the anchovy?
I thought you said they were too salty.
Didn't you say you liked them?
Huh?
Oh, I get it.
Unni must have been mad.
Since I wasn't helping out, you wanted to send me on an errand, right?
You were mad because I sent the director on an errand, right?
Okay, okay.
I'll do the dishes.
Do you want coffee?
I'll help with the dishes.
She's a guest after all.
Okay then.
By the way, I brought the magazine.
The pictures turned out great.
You look like an actor.
Really?
Let's look over it together.
What's with these two?
They're wearing couple aprons.
No, you should read over it alone.
These two must have done this before.
This is not their first time doing this.
They're so in sync.
Next time, I'll cook something tasty.
They're in harmony.
Did you wash up?
Yes.
Are you going to let Yoon Kang Hee keep visiting?
She even knows the password.
It's not like she'll steal anything.
It makes me feel bad.
I said it makes me feel bad.
Okay, okay.
I won't let her come.
Did you buy new lingerie?
Yes.
Come here.
No.
Not today.
Because of Yoon Kang Hee.
Come here.
What is this?
My man's kiss has changed.
Kim Sung Soo's kissing style has changed.
It's changed.
Something's happened to this man.
Did you park the bike right?
Yeah, it's stuck to yours.
Oh, I'm so tired.
Who said you should drink until morning?
And who provoked it?
Hey, you were all over me as soon as the door opened.
Ahh... fine.
I'm so tired...
Get up, wash up, come on.
I have to go to work.
I hate everything.
Shall I get you up?
Hey, Sunwu In Yung... you!
Ughh!
It's stinks!
Hey!
What you looking at?
Hey!
What you looking at?
Last night... it was good?
Huh?
I don't know...
I don't remember.
Oh, I'm disappointed!
I tried so hard after I woke up!
Worked so hard?
You didn't do much.
You come drunk again.
I won't open the door.
Hey, come on.
Even when drunk, I always did everything you asked.
You begin by kissing the forehead.
It's rude to feel the breasts before kissing.
When taking off the bra...
It's for the best.
Not just for me.
Yeah, for the best but sometimes a guy's in a hurry...
Last night, were you in a hurry?
Huh?
Yeah, I was in a major hurry.
What are you gonna do?
Okay, okay.
It's my fault.
I was in a hurry.
Okay?
In the beginning, we weren't this honest!
Yeah, I was!
Yeah!
There are two types of people in this world.
Cool people who don't remember promises made 10 years ago and those who still remember 10 year old promises.
On the day of graduation, we promised to each other 10 years later, at 23, we would meet on Christmas.
I thought it was a tacky promise.
I thought someone would show up.
I thought there would be another freak like me.
I decided to wait for that someone.
Among 50, I was the only freak.
It was Christmas.
That day...
It was my birthday.
Who are you?
Why are you doing this?
So, I am...
That is...
I am...
Kim Sung Su.
Huh?
6th grade...
Kim Sung Su.
Yes...
Hello.
You're still living in this neighborhood?
Yeah.
The house still the same?
Yeah.
Your parents?
They have an orchard in Cheongju.
My mom had cancer but she is fine now.
Thank God.
So you're living alone?
In that house?
My mom told me not to say that I live alone.
But you're not in our class so why you're here?
Well I was good friends with your desk mate, Oh Eun Ho.
I heard he immigrated to Canada in high school.
You came to see him?
No.
Then why did you come?
I don't know about the others but I knew you would come.
Why me?
You really don't know?
Yes.
I came to see how much you changed.
Oh...
I see.
Huh?
What's this?
It's snowing.
We're here.
The door has changed.
It was white before.
It was old.
If I knew you hadn't moved, I would come and see you before I went to study abroad.
Did you go to study abroad?
Yeah, I attend film school in New York.
I've returned to Korea in 3 years.
It's your birthday.
It was snowing that day.
It was Christmas.
It was my birthday.
Thanks.
And the guy who came from New York to see me offered me flowers and cake.
It was enough to become the stuff of legends... and I desperately needed romance since I was 23.
May...
I kiss you?
I thought it from childhood that my first kiss would be under that streetlight.
Ah... no.
Why not?
No...
You have a boyfriend?
No... not exactly.
There's someone you like, right?
No... it's just.
I didn't think there wouldn't be someone.
I was just curious what kind of girl you turned out to be.
Have you... kissed before?
On the cheeks...
I think it's okay.
This happened 10 years ago.
For 10 years afterwards, we've been together without much problem.
You've broken up, right?
It's written on your face.
It's been over 3 months since you last kissed.
We did, last night.
What's she talking about?
There isn't any tension that other couples have.
Yeah, really.
It's been a while since I saw the motorcycle man.
Motercycle is Kim Sung Su's nickname.
You broke up, right?
Or you're tired of each other?
Did you really break up?
We haven't seen him around.
Before, he would bring dinner with his motorcycle.
There's nothing wrong.
He is really busy and he sold his bike.
How's a jobless stay busy?
He's not jobless.
He's a film director.
Since you started working here, he's been making films and he hasn't made his debut?
That's right, he's preparing but not working.
Jobless.
No, he will make a movie soon.
Just you wait.
Coming to a theatre near you!
But then how does he eat?
Does he pay for the meals?
What?
!
Are you paying him to see you?
You also pay for the motels, right?
I can't believe this.
Really.
Manager!
Manager Sunwu!
Yeah, come in!
This is Motorcycle, right?
Huh, it's really Motorcycle!
Wow, he looks great dressed like this!
Look at the legs, they might do some damage, eh?
There's an interview. 5 pages.
I didn't hear about an interview
The press conference was a hit.
I didn't hear about a press conference!
Here, he looks like a model.
We knew that he was hot.
Well, manager, they asked him whether he has a girlfriend and said he didn't want to talk about his private life.
Don't want to talk about his private life.
Is he embarrassed about me?
They say Alex has checked in.
Yes, I know.
He asked for a box of ramen as soon as he arrived.
Huh?
Hey!
It's Mr. Motorcycle.
Yes, thanks for adding the Mr.
Everyone else calls him Motorcycle.
I have an invitation to the movie's preview.
You've already seen it, right?
It's good, huh?
Yeah... yeah.
You have many invitations, right?
Can you spare some?
Yeah...
Jerk... he didn't give me any invitations to the preview.
I'll try to get some.
Well, you'll get married soon.
He said he would propose when he premiered?
We've been together for 10 years and the girl's over 30 but the guy doesn't propose.
We have a problem.
He will.
He won't.
We've been together for 10 years.
He will.
Don't get your hopes high.
He's busy nght now.
Why it takes a month to propose?
A year?
He's not the type to leave someone who's been beside him.
Men are not animals using their brains.
They're instinctual animals.
He didn't even give you invitations to the preview.
He's finally debuted after struggling for 10 years.
If it were you, wouldn't you be tempted?
It's over, men change their minds over a 1,000 times.
Alright.
Stop it.
He cheated on you before!
It's been 10 years.
Ask if there's a guy in this world who hasn't cheated during 10 years.
Don't you know this expression?
Once a windmill, always a windmill.
Windmill that used to whirl to a fan, whirls to a nose breathing.
You cheat too.
Why all the fuss just because you're the storm that can beat a fan?
That's right.
I always say to my male co-workers don't hook up with a girl like me.
I can't stop being a player just because I want to.
I don't have control over my body nor do I have any control over my emotions.
You promised you wouldn't cheat.
Think it over.
Cheating is not a question of will.
It's something instinctual.
I should know since I'm an expert.
Is Sung Su like you?
Yeah, you think the whole world is a bed of roses!
Hey!
Says she's getting married.
The invitations are printed.
She just can't give them out due to circumstances.
Kang Hyun Ju, the girl is an expert in bad timing.
Wow, I'm so happy...
Congrats!
I don't know.
They haven't slept even once.
Is this something to congratulate?
Hey.
You haven't slept yet?
Getting married at 33 as a virgin.
Shouldn't there be a sign?
But.
No, it's your boyfriend who kept you a virgin for 3 years on whom we should hang the sign.
They don't call wedding night the first night for nothing.
What's to celebrate?
You liked your first time?
You get educated in your teens and in your 20s you get experience.
And in your 30s, you get to show your tricks.
But you have no experience and you know nothing.
So of course you don't have any tricks.
Which guy in his 30s hopes to sleep with a virgin?
He wants tricks.
A virgin girl with no tricks, that's not very attractive.
Okay, you have your reasons and the books are wrong.
So I want to make an effort of my own.
What effort!
That's of no use.
When he kisses you why aren't you using your hands?
Loosen his belt and stick your hand.
You can do that outside?
You haven't asked him in?
He won't come in.
Wow, he loves and cares for you.
Oh, come on, is she some crystal?
She breaks when they sleep?
What is he waiting for?
Hey, stop.
Why stop?
A friend's in trouble and we should just congratulate?
Okay, I'll congratulate.
Save it and when you hit 60, do it 3 times a day.
Fighting!
This couple has been together 3 years and they've only kissed.
That's of no use.
When you're kissing him don't waste your hand and loosen his belt and stick your hand.
What the...
It's late.
Go in.
You want to come in?
We're getting married soon.
I'll be going today.
Okay...
Sweet dreams.
But a guy proposed to Kang Hyun-ju and she's going to marry.
I've been with Kim Sung-su for 10 years and there's no proposal.
We've gone quite far and what's left is the wedding.
Hello, honey?
Why aren't you saying anything?
Hello.
A girl is calling his cell.
The butt.
You're listed as 'the butt' in his cell.
Did you drink a lot?
He drank with a journalist from Movie Week.
How should I know?
It was great and the reaction too.
We're going to hit big.
We?
Wake up, darling.
Why did you drink so much?
Director Kim, you've worked so hard.
Everyone from crew to the actors really made his life impossible.
After filming, we just let go and we get wasted often.
Did I do something wrong?
Sure you do.
You're pretty and young at that.
And a great body.
Sorry.
Dinner isn't sitting well.
Thanks for bringing him.
You're not living with him, are you?
Almost... why?
No... nothing.
Go in, please.
Could you return the cardigan?
The director gave it to me earlier since it was chilly.
I bought it for him last year for his birthday, okay?
Take it off.
I wore this throughout filming as if it were mine.
Take it off.
I must be weak, I get drunk so easily.
You're weak since you drink every day.
Have some honey.
I've brushed my teeth.
Did you drink?
I had a glass of wine with the girls.
That's Yoon Gang-hee, right?
The model, S Airlines.
Yeah.
Is she in your movie?
She's the protagonist.
Hmm...
She's cute?
Well, I don't know.
Why didn't you invite me to the preview?
Let me hear your excuse.
I'd like to hear it.
Because it seemed like trash.
Huh?
I didn't want to show you my film.
The film I want to make is something else.
This I made for money.
Since I needed to debut.
The was no other way.
I was ashamed to show you.
Why do you think that?
It was well received.
It's a guy thing.
There are things a guy doesn't want to show to the person he likes.
Why are you laughing?
I can smell that girl.
What smell?
It's not perfume.
It's a sweet scent.
Sickly sweet.
You know what her nickname is?
It's melon, melon.
Hey.
Yeah.
What's my scent like?
Your scent...
Yeah?
I smell myself in you.
It's the same scent.
I can smell in me.
I can't feel anything.
His hands are on my chest.
But there's no feeling.
It wasn't someone else's hand.
It felt like my hand.
Oh my, before my hair would stand up even if he touched me slightly.
Does this make sense?
Hey, there's someone who's still a virgin.
Well, that's you.
It can happen if you've been together for 10 years.
It's in the books.
Love has a deadline of 3 years.
And sexual arousal is a measure for love.
But still.
He smells himself in me and his body is like mine.
How am I supposed to take this?
It's been 10 years, so now it's all emotional.
And give up physical pleasure?
That's become boring.
Isn't there a solution?
Of course there is.
What?
What is it?
Huh?
You have to develop new tricks.
Well how do you do that?
First, vary your positions.
A human body is more flexible than you think.
With practice there isn't anything you can't do.
Full course and ditch the routine.
There is only one climax but the positions are infinite.
There's a reason why God created us in this way.
We need to research, explore and discover our bodies.
You haven't tried and yet all you do is complain.
I'm tired, there's no feeling it's over, all this is an insult to God.
You must be faithful.
If you're not willing to do that then I think it's over between you two.
It's going to get quite boring.
Anyways, it's over for you two.
He's not proposing.
It's been 3 years since we've moved on.
There's only one thing a girl can do in this situation.
One last kiss and end it in a cool way.
We've been together for 10 years.
Much has happened and I had a dream.
We would live like this, age together, get buried together... that dream.
Me, too.
Me, too.
Honey!
Yeah.
Be careful now.
Oh my.
Oh please.
Are you dumb or just stupid?
Or did you stop growing after junior high?
Guys never think of that.
You think they would dream of that with a girl?
And your guys, what do they dream about?
You don't know?
They only dream of one thing.
To sleep with all the women in this world.
They think they're forever 20!
Okay, let's give that to them.
But you know what's really bad?
They play around but they want their wives to be faithful to them.
Bad, bad guys!
I get all worked up just thinking about it.
They're simply less developed.
They need to return to prehistoric times and go hunting.
So is there a way guys can love us forever?
There is.
What is it?
Change guys every 3 months.
For 3 months, they're crazy over you.
It's over between you two.
Yot gotta break up.
- Hi, Alex!
What's up?
- Good morning!
How's the room?
You like it?
Yeah.
Totally.
Just great.
Gift.
I wanted to give it to you when I checked in but I was knocked out.
Wow, can't wait?
Love candles.
Use it with Motorcycle.
It'll be very romantic.
We're already romantic.
We don't need this.
Thanks.
Okay, I'm off.
- Okay.
- See ya.
You're not going to be difficult at the restaurant, right?
I won't because you might punish me.
Okay, I'm going.
Hey, you bought this.
Let me see.
Hey, it's Yoon Gang Hee.
She's the protagonist in my boyfriend's movie.
She must have a crush on him.
Let go.
May I be honest?
Director Kim is attractive.
We've worked together for over a year.
What did I know about movies?
I was totally frozen and the director made me feel comfortable.
And... he's handsome.
And I have a soft spot for smart men.
Now you know everything and I'm the type who can't hide things.
And I've told him that I like him.
He didn't seem to mind.
If he wants it, I don't see why we can't be together.
I'm 23 and an adult and today's fans are able to accept it.
Sure he's attractive and she's cute.
When did you buys this?
Is it good?
It's good.
It's comfortable to read books.
Do you have the list of guests who checked in today?
No, not yet.
Check the list first.
Today's Hanyung Construction CEO
Mr. Bae's wedding anniversary, right?
Yes, right.
Check the reservations at the restaurant and check the flowers and the cake, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
Has manager Park come to work?
What am I supposed to do?
Did you see today's article Hangang Sports entertainment section?
Read the interview.
She's really bad.
I don't need a loan!
Send one more spam and I'll call the police.
She's pretty?
Only 23.
I'm going crazy.
She's 10 years younger than us.
It's over.
How can he not give into temptation?
You know best how weak he is.
I'm going crazy.
What am I supposed to do?
I need to take a walk.
I couldn't sleep a wink yesterday.
Until when am I to suffer like this because of a guy.
These days I feel more lonely and sad.
Hey!
On a day like this you're not feeling much the cafeteria, right?
Shall we go out and eat today?
There's a new Japanese restaurant with a good lunch set menu.
I have an appointment.
Ah, really?
Sorry.
You'll have to eat on your own.
What can I do in a situation like this?
It's over between you two.
There's only one thing a girl can do.
Kiss and say goodbye.
A last deep kiss and end it cool.
Run before the sign changes.
Come on.
Why, what for?
Someone is following us.
Come on.
Hurry, hurry.
What's going on?
Are you out of breath?
Huh?
What's going on?
Someone's behind us?
Open your chest, also your arms.
Breate in and out.
Are we safe now?
Huh?
Huh?
Do you feel better?
Yeah.
Then let's go eat.
When you're confused it's best to run.
Come on.
It was corny and ticklish.
But it was somewhat soft and tender.
And filled with something warm.
There's a great place.
Hurry.
The sky is near, it's far.
I'm taller and smaller than the tree.
I'm bigger and smaller than Sung-hyun.
I'm thinking I shouldn't avoid it anymore.
I've got to face it!
Hey!
Did you have dinner?
Yeah, at the hotel.
You should have waited at home.
It'll be over in 2 hours.
I read the interview with Yoon Gang Hee.
Oh, that.
Is it bothering you?
Yes, it does.
I want to know how you feel.
You shouldn't worry over something like that.
That's your opinion.
How do you feel?
Can I be honest with you?
That's why I'm here.
She's great, confident, happy, cute.
She makes those around her happy.
You feel overwhelmed because she doesn't hold back.
Even if you're cold she don't seem to mind.
Very true to her feelings.
It's both a strength and a weakness.
I don't want to lie, I get excited when I see her.
It's true, I like her.
But it's not everything, I have you.
You get excited with her.
And with me.
Me?
I'm not going to leave you.
We've been together for so long.
I don't get excited anymore.
But you and I are like family.
You're like my sister, like my mother and sometimes like my younger sister, like my daughter.
That's not necessarily bad.
Right, that's not bad.
Everyone ages likes that, not just me.
Guys... when they meet other women, they get tempted.
A lot?
Yeah.
Honestly I did.
Why didn't you break it off with me.
How can I...
I'm responsible for you, I am.
Responsibility.
Duty.
Not love but responsibility.
Duty.
I'm not going to throw you away In Yung.
Kim Sung Su, why are you being so tacky?
Am I some trash you're going to throw away?
That's not what I mean.
Let's go.
I want to go home.
I shouldn't have asked.
It's all because of Bae Sung Hyun.
In Yung!
In Yung, don't get angry.
In Yung!
Why are you being...
Shall we buy some beer?
No.
It wouldn't be a bad idea.
Let's drink.
No.
I want to sleep alone tonight.
Then why did you ask?
You told me to be honest.
It's no good for you to know how I really feel.
I know you're feeling awful but what can I do.
Did I sleep with her?
Or date her behind your back?
Did I cheat on you?
Why are you playing the victim?
You did cheat.
You talk as if you never did.
It's been over 5 years and you bring it up when it's almost forgotten.
I don't know about you but I never forget it.
So?
What's the point of bringing up the past?
Whatever's old decays and rots.
When time passes everything changes.
It's the same with love.
My love is rotting now.
Can't you see I'm trying hard not to hurt you again?
And so you expect me to reward you?
Okay, fine.
Whenever I see her, I get excited.
But since I don't want to hurt you, I've tried so hard!
Can I kiss you?
A kiss on the cheek... would be fine.
Let's break up.
Let's end it here.
Let's break up.
The streetlight that witnessed our beginning 10 years ago.
Is now witnessing our silently farewell.
Subtitles by DramaFever
My 7th love was finished in a heartbeat.
All anxieties in my head were gone now.
It's a good thing.
I was very unstable at first.
But look at me now.
It's so simple.
Since I know he hates me, there's nothing I should feel nervous about.
Think about it.
If Seok Hyun hates me, would my many good points disappear?
Am I not attractive anymore?
I really am okay.
Yeah.
You do look really okay.
There's more important stuff than love.
There are so many children who starve to death.
I'm not going to cling to a man like him and live for the world.
- Yeah, I hope you will.
- Yeah, I hope you will.
The coffee beans here are all original?
Of course, they are.
I'm going to use this cup for take out coffee.
You should try to save the world.
We've been doing that since we opened the shop.
Really?
I'm okay.
I'm really okay.
But...
I'm not okay that he's so fine about this.
I can't believe he's playing catch with Kang Na Hyun.
He's like a weed in my life.
I'm going to pull all of them.
I thought I was doing just fine...
But I got a cold.
My body and heart were in so much pain.
Yeol Mae, are you up yet?
You're up.
Why didn't you answer me?
Let me see.
Bite.
Don't call my name and if you need something, just come in and tell me.
Do I have to do everything you say?
38.9 Celsius.
Same as me.
Get up.
I made a chicken soup.
Let's go see a doctor after we eat.
Let's go get a shot.
Why do we always catch a cold together?
People don't usually catch a cold in midsummer.
It happened since we were young.
If I'm sick, he gets sick.
When we are sick, we have chicken soup together.
We're in the same environment.
It's like we live together.
We have the same food and lifestyle.
And we got on a cruise together too.
Don't interpret everything like that.
Can't you just admit that we are meant to be?
We're not just random people to each other.
Just eat so we can go to the hospital.
Are you okay?
There's something between us that can't be explained.
Don't you think so?
I got very cold from last night.
- My head hurts.
- I don't cough that much.
I couldn't sleep because my body was so sore as if somebody beat me up.
Let me see your throats.
Your throats are swollen too.
Seok Hyun, are you sleeping?
- No, I'm not.
- I want to ask you something.
Go ahead.
Why did you like me at first?
Why do you need to know that now?
I want to know.
I liked you because you were smart, pretty and fun to be with.
Are you happy now?
So you dumped me because now I'm stupid, ugly and not fun?
I'm still smart, pretty and fun.
You are sick now.
Get some sleep.
Let's talk about that later, okay?
Do you really think we're sick because of the cold?
This is a mental thing.
Because we're so hurt mentally, our body got hurt too.
I understand you being sick because you got dumped.
Why am I sick then?
Your heart doesn't know, but your body knows how much you love Joo Yeol Mae.
I'm going to sleep.
You think you don't love me, but when you realize you do...
I might be with a different man.
Think about me kissing, hugging and sleeping with a different man.
If you can't do it, imagine me doing that with your eyes closed.
Isn't your heart breaking?
It's not like this is our first break up.
Do you think I don't feel hurt even it's not my first break up?
I'm hurt.
I'm very hurt mentally and physically.
Try to close your eyes and sleep.
You'll get better then.
I know I can't change his mind by acting like this.
But I can't stop.
- Seok Hyun.
- Why?
Did you really like me?
Before your brother got sick, we had a wedding at the arboretum.
It was for fun but we exchanged rings and..
You just don't listen me.
How can I make you shut up?
I'm doing this to understand you.
I'm trying not to hate you.
Just hate me.
It'd be easier for a bird-brain like you to understand that way.
I'm getting a divorce today.
Congrats.
This is a gift.
Congrats!
Be confident.
Fighting!
Since when did we celebrate a break-up?
Jae Kyung, is everything okay if you're okay?
Ji Hee, since when did you become a cool woman?
Especially, Yoon Seok Hyun.
Congrats?
Congrats?
This is all you could say?
You haven't become a human yet.
My hurt is so painful as if someone put salt on my heart.
I can't breath and I'm freaking out.
And this is all you could say?
I was saying that to Jae Kyung.
I'm sorry I was frustrated.
Anyway, a break up is not something we should celebrate.
It's something we should console.
Jae Kyung, let's overcome this together.
I'll be good to you.
I'll be a good friend to you.
Ticket number 5555.
Come in.
All right.
Lee Jang Woo and Seon Jae Kyung, are you two sure that you both have agreed to divorce?
Yes.
Lee Jang Woo, you did agree to divorce?
- Mr. Lee Jang Woo.
- Hey, hey.
There's no camera in here.
Let's stop acting out and finish this.
- Do you need more time?
- No, no.
Hey, do you want to divorce or not?
Do you want me to leech off you forever?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
I'll agree to divorce.
You should at least say sorry to me.
Say sorry.
I don't have a recorder.
Want to check my purse?
I can forgive you if you apologize from the bottom of your heart.
I can't say sorry because I haven't done anything wrong to apologize.
We live in a world where the strong prey upon the weak.
What should I do to survive?
I didn't do anything wrong.
I just responded with animal instinct.
So trampling me was what you did to survive?
I should survive.
Should I save you while I'm dying?
You're a much sadder human than I expected.
I can't say I enjoyed it but I can say thank you.
Thank you for the divorce and letting me be who I really am.
I was very worried that I might end up being like you forever.
Do you want to bet who would win?
Why would I bet with you?
You're already at the bottom.
You're a woman who has two faces but no shame with an affair.
This is you.
You're an official bitch now.
I know I'm an adulterer but I kept my nobility because of you.
I didn't tell anybody how dirty, childish, cheap and vicious you are.
And even if I'm at the bottom now, I have nobility.
A life is long.
And the world is not that simple just like you said.
You did lie too.
You lied that you love him.
You were just playing with him.
What makes you think that?
There's no way that you could love a man.
Sorry, Lee Jang Woo.
I'm so sorry for not loving you.
I mean it.
The sun is so bright today.
Step out, everyone.
Here comes a divorcee.
Jae Kyung walked very confidently.
But what was waiting for her at her office was... a breakup from her employees.
We've worked together for years.
We've made our own brand and ran our business well.
Our new launching show is very soon.
If we overcome this situation..
How are we going to do the launching show without money?
Our CEO was caught in an affair.
Who would invest in our business?
Honestly, I'm disappointed in you too.
- You guys can call it love but..
- Can't you trust me?
We've worked together for 5 years.
Even if everyone call me a bitch, you guys know that I'm not a bad person.
Do you know you haven't paid us for months?
I don't have any money.
I can't keep doing this.
If you don't pay us in a month, I'm going to report it to the police.
I know I can do it.
If they would bear with me just this once, I was going to pay them.
Even if she was very cool with her divorce, she cried because of her other breakup.
Kiss!
They should kiss.
That way, the story would go on.
Even Jae Kyung cried but Yoon Seok Hyun is just fine.
The kiss scene in this situation is so random.
They're in the meeting room.
Think about the background.
A big table, hard chairs and the distance between the two.
It's impossible to kiss.
Why did they have a meeting in a place like that?
What if the distance is this close?
Then they can kiss.
Sit down.
They are so funny.
It's just going to be a peck then.
Not a french kiss.
Seok Hyun.
Didn't you want to kiss me just then?
If a girl kisses a guy first like this, a guy would definitely kiss her back.
You're too ugly to kiss.
Stop that and go buy some milk.
Fine.
Did you take the medicine?
I'm asking if you did.
If you date her, I'm going to kill you both and serve a life sentence.
The moment I saw his laugh... the deep wound inside of me opened up and bled out.
You laughed?
Did you just laugh?
What's the reason that I shouldn't date Kang Na Hyun?
We slept together when we wanted to and then broke up.
It's not legally, morally, ethically wrong.
Don't you think so?
Conscience comes before laws, morals and ethics.
There isn't right, wrong or conscience in love.
I don't care if I date her or not.
I'm going to do what my hearts wants.
It's none of your business.
I hate him.
It's not going to do any good for you if you keep doing this.
Just accept it.
You said you're going to give me chance, right?
But no thank you.
Don't wait for me.
I don't easily take back what I decide.
And I don't take it back even if I regret my decision.
You know that better than me.
As much as I like him and love him, the hatred and loathing got deeper.
I'm so jealous how you're as firm as a rock.
And you're so fine about breaking up with me.
Yeah, I'm just fine.
So you get your head on straight.
If I have to end this relationship here, I should break it into pieces.
Yoon Seok Hyun, I'm wearing very sexy underwear now.
What do you think about that?
You shouldn't have said that Joo Yeol Mae.
You're probably so curious about my waist line between my bra and panty.
No, I'm not.
Are there any underwear that I haven't seen?
Are you really not?
This one's new.
A red one.
Do you want to see it?
Seok Hyun, I bought milk...
Then never mind.
You follow me.
I'm going to end this love and never look back.
What did you say before?
- Your panty is what?
- Why did you sleep with me?
You did it because I wanted it.
Only I wanted it, right?
Fine, I still had feelings for you.
- Sounds like you don't anymore?
- I don't anymore.
I'm so tired of you.
You're creeping me out.
I look easy to you because I keep clinging to you?
Yes, you do.
You still don't know why we broke up?
Look at us now.
You and I have to see it to the end.
Why do you think we always fight?
Is it all my fault?
Fine, it's never your fault.
It's just we don't get along.
The reason we fight is you're not honest and act like a coward.
Fine, I'm breaking up so I can become a good man.
It's not that you want to be a good man.
It's just that you want to date a girl who says you're a good man.
That's so childish.
You're mean.
Yeah, I know because you tell me that every 10 minutes.
- Glad you know that.
- You..!
I'm not honest?
I'm a coward?
I'm mean?
Fine!
You're so attractive because you're honest and brave.
But you're ill-tempered!
What about you?
Do you not have a short temper?
Do you know why I'm ill-tempered?
You can't say "I'm sorry" or "I love you"
but you're very good at saying things that would hurt people's feeling.
I don't want to talk to you.
Have you ever thought of the reason why I broke up with you?
Because I liked you very much.
You knew how I felt about you but you never satisfied me.
If I came close to you, you always pushed me away.
I couldn't take it anymore.
That's why I broke up with you.
Fine.
So let's just end this for sure.
Okay?
We're officially over here, okay?
Yeah, we are over.
Yoon Seok Hyun.
Look at this stick.
You always pushed me away from this circle.
Whenever you pushed me away, I tried to fight and wait.
I was very tired and lonely but I'm not going to live like that anymore.
It's really over now.
You must be so happy to be inside this circle alone.
You will be alone forever with this circle.
Yeol Mae knew that what I wanted to protect was only this much space.
But she doesn't know what I'm protecting in this circle.
She shouldn't know this until the end.
This is all I want now.
- Is it really over?
- Yeah, trust me.
All good things come to those who believe.
Can I hook him up with any woman?
Yes, you can.
I'm willing to respect her if she comes through his circle.
- What if she's Kang Na Hyun?
- No, anyone but her.
I can't see them dating!
Oh my gosh.
- I just realized a shocking thing!
- What is it?
That we will never be main characters in a romance movie.
- Why?
- Why?
You guys watched a movie called 'Spring goes away', right?
Lee Young Ae and Yu Ji Tae are in it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Do you remember the scene where they broke up?
Let's break up.
- I'll be good.
- Let's end it.
Do you...
love me?
How..
can love be changed?
Let's break up.
This is what a breakup looks like in a movie.
It's beautiful, willful, calm, and sad.
First, a woman is very innocent and kind.
Unlike you.
Think of what you've done.
You haven't become a human yet.
My pain is as if someone poured salt on my wound.
I can't breath and I'm freaking out.
And this is all you could say?
If you date Kang Na Hyun, I'm going to kill you both and serve a life sentence.
You'll be alone forever in this circle.
Anger, threats and curses.
Those aren't what a main female character would do in a movie.
Who would like a scary woman?
Don't you agree?
You know I work at a theater.
Audiences would hate this kind of movie.
They'd understand why you got dumped.
Don't you think so?
You should be lovely until the end.
Even if she breaks up, even if she sheds tears of blood, she smiles in front of her boyfriend in a movie.
You should play the villain in a romance movie.
Or a psycho.
Damn it.
It's Ho Joon again.
- Look at us.
- Didn't you break up yet?
I'm not going to see him again.
It's not just you.
It's for me too.
You watched 'You're My Sunshine', right?
The one with Jeon Do Yeon and Hwang Jung Min?
Yeah, the main female character got AIDS in the movie, right?
What if you get infected by me?
People say I'll die soon.
Say something.
Say something, Kang Ho Joon!
What happened to your voice?
What's wrong?
What's wrong, Ho Joon?
Ho Joon.
Love is something that can beat AIDS.
But Ho Joon and I are...
You can't even feel an orgasm.
You're like a tree!
You're like a stone!
A huge stone!
Have you watched a movie where a couple breaks up because of their sex life?
- No.
- No.
A frigid woman like me can't be a main character in a romance movie.
We're so pitiful, aren't we?
- Then what about me?
- Don't you know?
You really don't know?
Can a divorcee not be in a movie?
Didn't you watch the movie 'In The Mood For Love'?
I did, I did.
The music in the movie is so good.
What's the movie about?
Look.
These two are a couple and these two are a couple.
But the woman from this couple and the man from the other couple fell in love.
And this man from this couple and this woman from the other couple fell in love too.
It's like having a revenge affair!
It's just like me.
Not funny.
Even if it's an affair, it's not like yours.
They have a platonic love until the end.
They didn't have any physical contact.
-They don't have sex at the end?
-Yeah.
There's no implication that they will?
No.
Even if they had an affair first?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Why don't they?
They love each other.
Why not have sex?
They are freaks.
You think a main female character can be an adulterer?
What's wrong with our lives?
It's not about our lives.
It's about our characters.
Yeah, it is.
So we went to see a fortune teller.
She's a very well know fortune teller.
You don't even need to tell her your birthday.
She doesn't ask your name or age.
She knows everything the moment she sees your face.
- Really?
- It's just superstition.
Let's just do it for fun.
She might be good.
All three of you are coming together or separately?
- All together.
- Come in.
Right ears.
Left ears.
Show me your right hands.
Left hands too.
Since when did you guys become friends?
From 8th grade.
- You three hold your hands together.
- What?
Do you not understand Korean?
Hold each other's hands.
- You guys should be good to each other.
- We are.
Even if you guys have a fight, just let it go.
Support and believe in each other.
I've never seen people like you in my life.
You guys were born with the same destiny.
What kind of destiny?
You three are ill-fated!
- Very very ill-fated.
- Really?
- Aren't I a bit different than these two?
- What's wrong with that?
It's not only that.
You three are not lucky with men.
You guys are even kicking out a man who wants to be with you.
I've never seen such an ill-fated fortune before.
How could people survive in this fortune?
It must've been very hard to go through.
Not you guys.
The men that dated you.
I have 3 sons and I'm afraid that I'll get a daughter-in-law like you guys.
Does this make sense to you?
If we're made out of your ribs... there should be another rib that matches with me.
I was born without a dad and my mom passed away when I was 18.
I've only had Yoon Seok Hyun in my life.
And now you're saying I won't have any man in my life?
- It's just superstition, right?
- You probably have a different plan for us.
Please say something!
Please!
Sisters.
Is there something worrying you?
Woo Ji Hee, are you not wearing your bra?
Joo Yeol Mae, unfold your skirt now.
Look at your hair.
Why are you sticking your chest out like this?
- Teacher!
- Teacher!
Woo Ji Hee, Joo Yeol Mae, and Seon Jae Kyung.
- Woo-Joo-Seon?
(Spaceship)
- Yeah, that's right!
You guys haven't become human yet!
You're drinking in church?
How come you guys haven't become humans yet?
You're over 30!
Why are you hitting us?
I don't want to live!
Can a nun hit people like this?
You guys deserve that.
By the way, Jae Kyung, you're in the newspaper because of adultery.
You're so mean.
This place is for sinners, you know?
You guys shut your mouths and follow me.
I'm a sinner.
Damn thong.
Who told us to go to church?
Who would it be?
It's Woo Ji Hee.
Who told us to go see the fortune teller?
Who would it be?
It's Woo Ji Hee.
Guys, goodbye.
I have to go to work early in the morning.
Guys, I love you!
- We love you too.
- Bye.
Everyone in their 30's knows that even if they're over 30, life isn't as different as they think.
There isn't a very good thing or a very bad thing in life.
It's not certain that what's good now will still be good later.
And I know what's bad now can be a good thing later.
Everything is all right.
This isn't a bad life at all.
Because since the day my mom passed away, I've been alone.
Eat.
Here.
I'm eating only if you're eating.
Here.
Will anything good happen to me?
I don't think there are any good things coming to me in my life, Seok Hyun.
There will be.
You have me.
I'm not going to let you be alone.
I'll stay with you like your mom and dad.
I'll promise you.
So let's eat.
I'll eat after you eat.
I wish there were traffic lights in my life.
Stop.
Dangerous.
It's safe.
Be careful.
Turn right.
Turn left.
You can go straight.
I wish someone could tell me like this.
There will be rain tonight.
If you're home, take an umbrella with you.
If you don't have it with you, I can bring you one.
This was your forecaster, Shin Ji Hoon!
Honey.
Where would be my heart be in my body?
I don't know where it is so I just have to bear with the pain.
Damn it.
She should've brought an umbrella with her.
Seok Hyun, where have you been?
I had to buy something.
- Na Hyun.
- Yes?
Turn on the lights for the yard.
Okay.
My heart is breaking.
I don't want to go in a house where there are no lights on.
Yoon Seok Hyun, I'm sleeping at the studio.
You probably don't wait for me anyway.
Hey, Joo Yeol Mae!
Why are you soaked?
What were you doing?
Are you coming from the studio?
Why did you warn me one minute before it started raining?
- You jerk.
- I'd bring you one, if you called me.
- Why?
- You said I'm your friend.
And if a woman I like walks around like this, would I be happy?
Aren't you cold?
See?
You got a cold.
It's not because of the rain.
I've been sick for days.
Why did you get rained on when you're sick?
Do you want me to make a hot tea for you?
Do you want to come to my house?
Are you perverted or innocent?
What do you mean?
Do you want to flirt with me in this situation?
I don't believe you like me.
Why don't you believe me?
Are you not confident in yourself?
No, I'm not at all.
I told you I got rejected by a man I like.
Let's go to my house.
You should get changed at least.
I am not going to try to do anything to a broken hearted woman.
I told you I have a black belt in Taekwondo.
Don't do anything suspicious.
Come here.
Let's drink.
You were walking in the rain just because you got rejected?
Are you a teenager?
Aren't you wondering why I got dumped?
Use a different word.
Are you trash?
I wish I was a trash.
I wouldn't have a heart, right?
I don't know because I'm not trash.
This is top secret.
I'm only telling this to you.
I got dumped because I have a bad personality.
How bad is it?
He said I go until the end, to the point that it makes him crazy.
He said I make that happen.
If I say it like this, it's not like it's my story.
Every man isn't like him.
Can't you not make that face?
It makes me very uncomfortable.
Are you trying to flirt with me?
Damn it.
I wasn't going to say this but I think I should.
There's a man whose life was saved, because of you.
Because of your personality.
- You saved my life.
- How did I do that?
I started to like coffee when I was on a trip to Africa.
I stayed at this hotel but one day I borrowed someone's car and lost my way back.
The car was broken and there weren't any cars passing by.
So I walked because I thought there would be a village if I kept walking.
But even if I walked for 3 days, there was no water or people.
I thought I was going to die there.
So I gave up and lied down.
But all of a sudden this woman I met a long time ago, popped in my head.
That's me?
- Don't your fingers hurt?
- It hurts me so badly.
- I got a cramp on my fingers.
- A cramp?
Can't feel anything?
If people's fingers hurt, they usually stop playing it because it hurts too bad.
But some people want to play a little bit more because it hurts.
When they stop playing because it hurts, it will continuously hurt them.
Because a callus hasn't formed yet.
But for people who keep playing the guitar, a callus forms on their fingers.
So play more even if it hurts.
5 minutes more, 10 minutes more.
Then your fingers won't hurt you anymore.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
But how did that save your life?
I gave up everything and lied down but what you said popped up in my head.
A little bit more...
a little bit more...
So I started to walk again.
When I felt like I couldn't walk anymore, I told myself, a little bit more... a little bit more.
And I finally found a village.
So you've become my destiny.
Not because you're pretty or sexy.
You really should be good to me then.
I am your savior.
I wouldn't say you're my savior but I've wanted to see you one more time.
I'm glad that my personality saved someone's life.
Yeah!
So whenever you see me think about how you saved me and how great you are.
Be confident.
Don't have an inferiority complex.
- Speaking of which, cheers!
- Cheers!
What a good dog.
Judy and Soon Soon, your mom didn't sleep at home last night.
She didn't go to Jae Kyung or Ji Hee's house.
When she comes, just go bite her, okay?
Did she sleep at the studio?
I'm glad Ji Hoon stayed with me last night.
He kind of looks cute.
He looks so scary in a way.
I bet you were stupid when you were young.
I'm going.
Thanks for last night.
I heard everything.
The atmosphere changed in this room.
When I was about to stop breathing... his lips were on mine.
That's it for today.
Bye.
You must be crazy, Joo Yeol Mae!
How are you going to see him?
Where did you sleep?
Are you crazy?
How could you..
You don't have the right to do that.
You're not my boyfriend or husband.
Don't care where I sleep or who I sleep with.
It's none of your business.
Go get your clothes and change.
- No.
- Are you really going to do this?
What did I do?
You don't usually sleep out without telling me.
I don't have the right to care who you date or love.
But just know this one thing.
Don't ruin yourself.
If you worry about me that much, you should live with me.
How come you broke up with a woman that you care so much about?
I'm going to live however I want.
I'm going to date a man, when I want to or when I don't want to.
I'm going to kiss and sleep with a man if I want to.
What's wrong with that?
If you're going to live like that, don't even think about coming home.
Is it your house?
I don't have anywhere to go besides that house!
Yes, you do.
You do, Joo Yeol Mae.
Let's go.
We should eat breakfast.
Don't think about anything.
Let's go in.
You'll be alone forever in this circle.
Do you know what you just did?
Yes, I do.
He's the one I like.
Are you going to cling to him when he says he doesn't like you?
Don't think about how you can change his mind.
Just end it here.
And use that energy to find another man.
I don't care if it isn't me.

Yoon Seok Hyun.
It'd be hard.
If you're here, come clean the house.
Yoon Seok Hyun, get your co-author out of here.
- What are you doing?
- You wanted her out.
- Sleep in your house.
- I should know why you did that.
- Why did you do that?
- Shh.
It's over anyway.
I want to break up with you.
I can't stand it.
These are my break-up gifts.
Goodbye, Ho Joon.
Shin Ji Hoon, make me fall in love you.
I'll give you a chance.
"The Mind is Noble, but the Body is Hot"
The sound of his breathing is different.
His kiss has changed.
His body is different.
As he was caressing the small of my back, his hand stopped.
Was he thinking of another woman?
Did he get surprised when he realized it was me?
Someone has come between the two of us.
I was totally fooled.
They were calling each other honey and dear.
Who would've guessed they were having an affair?
Episode 6 They were calling each other honey and dear.
Who would've guessed they were having an affair?
They were calling each other honey and dear.
Who would've guessed they were having an affair?
For five years, the front desk thought they were a couple.
They even talked about their kids.
That's right.
And at the restaurant.
That's right.
The wife came today, and she was so loud.
I knew the two were having an affair from how they used their bed.
Really?
What married couple would make the bed so messy?
How is it for married couples?
Married couples don't do anything so the bed is clean.
Really?
The wife's so dumb.
How could she not know her husband's been having an affair for five years?
How could she have known?
They hid it from her.
You've never been married.
She should have known better.
That's right.
His eyes would have changed.
He looks at his cellphone too often.
He pays more attention to how he dresses.
He comes home late.
Does that mean he's cheating?
You never know.
Just catch him in the act and it's game over.
Really?
That's right.
That's why I divorced him.
I thought he was acting weird, but the definitive thing was when he said.
"You don't usually groan, do you?"
I groan a lot you know.
But I can't keep up with other women.
Oh really!
I've developed a lot by trying different things.
On top of that, he started flipping me around and putting me on a chair.
So I knew he was cheating on me.
He was sleeping with another woman.
That's how I found out.
A woman's intuition.
Is there such a thing?
Of course there is.
There is.
That's right.
There is.
A woman's intuition.
There is no greater confirmation than this feeling I have.
His cellphone is locked.
Do you prefer this or this?
This one.
Then I'll get this one.
I'm going to give this to him as a gift.
Could it be Yoon Kang Hee?
Oh, it's unlocked.
What did I press?
Yoon Kang Hee

6/29 La Défense Pension
Some women have days that are unforgettable.
June 29th, 10 years ago was that kind of day for me.
Ten Years Ago, June 29th
What do we do?
I can't miss the last bus.
Driver!
Driver!
Driver!
Sir, slow down!
Thank you.
Hurry, hurry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I should have let this bus go.
I totally regret it.
Then why didn't you?
Fool.
You don't have to go to work?
You said your mom is coming.
You said it can't be overnight.
You're such a fool.
Why did you stop a bus already on its way?
Mister!
Please stop the car!
Hey.
There it is.
Let's go.
Wait here.
This place is expensive.
Do you have money?
I have money.
Be natural.
That's right.
Be natural.
Let's go somewhere else.
Why?
I don't have enough money.
Should I give you some?
Forget it.
We have so many visitors.
There are no rooms.
So why did you miss the last bus?
Are we going to stay like this?
Then what should we do?
I don't know.
What should we do?
I'm not even tired.
Do you want to drink?
Should we drink first?
I don't want to be drunk when we do it.
Then let's just sleep.
But I'm not tired.
I'm not tired either.
Let's lay down for now.
Shouldn't we kiss first?
Oh right.
Kiss.
That morning, as I saw the sun come up, I felt like a new person.
Things that I had seen before looked different.
I felt like an adult.
I even felt that I had become a bit dirtier.
I felt I had become a woman.
No longer just a girl.
I felt I had lost and gained something at the same time.
I felt sad about what I lost, and fearful of what I had gained.
Were you crying?
That's how one world closed and another world opened.
But everything was beautiful.
Sung Soo remembers that day too.
In some ways, it might not be Sung Soo's that changed, but my body.
Has my body become strange?
I'm sleeping at home.
I forgot some files for a meeting tomorrow.
Why was I suspicious of Sung Soo?
I feel so guilty, I can't stand sleeping next to him.
The concierge's duties aren't restricted to certain domains.
We do anything and everything.
If the guest wants something, we have to do everything to get it done.
We're the guest's what?
Their problem solver.
That's right.
It's the man who changed my body.
No, the man who touched my body's feelings.
He's crazy.
How could he come here so early in the morning?
In Young.
What are you doing right now?
So this pillar.
You know these pillars in the hotel lobby.
So why they're here is because...
You know people we want to hide from our guests?
For their lifestyles, these pillars...
Aren't pillars meant to prevent the building from collapsing?
Well, sure they do that too.
For this and that reason.
What if he calls?
Should I answer or not?
He should have called before.
Why is he trying to shock people?
This is why people have to live purely and morally.
Sunwoo In Young.
Why did you kiss another man?
Ah.
I didn't turn on the cellphone.
No missed calls.
No one's calling.
Bae Sung Hyun.
Follow me now.
Keep your distance when you follow me.
Hurry up.
What is it?
Why are you here?
You already handed in your letter of resignation.
You may not take me seriously just because you kissed me that night.
I'm 33.
You're still stuck on age?
Is age the only weapon you have?
So what is it you want to say?
The kiss didn't mean anything.
It may have been a big deal for you, but it meant nothing to me.
It wasn't any different from holding someone's hand.
Why?
It's not a big deal holding someone's hand.
Why are you doing this?
What if someone sees?
Who cares if someone sees?
What about it?
Everyone at this hotel knows I've had a boyfriend for 10 years.
I might as well be a married woman.
That's why I said we should keep it a secret.
Have you given it some thought?
Hey!
What thought would I give?
If you need more time, think it over.
Where are you going?
Do I need your permission to go somewhere?
Well, you should do what you came here to do while you're at it.
I already did what I had to do.
Didn't you see me come out of the bathroom?
Didn't you come to see me?
I didn't come to see you.
I came here for something else.
Why would you think I came to see you?
Did your imagination run wild?
Nevermind, if it's not.
But it's true that I like seeing you.
I missed you.
Does the new concierge listen well?
He's stupid like you.
It's not the new employee that's weird.
You're the weird one.
Everyone becomes weird around you.
What about me?
Think carefully about my proposal.
First promise me something.
Now what?
Agree that nothing happened that night.
Forget that you kissed me.
Aren't you the one who can't forget it?
If you want to forget it, forget it.
I'll do what I want with my memories.
But it's true that I like seeing you.
I missed you.
Meanwhile, Seo Yeon was anxiously pacing in the Obstetrics Gynecology unit.
Are you Hwang Eun Joo's guardian?
Did it come out?
She's had contractions all day, but the opening of the uterus has only moved 3 centimeters.
I don't think she can handle it much longer.
She needs a cesarean section.
This is the consent form.
Read this over and sign it.
What's your relationship to the patient?
The thing is...
If you're not immediate family, please call someone who is.
Can't I just sign it?
Are you immediate family?
You said the surgery was urgent.
Still, it might be a problem if you're not immediate family.
You said the surgery was urgent.
I'm her younger sister.
Satisfied?
Are you really her sister?
Yes I am.
Don't we look alike?
Please come here.
Do Kyung can't come because he doesn't have a plane ticket.
He's been waitlisted at the airport.
Are you okay?
You didn't even eat.
The surgery will be over soon.
That's right.
Don't be scared.
It'll be over when you wake up.
How's her heart rate?
Normal range between 120-60.
Seo Yeon felt guilt for the first time since committing her adultery.
And she realized the person she was most sorry towards was right before her.
I'm sorry baby.
I made it difficult, right?
I'm sorry.
And Seo Yeon made a very important decision.
From now on, I'm going to live a noble life.
The body is not only a tool for pleasure.
The body is a medium for the soul.
A woman's body gives birth to life.
It's a sacred entity.
From here on, I'm going to live for the soul, not the body.
I'll restore my purity.
I'm going to repress my desires for the rest of my life.
How the fuck am I supposed to reply to this?
This is my response.
♪ Fart #4 ♪
Our baby was the cutest in the newborn unit.
It's the spitting image of Do Kyung.
They look exactly the same.
That sharp nose.
He'll be a heartbreaker when he grows up.
Those lips.
Just his father's.
He'll be quite a kisser.
Ah.
When are you going home?
Why won't you leave?
You have no one else.
Do Kyung still didn't get his ticket.
You have no family here.
They're all in Canada.
Give me the baby and go.
I'm going to hire a nanny.
I was about to leave it to the nurses and go.
Do you know how much the other babies cried?
If our baby goes there, it won't be able to sleep.
Isn't that right baby?
You don't like loud places, right?
Do Kyung sent flowers.
He never sent flowers to me.
Don't expect me to cancel my court order.
I'm not that easy.
Give me the baby.
Baby, it's your mother.
Isn't he so pretty?
I've never seen a baby with such pretty eyes.
Did you name the baby?
What's his name?
What if we call him Kevin?
He kind of looks like the kid from Home Alone.
Macaulay Culkin.
They look alike, right?
Hi, Kevin.
I'm sorry.
There was so much traffic.
It's fine.
Is Seo Yeon running late too?
No, she's not coming.
Why?
She's totally fallen in love with that guy's kid.
She even slept at the hospital.
She didn't even go to work.
If the baby was a girl, I don't think it would have turned out that way.
Oh, Seo Yeon.
Over here.
She's dressed like a school marm.
Leave her alone.
Please give us 2 more glasses.
How did you get here?
I thought you couldn't come.
What about Kevin?
Kevin's mother said she wanted strawberries.
I went all the way to the supermarket to buy some.
But she and Kevin disappeared.
Hey.
What's wrong with you?
You stay out of it.
I have nothing to do with you.
Hurry and go inside.
The baby's just been born so...
I'm getting mad.
You know how I am when I'm mad.
Go and sit in the driver's seat.
This is too much.
I know I've done wrong, but how could you just trick me away like that?
This is too much.
I'm sorry.
The baby's father suddenly came.
I didn't want you two to run into each other.
And I didn't want to see you two together.
Hi, Kevin.
Grow up to be a good man, okay?
Thanks for all you've done.
So I can't see Kevin anymore?
It was my first time seeing a baby born.
I even cut off its umbilical cord.
I've grown attached to it.
That's right.
In another lifetime, you and I might have been good friends.
You would have been a good guardian for Kevin.
But we met under such tainted circumstances.
Every time I see you, I'm reminded of the rage I have for my husband.
Our complicated love triangle.
If I had to explain it to Kevin.
I would have to lie.
I don't want to get in a love triangle with you and the baby either.
So I'll never see him again?
I even washed the strawberries.
I bought Kevin clothes.
Here.
I don't want to drink.
I said I want to live purely.
Didn't you get my text?
You might as well go into a nunnery.
Do you think they would take me?
I'm not sure.
If they could forgive my past, I think I could live in a nunnery.
I've made a decision too.
Truth is, I get scared whenever the girls say they've made a decision.
I, Kang Hyun Joo...
Will live full of lust and promiscuity from here on.
First, I'll lose my virginity.
Then I'll uncover my unique skill.
Do you have a partner?
I'll have to find one.
What's wrong with you?
Don't do that.
You'll seem cheap and desperate.
Excuse me ma'am.
You used to do this every day.
What's up with you two today?
You're joking, right?
No.
I'm serious.
That guy said that I didn't have any sex appeal.
He kissed me over 500 times.
He said his body never felt anything.
That stupid bastard!
But isn't that just one man's opinion?
I thought about how I ended up like this.
The body's not a big deal, Kang Hyun Joo.
Think of your soul.
What's wrong with you today?
I don't think it's Tae Woo's fault.
I think it's mine.
Why do you think it's your fault?
It's not as if I've never been in a relationship before.
I might not have had as many as Seo Yeon, but I had boyfriends too.
None of those men had sex with me.
Don't you think that's strange?
That's because they felt a platonic love.
Hey!
You've lived an exemplary life so far.
That's not true.
I've almost done the deed several times.
It's just that I've never crossed the line.
I brought it up with Kim Tae Woo because he never showed interest.
But before that, I never wanted to sleep with men.
I don't even want to think that I lived that way.
What's so great about an orgasm?
It only lasts a couple of minutes.
What?
A couple of minutes?
It's only a moment for me, but it lasts a couple of minutes for you?
How many minutes?
Is it really that long?
Don't ask about my past.
Oh, okay.
We can talk about this later.
Just stay quiet or pray for Hyun Joo.
Sorry.
Go on.
Now that I think about it.
I think I wanted to elevate myself by being pure.
What do you mean?
So I graduated from a prestigious women's university with top honors.
And I passed the bar exam within a year.
I wanted to be a pure woman.
I wanted them to know they were my first.
I was raised by a mother who married 3 times.
But I'm pure and proper.
Hyun Joo.
"A girl who never knew her father growing up is so respectable."
I think I wanted to hear that from my one true love.
Would there be such a man in my life?
There might be.
My first time was important to me too.
Don't cry Hyun Joo.
Please don't cry.
So what if I never slept with a man?
It's ridiculous to use that to determine my worth.
That's right.
Don't use that to determine your worth.
Use something else.
Yourself.
Your sexuality doesn't matter.
It's just you.
Fine.
Myself.
Your pure self.
I have good news Kang Hyun Joo.
Kim Tae Woo's gone now.
He's in the past.
You don't have to waste anymore time or feelings on someone who doesn't love you for who you are.
There's one other thing.
I'm going to get revenge on Kim Tae Woo.
After I do, I'm going to enjoy my life.
You guys will support me, right?
Of course, I'm your friend.
You should help too.
No.
Count me out.
This body has decided to live nobly.
The next day, Seo Yeon's adamant decision.
Totally disintegrated at the sight of a sexy dress.
I'm going to buy this.
I have to.
I'm going to buy it.
You said you wanted to live nobly.
You wanted to live respectably and purely.
Do you think you can do that with that dress?
Donate the money instead.
That way, you'll become noble.
I've just had a realization.
My desire is too hot to repress.
How much is this?
Okay.
A woman would fall for you too.
Kim Tae Woo's probably regretting right now.
Let's go get our revenge.
Okay, let's go.
Oh, wait.
Just squeeze my hand.
Just think, 'There's a bottle cap in this hand.'
What is that?
Just something.
Let's go.
Seo Yeon, stop the car.
Over there in front of the ping-pong club.
Why?
I have to use the bathroom.
Male Erectile Dysfunction Groin Rash
Male Erectile Dysfunction Groin Rash
Why do you keep putting up stuff like this?
If you keep this up, I'll call the police.
Give me the stickers.
I'm just trying to make a living.
Have lunch at the Chinese restaurant on the second floor.
I'll call you.
Give me those stickers.
Hyun Joo?
Oh my God!
Is Coco doing better?
No.
His hematuria is gone now, but he still seems to be suffering.
But why do you need that sticker?
It's not that I need it.
The more the better.
Thanks, Duk Woo.
Oh, it's not Duk Woo.
It's Duk Soo.
Kim Duk Soo.
Whatever.
See you next time.
What the?
Shut up and come to the emergency stairs.
Why?
You'll know when we get there.
Am I still not sexy?
Stop that.
Still not sexy?
It's not sexy.
Do you know how many people looked at me on my way here?
At least 11 people.
I'm not the one with the problem.
You're the one with the problem.
I'm sure of it.
Male Impotence Groin Rash
Who needs this?
You're the one with the problem Kim Tae Woo.
What problem do I have?
You'll know soon enough.
That's all I have to say.
Go back to work.
Let's not see each other anymore.
I want that too.
I wish you luck, Friend.
Yeah!
Revenge is complete.
Now it's time to enjoy life.
Why isn't he calling?
Does he want to surprise me?
Hey, In Young.
Hey, Sung Soo.
Yeah, I ate.
What about you?
What did you eat?
I have the day off tomorrow and the day after that.
I'm in the middle of a meeting right now.
I'll call you later.
Okay, call when you're finished.
I won't sleep until you call.
Hey, Sung Soo.
It's me.
Why didn't you call last night?
Where are you right now?
Where are you right now?
He said he was on his way to Po Chun because his friend's father died.
La Défense
6/29 reservation for Kim Sung Soo has been confirmed for La Defense Pension.
La Défense
Location:
Kang Won Do
Miss.
70 dollars.
Why did I come here?
In the far off future, will I regret this decision?
If she were a better woman than me.
If she were more clever.
Would she have come here?
Would she have witnessed this scene?
Just as I can't forgot that day 10 years ago.
I will never be able to forget this day.
I can't leave like this.
It would be pathetic to leave like this.
They have to know that I came.
I can't give him any more chances to lie to me.
I have to let Sung Soo know why I have to break up with him.
Let go.
You bastard.
You pig.
You dirty asshole.
Don't touch me!
How were you going to keep lying to me?
Did you two enjoy fooling me?
It was easy fooling an idiot like me, wasn't it?
Were you too loyal to tell me you had a change of heart?
Is this the responsibility you were talking about?
Aren't you even sorry you stupid bastard?
You did nothing wrong, right?
Just die!
I want you to die!
Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Let go of me.
Please!
Just go with me.
I'm begging you.
You know what Sung Soo?
Today, it came.
What did?
It came.
What is?
What came?
Well... give me your hand.
Make a fist.
Your ring finger.

Really?
Really?
Really, really?
How was it?
Tell me.
It was just ticklish.
That was it?
First it felt like ants were crawling all over my body.
And then what?
Tell me.
You're more excited about it than me.
Of course I am.
It's something we shared.
But it wasn't just once.
How many times then?
I don't know.
I can't tell you that.
But my feet are still hot.
Oh, Sunwoo In Young.
You're so adorable.
I knew this was an end that couldn't be undone.
An end I couldn't do anything about.
Absolutely the end.
Sung Soo put the ending punctuation on our love.
And there was nothing I could do... but cry.
Kang Hyeon Ju is getting married...
in this beautiful month of June.
Replacing a groom that didn't show up, she married someone she had met only once.
Both of you.
Yes..
In Yeong, go and tell my mom about the situation we're in right now.
Yes.
Seo Yeon, go and see Kim Tae U's parents.
We have to quickly resolve things before the guests suspect anything is amiss.
There is no need to be worried or sad.
This is not something to be worried or sad about.
Just say it as it is.
Emphasize to my mom that she has been married 3 times.
But this is my very first time.
Mom, you have been married 3 times, but this is only her first time...
So you're saying...
She wants to marry 3 times?
Is that it?
Tell them not to go anywhere until after the ceremony's over or we'll have to take legal action against your son.
This kid!
What exactly is he thinking?
!
How are we going to face the family in the future?
I don't know!
Where do you think it'll be this time?
Chest?
Or the back of your neck...
Wrong.
Watch carefully.
If you answer it right this time,
I won't take today's wages.
Okay, you're on.
Look carefully.
Your suit's inner pocket.
Wrong.
I'll give you one more chance.
I don't know.
Look for it then!
I really don't know.
What a pity!
You would have found it if you had looked a little bit harder.
When did you put it inside?
That's so amazing.
- The both of you are ready to walk in together?
- Yes.
Hold on to it properly so you won't lose it.
If you're having other thoughts, just firmly hold on to it.
Just think about the bottle cap in your hand.
If you do that, the hour will pass quickly.
Because all things eventually pass.
There is no moment that lasts forever.
The bride and groom enters.
Up next are the marriage vows.
The bride and groom must love and trust each other.
Even when facing difficulties and adversity, you must fulfill your duties as a good wife and husband.
Can you do that?
Oh, you're here early.
Hello, hello.
Congratulations!
But where's the groom?
He should be alive and well somewhere.
Sunbae, I've prepared it as you requested.
But... where is her husband?
The groom didn't show up.
It's no big deal.
Anything can happen in life.
Don't you think so?
Is this such a trivial matter?
One thing's for sure.
Crying won't solve anything.
Oh, can you send some wine over?
Room service is so expensive.
Room 4001's Chairman Kim, and who's in Room 7013?
A maestro from Germany.
Can you say those wines are for them, but send those to us instead?
I can't do that, sunbae.
You'll need to call room service yourself.
Take your hands out of your pockets.
What's the 1st principle a concierge should adhere to?
"Never say no."
Whoever your sunbae is, you've sure learned well.
There's no such thing as "no" for a concierge.
You'll be fired if you can't do that.
And right now I am a guest here.
You know this is ridiculous, right?
I'll leave it to you then.
I've put some effort into it.
This is great!
Perfect accommodations for women.
And thanks to In Yeong, it's 50% off.
What are you doing?
Quickly go and get ready.
I will pay the bill, so send it to me.
Send 2 bottles of red wine to Room 502.
It's for 3 women.
What would you recommend?
I'm not sure... they're not ordinary women to begin with, so it probably should be a big bottle of wine.
No, a more expensive one.
A Chateau would be good.
What did you just say?
In Yeong, we should take her to the doctor.
Judging from the nonsense she spouted, she must be running a fever.
Why can't I?
Shouldn't I get to go on a honeymoon after my wedding?
You're crazy!
I felt that you were on occasions, but you're really out of your mind.
It's Bali!
Not just any place, but Bali.
It's Bulgari Hotel.
They say it's the best hotel there.
The villa costs 1 million per night.
It's already paid for, so why shouldn't I go?
I even booked a spa.
I've also made a reservation at the restaurant on a cliff.
I heard that it's the best place to view the sunset.
Right, you're going to be so happy,
Watching that sunset all by yourself.
Furthermore, it's a restaurant on a cliff.
What if you suddenly feel like committing suicide?
Is there a reason why I shouldn't be happy right now?
On the road of life,
I just temporarily ran into a wall.
Who is it going to hurt when my head hits the wall?
I'll be the only one hurting.
A wall is not there for me to bump into it.
But for me to go around and take a detour.
It's not a wall but a corner.
Hyeon Ju, you haven't been making sense since earlier.
Why don't you just cry instead?
I can't do this.
In Yeong crying because she lost a few strands of hair...
And you being like this after 20 years...
I can't do this.
Because I wanted to go shopping in Hong Kong,
I emptied 3 of my regular accounts.
I converted all my money to HKD.
I even withdrew all the money from my card.
Didn't you ask me to buy face cream?
You have to go.
Didn't you want a wristwatch from Hong Kong?
That's right!
My wristwatch.
Go.
That's the right thing to do.
That's right.
Go there and relax.
Check out the guys while you're at it.
You can't do that if you went with your husband.
You can take off your "virgin" sign too!
Okay.
I'll go and develop my skills.
Let me take care of you tonight.
What are you doing?
First, kiss me.
They say it feels good between women too.
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
If you don't like Seo Yeon, come to me.
Let me give you a full course.
No way!
Compared to a full course, she needs to learn my skills.
Come over, Hyeon Ju.
Come over!
Life may possibly be simpler than we imagined.
If we don't make a big fuss when the groom doesn't show up for the wedding, maybe it isn't such a big deal after all.
Hyeon Ju didn't even shed a tear last night.
She also didn't call Tae U.
Until now, we still have no idea why he didn't attend his own wedding.
Be careful.
Have a safe journey.
Don't cry because you miss me.
Hyeon Ju seemed carefree.
Is she really all right?
Why can't I be simple like Hyeon Ju?
Right now in my head, all I can think about is the hair clip I found in Seong Su's car.
Hyeon Ju's right.
There's no reason why I should be unhappy.
Why should a person be in this state because of a mere hair clip?
This is absurd!
Sunbae, what's wrong?
I really hate writing reports.
But... what exactly are you doing?
Why are you pushing it?
If I do this, my breasts will get bigger and my waist thinner.
Yes, this is Concierge Seong Hyeon...
I'm different from Hyeon Ju after all.
I really can't get that hairpin out of my head.
Okay, I got it.
What is the matter?
Room Number 4012.
Richard said he is not satisfied with room service.
He always complains every time he's here.
Sunbae, what are you doing?
I'm going to stay in this position until the elevator stops.
This is good exercise for the body.
Hurry and do it with me.
Hurry up and do it already!
It's odd if I'm doing it alone.
This exercise is great for men.
Although, you are probably too young to know about this.
What exactly were they doing in the car?
Even the hairpin came off.
A man and a woman in a car.
Unless there was a typhoon, a hairpin won't come off so easily.
No matter how they kissed...
No matter how their heads turned...
A hairpin doesn't come off that easily.
Something... strong.
A strong impact.
Let's not be like this!
Let's not be like this!
Suspicion breeds suspicion.
Suspicion will cause disagreements.
Suspicion will cause misfortune.
Suspicion will cause separation.
Sunbae, what's going on with you today?
Is this because of your friend who went travelling alone?
No, I'm just hungry.
Hungry?
Seong Hyeon, seeing as how we're working until midnight, let's get some Tteokbokki for supper.
(Tteokbokki - spicy rice cakes)
I don't really feel like eating.
No, you're hungry.
Give it a second thought.
I'm not hungry.
Although you're not hungry right now, you will be when midnight comes.
If you eat something now, your heart would feel at ease, and you won't feel tired.
Hold on.
Where's my money?
Let's flip coins to decide who'll pay.
Heads, you'll pay.
Tails, I'll pay.
You're heads.
I'm tails.
Okay?
I'm tails.
You're heads.
I'll start now.
Oh!
It's heads.
Hurry up and go then.
Hold on a second.
I'm tails, and you're heads.
You are the one who should go, sunbae.
You're heads.
I'm tails.
You're heads.
You're heads.
Hurry up and get it.
The tteokbokki stall will be closed soon.
Ask ajumma for some blood sausage.
Tell her I asked for it.
(Ajumma - older lady, aunt)
You just love free stuff, don't you?
Suspicion is destructive.
Needless suspicion is prohibited.
Needless thoughts are also prohibited.
I'm regretful.
Letting one man be my entire world.
I have never cheated.
Only seeing one man for 10 years.
Those times when he was looking at other women,
I remained faithful.
Oh!
Kim Seong Su is home.
Dear!
Dear!
When did you come home?
Why didn't you call...
Hairpin?
I didn't see it.
Is that so?
I'll look for it.
What hairpin?
Who was that?
Yun Kang Hui?
When you looked for your cell phone yesterday, did you see a hairpin?
Oh, I didn't see one.
Whose hairpin is it?
Was there a woman in your car?
The car dealer's.
She seemed to have dropped it in the car.
The car dealer's a woman?
Yeah.
What kind of hairpin costs 100 000 Won?
She said it's expensive.
I'll go look for it!
I'll go.
A woman would be better at finding a hairpin.
I'll go now!
It was the dealer's, the dealer's!
It was the dealer's not Kang Hui's.
Didn't you have something to do tonight?
It's been pushed until tomorrow so I could finalize the housing contract.
I should finish reading this quickly, but I can't seem to concentrate.
Housing contract?
What's that?
Haven't I told you?
I bought a house.
What?
Hold on a second, Mr. Seong Su.
You bought a house?
When?
When did you buy a house?
About a month ago?
Without telling me anything, he went ahead and bought a house.
Where did you get the money from?
After I had signed the contract for my next movie project,
I received a lump sum of money.
Let me finish reading this first, and then we'll talk.
He didn't even say anything about receiving a lump sum of money!
What neighborhood is it in?
The house.
What neighborhood is it in?
-Kangnam.
-Is it a house?
No, it's an apartment.
Is it facing east, west, north or south?
I'm not sure.
Probably south?
Mr. Seong Su.
Get up.
Let's talk.
What is it now?
A person...
How can a person change this much?
How did you become like this?
What did I do?
Have you forgotten?
I still remember it clearly like it was yesterday, but you've forgotten everything?
- In Yeong!
- Omo, Mr. Seong Su!
(Omo - oh my)
Come with me.
What's the matter?
Where are we going?
I couldn't wait for you to get off work.
Why didn't you answer my call?
I left my cell phone at home.
What are you doing?
People will see us.
In Yeong, wait a moment.
Just hold still.
This is my workplace!
Why are you doing this?
Why don't you leave early?
I have somewhere I want to take you.
Why?
I am on the night shift today.
You must do this.
This is an emergency.
In Yeong, I have something I must show you.
You have to be the first one to see it.
What is it?
Why are we here?
You'll find out once we go in.
Welcome.
Could we take a look at some necklaces that would suit this lady?
Didn't you see the name of this place?
The jewelry here is very expensive.
No, it's fine.
Where are you going?
This one's not bad.
What do you think of it?
Let's leave quickly.
What do you think of this?
This one's nice.
Could we take a look at this?
I have a lot of necklaces already.
Just stay still.
Let's try this on.
It's pretty.
I'll take it.
How much is it?
It's 2 million Won.
Told you.
Dear, have you gone crazy?
Don't worry.
You've really gone crazy.
Don't worry.
It suits you.
So pretty.
Where did you get the money from?
Do you like it?
Yes, I'm so happy I could faint!
Come over here.
What's with you today?
You're acting strange.
You don't like it?
That's not it.
What's this?
-=Director Contract=-
Omo, you are going to film a movie?
Omo, how much are they paying you?
How much?
Is this really the amount?
Omo!
Is this really happening?
Congratulations, Mr. Seong Su.
This is nothing.
The next time I sign a contract, I'll be getting twice as much.
Really?
!
You're so great!
I'm so happy.
Do you know how badly I wanted to tell you?
I haven't told my parents.
I'm telling you first.
Seon U In Yeong, you need not worry about money from now on.
Eat whatever you like.
Buy whatever you want.
Oppa will give it to you, whatever it is!
(Oppa - older brother, boyfriend)
Even if I die now, I'll have no regrets.
Really.
Oh!
I'm going to make you so much happier from now on.
How can you die now?
I should have just died on that day.
If only that had happened, there wouldn't be a day like today.
I thought that if he bought a house, he would have picked 1 out with me.
That house...
I thought that we would be living in it together.
I thought that would become the house our children would live in.
No matter what, I hate apartments.
Come and take a whiff, Mr. Seong Su.
Idon'tsmellanything.
You don't like it?
-It's not bad.
-Lilacs are my favorite.
Even its name is pretty.
I'll show you a painting I have at home.
You have no idea how beautifully painted the lilacs are.
Thanks to that painting,
I fell deeper in love with lilacs.
I told you before, right?
The next time we buy a house, if we buy a house,
I'll surely plant lilacs in the yard.
You always say things that.
Where has that Kim Seong Su gone to?
I hate lilacs!
I don't like lilacs in the yard, Director.
I prefer apartments.
Let's get an apartment then.
You like apartments too, right?
Of course, I'm the type who lives in apartments.
Seeing how he's been behaving lately, it wouldn't be surprising if he had said that.
I went out for 2 hours, yet he's still sleeping.
Even if I had spent the night with a man, he wouldn't have even known.
That numbskull.
Go away, numbskull!
It's my bed!
My blanket!
Right now, am I backing myself into a corner?
I'm the only one hurting.
The next morning, Seo Yeon ran into a wall as well.
Will these items be sold in the shopping mall?
Let's order 2,000 first.
I understand.
Representative, there's a call from the women's magazine.
Na Li.
They want to interview you as part of their Women's Success Stories feature.
Is that so?
Tell them to come over then.
But the editor wants to see you.
The editor wants to go over it today.
In life, there are times when we will regret our actions.
Right now, Seo Yeon is bringing a man she should not have brought along.
Going to a place she shouldn't go.
She has no idea what's about to take place.
Excuse me.
I am Park Seo Yeon, Representative of Y Style.
Ah, the editor is in a meeting right now.
It will end in about 5 minutes.
Do my eyes look puffy?
Sorry for the long wait.
Not at all.
We've just...
I can't say that I am happy to meet you, Miss Park Seo Yeon.
I heard you even brought a photographer with you?
Are you from Y Style?
I work there 3 times a week.
Whenever you have the time, come over and show us your portfolio.
We are in need of photographers right now.
You know my husband, right?
Mr. Kang Do Gyeong.
I heard you two were a couple before.
Is that true?
Seo Yeon is very honest about her feelings.
He didn't come home a week ago, so I asked him where he went.
He said he was at your place.
He said he slept with you.
Did you two really sleep together?
If the opponent has a knife, Park Seo Yeon would voluntarily offer her heart instead.
Yes, we've slept together.
I'm planning to divorce that man.
I can't sleep with a husband who sleeps around with other women.
Don't you think so?
You can have him, Miss Park Seo Yeon.
Even while knowing that his wife is pregnant, you chose to sleep with him.
Don't you think you should be responsible for his future?
To break up or not...
That's between the two of you.
Shouldn't I decide my own future?
That's so self-righteous of you, Miss Park So Yeon!
Have you always been so self-righteous?
I'm going to sue you and Kang Do Gyeong for adultery.
Is she crazy?
Is the adultery law even valid?
She should go and cause trouble to her husband instead.
Why is she doing this to me?
Look, Representative Park Seo Yeon.
The adultery law still stands.
What are you saying?
That law hasn't been abolished?
Did you not see the woman's belly just now?
That woman is pregnant.
So what?
Things have already progressed to this state.
What do you expect me to do?
You should feel ashamed of yourself.
Don't you take other people's feelings into consideration at all?
Your thoughtless actions and words will cause other people to be hurt.
Have you thought about that?
She really makes my head hurt.
Hey, Seo Jun Hui!
I will not work with you anymore.
Really?
!
The adultery law still stands?
Didn't they abolish that?
I think I remember seeing that somewhere.
I mean, how can a country's law interfere with our personal life...
I understand.
Then what will happen to her?
What?
Go to jail!
?
No, it's nothing.
It's just a possibility.
Then what should she do?
Hey!
How can you think about a spa right now?
Hello?
Hello!
?
She hung up.
She said she's going to the spa.
They say the men there are extremely sexy.
Am I going to jail?
No.
If they sue you, Hyeon Ju says she'll represent you.
But... you need to reflect on yourself.
Hyeon Ju thought you chased that man away.
It didn't end there that day?
Why did you do that?
Although he was single when you were in love with him, he's a married man now!
Have you thought about that?
Seo Yeon!
Have you gone crazy?
!
I ended things.
Thank you.
It should have ended there with me going back into the room.
But then I realized I had forgotten his shoes.
We bought those shoes together.
Don't do this.
Hurry up and leave!
Seo Yeon, I was wrong.
Let me explain it.
You know I place a lot of faith in a man's hand, right?
Not too bulky nor too scrawny...
With oh-so-beautiful long fingers.
His arms are so sexy.
Seo Yeon, don't you realize what you've done?
That's right.
I did that... adultery.
You've hurt someone.
Someone who's about to give birth.
You saw her too at the restaurant the other day, right?
You may not realize since our situations are different...
But when Kim Seong Su cheated on me 5 years ago,
I was really hurt.
I still think about it sometimes.
I still can't forget about it.
I wondered whether I should be with someone who has hurt me so much.
It felt like something important has broken into pieces.
You broke the most important thing between a husband and wife!
This is not solely my fault.
The man is at fault too!
But right now you're the one in front of me!
Morality, legality and ethics aside...
I have something I wanted to ask you.
Must you keep liking a man like that?
Why do you keep changing your man?
It never lasts more than 3 months.
Do you like people that much?
Feelings... are they so important?
If not, then what is important?
I hate being alone.
When I'm alone...
I feel sad and lonely.
There's no one in the world who doesn't feel lonely or sad.
For a while, I forgot that Seo Yeon is my friend.
Seo Yeon doesn't need this right now, but instead needs comfort and love.
See you later.
Go back and have a good sleep.
It's me, dear.
A housewarming party?
When?
Oh, this is the same as the one in our house.
Customer, instead of that product...
Take a look at this.
Many people have been buying this espresso machine recently.
Compared to other espresso machines, this one is of a different standard altogether.
First of all, there is an automatic cappuccino function.
So it can automatically make cappuccino, coffee latte and latte macchiato.
It also has a memory function.
So it automatically remembers the coffee menu.
I'll take this.
Please wrap it up.
How much is it?
It's 3.22 million Won.
It's a bit expensive, right?
But customer, this would be the best choice.
There are many moments in life when you need to make a choice.
To buy or not to buy?
Of course, this is the more desirable one.
But as a sensible person,
I can't be controlled by desire.
But it's not easy to give things up either.
At times like this, I...
Please wait a moment.
At times like this, I'll look at my savings book.
Then I'll consult with the numbers in the savings book.
Are you guys doing well?
Will you take this product?
No, please get me this one.
Come in.
Wow!
Did you choose all these by yourself?
Of course.
Just think of all these as yours.
- What?
- Make yourself at home.
All right.
I love this so much!
Come here.
Over here is our bedroom!
Wow!
In Yeong, I prepared this for you.
A dressing table.
Wow, this is the best!
I love this so much, dear.
Wait a moment.
=Director!
Director!
=
How does she know you live here?
I'll send her away.
Come in.
What is this?
Please place it over there.
In Yeong!
Hello!
Yes.
Why are you hiding?
That's right.
Why am I hiding?
Why did I do that?
I won't be a bother.
I'll just have a cup of coffee.
You can't keep showing up like this.
Understood, understood.
I live on the floor below.
Director, yesterday you slept at 4 in the morning, didn't you?
I heard the sound of water when I took a shower.
I thought for a long time about what I should get you, and it seems like you don't have a coffee machine.
Right now I feel like ripping the savings book into shreds!
Do you know how good this machine is?
All right.
Thank you.
I'll go after I make myself a cup of coffee with this.
Omo!
That must be a present.
This looks like fun!
Let's open and see.
That's right, this is so much fun.
I'm so excited!
That's right.
Let's open and see.
It's a coffee machine too.
Hey, Seon U In Yeong.
You've chose well.
Isn't this the same as the one in your house?
Couple coffee mate.
I didn't set out to do that.
But since you like the coffee this machine makes...
Yeah, I like it a lot.
Thanks for yours too, Kang Hui.
Today, let's make coffee using In Yeong's machine.
I have to watch it with you, Director.
I've watched it already.
It's not something I like enough to watch twice.
While we watch the movie,
I want to discuss some ideas for our next movie.
What is it?
I'll tell you when we watch it together.
Didn't I already tell you not to be like this?
So do you want to watch it or not?
Not at home.
If you want to watch it with me, then bring it to the office.
Also, don't come here whenever you want.
This is my personal space.
Isn't the director being cold?
He's so cold to me.
I don't know if he was always like this, or just acting.
But I won't back out just because you're like this.
Of course not.
He said he was attracted to this girl.
That he felt excited whenever he was around her.
He may be treating her coldly because of my feelings.
Out of his loyalty for me.
Yes, out of his loyalty to me.
And because of this, this girl is falling for him even more.
He seems to treat you very well.
But he's really cold towards me.
Hey, what do you mean "you"?
She is 10 years older than you.
I know, I know, 33.
Because I'm the eldest daughter,
I'm not used to calling others "eonni".
(Eonni - older sister)
Are you two working on another movie together?
You didn't know?
We're a natural pair.
You're being nonsensical again.
I had fun, bye.
You're not sending me off?
I'm scared of the stairs.
Just leave by yourself.
Just lend him to me for a while.
Hey, hey, hey, why are you so easy going?
Director, the coffee machine I gave you is a couple thing too.
I have the same one at home, you know?
I know...
I know...
Where are you going?
You go down by yourself, okay?
I have to go back.
At first, I was mad at her forwardness.
At the thought of having to compete with this person,
I am so afraid.
Furthermore because I know Kim Seong Su will not be able to reject her,
I cried.
In Young...
In Young...
The most tragic part is that he saw me in such a state.
He found out I was uneasy and suspicious.
He found me in such a pitiful moment.
In Young.
Have a cup of wine.
In Young, are you bothered by what I said earlier?
Just a bit.
I only said that because you wanted me to be honest.
If it's to be described in words, it's not a serious feeling.
When I see Yun Kang Hui, I just feel that she's very cute.
It's only to a small extent, if I have to put it in words.
Yes, it's fine.
You don't have to say anymore.
You know best that I love you.
Then propose to me.
Kim Seong Su, do I even have to say it out?
In the future you and I will be very happy.
I've already made plans.
Plans?
What plans?
Does he mean a proposal?
You've been with me for 10 years.
Those 10 years will not be easily destroyed.
I am very thankful and happy to be able to have you by my side.
I know, I know.
I know everything.
What is there about you that I don't know?
Is that Hyeon Ju?
Yes, it's me.
Guess where I am right now.
You're in Bali.
Where else can you be?
Aren't you coming back tomorrow?
I came back today.
Right now, I'm in front of that bastard's company.
Who?
Which bastard's company?
That son of a bitch.
Why?
Didn't you say that you wouldn't go?
=Didn't you say you'll coolly end it?
Why are you there?
=
=Hello?
Hyeon Ju?
Hyeon Ju!
Hyeon Ju!
=
=Hyeon Ju!
Hyeon Ju!
Hyeon Ju!
Hyeon Ju!
=
Go ahead.
What are you planning to do?
I am going to kill this bastard today.
Hyeon Ju.
I am going to kill you, today.
Miss In Yeong, you seem like a fine woman.
This is my declaration of war.
I really like Director Kim.
He's my type.
Women can see a thousand things in one second.
I see him wearing a ring.
You know, the first thing we check out when we see an eligible man...
That punk actually took off the ring.
Private life is private life.
This is work.
This isn't the attitude of a professional, is it?
If you want a good career, learn how to treat your partner first.
Once every month, I become a totally different woman.
Sorry I'm late.
Do you always lie like this when you're outside of the company?
How can you talk such nonsense to your senior?
What?
Hotel Chairman's grandson?
You're the chairman's grandson?
Kang Hyeon Ju is getting married...
in this beautiful month of June.
Replacing a groom that didn't show up, she married someone she had met only once.
Both of you.
Yes..
In Yeong, go and tell my mom about the situation we're in right now.
Yes.
Seo Yeon, go and see Kim Tae U's parents.
We have to quickly resolve things before the guests suspect anything is amiss.
There is no need to be worried or sad.
This is not something to be worried or sad about.
Just say it as it is.
Emphasize to my mom that she has been married 3 times.
But this is my very first time.
Mom, you have been married 3 times, but this is only her first time...
So you're saying...
She wants to marry 3 times?
Is that it?
Tell them not to go anywhere until after the ceremony's over or we'll have to take legal action against your son.
This kid!
What exactly is he thinking?
!
How are we going to face the family in the future?
I don't know!
Where do you think it'll be this time?
Chest?
Or the back of your neck...
Wrong.
Watch carefully.
If you answer it right this time,
I won't take today's wages.
Okay, you're on.
Look carefully.
Your suit's inner pocket.
Wrong.
I'll give you one more chance.
I don't know.
Look for it then!
I really don't know.
What a pity!
You would have found it if you had looked a little bit harder.
When did you put it inside?
That's so amazing.
- The both of you are ready to walk in together?
- Yes.
Hold on to it properly so you won't lose it.
If you're having other thoughts, just firmly hold on to it.
Just think about the bottle cap in your hand.
If you do that, the hour will pass quickly.
Because all things eventually pass.
There is no moment that lasts forever.
The bride and groom enters.
Up next are the marriage vows.
The bride and groom must love and trust each other.
Even when facing difficulties and adversity, you must fulfill your duties as a good wife and husband.
Can you do that?
Oh, you're here early.
Hello, hello.
Congratulations!
But where's the groom?
He should be alive and well somewhere.
Sunbae, I've prepared it as you requested.
But... where is her husband?
The groom didn't show up.
It's no big deal.
Anything can happen in life.
Don't you think so?
Is this such a trivial matter?
One thing's for sure.
Crying won't solve anything.
Oh, can you send some wine over?
Room service is so expensive.
Room 4001's Chairman Kim, and who's in Room 7013?
A maestro from Germany.
Can you say those wines are for them, but send those to us instead?
I can't do that, Sunbae.
You'll need to call room service yourself.
Take your hands out of your pockets.
What's the 1st principle a concierge should adhere to?
"Never say no."
Whoever your sunbae is, you've sure learned well.
There's no such thing as "no" for a concierge.
You'll be fired if you can't do that.
And right now I am a guest here.
You know this is ridiculous, right?
I'll leave it to you then.
I've put some effort into it.
This is great!
Perfect accommodations for women.
And thanks to In Yeong, it's 50% off.
What are you doing?
Quickly go and get ready.
I will pay the bill, so send it to me.
Send 2 bottles of red wine to Room 502.
It's for 3 women.
What would you recommend?
I'm not sure... they're not ordinary women to begin with, so it probably should be a big bottle of wine.
No, a more expensive one.
A Chateau would be good.
What did you just say?
In Yeong, we should take her to the doctor.
Judging from the nonsense she spouted, she must be running a fever.
Why can't I?
Shouldn't I get to go on a honeymoon after my wedding?
You're crazy!
I felt that you were on occasions, but you're really out of your mind.
It's Bali!
Not just any place, but Bali.
It's Bulgari Hotel.
They say it's the best hotel there.
The villa costs 1 million per night.
It's already paid for, so why shouldn't I go?
I even booked a spa.
I've also made a reservation at the restaurant on a cliff.
I heard that it's the best place to view the sunset.
Right, you're going to be so happy,
Watching that sunset all by yourself.
Furthermore, it's a restaurant on a cliff.
What if you suddenly feel like committing suicide?
Is there a reason why I shouldn't be happy right now?
On the road of life,
I just temporarily ran into a wall.
Who is it going to hurt when my head hits the wall?
I'll be the only one hurting.
A wall is not there for me to bump into it.
But for me to go around and take a detour.
It's not a wall but a corner.
Hyeon Ju, you haven't been making sense since earlier.
Why don't you just cry instead?
I can't do this.
In Yeong crying because she lost a few strands of hair...
And you being like this after 20 years...
I can't do this.
Because I wanted to go shopping in Hong Kong,
I emptied 3 of my regular accounts.
I converted all my money to HKD.
I even withdrew all the money from my card.
Didn't you ask me to buy face cream?
You have to go.
Didn't you want a wristwatch from Hong Kong?
That's right!
My wristwatch.
Go.
That's the right thing to do.
That's right.
Go there and relax.
Check out the guys while you're at it.
You can't do that if you went with your husband.
You can take off your "virgin" sign too!
Okay.
I'll go and develop my skills.
Let me take care of you tonight.
What are you doing?
First, kiss me.
They say it feels good between women too.
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
If you don't like Seo Yeon, come to me.
Let me give you a full course.
No way!
Compared to a full course, she needs to learn my skills.
Come over, Hyeon Ju.
Come over!
Life may possibly be simpler than we imagined.
If we don't make a big fuss when the groom doesn't show up for the wedding, maybe it isn't such a big deal after all.
Hyeon Ju didn't even shed a tear last night.
She also didn't call Tae U.
Until now, we still have no idea why he didn't attend his own wedding.
Be careful.
Have a safe journey.
Don't cry because you miss me.
Hyeon Ju seemed carefree.
Is she really all right?
Why can't I be simple like Hyeon Ju?
Right now in my head, all I can think about is the hair clip I found in Seong Su's car.
Hyeon Ju's right.
There's no reason why I should be unhappy.
Why should a person be in this state because of a mere hair clip?
This is absurd!
Sunbae, what's wrong?
I really hate writing reports.
But... what exactly are you doing?
Why are you pushing it?
If I do this, my breasts will get bigger and my waist thinner.
Yes, this is Concierge Seong Hyeon...
I'm different from Hyeon Ju after all.
I really can't get that hairpin out of my head.
Okay, I got it.
What is the matter?
Room Number 4012.
Richard said he is not satisfied with room service.
He always complains every time he's here.
Sunbae, what are you doing?
I'm going to stay in this position until the elevator stops.
This is good exercise for the body.
Hurry and do it with me.
Hurry up and do it already!
It's odd if I'm doing it alone.
This exercise is great for men.
Although, you are probably too young to know about this.
What exactly were they doing in the car?
Even the hairpin came off.
A man and a woman in a car.
Unless there was a typhoon, a hairpin won't come off so easily.
No matter how they kissed...
No matter how their heads turned...
A hairpin doesn't come off that easily.
Something... strong.
A strong impact.
Let's not be like this!
Let's not be like this!
Suspicion breeds suspicion.
Suspicion will cause disagreements.
Suspicion will cause misfortune.
Suspicion will cause separation.
Sunbae, what's going on with you today?
Is this because of your friend who went travelling alone?
No, I'm just hungry.
Hungry?
Seong Hyeon, seeing as how we're working until midnight, let's get some Tteokbokki for supper.
(Tteokbokki - spicy rice cakes)
I don't really feel like eating.
No, you're hungry.
Give it a second thought.
I'm not hungry.
Although you're not hungry right now, you will be when midnight comes.
If you eat something now, your heart would feel at ease, and you won't feel tired.
Hold on.
Where's my money?
Let's flip coins to decide who'll pay.
Heads, you'll pay.
Tails, I'll pay.
You're heads.
I'm tails.
Okay?
I'm tails.
You're heads.
I'll start now.
Oh!
It's heads.
Hurry up and go then.
Hold on a second.
I'm tails, and you're heads.
You are the one who should go, Sunbae.
You're heads.
I'm tails.
You're heads.
You're heads.
Hurry up and get it.
The tteokbokki stall will be closed soon.
Ask Ajumma for some blood sausage.
Tell her I asked for it.
(Ajumma - older lady, aunt)
You just love free stuff, don't you?
Suspicion is destructive.
Needless suspicion is prohibited.
Needless thoughts are also prohibited.
I'm regretful.
Letting one man be my entire world.
I have never cheated.
Only seeing one man for 10 years.
Those times when he was looking at other women,
I remained faithful.
Oh!
Kim Seong Su is home.
Dear!
Dear!
When did you come home?
Why didn't you call...
Hairpin?
I didn't see it.
Is that so?
I'll look for it.
What hairpin?
Who was that?
Yun Kang Hui?
When you looked for your cell phone yesterday, did you see a hairpin?
Oh, I didn't see one.
Whose hairpin is it?
Was there a woman in your car?
The car dealer's.
She seemed to have dropped it in the car.
The car dealer's a woman?
Yeah.
What kind of hairpin costs 100 000 Won?
She said it's expensive.
I'll go look for it!
I'll go.
A woman would be better at finding a hairpin.
I'll go now!
It was the dealer's, the dealer's!
It was the dealer's not Kang Hui's.
Didn't you have something to do tonight?
It's been pushed until tomorrow so I could finalize the housing contract.
I should finish reading this quickly, but I can't seem to concentrate.
Housing contract?
What's that?
Haven't I told you?
I bought a house.
What?
Hold on a second, Mr. Seong Su.
You bought a house?
When?
When did you buy a house?
About a month ago?
Without telling me anything, he went ahead and bought a house.
Where did you get the money from?
After I had signed the contract for my next movie project,
I received a lump sum of money.
Let me finish reading this first, and then we'll talk.
He didn't even say anything about receiving a lump sum of money!
What neighborhood is it in?
The house.
What neighborhood is it in?
-Kangnam.
-Is it a house?
No, it's an apartment.
Is it facing east, west, north or south?
I'm not sure.
Probably south?
Mr. Seong Su.
Get up.
Let's talk.
What is it now?
A person...
How can a person change this much?
How did you become like this?
What did I do?
Have you forgotten?
I still remember it clearly like it was yesterday, but you've forgotten everything?
- In Yeong!
- Omo, Mr. Seong Su!
(Omo - oh my)
Come with me.
What's the matter?
Where are we going?
I couldn't wait for you to get off work.
Why didn't you answer my call?
I left my cell phone at home.
What are you doing?
People will see us.
In Yeong, wait a moment.
Just hold still.
This is my workplace!
Why are you doing this?
Why don't you leave early?
I have somewhere I want to take you.
Why?
I am on the night shift today.
You must do this.
This is an emergency.
In Yeong, I have something I must show you.
You have to be the first one to see it.
What is it?
Why are we here?
You'll find out once we go in.
Welcome.
Could we take a look at some necklaces that would suit this lady?
Didn't you see the name of this place?
The jewelry here is very expensive.
No, it's fine.
Where are you going?
This one's not bad.
What do you think of it?
Let's leave quickly.
What do you think of this?
This one's nice.
Could we take a look at this?
I have a lot of necklaces already.
Just stay still.
Let's try this on.
It's pretty.
I'll take it.
How much is it?
It's 2 million Won.
Told you.
Dear, have you gone crazy?
Don't worry.
You've really gone crazy.
Don't worry.
It suits you.
So pretty.
Where did you get the money from?
Do you like it?
Yes, I'm so happy I could faint!
Come over here.
What's with you today?
You're acting strange.
You don't like it?
That's not it.
What's this?
-=Director Contract=-
Omo, you are going to film a movie?
Omo, how much are they paying you?
How much?
Is this really the amount?
Omo!
Is this really happening?
Congratulations, Mr. Seong Su.
This is nothing.
The next time I sign a contract, I'll be getting twice as much.
Really?
!
You're so great!
I'm so happy.
Do you know how badly I wanted to tell you?
I haven't told my parents.
I'm telling you first.
Seon U In Yeong, you need not worry about money from now on.
Eat whatever you like.
Buy whatever you want.
Oppa will give it to you, whatever it is!
(Oppa - older brother, boyfriend)
Even if I die now, I'll have no regrets.
Really.
Oh!
I'm going to make you so much happier from now on.
How can you die now?
I should have just died on that day.
If only that had happened, there wouldn't be a day like today.
I thought that if he bought a house, he would have picked 1 out with me.
That house...
I thought that we would be living in it together.
I thought that would become the house our children would live in.
No matter what, I hate apartments.
Come and take a whiff, Mr. Seong Su.
Idon'tsmellanything.
You don't like it?
-It's not bad.
-Lilacs are my favorite.
Even its name is pretty.
I'll show you a painting I have at home.
You have no idea how beautifully painted the lilacs are.
Thanks to that painting,
I fell deeper in love with lilacs.
I told you before, right?
The next time we buy a house, if we buy a house,
I'll surely plant lilacs in the yard.
You always say things that.
Where has that Kim Seong Su gone to?
I hate lilacs!
I don't like lilacs in the yard, Director.
I prefer apartments.
Let's get an apartment then.
You like apartments too, right?
Of course, I'm the type who lives in apartments.
Seeing how he's been behaving lately, it wouldn't be surprising if he had said that.
I went out for 2 hours, yet he's still sleeping.
Even if I had spent the night with a man, he wouldn't have even known.
That numbskull.
Go away, numbskull!
It's my bed!
My blanket!
Right now, am I backing myself into a corner?
I'm the only one hurting.
The next morning, Seo Yeon ran into a wall as well.
Will these items be sold in the shopping mall?
Let's order 2,000 first.
I understand.
Representative, there's a call from the women's magazine.
Na Li.
They want to interview you as part of their Women's Success Stories feature.
Is that so?
Tell them to come over then.
But the editor wants to see you.
The editor wants to go over it today.
In life, there are times when we will regret our actions.
Right now, Seo Yeon is bringing a man she should not have brought along.
Going to a place she shouldn't go.
She has no idea what's about to take place.
Excuse me.
I am Park Seo Yeon, Representative of Y Style.
Ah, the editor is in a meeting right now.
It will end in about 5 minutes.
Do my eyes look puffy?
Sorry for the long wait.
Not at all.
We've just...
I can't say that I am happy to meet you, Miss Park Seo Yeon.
I heard you even brought a photographer with you?
Are you from Y Style?
I work there 3 times a week.
Whenever you have the time, come over and show us your portfolio.
We are in need of photographers right now.
You know my husband, right?
Mr. Kang Do Gyeong.
I heard you two were a couple before.
Is that true?
Seo Yeon is very honest about her feelings.
He didn't come home a week ago, so I asked him where he went.
He said he was at your place.
He said he slept with you.
Did you two really sleep together?
If the opponent has a knife, Park Seo Yeon would voluntarily offer her heart instead.
Yes, we've slept together.
I'm planning to divorce that man.
I can't sleep with a husband who sleeps around with other women.
Don't you think so?
You can have him, Miss Park Seo Yeon.
Even while knowing that his wife is pregnant, you chose to sleep with him.
Don't you think you should be responsible for his future?
To break up or not...
That's between the two of you.
Shouldn't I decide my own future?
That's so self-righteous of you, Miss Park So Yeon!
Have you always been so self-righteous?
I'm going to sue you and Kang Do Gyeong for adultery.
Is she crazy?
Is the adultery law even valid?
She should go and cause trouble to her husband instead.
Why is she doing this to me?
Look, Representative Park Seo Yeon.
The adultery law still stands.
What are you saying?
That law hasn't been abolished?
Did you not see the woman's belly just now?
That woman is pregnant.
So what?
Things have already progressed to this state.
What do you expect me to do?
You should feel ashamed of yourself.
Don't you take other people's feelings into consideration at all?
Your thoughtless actions and words will cause other people to be hurt.
Have you thought about that?
She really makes my head hurt.
Hey, Seo Jun Hui!
I will not work with you anymore.
Really?
!
The adultery law still stands?
Didn't they abolish that?
I think I remember seeing that somewhere.
I mean, how can a country's law interfere with our personal life...
I understand.
Then what will happen to her?
What?
Go to jail!
?
No, it's nothing.
It's just a possibility.
Then what should she do?
Hey!
How can you think about a spa right now?
Hello?
Hello!
?
She hung up.
She said she's going to the spa.
They say the men there are extremely sexy.
Am I going to jail?
No.
If they sue you, Hyeon Ju says she'll represent you.
But... you need to reflect on yourself.
Hyeon Ju thought you chased that man away.
It didn't end there that day?
Why did you do that?
Although he was single when you were in love with him, he's a married man now!
Have you thought about that?
Seo Yeon!
Have you gone crazy?
!
I ended things.
Thank you.
It should have ended there with me going back into the room.
But then I realized I had forgotten his shoes.
We bought those shoes together.
Don't do this.
Hurry up and leave!
Seo Yeon, I was wrong.
Let me explain it.
You know I place a lot of faith in a man's hand, right?
Not too bulky nor too scrawny...
With oh-so-beautiful long fingers.
His arms are so sexy.
Seo Yeon, don't you realize what you've done?
That's right.
I did that... adultery.
You've hurt someone.
Someone who's about to give birth.
You saw her too at the restaurant the other day, right?
You may not realize since our situations are different...
But when Kim Seong Su cheated on me 5 years ago,
I was really hurt.
I still think about it sometimes.
I still can't forget about it.
I wondered whether I should be with someone who has hurt me so much.
It felt like something important has broken into pieces.
You broke the most important thing between a husband and wife!
This is not solely my fault.
The man is at fault too!
But right now you're the one in front of me!
Morality, legality and ethics aside...
I have something I wanted to ask you.
Must you keep liking a man like that?
Why do you keep changing your man?
It never lasts more than 3 months.
Do you like people that much?
Feelings... are they so important?
If not, then what is important?
I hate being alone.
When I'm alone...
I feel sad and lonely.
There's no one in the world who doesn't feel lonely or sad.
For a while, I forgot that Seo Yeon is my friend.
Seo Yeon doesn't need this right now, but instead needs comfort and love.
See you later.
Go back and have a good sleep.
It's me, dear.
A housewarming party?
When?
Oh, this is the same as the one in our house.
Customer, instead of that product...
Take a look at this.
Many people have been buying this espresso machine recently.
Compared to other espresso machines, this one is of a different standard altogether.
First of all, there is an automatic cappuccino function.
So it can automatically make cappuccino, coffee latte and latte macchiato.
It also has a memory function.
So it automatically remembers the coffee menu.
I'll take this.
Please wrap it up.
How much is it?
It's 3.22 million Won.
It's a bit expensive, right?
But customer, this would be the best choice.
There are many moments in life when you need to make a choice.
To buy or not to buy?
Of course, this is the more desirable one.
But as a sensible person,
I can't be controlled by desire.
But it's not easy to give things up either.
At times like this, I...
Please wait a moment.
At times like this, I'll look at my savings book.
Then I'll consult with the numbers in the savings book.
Are you guys doing well?
Will you buy this?
No.
Please get me this one.
Come in.
Wow!
Did you furnish all this by yourself?
Of course.
Just think of all this as yours.
- What?
- Make yourself at home.
I love this so much!
Come here.
Over here is our bedroom!
Wow!
In Yeong, I prepared this for you.
A dressing table.
Wow, this is the best!
I love this so much, dear.
Wait a moment.
=Director!
Director!
=
How does she know you live here?
I'll send her away.
Come in.
What is this?
Please place it over there.
In Yeong!
Hello!
Yes.
Why are you hiding?
That's right.
Why am I hiding?
Why did I do that?
I won't be a bother.
I'll just have a cup of coffee.
You can't keep showing up like this.
Understood, understood.
I live on the floor below.
Director, yesterday you slept at 4 in the morning, didn't you?
I heard the sound of water when you took a shower.
I thought for a long time about what I should get you, and it seems like you don't have a coffee machine.
Right now I feel like ripping the savings book into shreds!
Do you know how good this machine is?
All right.
Thank you.
I'll go after I make myself a cup of coffee with this.
Omo!
That must be your present.
This looks like fun!
Let's open it.
That's right.
This is so much fun.
I'm so excited!
That's right.
Let's open it.
It's a coffee machine too.
Hey, Seon U In Yeong.
You chose well.
Isn't this the same as the one in your house?
Couple Coffee Mate.
I didn't set out to do that.
But since you like the coffee this machine makes...
Yeah, I like it a lot.
Thanks for yours too, Kang Hui.
Today, let's make coffee using In Yeong's machine.
I have to watch it with you, Director.
I've watched it already.
It's not something I like enough to watch twice.
While we watch the movie,
I want to discuss some ideas for our next movie.
What is it?
I'll tell you when we watch it together.
Didn't I already tell you not to be like this?
So do you want to watch it or not?
Not at home.
If you want to watch it with me, then bring it to the office.
Also, don't come here whenever you want.
This is my personal space.
Isn't the director being cold?
He's so cold to me.
I don't know if he is always like this or it's just an act.
Do you think I will back off?
Of course not.
He said he was attracted to this girl.
That he felt excited near her.
He may be treating her coldly because of me.
Out of his loyalty to me.
Out of obligation.
Yes, out of his loyalty to me and because of this, she is falling for him even more.
He seems to treat you very well.
But he's really cold towards me.
Hey, what do you mean "you"?
She is 10 years older than you.
I know, I know, 33.
Because I'm the eldest daughter, I'm not used to calling others "eonni".
(Eonni - older sister)
Are you two working on another movie together?
You didn't know?
We're a perfect couple.
You're being nonsensical again.
I had fun, bye.
You're not sending me off?
I'm scared of the stairs.
Just leave by yourself.
Just lend him to me for a while.
Hey, hey, hey!
Why are you like this?
Director, the coffee machine I gave you is a couple thing, too.
I have the same one at home, you know?
I know...
I know...
Where are you going?
You go down by yourself?
I have to go back.
At first, I was mad at her boldness.
At the thought of having to compete with this person,
I am so afraid.
Furthermore, because I know Kim Seong Su will not be able to reject her,
I cried.
In Yeong...
In Yeong...
The most tragic part is that he saw me in such a state.
He found out I was uneasy and suspicious.
He found me at such a pitiful moment.
In Yeong.
Have a glass of wine.
In Yeong, are you bothered by what I said earlier?
Just a bit.
I only said that because you wanted me to be honest.
If I have to describe it in words, it's not a serious feeling.
When I see Yun Kang Hui, I just think that she's very cute.
If I have to say it out.
Yes, it's fine.
You don't have to say anymore.
You know full well that I love you.
Then propose to me.
Kim Seong Su, do I have to say it out loud?
In the future you and I will be very happy.
I've already made plans.
Plans?
What plans?
Does he mean a proposal?
You've been with me for 10 years.
Those 10 years will not be easily destroyed.
I am very thankful and happy to have you by my side.
I know, I know.
I know everything.
What is there about you that I don't know?
Is that Hyeon Ju?
Yes, it's me.
Guess where I am right now.
You're in Bali.
Where else can you be?
Aren't you coming back tomorrow?
I came back today.
Right now, I'm in front of that bastard's company.
Who?
Which bastard's company?
That son of a bitch.
Why?
Didn't you say that you wouldn't go?
=Didn't you say you'll coolly end it?
Why are you there?
=
=Hello?
Hyeon Ju?
Hyeon Ju!
Hyeon Ju!
=
=Hyeon Ju!
Hyeon Ju!
Hyeon Ju!
Hyeon Ju!
=
Go ahead.
=What are you planning to do?
=
I am going to kill this bastard today.
Hyeon Ju.
I am going to kill you, today.
Miss In Yeong, you seem like a fine woman.
This is my declaration of war.
I really like Director Kim.
He's my type.
Women can see a thousand things in one second.
I see him wearing a ring.
You know, the first thing we check out when we see an eligible man...
That punk actually took off the ring.
Private life is private life.
This is work.
This isn't the attitude of a professional, is it?
If you want a good career, learn how to treat your partner first.
Once every month, I become a totally different woman.
Sorry I'm late.
Do you always lie like this when you're outside of the company?
How can you talk such nonsense to your sunbae?
What?
Hotel Chairman's grandson?
You're the chairman's grandson?
~Episode 3~
The Unusual 6th Time Dating There are no winners or losers in a game of catch.
The most important thing is that we are spending this moment together.
That's it.
Try to catch this!
Try to catch it!
The reason that I like catch is that once you're done you can forget about it.
There's no need to analyze how good your game was.
What's different about sex and catch is that after finishing sex, it's a little, no, quite a lot fussy.
Did Seok Hyun get up?
He probably didn't, right?
Is he on the other side?
He's not here.
He's gone.
Yoon Seok Hyun isn't here.
But it definitely isn't a dream...
Is he getting breakfast ready?
In the shower?
Ahhh.
Maybe he went out to buy Cheese cake, which is my favorite.
Hey, Yoon Seok Hyun.
Yea, not too long ago...
The movies?
!
Why are you there so early in the morning?
There was a movie that I wanted to see.
I have a lot to do today.
When are you coming back?
Don't worry about me and do the things you need to do.
How am I supposed to take this?
It wouldn't have been this ridiculous even if I found myself sleeping on the street.
I like waking up and holding onto each other tightly when I wake up.
How is it usually?
In the past...
We woke up and laid there like that before we got up.
I can't believe that Sunbae did something so childish.
I know sides of him that you don't know.
He was always so sweet when he woke up.
That's how it feels to wake up first and be left in bed alone.
It feels bad, actually.
Doesn't it?
It's because you aren't dating.
Huh?
You guys aren't dating.
What do you mean?
Wasn't it a one-night stand?
Wasn't it a night of playing catch?
I mean, last night....
Do you want to sleep in my room sometimes?
It felt like he had totally fallen for me.
You were the one who suggested it first.
Do you want to come and sleep in my room sometimes?
Why would I leave my room and go to yours?
That was his answer to that.
His gaze wasn't like that!
He originally has a gaze that seduces women.
It's different for me!
No, it the same.
Usually he is harsh, but sometimes, when I say something, he smiles a little.
Then, he makes my heart a flutter a little.
When he does that, he knocks women off guard.
Right?
Right?
You didn't possibly think that sleeping with him last night meant you were dating again, did you?
If he leaves you in bed alone after you slept together for the first time in three years, that's his answer.
I'm sure of it too.
You can't believe a single word, smile, gaze, or promise of a man.
You read a man's heart through his actions.
What men do reveals what is in their heart.
After the night that you slept together, he left you in bed alone and went to see a movie.
Do you need any other words?
Wasn't just sleeping together all you wanted?
I thought that at first, but I actually don't want to just sleep with him.
So, what are you going to do now?
What's important is your decision.
Don't just leave the deciding up to him; you have a say in it also.
Don't just follow the man to the place he says to go.
You make him come the way you're going to go.
But is that as easy as you say it is?
Last night, Ho Joo suddenly bought a mirror.
What do you think?
It'll be fun, won't it?
Give me another one.
Baby, look at it.
Look at it~ Look at it!
I said look at it!
It feels like we're shooting a movie.
Do you know how embarrassing it was?
Why?
I like how people look when they kiss.
I couldn't focus and it wasn't hot.
And it felt a bit animalistic.
Why couldn't you refuse it?
Because he wanted it.
He's the person that I like.
Does he not like you?
Tell him to cater to you a little!
He caters to me a lot.
When we watch movies, he lets me decide the movie.
It's the same with restaurants.
He also goes along with what I want when we go on dates.
So I should compromise too.
So just compromise to the point where it's not hard for you.
That's the advantage of compromising.
If you hated it that much, you should have told him truthfully!
I don't want to hurt him.
Is there a way to speak truthfully without hurting someone?
That way is in a lot of movies of Disney.
Wake up from your dream.
The place I'm trying to go.
Where do I want to go with Yoon Seok Hyun?
There are times when I don't even understand my own heart, even though it's mine.
What in the world do I want?
He revealed what he wanted clearly to me three years ago.
I've never thought of getting married, not once.
I thought you were the same.
Does he think differently now?
You went exercising?
Yea, with the girls.
Let's go in!
Did you enjoy the movie?
Of course, I enjoyed it!
You like sushi, right?
As soon as the ending credits of the movie came up,
I hurried and ran to get lunch for us to eat together.
You know I hate those people who stand up and leave before the names of ending credits, right?
You said that you had a lot to do today on the phone earlier.
Did I?
This man is making me confused again.
I asked them to put a lot of salmon in because you like salmon.
There's one thing I know for sure, and that's that I don't want to be shaken by this man anymore.
All of sudden, why did you go to see a movie?
I made a reservation in advance.
You might not see it today.
What are you dissatisfied about?
What kind of relationship are we in?
I'm saying, what kind of relationship do we have?
Well, does it really need to be clarified?
He's saying that nothing has changed from 3 years ago.
I haven't thought that this kind of relationship we're in now could become that kind of relationship later.
What kind of relationship do you want it to be?
Are you going to just go along with whatever kind of relationship I say I want?
I will never give him the right to decide this relationship.
I want something definite, simple, and uncomplicated.
And what kind of relationship is that?
Just sex partners.
Good job, Joo Yeol Mae!
Ok then, let's go with that.
If that's what you want.
You're talking like I'm the only one who wants that.
I also wanted that.
Thanks for deciding it in advance.
Since we started to talk about it,
I'd prefer making it more detailed.
Fine.
What do you want?
Wait.
Sleeping together once a week.
At my room in 1st/3rd week and at your room in 2nd/4th week.
That can't be done mechanically like that.
Let's just do it when we want it.
Are you saying we have to say it everytime we want to do it?
Let's set some code.
When you want, put those high heels at the entrance.
Those shoes from Jae Kyeong.
What are you going to do when you want to do it?
I'll stick that thing together like this.
Fine.
Do that then.
Doesn't there need to be something for when we're refusing?
Your shoes...
Refusing is the other's right, so let's not get hurt.
Wouldn't it be better to have a relationship to respect each other?
Not more than once per week!
What are you talking about?
If we want it, it should be ok to do it even 10 times in one night!
I know it's not possible, so stop your bluff.
So, should I prove tonight that it's not a bluff?
Cooperate for the birth control.
When did I not do that?
I was always in charge.
Have I made any mistake before?
Using the frontier spirit, find a new world everyday.
There are so many new worlds I found before, but you aren't satisfied with those?
Have the spirit of adventure.
You should have some spirit of service, not trying to only receive everyday.
How great service are you giving me?
Tell me if there is any thing lacking.
Your kissing on my knees isn't all that.
I don't feel anything at all.
You don't feel anything, yet you moan like that?
I refuse your sarcastic tone.
I'll talk to you the way you talked to me.
You should speak a little more gently.
Holding my hand, putting your hand on my shoulder, and touching me arousingly outside of the bed is definitely banned!
What about kissing?
It doesn't matter if you don't.
I'm going to do it.
Because I like kissing you.
"Clean the house",
"Sleep at night and work at day",
"Let's eat timely", and so on.
All kinds of nagging are absolutely banned.
Whether I put socks in the laundry bin, or put them under the sofa and ferment them, do not care at all.
It's also banned for you to give advise while putting on airs.
Don't act like my older brother, either.
You're just one year older than me.
Whatever I do, whoever I meet, don't butt in my private life either.
Of course.
We're just sex partners.
Don't forget what you said.
That we're just sex partners.
Keep in mind that if either of us gets a lover, this relationship ends there!
The relationship must be fair.
Don't forget that it should be the same way If I get a girl friend.
In this way, our relationship was confirmed.
A sex relationship with no restrictions or love.
And so my unusual 6th relationship with Yoon Seok Hyun began.
But, I suddenly remember.
My first night with Seok Hyun.
I told you not do it, didn't I?
Do what?
I told you not to do this, didn't I?
I said I can't be responsible for what happens, didn't I?
I felt like my heart was going to explode then.
It was the first time my heartbeat was that loud.
But look at me now!
I told Seok Hyun to just be sex partners first!
Shamelessly.
Because it's been over 10 years.
Aren't you sad?
We've changed like this.
We can't pretend to be innocent now.
To me, it's more embarrassing to act innocent.
Sometimes men tell some dirty jokes.
Even if I really don't get it, if I don't know at my age, they think I'm pretending to be innocent.
I give the jokes back sometimes, and then later regret it.
I actually don't really know how a climax feels.
I've never felt myself aroused to that point yet.
But I know that Ho Joo can't do it.
I feel so sorry about that.
Sorry about what?
I'm sorry that I like him but I can't be satisfied by him.
If you like him, should you get the orgasm even if you're only holding his hand?
There was the time we believed that, too.
What's up with us?
My first was when I was 4th year in the university.
The next day I looked at my mom, but I couldn't even look her in the eye.
Because I felt so sorry and ashamed.
Me too!
Me too, me too!
I looked at his face all the time since I was 5 years old.
But it was so unfamiliar to me after I slept with him and woke up.
I thought, "Ah, his face was like this."
He looked that much unfamiliar, but so lovely too.
For some reason, I was sad too.
I looked at my face that morning and felt like I had become an adult overnight.
I can't explain what that feeling was.
Suddenly,I wantedto seemylate mom, and worried if my grandmother would scold me.
What was so complicated about it for you guys?
Then how was it for you?
I told you a long time ago!
Since the guy begged for hundreds days,
I just slept with him because it was too much bothering.
I did it, finished, and realized, "Ah, it's nothing special."
That's it.
Other than that, you really didn't feel any?
The first time is just the first time.
You, do you remember when was the first time you drank cola?
There's no need to remember it as special or keep remembering it.
The first time doesn't have any special meaning except for the fact it's the first.
Don't you feel sad that you won't ever be that innocent again?
We just changed, that's all.
We'll keep changing in the future too.
Hold on, I have a question.
How much more should I change to be happy after getting a weird present from Ho Joon?
You got a present?
Jae Kyung, your nails are dry now, right?
Take this out of my bag.
Don't make fun of me!
This box was delivered to my office today.
This expensive brand?
Is it the time to discuss its price?
It's not a leather rope or handcuffs.
What's the big deal?
I can't wear this kind of underwear even if I die.
Wearing it is better than dying.
Imagine if I were to die while I was wearing those underwear.
Imagine how shocked my mom would be when she confirmed my corpse.
She will faint, not because I died, but because of my underwear!
You worry about the strangest things!
Anyway, I can't go on like this.
I'll go to your house tonight.
You come everyday.
Tonight's not that good.
Let's meet tomorrow!
The next day, Ji Hee and Ho Joo went to Namsan.
Of course, she didn't wear those underwear.
1,2,3!
So that she wouldn't be burdened or serious.
She tried to find the right timing to tell him without hurting him.
Shall we sit here?
This is really awesome!
-Um...
-Um...
Finally, she found that space.
.... she thought so, but...
Never mind, I'm fine.
Next time.
I really like you, Ji Hee.
Why suddenly out of the blue...?
You're really kind and strong, and I think you would be good at raising kids.
You work hard to match me well, and you're pretty.
I'm even thinking of marrying you.
You know I'm not the average doctor in Korea, right?
In other words, I'm the higher level.
What?
All of my friends open their clinics with the funds from their wives' family and receive buildings.
But I don't need anything like that!
Why?
Because I'm capable enough to earn those.
I'm fine with the fact that you're just an ordinary employee and that you're from an ordinary family.
But, I, a person from the higher level of Korea, have one thing I can't get above the average.
What is that?
-S-E-X!
-What?
!
Sleeping together is the most important thing to humans!
SEX
LIFE!
The most important thing to humans is food, isn't it?
Let's go talk at home!
He's listening to music.
He doesn't hear us.
He's listening to music.
He doesn't hear us at all, what is it?
Put yourself in my shoes.
Don't you think I would feel wronged?
During days, I'm totally the higher level.
But at nights, I'm the lower class.
How does it make sense?
You don't have much experience with men, do you?
That's...not true.
Even if you have some,
I would be the third or second guy, wouldn't I?
Ho Joo was Ji Hee's third man.
Tell me straight out.
This is a really important problem in our relationship!
Do I....really have to tell you that?
Ah, look at you!
I knew you would be like this.
I mean, you should be able to just tell me something like this naturally.
How inflexible you are!
I like you being innocent, but since you're this unflexible, your skill doesn't improve even when we do it over and over!
Are you done talking?
You and I have slept enough.
More than 10 times.
But then how come you haven't improved at all?
Your orgasm was as stiff as wooden panels.
Totally like a stone!
Like a huge rock!
Ji Hee realized that that the time had come to throw the last ball in this boring game of catch.
The ball exactly hit the opponent's chest.
Ho Joo could not receive the ball.
What are you doing?
!
So ignorant!
Were you always such an ignorant woman?
!
Hey, Ji Hee!
Ji Hee!
Ji Hee, it was a conversation for both of us.
Ji Hee, let's get on and leave together, ok?
Fine, you are good at sex.
You're good, but just a little lacking.
That's all.
OK, I was too selfish.
OK?
So let's go.
Ka Ho Joo-sshi.
I'll see you next time.
I'm really not in the mood to talk right now.
Fine, I got it.
I'll call you later.
Calm down and go on home.
One second!
One second!
Hold on a second!
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Ahjusshi, hold on a moment!
Just a second!
Listen to me closely.
Today was no big deal.
I've also experienced something similar , but don't cry for that kind of jerk's comment.
Miss Ji Hee!
Sorry.
I heard it earlier.
You're really cute and sexy!
That jerk just doesn't know that.
The problem must be with him.
I assure you.
So don't be too miserable, and live bravely, ok?
There would be no chance for us to meet again, so forget about me as well as what he said completely!
Understand?
Miss Ji Hee!
Fighting!
Fighting!
Fighting!
Fighting!
Fighting!
Fighting!
Hello?
Yes.
Oh really?
!
Yea!
I'll go right now!
Where are you going?
They said that the record that Music Director Francis Lai composed came in.
Which one amongst them?
OST for "La Leçon particulière".
Wow.
I'm sorry it's so sudden!
Let's do it tomorrow!
Where's the boss?
He's eating lunch.
Wasn't there any LP your boss gave you?
I heard the LP of OST for "La Leçon particulière".
Hold on one second.
We don't have that.
But he called me 10 minutes ago.
Can you call and ask him?
Alright, I will.
Excuse me.
How much is it?
It's $220.
Thank you.
Do you come here often?
I requested this a really long time ago, so can't you give it up to me?
Then try explaining why I have to.
Well firstly, the boss called me to tell me that this came in, and while I was coming here, you picked it, Ji Hoon.
I really need this because of work!
Ah, this came out on CD!
Try buying that, Ji Hoon sshi!
Wow, you're a total conman.
Not all of the songs on here are on the CD.
On CD, all the songs I like were missing.
You knew that and tried to trick me just now?
Am I unattractive?
Why are you asking?
Usually, if a woman this pretty begs earnestly, wouldn't the man give in?
You didn't act cute!
What is it?
Do you have something left to say?
You're going to a coffee shop, right?
Let's go together.
We're going the same way anyway.
I'm going to go eat though.
Oh, that turned out well!
I'm going to go eat too!
Let's eat together!
It's my treat.
Shall we do that then?
I'm getting the A Course.
Then I'll get the same... [$320]
He's a super rude jerk which is rare nowadays.
I'm a bit full, so should I just eat some pasta?
Over here!
-Two A Courses.
-Yes.
Excuse me, pasta-
I want to eat that though.
I will treat you.
I don't want to lose my LP after getting the lunch treat.
It's not just because of the LP...
All right!
Tell me, why do you need this that badly?
This time you have to tell me the truth.
Don't try to con me.
Look here!
You said earlier that all of this LP isn't on CD, right?
There are six songs that are on the CD and I need two of them.
Not for the movie I'm working on now, but some day I will surely use them.
I wanted to be a movie music director because of this music director, Francis Lai.
My mom really liked the movie Love Story.
But I remembered the music more than I did the movie.
Then, by any chance, are you looking for the sound track of this music director for "Eyes Full of Sun"?
Do you have it by any chance?
It's this way.
All right, let's see!
"Eyes Full of Sun", Francis Lai..
Here it is, "Eyes Full of Sun".
Wow, amazing!
You really have many rare records.
How did you find them all?
They're my dad's.
Turntable, radio tube, speakers... all of them.
Your dad passed away, huh?
I'm like that too.
I didn't have a dad from the time I was born.
My mom passed away too, when I was 18.
But where are the speakers from?
These?
My dad made them.
But he had to keep repairing them because they kept breaking.
Actually, when I was a kid,
I didn't really think of them as precious.
When I needed some allowances,
I snuck them out and sold them too.
My dad left a list.
So, these days, reading this list,
I'm getting back the ones I sold before.
So, that LP won't come to me as a result.
Instead, you can listen to it whenever you want.
Or you can come later on your own and listen to it.
Really?
My father should've left such things.
Aren't you jealous?
He listens to music when he misses his dad.
How about you?
Don't you have any moments when you miss your father or Ki Hyun?
If I talk about that kind of stuff, I get weak.
I don't want to talk about that with you.
That's why you won't do.
Men should know how to talk about sensitive subjects too.
What's good about sharing those kind of stories?
I mean if you just hold it in your heart it's hard.
Aren't you lonely?
Not at all.
I don't know why I'm saying this to a messed-up person.
That's why I'm also lonely by your side!
Do you know?
Your heart is made of steel.
I think it's for you.
Who is it?
This is Author Yoon Seok Hyun's house, right?
Yes that's right.
Who are you?
I'm here to meet him and tell him something if he's home.
Come in.
He's in the room on the right.
Oppa, you have a guest.
Who is it that you would open the door?
I don't know, it's a woman.
Who is she that she would come to my house without even contacting me?
Have a seat over there.
Hold on a moment.
I'll do it.
She should wait.
Coming here without contacting me...
She'll hear you.
So picky...
But she seems to be in a very cold mood.
Why?
You're not going?
Go!
What is it?
I am...
Writer Kang Na Hyun.
You don't recognize my name?
Not really.
The scenario that you adapted this time...
I'm the one who wrote its first draft.
Ah, yes.
Please have some coffee.
So?
Is it okay... to change mystery into a romantic comedy?
Ah, for that, it'd be better to talk with the production company...
As I am a writer too,
I came because I wanted to ask you.
What is wrong with my scenario?
It doesn't have any commercial viability.
Commercial viability....?
You're not the production company, nor the investor.
A writer is talking about commercial viability...
Are you really a writer?
You...
What did you say your name was?
I am Writer Kang Na Hyun.
I'm a senior who has worked for 10 years in this field.
If you're a senior, then act like a senior.
This story won in the contest.
It's already proven itself, but how could you change it without any conscience and ruin it like trash?
Did you just say trash?
That's right, trash!
This is not a story about a psychiatric ward, but a love story in a psychiatric ward.
You received the prize money.
Isn't that enough?
I..
I stayed in a psychiatric ward for a year to research the details, and then I wrote this story.
Precisely, I've re-written the story 28 times.
Even if the movie industry became the money game, how could an author, to another author-
Are you naive or just stupid?
Or are you crazy?
Stop showing you're an amateur.
Are we co-writers?
I received your scenario from the film company, and I corrected as per the request to change it to be as commercial as possible.
Director Kang confirmed my script was ok.
You've already gotten that prize money and it's over!
What's the problem here?
The system is the problem.
Then, go to the system and argue there!
You're not anyone else.
You're a writer.
If you've been in this field for ten years, then shouldn't you try to change the wrong process?
Even if it's the adaptation, how could you...
Without considering the intention of the writer who wrote its first draft, how can this kind of scenario just be produced and made into a movie?
How can a writer just accept this kind of system naturally?
If you're angry and feel wronged, then make your story sell so well that nobody can change a single word.
Or you do the directing.
You, in this field, have you never been treated unfairly?
Not even once?
I was hot from the beginning.
I won the prize of YoungJin Scenario contest when I was 22 years old,
And another prize of Golden Dragon contest in the same year, and after that, I kept doing well on and on.
As you know well, I've won awards 3 times from the film award festivals.
For the last 10 years, I've never been ignored, not even once.
But now it's just one time.
And that's today.
If you don't disappear in front of me within a minute,
I'll call the police.
Even coming to my house...
Come here at a later time.
Aren't you going to stay put?
How dare you butt in!
Please leave quickly.
Aren't you going to come here?
!
Just looking at her, she looks like 23 or 24 years old.
Why didn't you use some nicer words?
Whose side are you taking right now?
!
I'm not taking sides.
Yoon Seok Hyun!
Open the door!
Again, here comes your habit!
Open the door!
You're not going to open the door?
Did I do something wrong?
Why are you releasing your anger on me?
!
Good job, hearing that kind of stuff from your hoobae-
Oppa.
Oppa!
Open the door!
If he locks the door like that, basically it takes 2 days and 3 nights to open again.
Because of that habit, our 2nd break-up came.
Why are you taking leave of absence without discussing with me?
Why are you being like this?
Did I do something wrong?
At least answer your phone!
Where are you?
Are you even alive?
If you're alive, please call me, okay?
Please.
Hey, you crazy bastard!
Hey!
You're a mental case!
What are you doing that you can't even make a phone call?
!
Your cellphone's always off, and off, and off again!
The phone is turned off-
Hey, Yoon Seok Hyun.
Don't live like that!
Do you not like me?
Do you want to break up?
If you don't like me, then tell me you don't.
If you want to disappear, do it after breaking up
You bad man.
Unbelievable.
What am I to you, exactly?
Do you know how much I worried about you?
"Did he have any car accident?
or kidnapped?"
"Will he contact me today?"
"Will he return tomorrow?"
How did you find out I was here?
Is it my fault that your movie production is cancelled?
Is it my fault?
Do you know how much effort I put in it and how much I expected?
So, is that my sin?
Did I make your movie be cancelled?
You should've told me!
If I had told you, if I had told you I would take leaves, then would you have agreed with me?
If I told you I was going to stay here writing for a year, would you have let me?
Can't you write it at home?
Leave.
Okay.
I'll leave.
The thing I'm writing..if I write it all and go to Seoul-
I don't care.
I'm not going to be seeing you anymore.
Leave.
It's late-
I said I'm not going to see you again!
Yeol Mae!
Leave me alone!
Did I boil you or grill you?
Please, leave me alone so I can at least write something before going back!
Get your stuff and come out.
I'm saying this for the last time.
Pack your stuff up and come out immediately.
It's because of Ki Hyun.
Isn't it?
The work is just your excuse.
Go.
Can't you lean on me a little if you're having a hard time?
Can't you cry a little in front of me?
Think about me too.
How could I leave you here alone and go back by myself?
Let's go back together.
Be careful on your way back.
If you don't get your stuff and come out of there in ten minutes, we're really over!
Stop right there, Yoon Seok Hyun!
I said it clearly, didn't I?
That we're really over!
I'm just a stranger to you, right?
!
You're a stranger to me too!
Yoon Seok Hyun didn't come until the last bus departed.
Back then, I thought that it was proof that he didn't love me.
Now, I know this closed door is just a cave, and he went into this dark cave, and he's just a hibernating bear.
Eat a lot of garlic and come out as a human, okay?
I was innocent and beautiful back then, but I don't want to go back.
If I had known what I know now back then, maybe I would've had a little different love.
That regret is all I have now.
Yoon Seok Hyun left his cave 2 days later.
This man still doesn't lean on me.
That didn't hurt me anymore.
Because we're only sex partners.
The sunlight is really nice, isn't it?
You're right.
The sunlight is nice.
Did you eat a lot of garlic?
What do you mean?
No, it's nothing.
- Oh, isn't this my laundry?
- Yup.
I'm in charge of this week's laundry.
The sunlight was nice so I did it.
Occasionally you do kind things.
I'm like that.
Will you go to buy some herbs with me?
I like the fragrance of this one the best.
Mmm!
It's nice!
Mmmm...it's nice.
Why are you being like this?
We decided not to hold hands.
Did you forget?
Pointless skinship is banned!
Just hold it.
Touch it.
It died.
Run!
Is it good?
Mmm, so nice.
It smells good, doesn't it?
Who is the one saying it smells good, but never watering them?
Nagging is banned!
You've keep on breaking the rules; you held my hand earlier.
Yes, yes, yes.
Please water them sometimes.
And change their pots on your own.
You agreed not to butt in how I live, didn't you?
Oh, oppa!
Turn the car!
Wow, it's still here from ten years ago.
It's amazing.
But this isn't where we had our first night.
It is here!
Anyway, it's amazing that it hasn't changed in 10 years.
I know right.
We're the only ones who changed.
The inside probably changed, right?
Shall we go in?
Shall we?
Is this the right place?
I think it is, but...
Press the number of the theme that you want.
Theme?
It seems like a crewless service.
Is that so?
Should we try it?
Shall we?
Room#702.
Room#702?
OK!
What the?
It all changed!
The bath tub is also in outside.
I know right.
I think the bed looks different from then too.
How can you remember something like that?
Because I'm odd?
That's right.
Our first night wasn't here.
Right, it was the home stay at Jeong Seon, Kangwon province.
I just remembered the noodles from then too.
You remember now?
It's too bright here, right?
Shall I make it night time?
Oh, what is this, Joo Yeol Mae?
You're too skilled.
You look like a player.
Sure, because we're not in the relationship that I have to pretend being innocent.
Hey Joo Yeol Mae!
There's no one here.
I should've brought sunglasses.
It's Jae Kyung.
It's Jeong Min!
I almost told him that I started loving him again.
Why are you hesitating?
If you tell him, do you think you would be strangled to death?
I have no right to intervene, but I'm worried that you'll get hurt.
The guy who witnessed the bottom of my sex life came as the branch manager of my company.
Oh My God!
- Mr. Namsan Nosy?
- Why do you keep following me?
- Hey.
- I told you not to touch me!
- It's ok.
I said I'm ok!
- It's all messed up!
I feel depressed, and I hate myself.
I wish I had some kind of different love.
- What kind of love?
- Your fingers must be hurt.
Even if you go around and around, the person you eventually meet.
Die!
You beast-like jerk!
~Episode 1~
Should I tell you something funny?
I had a pet rabbit a long time ago.
But the rabbit was super slow.
Rabbits are fast.
It was super super slow.
Don't lie.
You're trying to trick me again.
No, I was really surprised.
How would I know that the rabbit would be that slow?
Doesn't a rabbit hop around?
Exactly.
That's what I thought it would do too.
But it didn't hop around.
It went slowly, like this.
Slowly.
Slowly.
It ended.
Did it end?
Yes, it ended.
Um...
Um...
To be honest, I don't want to part like this.
How about having a cup of coffee and sobering up a bit?
I'm not that drunk...
Hold on.
We don't know each other that well.
We can get to know each other starting now.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
You don't even know what I like or what I'm worrying about?
What do you like?
Kisses.
And what are your worries?
Uh.. environmental pollution?
Lack of water in Africa.
I feel so sorry about kids dying of famine.
World peace.
Child abuse.
Ok!
Wait a second.
This part.. is better when I do it myself.
Because...
It gives me a more exciting sensation.
Unbelievable!
What?
Do you not like the scenario?
You don't have the intention to keep my privacy private, huh?
Why do you think it's about you?
It's not?
!
Here!
The setting is the cafe we always use to go to.
This... is what we'd always do when we got drunk.
And what I really can't forgive is...
This part.. is better when I do myself.
Because...
It gives me the most exciting sensation.
Do you really want to reveal to the world about other's sexual taste like this?
Can't you keep it secretl?
Hey!
You think you're the only woman in Korea who enjoys undoing a man's pants?
It's not just one or two.
Up until now a man's waist band have only been undone by hot woman who have want to undo the pants themselves.
MUST you live by selling your experience?
Anyways, was it good or bad?
It's not bad.
Right?
It's good, right?
See, I told you it was good.
But...
Why does a writer instruct about the music?
I really don't like this.
Not only me, but all the other music directors don't like it either!
Why?
In this scene...does this music fit?
So cheesy.
Look, Writer Yoon Seok Hyun!
The music director is me.
Oh.
It's your grandma.
Don't answer it.
Don't answer it.
No answer it.
Tell them I went out, okay?
Yes, Grandmother!
You went on blind dates?
Yes, it was a birthday present,
Matchmaking company's membership.
Grandma says if I don't marry soon,
I won't be able to get pregnant.
I just went for fun, for fun.
Hey, check well, one by one.
Where's my bag?
It's probably upstairs.
Get me that too.
Ok.
Hey!
How can you forget such an important promise?
Car keys!
Oh, oh, here.
Hey, what are you going to do about your hair?
Don't worry about it.
My cellphone.
Yea, here.
Right, this week's cleaning is your turn.
My studio in 2nd floor.
Don't worry,
I'll do everything myself.
Oh, yeah!
I really liked the scenario from before
When you speak to the director, make sure to recommend me as the music director ok?
After I think about it.
Just recommend me!
I'm telling you, I'll give you beautiful music.
Ok.
You'll be late.
Hurry up and go.
Yoon Suk Hyun and I grew up together since we were little.
At 5 years old,
Yoon Suk Hyun who arrived upstairs of our home,
I thought of him as my brother.
Go left.
Left.
Okay.
I don't remember when we starting seeing each other as man and woman, but at 18 years old, we were already in love.
It's all in the past.
Even so.
A girl he dated for 12 years said she was going on a blind date.
How can he have no reaction?
Okay, my house is done.
Now, Yeol Mae's house.
We dated 5 times and broke up 5 times, but we completely ended 3 years ago.
Right now, we're completely strangers to each other.
Look at her room.
We're just "the boy/girl next door".
How can she leave her room like this and go on a blind date?
Because of who I am like this at this age and did not marry yet?
This guy does not take responsibility at all.
Can't you handwash your underwear, Yeol Mae?
Whoever she goes on a blind date with is a poor person.
What is this?
Is this called a bra?
What kind of kid does not have sincerity?
What would've happened if we got married then?
You don't want to get married?
What do you mean?
I never promised to marry you.
We've been dating for 12 years.
Isn't it obvious we would get married?
Are you telling me to take responsibility of you?
Who said that?
Do you even want to marry?
Look around you for a while.
They married but have you seen couples that still love each other?
You haven't seen one.
Are you saying we should date until we get old and die?
It's nice like this.
I don't like it.
I want to get married.
I've never thought about getting married once.
I thought you didn't either.
Then what do I do?
If you want, do it.
With who?
You said you won't!
Let's do it.
I'll be good.
I'm 30 years old now!
I'll be really good to you.
I'll be good~
Let's do it.
If I had believed her then, my life would be over.
If I think about it now,
I am so grateful that he opposed.
A dirty and fickle bitch!
A selfish and picky jerk!
She's going on a blind date and she didn't even wash her face!
Uggh, so dirty!
Hold on,
I should have a water tissue somewhere...
Age, 33.
I have no time to date men who pass by me.
There are many men in the world.
And I have enough charm.
Of course, the fact that the new start of my dating is a membership of Matchmaking company is A LITTLE bothering me, though.
So what?
My friend, Jae Kyung married a man whom she met at a first visit to a library.
have met her present husband.
We met at a library.
Really?
Yes.
If I think about it now, I think of it as fate.
I looked back while opening the door
There was a bright light shining from her direction.
And as I saw it, It was this person.
Then Mrs. Sun Jae Kyung, why were you there?
I was there to meet my friend.
She wanted me to come to her to help her seek revenge against someone.
I treat that friend as a second queen.
She plays major role in my wedding.
Thanks, Ji Hee!
Thank you, Miss.
Ji Hee!
Woo Ji Hee met him at a party.
she met her present boyfriend, Kang HoJoo.
Close the doors during lunch time.
Other hospitals does that.
How can I eat when there are sick children crying?
Still, when you have to eat, you have to.
I ate well.
I even skipped breakfast.
I worked hard making this.
Thank you very much Chef Ji-Hee.
During weekend, should we go on a picnic?
The weather is good these days.
I, have somewhere I want to go.
Where?
Should I make an appointment?
Are you not going to... invite me to your house?
Huh?
It's been over 5 months since we've dated, it's time for you to invite me to your house, isn't it?
Would that be okay?
Honey, aren't we in a loving relationship?
I will think about it.
Romance could appear anywhere.
So I can't lose hope...
I should just leave them there, go home and sleep...
Miss.
Joo Yeol Mae.
Sorry.
I'm a little late, aren't I?
This way, please.
Mr. Kim Han Sup, it's Miss.
Joo Yeol Mae.
You're a music director?
Yes, my first piece was in a movie called The Broken Couple.
I did the whole original soundtrack to the movie.
Omo!
It's so fun!
It's not a romantic comedy, it's a movie about life.
The best part being the music.
Isn't there anything that you and the director both agree on?
I didn't see eye to eye with the director this time.
Director Kim Sung Soo has extremely peculiar taste in music.
However, I tend to have an accepting personality.
That's what everyone tells me.
Hey, Joo Yeol Mae!
Maybe it's because you're in your 30's.
You've gotten more confident.
You could have fooled me if this was our first meeting.
Do you not remember me?
Class of 97, Economics major, Kim Han Suk.
Do you still don't remember me?
Are you a fish?
Does it make sense?
I am saying, does it make sense?
It doesn't make sense.
Right, right?
How can I not remember a guy who I've kissed?
Whose story are you talking about?
My story.
It's not some man that you've passed by but a man who've kissed and you don't remember?
That's why I'm flipping out!
It's not that something's bad with your memory?
You girls...have you ever heard a guy named Kim Han Sup?
The only guy important in your life is Yoon Seok
- Hyun.
He said we met while I was in college.
He knew everything from the movie theater, coffee shop, and all the places I used to go.
It's me totally.
Everything down to how impatient and how mean I can be.
Because he was 10 minutes late, he said I hit him on his back with my bag.
It's you, alright!
Right, the bad me its me right?
How much did he say you've dated?
One month?
What about kiss?
Did he say it was once?
No.
He said we did it 3 times.
Then, at that moment, I've remembered the kiss with him.
I.... remembered.
The first time was at the dorm.
It was a hard and rushed kiss.
It was after we were done kissing that I realized that my bottom lip was totally sore and swollen.
Oh my, I've forgotten about it!
Do you remember the other 2 times?
No.
How many kisses do you think I don't remember?
And...
Also how can I be alone right now after kissing so many men?
I didn't know you were such a easy girl.
Hey if I'm an easy chick then how many men do most 33 year old women kiss?
What the appropriate number?
How many did you do?
You should never tell a woman's past even if you're called to a hearing and questioned.
That's because you can't count them all.
Including the time I was wasted I'm going to say 7 times.
You did more!
I can clearly say how many.
Check it out.
The time I was a freshman in college.
That was my first kiss.
You did it at the movie theater.
The same year with Kim Duk Su.
Also the time under our stairway.
Then, with Park Ji Sung, Kang Dae Pyuh...
Now with Kang Ho Joon.
Why did you miss Chae MyeongSuk?
You eliminated Ji Ho's name, too.
Also that guy who was your brother's friend.
The one who used to watch movies with your brother that fell for you.
Hey, his nickname...
Right!
Geborine!
(a name of painkiller)
Right!
I remember few more right now..
Let's not dig our own graves like this.
Yeah, let's go with the number 10 and go with that.
I told you it's more.
When did I do so much?
A nice girl like me...
But why is the number so important?
If it's more than 10, a player.
It it's less than 10, a good girl?
While I was coming here,
In the streets, they were giving out these.
They give these out in the streets?
They said these are the kit for AIDS.
We're living in this kind of society.
Live life to the fullest instead of worrying about how many guys you've kissed.
I don't remember the past.
I still have no use for these.
Then give that to Ji Hee.
No, those kind of stuff, a man should prepare.
You keep it.
No, I am trying to be pregnant.
Okay, I will keep it.
I'll be needing it soon.
Definitely without a doubt.
Sometime within this month.
Thanks, you b i t c h e s.
You came?
Oh, sunbae, long time!
Sorry.
You were working right?
Yeah, you three are loud today.
Give me a cup of coffee.
Oh, when did you run out?
I have Mandarin and Kenya.
Mandarin.
Thank you.
Even if I've kissed all those men,
I realized why I am still single.
I... loved this man the most.
Yeol Mae, aren't you going to tell us about the blind date?
A totally awesome man came to meet her.
My first kiss went to this man during my sophomore year in high school.
Let's just try it once.
Let's give it a try just once?
Why do we have to do that at all?
Because today is white day. (U.S. Valentine's day)
And so..
If we have our first kiss on white day then we'll have a great memory.
Oppa, have you not kissed anyone yet?
Yeah, so let's do it today.
Our first kiss.
Why do you want to do it so badly with me?
Aren't you curious about it at all?
Curiosity?
Yeah, aren't you curious in the slightest bit?
Not a peck but a real kiss.
You know the difference between a peck and a kiss, right?
Hey!
Don't you really want to try it.
Aren't you honestly curious?
Alright, let's not do it.
Let's go.
Alright, I got it.
I take back saying that we should kiss.
Oppa, you want to experience your first kiss because your curious?
If you want to experience your first kiss out of curiosity then go do it with someone else.
It's not only because I'm curious.
It's not just curiosity.
I mean it.
You're suppose to tell me that you like me first.
I do.
That's true.
That's right.
But do I have to always verbalize that to you?
I already gave you the candy.
Say it!
I like you.
That isn't enough.
You have to say it to me!
I love you.
Shish, what's so hard about that.
Can I do it now?
No, you can't!
Come here!
It's cause there... kids pass by a lot...
This is a peck, right?
Right?
The kiss with this man was so strong, the kisses with other men,
I think I had forgotten it all.
Why aren't you answering?
Huh?
Did you decide to meet with that guy again?
Why are you curious about that?
She said it's a man she dated long time ago.
And she even kissed 3 times...
I heard everything...over there in the living room.
Was there a guy I didn't know about?
Why are you eavesdropping?
When you talk really loud like that, even if you don;t want to hear it, you hear it.
Do you think I would want to hear it?
So...are you going to meet him again?
I am not going to meet him.
So embarassing, how can I?
Didn't you meet him before, because you liked him?
Why are you twisting the words?
How can you...forget a guy you've kissed?
Do you girls do that too?
What about boys?
Do boys remember all as well?
You say it first, sunbae.
If you're talking about my fresh years, won't you with me?
It was when we seperated for a while.
When we first seperated.
You should say it right.
It's not when we both seperated, it's when I first got dumped, isn't it?
What do you want to talk about?
Oh, so that time I got dumped because of that rascal, huh?
You dumped me because you liked that rascal, right?
Who are you calling a rascal ?
Were you two-timing?
Yes, I was two-timing.
If you feel wrong, sue me!
You always wanted to dump me when something goes wrong...
If you were really curious why I've wanted to break up, why didn't you ask then?
If I asked then, would things change?
What would I ask to a girl who wanted to break up everytime we argued?
Okay, fine.
Then why did we broke up 3 years ago?
You don't even have a heart.
Aren't you feeling responsible for a women whom you kissed 50000 times?
It's not 50000 times even if you kissed one time a day for 12 years.
There was a time when you kissed girls 10 times a day!
So, are your lips worn?
Yes. they are.
How are going to pay for it?
How about my lips?
Stop it...
Aren't you guys tired of it?
Why do you guys argue whenever you meet?
Who will be responsible for whom?
You would have to do it yourself.
-I should just not say it, seriously.
-I should just not say it, seriously.
Oh, Jang Woo ssi.
Yeah, I am going in right now.
What about dinner?
He said he had never seen anyone who was happy after marriage, but JaeKyung is living well.
During 3 years of marriage, that they've fought,
I had never heard it once!
How about we use different rooms?
We can just say my room is a guest room.
Then we would have to move makeups and everything whenever a guest comes.
They will find out.
Anyways, they think of us weird.
What?
Why we don't use the same bed.
Ah, seriously.
The woman talks a lot.
So what did you say?
Cuz you need take good rest for the early morning show.
Nice job.
Oh, Congressman Park told me to play golf with him some time.
As couples.
Okay, I will make time.
I just need to lose?
Don't you do a hole in one as previously.
That was an accident.
I was really suprised as well.
So, get ready for heels for madame.
Alright.
Weird.
Did it go out?
Where did you come from?
To buy lights.
My house seems like its out too.
Did you find out just now?
It was like that since yesterday.
You were going to fix it?
Yeol Mae.
Hold on tight.
Okay.
Yeol Mae.
Huh?
Not my legs.
The chair.
Oh, chair?
You have to hold on tight.
I'm here.
Did you change a back mirror on your scooter?
Are you busy?
Look at this.
Isn't it pretty?
I bought 10 pairs.
It was 50 cents.
Wasn't it really cheap?
Look at mine too.
It's the same ones.
It's pretty right?
Hold on.
After I do this.
Look for a bit.
Yeah, it's pretty.
Look a bit and talk.
I just started to write.
Hold on...
I will put them in your notebook bag.
If you are that busy, why did you say to meet?
All my friend went on a trip but I'm here with you.
I am saying you are that busy so why did you say to meet?
How much do I have to wait?
Do you have to write that today?
What's it about?
[Yeol Mae loves Seok Hyun!
]
It's been 1000 days since our first kiss.
Do you know that?
I see I see.
I...
I am going.
I am really going!
Did you come out now?
What are you doing?
Are you insane?
You crazy...
Yeah, I am crazy.
And do you even care about it?
You..do you even know how hard it was to get this?
I just replaced it last week.
You called me and all you do is look at the computer for four hours?
Hey, what kind of great writer do you think you are?
You always write things that are boring,
So what's the use of doing that?
You will never get accepted anyways.
Are you done talking?
No, I still have something to say!
Before you become a writer, be a human first!
If that garbage you wrote today gets accepted,
I will be your daughter..
Are you really going to talk whatever you want?
Let's end it.
The moment I spit that out, I began to regret it.
Let's break up.
Tell me it again.
I said let's break up.
I will give you 10 seconds, so think it over again.
I said let's break up!
I wanted to tell him I am sorry.
To tell him not to do this.
I wanted him to stop me.
Okay, I got it.
Go.
That day was the first time we broke up.
I wasn't angry because he was busy.
I wasn't angry because I waited for 4 hours.
That it had been 1,001 days since our first kiss,
Wasn't important to me at all.
I just...
If you are that busy, why did you want to meet?
I can write better when you're around.
So let me go for once.
I will take exactly 5 hours.
Really 5 hours.
I am not going to accept longer than that.
Okay.
Thanks!
I just...needed those few words.
I will have the scooter fixed.
Student.
To put on the same one as the left one, it is 120 dollars but
You are going to put on the same one, right?
Why is it so expensive?
A cheap one is 10 dollars but
This is a good one.
What are you going to do?
Can't you make it a bit cheaper?
It's a imported part for me to give you with discount.
Then just put on the 10 dollars one.
You want to just put two different ones?
Can you please put it on with the same colors?
Alright.
I am sorry.
I decided to put on the 10 dollar one.
There was no replies from Yoon SeokHyun.
Did you see the scooter fixed?
It doesn't match, so it looks funny right?
I am sorry.
It will be easy to study other laws.
You just need to study this law carefully.
Let's end the class for today.
We will see each other another time.
Yes.
Thank you.
With that, we really broke up.
Until we met again three month later, he didn't even look to my direction.
It'sraining.
You...
Is breaking up so easy?
Are you going to say things like that everytime you get angry?
No, I won't do it from now on.
I really won't do it.
I did wrong.
I did wrong, I said.
You smiled!
You missed me, right?
Whyareyouactinglike this ?
Idon 'tlikeyou.
Stayoverthere.
Tell me.
Did you miss me or not?
Thinkwhateveryouwant!
You know you missed me.
Tell me.
You missed me didn't you?
You did miss me didn't you?
He wouldn't say he was wrong even if his life was at sake.
He didn't say he missed me either.
You non acknowledging indifferent jerk!
Ok, Yeol Mi.
Ha?
Turn on the light.
Yes.
- Oh!
- Okay!
Thank you.
These socks have really lasted a long time.
Yeah, I'll probably be able to wear them for another 5 years.
We have a excellent taste.
This will make things difficult.
Does anyone know a person who is aroused by a touch of nose?
It doesn't make any sense.
You've never met a woman like that have you?
I've never heard of such a thing.
She's standing right before your eyes!
My nose is very sensitive.
I just found out yesterday.
It's very comfortable.
How about your ankle?
I'm good over here.
These hurt the heel of the foot.
It hurts from a third step.
Then try this design.
Did he lick your nose?
No just briefly with his finger.
How can my whole body be trembling from such a slight touch?
You must be happy.
All you have to do is this to get that feeling.
Let me touch it.
That's not the same feeling.
Touch my nose lightly.
That does nothing for me!
Thenwhyexactlydid Ifeel that wayyesterday?
You should start with him again.
It's enough that we've reconciled and broken up 5 times already.
It's starting to get disgusting!
He made your nose as a sensual point.
He didn't make it.
It's a my ability.
He made your nose sensitive.
No one is born with it.
I used think my whole body as a sensual point but now I don't feel anything.
The only thing that thrills me these days are these!
What can you do with shoes?
Do it to my nose.
Do it to my nose too.
My nose too!
I Need Romance 2
You should feel the words.
From there.
We'll continue tomorrow.
Please practice so we can finish tomorrow.
Can't we just finish it tonight?
Even if we stay up all night it won't work.
The bassist is totally not with it today.
Grandma.
Why don't you get married since you like it so much!
A major lesson I've learned from previously relationship is how much you try,
Fate can not be altered.
Ok.
Let's not expect too much.
I'm going to test my fate today.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sor...
Why are you so late?
I'm sorry.
There was a lot of traffic.
I have a really really urgent thing I have to take care of.
You took a look at the man's profile, right?
Ah, yes.
Please go ahead.
It was me who got here late.
He's sitting by the windows.
I'm really sorry.
Ididn'tcheckthe profile.
Who is it?
ShouldI justleave?
Is it that man?
It's a relief, it's that guy.
I'm sorry for being late.
There was a lot of traffic.
If you came here from the recording studio, then there wouldn't have been any traffic.
Yes?
I used that route too to come here.
There was no traffic at all.
Howpicky.
Excuse me?
You don't have anything to say to me?
No.
IknowthatheandI are notmeanttobetogether, butwhydid Igetsuchacrazyperson?
I know it was me who was late, but you should at least have some manners when you are in a situation like this.
What kind of a situation is this?
A blind date.
Did someone force you to come here?
Do you think I am a kind of a person who would get married through a blind date?
Lookathim.
Did hejust aggravateme?
Oh my.
Do you think that I would get married through a blind date?
I have a bunch of men who are after me, but I am here because of my grandmother's wishes.
But I still respect the other person and have good manners.
How could you disrespect me like this?
Joo Yeol Mae ssi.
Yes!
I think you got the wrong person.
What do you mean wrong...
I went to the bathroom for a second....
I Need Romance 2
It's over here.
I'm sorry.
I ate a piece of pizza before coming here.
And that is giving me some stomach troubles...
Hold on.
But that man...
Howdoeshe knowmyname ?
Even the location of the recording studio?
I really don't like instant food.
I would love to marry someone who can cook.
Excuse me.
What's your name?
Shin Ji Hoo.
It's a name I don't know.
How do you know me?
Why are you laughing?
If you know me, you shold know how I'm.
I'm very disappointed that you don't remember me.
Were we dating before?
Do you remember now?
Is that right?
When?
You mean..
What I'm saying is..
Did we kiss before?
I think so.
Preview
Did we date?
How long?
That's why you looked so familiar.
I told you not to eat.
I will deal with you at the recording studio.
Be fXXX buddies.
With Yoon Seok Hyun.
He's not any different.
Sex is a sex.
Do you want to sleep in my room sometimes?
Why would I?
[The moon represents my heart] Subtitles by DramaFever
When is the start of a relationship?
What's considered the starting point to count the 100th and 1000th anniversary?
Since I hold a black belt in Taekwondo, I'm just going to get to the point.
I like you.
Would it start when I was asked out?
Or...
Would it start when he first kissed me?
If it's not that either, would it start from a special moment?
Congratulations, Joo Yeol Mae.
You'd better get ready.
Otherwise, your heart will explode.
Would it be the moment when my heart first fluttered?
Anyway, the romance between Shin Ji Hoon and I has started.
You're coming to the studio, right?
Show me your face before you go.
I'm in front of you now.
What the heck?
You literally showed me your face and left?
Stop.
Lisa, even if it's kind of rhythmical, the lyrics are about parting.
I don't want you to sing it with a light voice.
Wait.
The ice coffee will arrive in 30 seconds.
There wasn't love in this relationship.
But there were smiles.
- Lisa.
- Yes?
- Don't you want to drink coffee?
- Yes, I do.
I'll show you magic.
When I count to 3, the coffee will be here.
1, 2, 3.
- Your coffee is here.
- Wow, so cool!
This is who I am.
But there isn't any thrill in this love.
Will this relationship be okay?
- Coffee?
- No, Milk.
Why don't you just tell him to plant a tree?
- Why a tree?
- It'd be a waste if the flower dies.
How do you know?
If it's possible, I want to preserve them for 500 years.
In this relationship, there isn't a feeling of longing for him.
I miss you.
You're thinking of how to reply to this, aren't you?
You can just say you miss me too.
Would it be all right if I say something that I don't mean to Shin Ji Hoon?
I miss you too.
But if I say I miss him, sometimes, I really do miss him.
Should I pick you up?
Do you want to listen to music together at my house?
Be careful.
You might fall off!
- Come down.
I'll do it for you.
- I'm just looking at what's here.
You have so many rare LPs.
Just look at the list of music over here.
You might fall off.
It's okay.
Here.
Look.
Would my heart flutter, even if it's not love?
From here to here, it's 70s music.
And it goes 80s and 90s.
- It's so organized.
- What's your favorite LP?
I have three favorites.
One of them is...
- This one.
- Why do you like this one?
It made me have lunch with a woman I like.
And my next favorite is this.
- Good Bye Summer.
- Why this?
It made that woman come to my house.
What's the last one?
This one.
Almost A Love Story.
Why this?
It made it clear that the woman is my fate.
Then I'll pick your 4th favorite LP.
- What about this one?
- I love it.
Wait.
Don't ever go up here by yourself.
I mean it.
Why?
You're a woman who even gets hurt by bumping into a harmless door.
My heart definitely flutters.
Would this be love?
You picked a good one.
It's good.
Why do you like music?
Why do I like it?
If I listen to music, I feel like the music is leading me to a different world.
Me too!
I started music so I can bring others to a different world.
It also makes me nostalgic.
I know.
If I listen to this music later, it will remind me of today, right?
I feel so comfortable and happy when I'm with him.
But I don't feel sad when I say goodbye to him.
Dude, I like this mirror so much!
Don't get rid of it.
I like the mirror too.
Pay attention to me!
I said I don't feel sad when I say goodbye to him.
That can be a problem.
Aren't you supposed to hate not being with him?
- What about you?
-When I'm alone, I like to be alone.
And when I'm with him, I like to be with him.
I like to be with him but I like it more when he comes back later.
I like him but something's bothering me.
I think something crucial is missing or something.
You'll never love again because of your intense love with Seok Hyun.
Who would break that love?
And this is not like you.
You don't get controlled if you think something's off.
She's right.
You're not passive like I am.
I know that but I don't want to ignore that love.
- How?
- I saw his album yesterday.
What about it?
This is when I was 3 years old.
And this is when I was in kindergarten on Christmas.
And they are my parents.
You look a lot like your father.
- Your lips.
- Really?
Yeah.
- When was this?
- It's when I was in 7th grade.
This is taken around the orphanage.
Didn't you see this tree when you went there?
- You were short.
- I was the shortest in the class.
I got taller in high school.
You look like an elementary schooler.
- Can I keep this picture?
- Okay.
Why did I want to have his picture?
What's this feeling?
I'm kind of surprised that you like this picture.
- Why?
- Wait here.
Here.
Is this the same tree?
It's my tree.
My tree.
I started to live in the orphanage in middle school.
I was very lonely.
Others got along because they were raised there since they were very young.
But I wasn't, so I kind of didn't get along with them.
So after school, I would read a book under that tree.
But that year, there was severe drought.
It's kind of funny if I think about it now.
A tree doesn't die that easily, even if there's a drought.
But I was so worried that I watered the tree everyday.
I realized that this is love.
I went to water the tree on the night I couldn't water it during the day time.
It was a full moon that night.
I watered it 20 times and looked up at the moon.
At that moment, I realized what love is.
What's love?
It's something I worry about and would do anything for, and after I do it, I feel happy.
You were a nice and good boy when you were young.
I was thinking at that moment, that if I was there, I'd probably hug him tightly.
Isn't this love?
What the heck?
I was just being very thoughtful and mature.
You guys open your eyes when I'm being mean.
Move your butt!
Na Hyun.
Na Hyun!
Na Hyun.
Please!
Everything here is messed up.
Every woman who comes to this house is weird.
Seok Hyun, I'm sleeping over at Ji Hee's house.
Ji Hee, let me use your phone.
I did ask you.
Ji Hee?
Seok Hyun, Yeol Mae is sleeping at my house tonight.
You're so cute, Yeol Mae.
Then tell her I'm sleeping in her room.
My room is taken by Kang Na Hyun.
If it's possible, I want to preserve this for 500 years.
Our morning started by looking at the mirror.
I like this mirror a lot.
I wish I had one too.
I like it too.
I feel sexier brushing my teeth than when I do it in the bathroom.
Oh, really?
- Is this okay?
- Yeah.
- You guys woke up early?
- Hey, do you want some?
No.
I'm going to change my clothes and leave.
We should get all the information scientifically, okay?
- What happened to the flowers?
- Did you see it?
What do you think?
This is what I did.
Do you like it?
Fine.
You're so cool.
You win.
You're a pathetic person.
I don't understand how a person like you can write.
You know we have a VIP preview for Director Park after 2 days, right?
Was it?
Na Hyun, do you want to go?
I wanted to watch that movie.
He'd feel upset if you don't go.
I'll get a ticket for her later.
You two go together.
I'm going on a date with Ji Hoon.
Bye guys.
You can go then.
Hello.
I'll show my face as long as you want.
By the way, you're only staying in this cafe lately.
Yeah.
The other branch is okay without me.
Are there any other cafes?
I only have two.
Should I open one again?
That's not a bad idea.
I'd like two Yeol Mae sherbets.
What's that?
Ah, that's the new menu that I invented.
Here.
Only put what you like.
You said you don't like my cafe's sherbet.
But why did you name that after me?
I'm kind of shy.
Wow.
Your face blushes too?
- You're so pretty.
- Don't say that.
Don't cover your face.
You said you would show it to me for a long time.
- Yeol Mae.
- Yes?
Do you want to go see the tree with me tomorrow?
It's supposed to be a full moon tomorrow night.
We will see the huge moon.
Okay.
- Do you want this in?
- Yeah, this too.
- This one too.
- This much?
This restaurant is very famous for fusion food.
You picked a good one.
It sounds good.
I thought it'd be better to have some gourmet food rather than just beef.
What should I eat?
I guess the man is going to propose to the woman.
Miss Woo, when are you getting married?
Did you get a proposal yet?
- I broke up..
- I broke up..
Did you break up with him?
How did you know about that?
Kim Deok Soo.
He was Ji Hee's first man.
I think she's related to Kim Tae Ho somehow.
- What's that?
- Marry me, Deok Soo.
I love you.
I want to be with you everyday.
Hyun Joo, I like you a lot.
As time goes by, I like you more and more.
But...
- You know my circumstance.
- Why does that matter?
All you have to do is bring your clothes and come to my house.
Your mother is against it.
Let's keep convincing your mother and build up my potential and then..
No!
How do you know when she'd say okay?
- She should wait.
- What's wrong with you two?
- Shh.
- Shh.
Let's just do it.
Let's do it by ourselves.
I'm really okay, Deok Soo.
Please?
You're so crazy about getting married, Kang Hyun Joo.
There's no hurry.
Give me some time.
I'm sorry but I gotta go now.
I'm sorry.
- Miss.
Woo!
- I gotta go too.
I'm sorry.
She's a nice girl.
He will regret turning her down.
Do you know how nice and innocent he is?
- How do you know him?
- How do you know her?
I must be unfortunate.
I went to see a fortuneteller with my friends a few days ago.
She said I have an ill-fated life.
I realized when I saw Deok Soo.
Because I'm not very fortunate with men, I missed him.
I'm upset.
Why are you nodding?
I'm glad that you're regretting that you missed a nice and innocent man like him.
Kang Hyun Joo...
She's a very lovely girl if you get to know her.
I used to be a lovely girl too.
My blood type was A.
But since I was so stressed in my senior year of high school, my blood type changed.
From A to AB.
This nonsensical babble is a warning that Ji Hee is drunk.
After my blood type changed, I got weird.
Does that even make sense?
Ji Hee's face doesn't change at all even if she's drunk.
You think I'm stupid, don't you?
Then do you think you're smart?
It's delicious.
After 10 minutes, she'll black out.
Somebody has to stop her.
Actually, I'm a vegetarian.
A vegetarian.
Ah, begetarian?
Your pronunciation is wrong.
The "V" sound.
You should do it right.
Okay.
Vegetarian.
By the way, does a vegetarian eat chicken?
I don't know.
I feel so bad.
I feel so bad.
I feel so bad for this chicken.
Look at this.
She has a neck but she doesn't have a head.
Now, no one can stop her.
Where have all the chicken heads gone?
Do you know the book, "A Chicken Dies in Peru"?
Would she go to Peru?
Ji Hee, it's "A bird dies in Peru", not a chicken.
Ji Hee, what are you doing now?
- Ji Hee.
- I can't leave them here.
I should go bury them.
I'm going to find her head and bury them.
If something has to exist together, it has to be together to be happy.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Do you know how to go to Peru?
- What?
Peru?
I'm sorry.
It's nothing.
I'm sorry.
Ji Hee, is this your drinking habit?
I'm not drunk.
Ji Hee.
Ji Hee!
Where did she go?
Ji Hee!
Ji Hee could finally take a break after 3 hours of wandering.
Hyun Joo, I'm getting punished now for being mean to you.
So you should live a happy life.
Ji Hee, I'm answering your phone call, okay?
Hello?
- Hello.
- Who's this?
Ah, you!
I've heard a lot about you from Ji Hee.
- Yeah.
- What's Ji Hee doing now?
She's sleeping now.
It's right to sleep at this hour.
But the location where she's sleeping is the problem.
Then I'll leave it to you.
Thank you.
Should I go check on her?
She should be fine I think.
Mr. Kim?
- You're up?
- Why are you sleeping here?
Woo Ji Hee, I brought you here from the park last night.
You know what this is, right?
Your friend knows about it.
A vegetarian.
- Friend who?
- Seon Jae Kyung.
- The official...
- I'm sorry.
It must've been hard to handle me.
Yeah.
But you were cuter when you were drunk.
Thank you.
This room is kind of mysterious.
What's with that mirror?
What do you think it is?
It's just a mirror that I look at when I do exercise in the morning.
I see.
The angle is just for the bed.
I'm a woman who does exercise in the morning while looking at the mirror.
Yeah.
I do believe even if you swim on the bed.
Want to join?
- You're up?
- When did you come?
At midnight.
I took a shower and put some make up on.
But I still had some time left so I made breakfast.
- Did you make all of this?
- You had all the ingredients in the fridge.
Have a seat.
Take a shower after you eat.
The soup is getting cold.
You don't cook at home, do you?
The rice looks so old.
Jae Kyung.
It's been so long since you talked about something besides the business.
Because the situation got a little bit better.
I'll try to do that more.
I'm impressed.
Eat this, too.
Eat slowly.
Your stomach will get upset.
Would it be too small for two people to live here?
Let's stay here together.
It's kind of small.
I'm sorry.
But we are...
No!
I'm sorry, Jung Min.
I got a new apartment and I don't want to live with another person anymore.
- I can't stand it.
- Let's live together.
You know I've been waiting for you.
I know if I'm having hard times, you're having harder times.
Can we work this out together as we live together?
Let's bear with this separately and work it out separately.
Even if we love each other, it doesn't mean that we have to stick together.
Think it over.
We don't need to hesitate anymore.
I don't want to waste my time doing that again.
I'll think about it.
The address is kind of weird.
That's a residential area.
Seriously, it's not possible for her to buy a house.
It's Jae Kyung.
Buy some chicken.
Yeol Mae, you buy pizza.
- What did she say?
- She told us to buy everything.
I'm chicken and Yeol Mae is pizza.
- I thought it was a housewarming.
- Then what am I?
You're drinks.
- She told me to buy cups too.
- Cups?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What the heck?
Is this the right address?
It's right.
I think she just wants to meet us here, she doesn't live here, right?
You guys are here?
Let's make a toast to my restart!
Let's drink, guys!
Seok Hyun shouldn't drink because he has to drive.
- Why aren't you living with Jung Min?
- This chicken looks so good.
- Do you want some chicken, Ji Hee?
- I'm not eating chicken for a while.
Ahh, because you're a vegetarian?
Anyway, are you really going to live here?
Yeah.
Just live with Yeol Mae.
What are you doing here?
- What do you think it is?
- Are you punishing yourself?
Yeah, you're right.
I'm going to reflect on myself here.
You shouldn't have committed adultery in the first place then.
No, not that.
I'm punishing myself for taking advantage of a man.
You know I got married just by looking at a man's background.
I didn't care if I loved him or not or if he was my type or not when I got married.
This is the consequence of me taking advantage of a man.
It's obvious for a person to calculate her benefit in her life.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Even if you did it, it's in the past.
You don't have to punish yourself.
You never miss the chance to show off.
How did you come up with that kind of speech?
I'm a writer.
Where do you take a shower?
If you go around that corner, there's a small bathroom.
Jae Kyung, let's not do this.
I can't sleep comfortably at night, if you live here.
I didn't invite you to worry about me.
I invited you to witness my comeback!
You can't tell Jung Min about this, okay?
- Guys, cheers!
- Cheers.
Bottoms up.
Just let her be.
You know you can't make her stop living there.
Hey, Ji Hoon.
If you're in Chung Dam Dong, just wait there.
I'll pick you up on the way.
- There's a coffee shop next to Dosan Park.
- I know that place.
- Come to the cafe.
- See you.
You're doing good with him?
- Is he coming here to pick you up?
- Yeah.
Ah, your underwear is in my office.
The one you left at my house.
I washed them out.
You're so clumsy.
Where's that nosy guy?
I wanted to see him.
- Don't even think about it.
- Miss Woo.
- Did you check the stage?
- Of course, I did.
- Hello.
- Yeah, you're her friend?
I saw you in the magazine.
The topic about this movie is...
- Do you want me to carry that?
- No, it's okay.
Are you really going to be okay?
I don't know.
I gotta go now.
I'm busy.
Am I really fine?
Am I really okay?
At that moment, the adolescent girl inside me came out.
I wanted to make sure of how I feel about him again.
- Did you not leave yet?
- Please give me a ticket for the movie.
It's a VIP preview.
How can I get that all of a sudden?
There must be some people who can't make it because something came up.
What's the theater number that Seok Hyun and Na Hyun entered?
A woman has eyes in the back of her head.
No.
A woman can see not just with her eyes, but with her mind.
It didn't matter if what I see now is my imagination or reality.
I was fine.
That image didn't hurt me.
I was glad that my feelings for him are gone.
But I felt so lonesome in a way.
The love that eats my heart out has changed.
The love that would burn me forever has been cooled down.
Give me a hug.
The fact that our love has been changed to this point, hurts me so badly.
You have me.
I'm not going to let you be alone.
If time goes by, would I forget the pain that I'm feeling now?
Is this really what love is?
I can't believe that what I believe, what I hope for and what I love are this weak.
I got very depressed as if no one could even stop me.
[Dosan Park]
The cafe is next to Dosan Park.
I'll meet you there.
I totally forgot about Shin Ji Hoon.
I know he's still waiting there for me.
Take your time.
It's okay even if you come late.
I'll just wait reading a book.
You didn't get in an accident, right?
I can't meet you.
Sorry for telling you this so late.
At that moment, it felt like a sharp blade just cut my heart.
What's wrong?
Did something happen?
I'm late.
You should ask me why I'm late first.
You're stupid.
You're stupid, aren't you?
I turned off my phone and was 2 hours late.
And you're still waiting for me?
You came.
That's all that matters.
People are staring at us.
Who cares?
It's okay.
I don't care.
Close your eyes.
When you do, there is only you and me in this world.
I closed my eyes just like he told me to.
It really was like there was only he and I in the world.
With my eyes closed I thought, he could be the one who will stay with me forever.
That he would never leave me.
As long as it's Shin Ji Hoon...
You never imagined that it could be that big, did you?
Yeah.
It's really big.
- It's pretty.
- It's pretty.
What's fate?
A person I meet even if I go all the way around the world.
Like the movie, "Almost a Love Story".
So to find out if this is fate or not, you should go until the end.
What do you mean?
You meet him coincidentally.
And you meet him coincidentally over and over.
If you name that coincidence fate, then you will eventually accept that as your fate.
It's Almost a Love Story.
Yeah, it is.
It's my favorite song.
The love between Shin Ji Hoon and I has just started now.
I'm glad that I didn't miss this moment and this feeling.
But sometimes, our fate laughs grimly at us.
Are you not drinking?
I said I'm not because I have to tell you something very important.
Seok Hyun, where would my heart belong?
Your heart is yours.
If it's mine, does it make sense that it's very hard for me to control?
If it's mine, I should be able to control it.
Don't you think so?
- Why are you questioning that?
- I have a crush on someone.
So?
I just know that if I tell him I like him, he would reject it.
So?
Then I should give up on him, but I can't do that.
My heart doesn't do what I want it to.
I guess your heart is stolen by that man.
Wait.
Let me write down what we just said.
What did you just say?
I...
I think my heart is stolen by you.
I like you, Seok Hyun.
Wait.
So?
You said you knew he would reject you.
You're right about that.
It makes working together awkward.
I didn't hear anything.
Give up on him as soon as possible.
- Drink it.
- No, I'm not going to.
I don't want to think about anything but my work.
Just like you said, my script was just for business.
I want to write a good script with you.
Besides, I have crush on this woman.
- Who is she?
- Why would I tell you that?
Is she Yeol Mae?
You two are so strange.
I don't know what the problem is.
I think she still has feelings for you too.
I saw Yeol Mae coming to the theater.
What's the problem?
I rejected her and we are getting used to this situation.
You like her but you rejected her?
That's my way.
To leave first.
Not to be left alone.
To be alone first.
- You don't know what I'm saying, right?
- Why are you doing that?
No matter what the reason is, I don't understand.
I don't want you to understand me.
You like her but why are you fooling her?
I didn't try to fool her.
Lying about something and not telling the truth aren't different.
The reason I don't say what's on my mind is I don't want her to get hurt.
You're too young to know this.
Good night.
I really don't want to let you go.
Yeah.
I don't want you to leave.
Drive safely.
You don't want me to go, right?
Can you pretend to be cool?
Don't you know how to play hard to get?
Why would I do that?
I'd rather be good to you instead of doing that.
Then I guess I should kiss you and leave right away.
Didn't you say... you're going to do something...?
If I told you that, you should...
Go home now.
Have a good night and show me your face before you go to the studio.
I'll really show you my face for a long time tomorrow.
Wait.
Let's do it one more time.
Are we home?
Why didn't you wake me up?
What are you doing?
Seok Hyun, excuse me for one minute!
Just one minute.
Subtitles by DramaFever
You really didn't feel anything?
- I had a reason.
- What is it?
Did Yeol Mae kiss Ji Hoon or something?
Why my house?
If a healthy man wants to go to his girlfriend's house, what do you think he wants?
-Ji Hoon, am I an innocent girl?
-What?
Relax yourself.
And smile.
I think we're good together.
Don't you think so?
Mr. Kim, your necktie...
I just had a brilliant idea for the launching show!
Shoes that even Cinderella can't wear.
Shoes that can't be left on the street!
Shoes for the evil.
You have no shame!
Think about how much you hurt me before!
Joo Yeol Mae has entered a new world.
A world that I don't know.
Beautiful, it's really beautiful.
A very beautiful season.
A love season.
There are beautiful cuisines.
-=A man is also recyclable, right?
=-
It is night with love candles,which were given by Alex.
Love candle, use it when you're together with Motorcyle.
It will be very romantic.
We've always been very romantic even without using these.
Thank you!
This is really romantic night.
I'm late, but you must forgive me because of this.
Chateau de la Perriere.
(Well-known French red wine).
Moreover, another bottle.
How much is that?
Don't ask about the price, you will faint after hearing it.
Hyeon Ju?
She spent the entire hour to find beauty in garnishing.
Put in this dish, then put in that dish.
I guess the food are stick on with her ashes too.
You're here already.
Juicy baked Holland silver carp and cheese sauce 10 more minutes.
What a pity, if there is a man then it's perfect.
It is even better without a man, am I right?
Of course, everyone is prepared for pajamas (party)?
To celebrate Seon U In yeong's freedom!
I wish all the best for Seonwu In yeong for your freedom!
All men wait for me,ok!
I'll passionately embrace you all, cheers.
This scene shows the end of my useless 10 years of love with that man and a pajamas party to seal it.
It feels so good to drink wine.
Kim Seong Su, he's not into this kind of thing.
There're more than a few benefits.
My bed, before I didn't know
That my bed is so big and comfortable
Not only that, when I'd already lying
I'd hear that Kim Seong Su has just arrived then he needed to wash then brushing his teeth.
Just a nightwear...
It has to be sexy.
I knew it...
Do you know what's the best part?
I used to read five books in a month
But now I've read five books already this week.
When I meet with Kim Seong Su later, he is going to see an improved me.
I will become the full general manager of a hotel.
Hey, but is that a spot under your eye?
What, I've got a spot?
Really?
No, there isn't.
You've to manage yourself well.
Or else you'll be sorry.
You'll never know when you're going to bump into Kim Seong Su.
It's true - when you break up with a man, what is the most embarrassing?
He was still so handsome, but I hopelessly continued to turn old.
That's right.
Remember Park Jung En during my college entrance exam?
After we broke up, when I went for the exam,
I even put on mascara.
But since you've already broken up, why are considering so much?
Hey silly, it's because he isn't mine, that's why I have to consider more.
If he was mine, why would I bother?
No matter what, it's mine already.
Aren't you angry?
I feel so angry when I look at the news reports.
Interaction about those two, with Yung Kang Hui.
It wasn't for them to find happiness together.
That wasn't why I broke up with him.
I wanted him to experience some hardship after we break up
That's why I left him.
To let him really feel how great a woman I am.
Made him distraught, that#39;s why be with him breaking up?
Don#39;t tell me is passed around the network have gold contacts director woman.
What is this all about?
She is a friend that I knew from primary school, we still keep in touch until now.
As far as I'm concerned, she is like a friend of my siblings.
Let me explain,
Seonwu In Yeong, thank you for blessings us.
For everyone's benefit, let's take a closer picture of you two, ok?
Don't tell me up to this level, right!
I was originally a fan of Yun Kang Hui but these two people are too much.
So I just cleanly quit, congratulations to both of you.
I saw both of them at the GVC theater.
Wow, this is the first time I see a perfectly match couple, the strongest couples.
Really, this is such a wonderful online world!
.
Recently the weather is good, scold people have to travel, is it?
Well ok, if like this then I'll write something for you.
Isn't the age difference between the two too large.
Kim Seong Su, you this bastard..
Have a conscience!
Yun Kang Hui had breast augmentation surgery.
As a first completely cliff.
Such a noisy couple!
I don't think they'll last long, the most is 3 months, or else I'll jump.
Looks like you've got alot of pressure on you.
If you can't give a blessing to those couples who are in love, then you just forget about them.
Go and grab a mirror, it?
s time for self-reflection, ok?
When I was in my 20s, I also had never imagined
I will become this 30 years old person.
All of you are kidding me, right?
What exactly happened?
General Manager, I'm sorry.
What I'm sorry, trainee manager?
Do you still intend to work here?
I call you on the phone yesterday and stressed about this matter.
I didn't get the final confirmation.
If I've never come, then what are you going to do?
That president will be arriving in ten minutes.
Do you want to see me write the resignation letter?
I will replace everything.
Now like this, we might as well try to replace.
Where is the phone?
Hello, what?
.
I understand.
I'm hanging up.
15 minutes later, 15 minutes, ok.
Trainee Manager, I've three children.
Two of them don't even go to collage yet.
Later, wait and see, you're dead.
Sunbae, what do I...
That room is for the president of Hyoyeom Eletrical.
Change all the electrical appliances to Hyoyeom brand.
TV, refrigerator, microwave oven, induction cooker, hair dryer, and also cell phone .
We only have Hwangkim electrical appliances, what should we do?
What should we do, what are we going to do?
Yesterday, I saw in Alex's room...
That, I'll do it.
Even the stereo system must change too, I'll tell housekeeping's Manager Park.
Once I find the food warmer, I'll immediately go over there.
15 minutes left, 15 minutes.
Alex, Alex, Alex.
Something happen?
Hold on, Hold on!
In Yeong, what's wrong?
What's the matter, what's wrong?
Alex, you're a hotel guest, right.
I'm a staff member here, right.
Mmm...
But before that, we are friends, right?
We're friends.
I need to use that to eat ramen, what are you doing?
Alex, I want to take this away for a while.
Hey, that's mine, not the hotel's.
Yes, I am Bae Seung Hyeon.
All have been prepared.
I understand.
He is in the elevator right now.
All of you, quickly retreat, retreat, quickly.
Kim Seong Su!
After breaking up with me, he comes to the hotel with Yun Kang Hui!
.
Furthermore, it's the hotel where I work!
Both of you're going to die today.
Hey, don't you have a conscience?
He is not Kim Seong Su, and also she is not Yun Kang Hui.
What are you doing?
I'm very sorry, guests.
I wish you all a pleasant time, I'm sorry.
I'm going crazy.
-=Three days ago=-
Kim Seong Su.
-=Two days ago=-
That is Kim Seong Su.
-=This morning=-
That is Kim Seong Su.
Haven't I told you before this is very important.
Furthermore, we also need to provide five stars service.
During that president stay, all appliances must change to his company's brand.
Didn't I tell you before to discuss with the housekeeping's manager to buy those appliances!
What exactly were you thinking?
Sunbae, you can't talk to me like that!
Why can't I talk like that?
Seung Hyeon, do you still want to work here?
Yesterday, I clearly say over here...
Did you have a sleepless night recently, even your eyes look bad.
Did something happen with Mr. Motorcycle?
This is melamine, a type of nutrient.
Take two.
It can help to get back your body rhythm.
Take it.
I'm going out for a while.
Driver ahjushi, your lips really look like Kim Seong Su's lips.
Even that hands look exactly like Kim Seong Su's hands.
I might as well just watch the ground, ok?
That is Kim Seong Su's shoes.
Yes, I better close my eyes, ok?
Then I can't see anything anymore.
Seong Su, long time have not seen, has something happened?
You sold the car.
Sorry!
Sorry!
I really want crash into the wall and die to end it all.
Wait for a minute, death of whom?
Why do I have to die?
Those two are doing so well.
Why do I have to go and die?
I've also got to live well to show them.
Yes.
Here is the hair treatment place endorsed by Yun Kang Hui, isn't it?
Please go this way.
I'm going bald, bald.
Only here, it doesn't have hair.
Sort of bald spot.
Have you all heard about it?
Bald spot.
I'll become like that, like that...
Because there was too much pressure.
Only then this bald spot problem happening to me.
I have to always apply this and eat this medicine.
But, then bangs is still there, how lucky for you.
Recently, there a lot of attractive wigs, In Yeong.
Hey, Can I see compensation for this?
.
Because of him, I'm having this hair loss problem.
Compensation for the cost of buying these things and also for mental damages.
Can I do that?
What is this has to do with Seong Su?
For lots of wrongdoings.
There is no after sales service?
Yes, I've endured a lot.
Even if he is in love with other person after breaking up with me,
But do he has to make a lot of noise about it?
The guy with no loyalty to others.
The guy with no courtesy to others.
No consideration to others at all.
Bad guy!
Love will change.
Even In Yeong is caught on fire.
Seeing from your current situation.
Hey, do not nag it's so ugly, pick up yourself.
What, I'm ugly?
Oh yes, you're getting married, whereas I broke up with my man.
You this woman, omo!
You can't keep cool?
If I really become bald, you all will never see me again.
Is dead and so I can don#39;t want to regret their bad ?
head.
That is the man who broke up with Seo Yeon 3 months ago.
Hey, did you see?
What's going on?
She seems about to give birth soon, but he claimed it was siblings love.
That means when he broke up with you, that woman is already pregnant.
Having a foot in both camps?
Otherwise, from the start, he is a married man.
Did you know about it before?
Give me red wine.
One glass, please.
Park Seo Yeon began to date at 14 years old.
Until now, she has never been infatuated with a man.
Although there were numerous men before, normally Seo Yeon will wipe them off blindly.
But she actually thought about getting married to that man.
What was the reason he gave for breaking up with you?
He must go to Mongolia and find the Dalai Lama.
Not living life physically but rather to live life on the soul.
wasn't it?
wasn't it?
Three months ago, she broke up with that man.
But now, he is with a woman who is nine months of pregnancy.
We can tell right away, that woman who is sitting together is his wife.
I want to be clear with all of you.
I did not think of marriage with that man, ok?
Of course I know that.
Just like this, we're once again confirmed that we are the best of friends.
But human beings again pain in front of do not have any way.
Why must it be a bald spot?
It's already 2 a.m, another sleepless night for me.
Kim Seong Su gave me that clock.
Kim Seong Su bought this doll for me.
Kim Seong Su bought that guitar.
His shaver, toothbrush, and his clothes.
The doll he bought for me.
His skin lotions.
Currently I can't be with you.
But you'll never know, the world is very wide.
I'm still young and there are a plenty of man out there.
I can't lose hope.
You just wait and see, we'll definitely meet again.
That's right, throw everything out, and start all over again!
Seonwu In Yeong, fighting!
.
To tell you the truth, I was very angry with you so I didn't want to come.
But I couldn't sleep.
I hasn't been sleeping at all.
How could you easily say wanted to break up?
You didn't regret it at all?
Can you let me sleep for a night.
If you were by my side,
I feel like I'm able to sleep.
Didn;t you want to break up with me?
You jerk!
Didn't you say, the only things left were the feeling of responsibility and obligation to me?
You this bad guy!
Didn't you say you want to be with Yun Kang Hui?
Whether you can or can't sleep, it has nothing to do with me!
.
That night the person who met again with an ex-boyfriend is not only me.
Seo Yeon.
What is it?
I miss you, so I come to see you.
Just now at the wine bar, didn't you see enough?
I see those flower pots are still there.
Weren't those potted flowers that we bought together at the flower market?
Therefore...
I thought you've throw those away.
Do your wife know what you're doing here?
Don't be too daring, just go.
If you're not gone in 5 seconds, I am calling the police.
Seo Yeon, I've something to say to you.
I'm relying on you, just for a moment.
Therefore...
Why do you let him in, are you crazy?
He said his wife doesn't care.
Because of the pregnancy only then they had to get marry.
You need to clear you head, he is a man with a woman already.
He is a married man!
He said he can't forget me.
Are yo a bird brain?
How can you believe what he says.
Don't you know at the time like this, I'm really irrational, do you?
That's why I call you on the phone?
Tell me, I'll follow according to what you say.
That, at the moment like this, I'm only emotionally driven.
Let me borrow your rational mind, ok?
What should I do?
Go to the room, then tell him to go out immediately.
Get out now!
Did you hear me?
I told you to get out.
I said it already.
He is out?
Not yet, he is only staring at me.
His clothes, throw all his clothes outside!
What happened?
What happened?
Get out, get out!
Seo Yeon, Seo Yeon, what's wrong?
It's over, thank you.
Seo Yeon thought that all the matters have ended.
But not for Hyeon Ju's case.
Because she has started to feel distress.
Why I do not have that hot that time?
Later she came out with a decision.
Change, I need to make changes.
I can't just trust a man and waiting for him.
I'll personally create the moment.
If the man doesn't come, then just attract him to come over.
Darling, it's me, what are you doing?
You haven't left the office yet?
That's great.
Do you want to come over to my place?
It's nothing, I'm thinking about redecorating my place a little bit.
Because it's too heavy, I can't move it by myself.
I'm so tired!
My dear can you help me just a little, okay.
What?
You must stay up all night?
.
Morning then?
Can you come in the morning?
Yes, if you stay up all night, you'll be too tired in the morning.
Then how about the afternoon?
Is the afternoon ok?
Really?
Ok, I understand
It can't be help then.
Keep up the good work.
Just a second, wait for a moment.
Why aren't you all not answering the phone?
I twisted my waist and now I can't move, quickly come over, ok.
I am currently busy.
I'm recently very busy.
The house is in a mess because I worked overtime.
For 10 years, Kim Seong Su has always helped to cut my toenails.
Even though, there is no heart and we're no longer tense.
Both of us have this comfortable feeling as before.
Is this not another name for love?
Like this one would like to feel that all matter is very easy.
Hyeon Ju also got what she wished for, a moment of hotness.
Doctor, it's really very hot.
Just endure it for a moment, ok?
And... doctor!
.
Yes, is this a moving company?
I would like to hire a few workers.
But that day a few years then can have this once full members.
I would like to move a few things.
This is a moving company right, yes or no?
.
Send me a few workers, ok?
Just a few workers.
There's not even one person available?
Is there no worker available at all?
I know, I know, today is fully staffed.
I also know, there is no worker.
Hyeon Ju called more than 50 moving companies.
But could not find even one worker.
Require one-time-off man?
Contact us immediately.
Good!
Again, move closer.
Good, really beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, great!
.
See here, good, good.
One-time-off Man?
Just for single women, they're willing to do any little things.
What it means by 'little things'?
At a certain time when we need a man to do things.
Let say like changing a light bulb, curtains, installation of TV with a stereo.
But he and also must let him come over plaster regulars Grandma.
There do not have must tickle Grandma.
But, he looked so handsome.
Hello, I'm from this One-time-off Men Club, Kim Deok Su.
I heard you need some items moved.
You need to organize here and then inside the room a little bit.
That is put here.
This is here and the books on the second rack.
Do you want me to get you a cup of coffee?
Well, I am delighted to drink your coffee.
Excuse me, the coffee...
What do I do?
What do I do?
Where are you touching?
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Can there be nothing wrong?
What shall we do?
Do you want me get you some ice?
Or burn plaster wipes.
Plaster, plaster, plaster will do.
Not good?
Ah, Kang Hyeon Ju, you're killing one good man.
Now I'm wishing that hot man is Kim Tae U.
Seo Yeon is coming.
The shooting went well?
After finishing here, let's go back together, ok.
I must go back to the office to settle something.
I'm going to take a bath.
So hateful!
.
Must come here that time just have to know.
She is always like that.
Right, Jun Hui, aren't you tired working with her?
Of course I'm tired, she is arrogant, eccentric, and impulsive.
No advantageous at all?
No plus points at all, I hate that sort of type.
Selfish and opinionated woman.
I'm leaving first.
What a temper!
Wasn't at that time even with a cold, Seo Yeon still had to take picture in a water?
Yes, hey, we want or do not want again to play in a moment.
Rui Yan Don#39;t want to say she would give me just now wearing a swimsuit.
Best friends, I intend to volunteer for environmental groups.
I'm giving you this to have a look.
You too.
From now on, don't use plastic bags when grocery shopping.
Use this bag, this eco-bag is very beautiful, right?
This is a mug, this is a water bottle.
So pretty.
Do you know how much it'll cost to process disposable cup?
In the future, all of you have to start using recycled products.
The best thing is not to buy new things but to recycle.
I recently has been recycling a good thing.
-Really, what is that thing?
-A man.
Are you crazy?
You both broke up already, why did you do that?
Just a moment ago, didn't you ask us to support recycling?
Hey, it depends on what to recycle too.
Not only a man, but also a man whose heart belongs to another woman.
In Jeong, back then when you're with Kim Seong Su didn't I say it already?
My opinion was it's better for you to split up.
Why must you be with him again?
No, I think it doesn't matter.
No matter what, there are lots of benefits for using recycled things.
We're able to protect the earth.
But recycling your former lover, what are the benefits?
Instinctively, there is no distinction between good and bad, when it's good then it's good.
And also, the resources are quite limited.
There are not many men in this world that up to my taste.
Give up the one half, let the one half.
Reproduce the exchanges i feel that not bad.
What's wrong, this isn't like you at all!
?
You, a few days ago, didn't you end the affair?
But he has another woman.
No matter what, recycling is very good.
Oh well, we can go to the shopping mall now.
Waste to process, emissions to process.
Once you broke up, you can't recycle that man but process him in the waste gas treatment.
Understand, give me a good dry-don#39;t want to listen to the other issue.
What Kang Hyeon Ju said is not necessarily true!
.
Good response and will do, this is worthy of happy matter, as soo.
Problem is the whole works is a romantic comedy to come.
I like romantic comedy very much, you didn't like it at all?
How can there be a romantic love in this world?
Everybody have wanted must like that, I also like very much!
Let me go wash my hands.
It smells a little bit like melon.
Did he go to see Yun Kang Hui?
Today at 10 am a bit thirty-six points.
Yun Kang Hui called him.
The call duration was 42 seconds.
Director, where are you right now?
I'm near the office.
Do you want to eat lunch together?
Forget it, why would I want to see you?
I'm very busy now, hang up.
No, last night we're not together.
What to do, even though I saw you last night , now I am missing you?
Me too.
Oh right, do you want to have lunch together?
I'm at the front of the office, come out, ok?
This rice soup is really delicious, your skills are becoming better and better.
All this is because of you since you don't like to eat outside, do you?
I like it at home, eating together with you.
The Kimchi is delicious, try it.
This tenderloin is also very delicious, try it.
Really delicious, I also point tenderloin just okay.
Today#39;s bad to eat the thigh meat.
Want or do not want for eating, no need to, this also very delicious.
Thank you director; director you've always been very attentive.
Yes, to my relative cut man.
Will also to cut another woman relative.
Waste to process, breaking up over this once man cannot be recycled make use of.
But must lose then can, understand.
What's wrong, is the kimchi bad?
What?
No, no, it's delicious!
After we finish eating, let's go out.
I want to show you something.
What is it?
Is this really your car?
Your Company gave you such a good car.
It seems like you're really getting famous.
Could it be you thought that I'll be a bump and rely on you forever?

I just know you will succeed eventually.
Wow, the car is really wide.

You don't have to wash the dishes, I'll do it.
Okay!
My cell phone.
If put in the car, see just now you get is hands.
No need, no need, I'll go.
And see my memory, because cars are too excited.
Yun Kang Hui's hairpin?
He let Yun kang Hui into the car first.
Furthermore, is this car in the car to do what the line for, but also off the card?
I shouldn't have renew this relationship with Kim Seong Su.
I understand that man not to make use of recycled varieties.
But Hyeon Ju is not the same.
How do you do?
Congratulations to you.
So pretty.
Congratulations.
You're here.
How do you do?
Thank you!

Seems like he won't come.

Always very absurd, it are absurd.

Oh, thank you.
Congratulations!
We've got to make a move first.
The groom is not here yet?
He's on the way.

Yes?
Hello, do you remember me?
This is the pants rubbed coffee's woman.

Alright then, I'd like to ask to become my husband for today, ok?
Are you insane?
You're still normal, right?
Wait for a moment.
I hate complication, the problem is very simple.
I am there for the formal beauty of woman.
Wedding ceremony without a groom is outrageous, isn't it?

In Yeong, get her to see doctor.
See her say dream as if disease is not light.
Why cannot, already married?
Just have to go to honeymoon!

[Episode 1] [The Woman who Resembled Shing-Shing.]
The day that I was born... was the first snowfall of the year.
The seven year old Shing-Shing walked through the pristine white snow untainted by others footprints and made her way through the snow to meet me.
I heard everything from Shing-Shing.
I was told that I resembled a sweet potato when I was first born.
I don't believe what I'm told.
He's going to have one tough life being so ugly like that.
I grew up in Shing-Shing's home.
I'm told that I looked like a roasted sweet potato when I turned a year old.
Which means that I got even uglier.
That's why Shing-Shing... was said to have covered up my face at every chance she had.
Whenever I hear the old Korean saying that a habit at a year old will become a habit at 80 years old...
I feel like they're talking about me.
This is my first time back in Korea in 17 years.
The Shing-Shing that I remember is smart... innocent... and kind.
I wonder what Shing-Shing is like now?
My goodness.
In the alley?
- For an entire hour?
- Stop laughing!
- That's not even that funny.
- Tell us the truth.
- You really just kissed, and that's it?
- Whatever.
At first, I was going to say goodbye after just a quick kiss.
But he just kept going, and things got steamier.
I was going to stop after a while myself.
But I couldn't help myself...
and we moved over to the next alley.
Your boyfriend really is earnest about everything he does.
He'll easily pass his civil exam with that kind of dedication.
I was worried about what he was doing when he had his big exam the next morning.
But what else could we do?
My body was starting to burn, and I couldn't stop myself either.
Why didn't you guys just go to a motel instead?
That's what I'm saying.
We don't have the money for that.
If we went to a motel every time we wanted to go then we'd be spending half our salaries on paying for the motels.
We promised each other that we'd only go once a month to a motel.
It's just safer to plan it that way.
My goodness.
We just kept doing that for an entire hour.
Let's use our team dinner outing money and fund their motel room.
I agree with that idea.
Consider it an employee welfare case.
I'll make sure not to let those funds go to waste.
- But we're going to need a full report.
- And make sure to turn in your receipts.
What are you all talking and smiling about?
What is it that you're going to do with team dinner outing money?
- We want to donate it to the needy.
- We want to donate it to the needy.
That sounds good.
I'm in complete agreement with that idea.
Hi mom.
Sweet potato?
He's back in Korea?
How old is he now?
What's he back here for?
Music?
Ugh...
I bet he grew up to be a total delinquent.
What took you so long to get here?
You made me wait at the airport for the last 40 minutes.
You'll be staying at a hotel in the city.
We're looking into some rental houses, so it'll just be for the time being.
Give me the car keys.
What do you want the keys for?
Don't call me if you can help it.
I won't answer even if you do call.
You can just text me my schedule, and don't be on my case if I don't respond right away.
If you annoy me with incessant phone calls, I'm going to change my number.
Just leave me be unless you really need me for something.
- I work better that way.
- But, Allen...
- You have the photo shoot this afternoon...
- I'll get myself there myself.
- Did you get all the materials that we need?
- That's what I'm doing right now.
My mom said that she imposed on them during her most recent trip to America so she wants me to let their son stay at my house while he's here.
And for a whole year at that.
That must complicate things.
With Lee Jung Ho.
That's right!
I had forgotten about that.
Okay, send me Sweet Potato's number.
I'll go meet up with him.
I told you that I'll take care of it.
Okay.
I don't know why I didn't think of that myself.
Okay.
This can't be Han River, can it?
I wonder if that's only said up in the mountains.
Anyways.
It's good to see you, Republic of Korea!
I promised Shing-Shing that I'd come back.
And I did come back.
To Shing-Shing's world.
[Call me.]
[It's me, Shing-Shing.]
Where are you?
Why are you talking in casual speech with me right off the bat?
I've spoken to you in casual speech since the day you were born.
But aren't we still only strangers to one another at this point?
Do you remember what I look like?
No, I don't remember.
Except for the fact that you were ugly.
Well, I'm sure you must've grown quite a bit.
So tell me where you are right now.
I'm playing with the seagulls right now.
Where do you think I'm at?
Do you remember?
On that snowy day... when we went to see the giraffes?
What the heck?
You.
I'm busy right now, so I'm going to get straight to the point.
I still haven't decided whether I'm going to let you live with me or not.
My mom is the one who said that my house is your house.
But I don't like that idea.
Why don't you like that idea?
I'm dating someone.
He sleeps over at my place from time to time.
You think that he and I just hold hands, and do nothing else when we go to bed?
What does it matter if there are two bedrooms?
Must I endure having a little boy like you listening to me pant and scream at night?
I tend to be a bit on the loud side.
I'm much worse than this in real life.
I doubt that you want to hear me scream and pant like that every single night, do you?
I think it would make me extremely uncomfortable to have you living in my house.
I'm sure that my boyfriend would hate that too.
So what I'm saying is take the hint and have enough courtesy not to come stay with me at my house.
I really hate, loathe, and scathe at the idea of you coming to live with me at my house.
Why... do you not like me?
First.
I don't like you because you're ugly.
Second.
Your rich parents used to pay my mom to take care of you back in the day as a job.
The money she made from watching you is how we were able to get by.
Seeing you reminds me of those days.
I really hate the thought of that.
I hate it so much that it gives me the creeps.
- The creeps?
- You get how much I hate the idea, right?
I hope that we'll never have to talk to each other like this again.
Wait.
I've... missed you.
I've missed you, Shing-Shing.
Jung Hee Jae, the color of the day is mint.
Tell them this is wrong.
Take a look at this.
This is all wrong.
You need to get this corrected.
Got it?
- Get in touch with all our business partners.
- Okay.
Everyone on camera, the color of the day is mint.
Make sure you get a good shot of the products.
Five minutes until we're on air.
Everyone be ready.
Let's go!
Why aren't the call numbers going up?
It'll get there.
Just wait.
There it goes!
Over 700 calls already!
Awesome.
Over 700 calls already.
Over 700 callers.
This is awesome!
We're all sold out of the grey and the mocha color.
Every size in every color is now sold out.
Shin Joo Yeon is going to have another sold-out show.
Amazing.
- Want to go out for a beer to celebrate?
- I like that idea.
Next broadcast show isn't ready yet, so we have to keep going for another 10 minutes.
Wipe that smile off your face.
And pull the corners of your mouth back down.
Okay, team meeting.
We have to start strategizing for the next season.
You think it's going to give us any advantage to let everyone know how happy we are?
- But still...
- We're going to have to work even harder now.
Compile a report of the customers' responses, and see what it is they're wanting next.
Main objective is not have them raise a single penny on us, right?
Of course.
Of course, she says.
I'll be right back.
Tae Yoon!
Yes!
You saw the broadcast, didn't you?
Can you believe it?
It's another huge hit!
That's five in a row now!
I can't believe how gifted I am!
Every item of every color and size is all sold-out!
Must you come to my office to brag and gloat like that?
Where else would I go to brag?
Everyone else is dying of jealousy right now.
Then do you think that I'm genuinely happy for you?
Who was it that trained and taught me to be where I am today?
You must be so proud, Tae Yoon.
To have taught such a successful junior like myself.
Yes, congratulations, Shin Joo Yeon on your fifth amazing season in a row.
You'd better be careful of your position.
I'm going to make my way up to your position soon, Tae Yoon.
I like that challenge.
There you go acting like a brat again.
Why don't you just go out to the steps?
I saw Lee Jung Ho head out there earlier as soon as the broadcast ended.
That's right.
How do I look right now?
- Not pretty in the least.
- I know that I'm pretty.
Honey!
We're such a perfect team!
I'm so happy right now!
Why aren't you kissing me?
I'd really love it if you'd kiss me right now.
Your kisses... really are the best.
- Let's go out to dinner.
- Hm?
There's something I have to tell you.
What is it?
I saw PD Lee at a jewelry store in Cheongdamdong yesterday.
Really?
I was running an errand for my mom because she asked me to go pick up something for her and that's when I saw PD Lee.
It was a necklace called, 'Two-Ring'.
Two-Ring necklace?
Maybe he's planning on proposing.
Marriages don't end in happy endings.
It's a one way ticket to hell.
Why don't you give it a try first?
It's not because I can't, but it's because I won't.
Oh my goodness.
Look at how much this thing costs.
This is the one, right?
- Let me see.
- Oh my goodness.
This is so crazy!
How can he know my taste so perfectly?
- It's 262,000 won.
- Oh my God.
I know he got a bonus recently and I guess he's about to spend it all on you.
You're so lucky!
Are you sure that he bought it?
He wasn't just window shopping, right?
I saw him buying it.
But I didn't acknowledge him because he was so focused on buying that necklace.
But why is he proposing with a necklace?
Shouldn't it be with a ring instead?
He already got me a ring when we went to Bali this summer.
This ring is made by the same designer as the necklace.
- This is so amazing.
- That's really pretty.
This really fits you perfectly.
It's almost as if these clothes were tailor made just for you.
- What does it mean if you're creeped out?
- That they really hate it.
- Why?
- Someone told me that I creep them out.
What?
There's someone out there who would dare talk to the divine Allen Joo like that?
- Who's that?
- Just someone from my past.
- Someone I used to like.
- Your first love?
The one who taught me about music...
was Shing-Shing.
Don't you have anything...
that you want to say to me?
Didn't you say that you had something to tell me?
Out on the steps earlier.
- Joo Yeon.
- Yeah?
Let's break up.
How does that song make you feel?
I feel like I can see a group of yellow chicks running around in the sunshine.
A feeling like this, right?
Yeah, all the chicks are running around happily together.
They're all running around and playing with one another.
That's called, joy.
- Ah... joy?
- Next is, happiness.
How do you feel this time?
The wind is blowing.
The wind feels warm blowing against my skin.
I'm all sweaty, but I'm still happy because I like the wind blowing against my skin.
The wind makes me feel short of breath, so I have to breathe through my mouth.
I can feel the wind in my mouth.
That's right.
That's what happiness is.
Then what does pain feel like?
Pain feels like...
I'm not sure.
Do you remember falling off your bike the other day and hurting your knee?
Yeah, and I got hurt here too.
That's right.
It hurt when you fell, didn't it?
That's what pain feels like.
That's when you're in physical pain.
There are times when your heart hurts like that too.
It's very different than being in physical pain... but I'm not quite sure how I can explain the difference.
I'm sure you'll find out yourself one day.
Where's the heart?
Then what about sadness?
Excuse me.
I'll have the ice cream for my dessert.
Two ice creams, please.
I just told you that I wanted to break up.
Yeah, I heard you.
Let's break up after we have the ice cream.
Aren't you going to ask me why?
Do I really have to know the reason?
Knowing your personality, I'm sure you've given it plenty of thought.
Whether it's just one single reason, or a hundred different reasons...
I have no desire to hang on to a man who says he wants to break up with me.
If I tried to hold on to you... would you stay?
Do you think that people hold on thinking that the other person will stay?
Even while being fully aware that the other person isn't going to stay people still hold on, and cling onto the other person.
Whether they stay or not, it's how the person feels that's important...
It's not important to me.
Hearts and feelings aren't important to me.
Sadness...
Sadness... is like when two people break up.
Your heart is in pain... and the pain deepens even greater then.
Something starts to pool in your heart... and that's what sadness is.
Why do people break up?
Can't they just meet again?
Break-ups can happen because two people no longer like each other... and there are a lot of other people who can't be together even though they miss each other.
So Shing-Shing is... the woman who molded me into who I am today.
The woman... who taught me how to play the piano.
The woman who taught me about feelings.
There's no reason to be sad, nor be in pain.
Relationships coming to an end is a natural occurrence.
But... this isn't how I always used to be.
How could you do this to me?
How could you?
Neither you nor Se Ryung are my type.
What I really love... is music.
Rock.
When my first relationship ended...
I thought that the sky was going to come crumbling down on me.
It was the same way with my second breakup.
I can wait.
Are you sure about this?
I can't keep you chained up just because I love you.
- You're too pretty for that.
- No, I'm not.
I just want to wait for you.
I have to go serve in the army once I get back from studying abroad.
It's okay.
I'm really okay with it.
You'd better get inside.
You should meet a nice man, date...
and get married too.
I don't want to have you see me walking away.
Go on in.
Go on in.
No, I'm not going to date or get married!
I'm just...
I'm just going to wait for you!
Because I'm never going to meet anyone else as wonderful as you.
Because there's no way that anyone else in this world could be as wonderful as you.
It's okay for me to wait for you, right?
You don't have to feel burdened!
I'm going to wait for you because I want to!
Listen to what I have to say before you go!
Wait!
Wait!
- Can you give me some broth too?
- Sure.
The back that he didn't want me to see...
I got to see it.
While I was floundering in my sea of sadness and despair... he was... busy filling up on steamed fishcakes.
I found out the truth a month later.
That what he said about studying abroad...
was a bald faced lie.
And with that breakup...
I realized the true nature of relationships.
That love... and break-ups... are nothing but a play of emotions.
I guess the price of gold really has gone up.
I just sold three of my old couple rings.
Even though men may leave, the gold still remains.
And the value of gold even went up.
Thanks guys.
I'll put this money to good use.
Oh Se Ryung.
I used to think that we were friends.
I was afraid that if I gave up on love like this...
I would end up becoming like her.
I didn't want to become like Oh Se Ryung.
Joo Yeon.
Joo Yeon!
Joo Yeon!
What's wrong this time?
What have I done wrong now?
Is the motel the only place you ever want to take me to?
We're going to get pizza anyways so wouldn't it be nice to get it delivered and eat in the comfort of the room?
- Let's break up.
- Why are you being like this again?
- Things are great between us.
- What about us is so great?
I'm really turned on right now.
Let's just get inside.
Sleeping with me is the only thing you can think of when you're with me, isn't it?
Are you acting like this because there are so many people around?
Why don't we go inside and talk about this?
Did you just hear what I said?
I said, I wanted us to break up!
I said, I don't want to!
Okay, fine.
We can break up.
But... since we're here anyways, let's just do it one more time, okay?
Let's sleep together just one more time.
At that moment...
I was reminded of Oh Se Ryung, who I saw selling her rings a few years ago.
Let's sleep together just one more time.
I'll be good.
- How are you going to be good?
- I'll do everything.
Fine.
Since this is our last night together...
give it your best shot.
So that I can remember you for the rest of my life.
After my fifth relationship ended...
I no longer ever let myself get too involved no matter what the relationship... and I no longer cried no matter what the breakup.
Excuse me, Ma'am.
- Your guest didn't pay when he left.
- Excuse me?
Wait!
You really are so strange!
Why did you stop me instead of him?
You saw what happened, didn't you?
Who do you think should pay for this dinner?
I'm sorry.
Every relationship ends by leaving you with a new realization.
I should've walked away first.
This place is this expensive?
I couldn't understand.
There were so many questions that I wanted to ask him.
But I didn't ask him any of those questions.
There's only one reason for any break-ups.
It's because the pinnacle of a relationship... has ended.
[First snowfall of the year.
Better get home before it starts to pile up.]
[Together with Lee Jung Ho PD, who recently ended a relationship]
Did you see her new tweet?
You'll never believe what happened.
Hang on a second.
I think Team Leader Shin and PD Lee must've broken up.
Unbelievable.
Did you see it?
What the heck?
It wasn't a proposal?
What happened to the necklace?
Who dumped whom?
I heard that it was Team Leader Shin who got dumped.
Unbelievable.
My Team Leader...
just got dumped by her boyfriend.
Let's concentrate, Jung Hee Jae.
Ignore any work-related text messages when you're out of the office.
You don't know because you've never worked at an office before.
You're never fully off from work.
Leaving the office only means that you're working outside the office.
- Who told you that?
- My Team Leader.
We only come to the motel once a month.
Yes, you're right.
I sent a message, so I'm all set now.
It's been a month since we've chatted.
Since the last message I posted on the blog was this past summer it's been about six months since we've last been in touch.
You can't say that it's been recent.
I'd like to meet you offline one of these days.
Since this is the first snowfall of the year...
what do you think about meeting tonight?
I live in Dae-Chi Dong.
Where should we meet?
The Design Hotel.
It's better you don't even come if you're going to get frightened off now.
What the heck?
He's more innocent than I had thought he was.
The sky lounge bar at that hotel is pretty nice, isn't it?
Are you playing right now?
We know about each other as much as we need to know.
I don't want to bother with dating, and I hate the thought of marriage even more.
I like being alone the best, and I don't like anyone bothering me.
I also don't want to have any meaningful relationships with anyone either.
Isn't that how we both feel?
Text me the room number once you've checked in.
As for the wine, I think Chateau Margot would be best.
[Sweet Potato]
What?
It's snowing.
People are saying that it's the first snowfall of the year.
So what?
How about we meet up?
A day like this is meant to be spent with the person you love.
Don't you think?
I found out what being creeped out means.
Now that you know... don't you think that you should've stopped yourself from calling me again?
I think... that you've changed.
I've thought about it.
I asked myself why you became like this.
Even though you told me earlier today that you were in love with someone... that was a lie.
If you were in love with someone, and you were being loved by someone... then I'm sure that you would've become someone who cherished memories more.
So if you really are seeing someone right now... then it would be best for you to break up with him.
Because I'm sure...
that's not real love.
We're going to end up meeting even if you don't want to meet with me.
Because I always keep my promises.
I told you that I'd come back to you.
See you later, Shing-Shing.
I came because I had nowhere else to go.
But at this hour?
What if I had a girl over?
I know perfectly well that you have no girl.
Are you getting water?
Hey, do you know how much this bottle is?
You and your expensive taste.
I just got dumped by Lee Jung Ho.
Even after we kissed out on the steps earlier this afternoon.
He dumped me.
What do you think about that?
This is what I think about that.
Let's drink it.
Weren't we thinking of selling that too?
You said you couldn't trust that manufacturer because the quality of their products had gone down.
I said that?
They look pretty good on screen right now, so I don't know why I said that.
Thanks.
For what?
You made me forget all about it.
The fact that I just got dumped by a man.
What the heck?
They're sold-out?
Oh my goodness.
How can that stuff sell out?
I bet they're going to have a ton of returns.
Yes, I bet the buyers will realize how poor the quality is once they get their items.
Yeah, they should be ashamed of the lack of their quality.
- Team Leader Shin is coming.
- What kind of a mood is she in?
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Do you know what I brought with me?
Invitations to...
Michelle Jang's party to celebrate her 2-year anniversary of the launching of her brand!
- Amazing.
Just amazing!
- I heard the tickets were impossible to get.
Let's go make our appearance as a team, and go have some fun.
I heard it's a club party.
- Really?
- You know what the best part is?
Allen Joo is going to be the DJ!
- That's absolutely amazing!
- Who's that?
You don't know who Allen Joo is?
The genius songwriter, Allen Joo.
- Number nine on Japan's Billboard charts.
- 'Now and Forever'.
You don't know?
Thank you.
So beautiful.
Guys.
- Let's go back to dancing.
- Let's just take a quick break.
I'm exhausted, Min Jung.
I think that Allen Joo is staring at us.
That's him.
He's so handsome.
I think that he's staring at you, Joo Yeon.
Can't fault him for his good taste.
Didn't you just break up with PD Lee last night?
You need to take some time to embrace your pain right now.
When you go out to buy a new pair of shoes...
do you go to the store barefoot?
No, you go to the store wearing your old shoes.
He's coming this way.
Allen.
That woman is gorgeous.
I guess Oh Se Ryung is pretty hot.
No kidding.
She really has golden connections.
I'm sure it's more like bed connections, rather than golden connections.
What are you talking about?
She's infamous for her cup ramen moves.
What does that mean?
She used to send text messages to all the male students at her school.
'Want to meet up and have cup ramen with me?
'
Do you really think that those guys only ate cup ramen with Oh Se Ryung at her house?
You know about that too, don't you?
You two went to the same school.
Look who it is.
I guess you two really do know each other.
That's the necklace that PD Lee bought.
I almost didn't recognize you.
She's a friend of mine.
We went to the same school together all throughout high school and college.
We did go to the same school together... but we're not friends.
You may stick those lips on just anyone... but you should still keep your stories straight.
Yeah, okay.
We used to be friends.
Now we're just acquaintances who used to go to the same school.
But why do you look so stiff?
You're looking a little lifeless.
I wasn't like this earlier... but I guess I'm looking a little stiff from having run into you.
My face always freezes up like this when I see anyone who's subhuman.
What can I say?
I've always been more on the naive side.
- Guess you're not happy to see me?
- Are you saying you're happy to see me?
Why wouldn't I be happy to see you?
It's been awhile since I've seen you last.
Yeah, I bet you're happy to see me.
Since you've always been such a loose woman when it comes to people.
You know what 'loose' means, don't you?
No, I'm not sure what that means.
But I do know that you're being rude and catty right now.
It means that it's better than being stiff.
Don't pay her any attention.
There's no way that Shing-Shing would've changed this much.
She's just a woman who only resembles her.
So... are you happy to live your life in such a stiff and frozen manner?
That's what I'd like to ask you.
Whether or not you're happy to be living your life the way you do.
I guess she wants to ask you the question.
Whether or not you're happy to be with me.
What a bunch of jokers.
I wish you a ton of happiness.
I'm going to take off.
Did you do something wrong to her or something?
I'm not sure.
She really is making a mess of her life, that Shin Joo Yeon.
What... did you just say her name was?
Shin Joo Yeon.
That woman... was my Shing-Shing.
That woman... was my Shing-Shing.

[Next Episode Preview]
- Honey!
We're here!
- Why?
Who said that?
Who said I was the one that got dumped?
Do you think that he was cheating on you with her?
Forget it.
There's no use talking about this now.
There's no reason to be sad.
There's always the next relationship.
This company... is really tacky.
Raise your standards a bit, Director.
We need to talk, Team Leader Shin.
Well...
let's go talk then.
That woman from last night...
you two don't seem to like each other much?
We were in the same classroom for three years in high school and we even used to go to the bathroom together.
But I stole her first love away from her.
I was a bitch.
Was it you... again this time?
♫The word "maybe"...♫ ♫ those two letters♫ (in Korean, 2 letters)
♫ it made my mind collapse. ♫
Ah!
At this part the boy needs to say something cool, don't you think?
You don't have any thing cool?
Ah, how about this, Sunbae.
Since this is a mental disease anyway-
♫ Listening music and reading books,♫ ♫ Watching a movie and meeting people.
It's funny♫
♫ But I couldn't do those before.
I end up thinking about it a lot too.
You're not the person who makes me hurt
♫ In those countless days, it's sparkly ♫
♫ I was always grateful.♫
I said something that no one can understand, but...
At time like those, I sometimes think I'm crazy.
I told him that I liked him.
I like you, Yoon Seok Hyun.
When I think about it....
there's never been a time when I didn't like you
Everything became awkward after the confession.
Why are you doing that?
Why?
It's good.
Did you wake up or just not sleep?
Didn't slept, In the morning I have to find something in the library.
Do you want to go with me?
Shall we eat a sandwich for breakfast on the way there?
Shall we?
I acted like I didn't notice, but all of my senses were opened toward him.
He looked like that too.
He still hasn't answered yet.
But I could figure it out through feeling.
That he accepted my feelings.
And that is how our seventh time dating began.
He's a man who's never really been able to say "I like you".
I only heard the words "I love you" twice while we were dating.
The first time was when we had our first kiss and the second time was when he was drinking.
That's why you said you didn't like it and that you were uneasy.
No, that's not it.
You were the one who said that you don't figure out a man's heart through his words.
But that you figure it out through his actions.
For some men, words are more important than actions.
It's even more so for Yoon Seok Hyun, who you can't figure out even through his actions...
Ah, ow it hurts.
Hold on a minute.
You came because you felt sorry, huh?
My words were too harsh yesterday.
I thought I needed to resolve it before we go on the trip.
Don't say you're sorry to Jae Kyung.
Why?
She said she packed lunch.
I was just coming in for a moment before I went to work.
Hey, this chick only brought me a cup of coffee.
Isn't she stingy?
Hey, it looks delicious!
What about Jung Min-sshi?
He went out to have a meeting with investors.
Wait!
This is it!
Knowing that someone is sorry even though they don't say it, and knowing that everything's okay even if no one says it.
What are you talking about?
Me and Yoon Seok Hyun.
I'm saying that our love is now beyond the language.
What?
Did you decide to start dating again?
Yea.
You can't be stopped.
You're going to get even more hurt by Seok Hyun while you're acting like that.
But are you really alright?
Will you be able to go on the trip?
They said I don't really need to worry about this one.
They were a bit worried about my ribs, but it'll be alright as long as I'm careful.
Not that...
Hey!
If the heavens break down, let's see if she even blinks a eye.
I guess you haven't seen it yet, huh?
What is this?
As per the police report, Seon Jae Kyung was in the driver's seat and there was a male passenger with her.
Both the hospital and Seon Jae Kyung refuse to reveal who was with her, so more suspicions are rising now.
Who is it?
You said you went to the hospital yesterday.
Because of this accident, the rumor about this couple's marital trouble is being discussed on line.
Announcer Lee Jang Woo finished his live radio program this morning without any problem, but he's not making any comment about the rumor...
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do about this?
Do you have any reporters you know?
You should clarify things somehow...
You had a car when you came here, right?
Yea, Oppa's car.
Will you go through the discharge procedure for me?
This bad bastard!
He changed all of the numbers.
Let's just call the mechanic.
I can't!
A rumor will start.
Did Jang Woo really change them?
It's not that you forgot them because you hurt your head?
Ah, really!
I found out that you three are friends from a magazine.
What are you going to do about this now?
Who would believe she went there for work?
That area is famous as a motel town!
I told you she went to work!
You better end the friendship with her now.
Just say that you happened to have the magazine interview and that you aren't close at all!
To who..?
Who else would it be to?
!
My mom!
And tell the other people too!
Jae Kyung has been friends with me for 20 years.
This weekend, it's my mother's birthday.
As you're just an ordinary employee, I wanted to show the magazine interview to my mom for your sake.
This morning, this news was on the newspaper!
My mom saw this and she called!
Branch Manager, you know that I'm going on vacation starting tomorrow, right?
How can you keep dating that kind of man?
What?
Don't date him.
It's no use staying beside a guy like that;
you'll just be miserable for the rest of your life!
You're really nosy.
I'm the one dating this guy, and I'm the one who will marry if it happens.
Don't answer his calls, and don't let him come here!
Just being nice to him won't get a girl anywhere.
Why are you so interested in my personal life?
!
Why do you care what I do with my love life?
It's because I'm worried, worried.
I can take care of myself.
I'm going to training now.
This is why I'm worried.
Don't you meet him again.
I'll see.
Keep your nose out of it!
Not even one word, not even one!
She can't even say one word in front of that guy.
But in front of me she runs her mouth!
This phone call can't be connected..
Lee Jang Woo
This phone call can't be connected..
Sit down, sit.
Drink this and try to calm down.
It was weird.
On the day I had the accident, it looked like I had a tail behind me and the reporters all rushed into the hospital like it was planned in advance.
Did Jang Woo really not know about the relationship between you and Jung Min?
It seems like he did know.
You said that you would never get found out!
I told you to be more careful!
When does your husband do the his next morning broadcast?
I'll go meet him.
To do what?
Only he can stop further publication.
Since his own image is that important, he would want the same thing.
If you leave it like this, you'll be the only one who gets hurt.
What should we do?
Reporters have started to gather outside!
How do they know that she's here?
As for how they knew, you guys said you've been best friends for 20 years in that interview.
It would have been hard to find Ji Hee's house, and Yeol Mae is a popular music director.
Do you think it would be hard to find her house?
Hey, it's me.
"It's me"?
Why are you so proud?
Just tell me what you're going to do.
Why do I have to tell you that?
We're not even on the same side anymore.
You said we're not on the same side?
I found my way in life, so you find your own way in life.
Good luck to you.
-What did he say?
-What'd he say, what did he say?
Why are you cutting on the TV?
Just wait.
What's wrong with your marriage life? Was he your wife's boyfriend?
A boyfriend?
Did you just say a boyfriend?
MY WIFE....!
is not that kind of woman.
My wife...
loved that man sincerely.
He's crazy!
The word "adultery" is...
He's confirming as an adultery.
Of course I was hurt.
There's no man who wouldn't be terribly hurt when he hears that his wife loves another man.
Is it true that Jae Kyung confessed that she was committing adultery directly to you?
Are you going to sue her?
My wife's adultery hurt me immensely...
I have no intention of hurting her by suing.
I had to let her go....because she loved him that much.
So that my wife who has already left me and the man that she loves... can start a happy future...
I'll help them to the best of my ability.
I hope that everyone else...will also be generous toward them.
That SOB.
Hey!
How could your husband be like that?
!
Were you the only one cheating?
He did it too, way more openly than you did!
Be quiet.
Calm down.
I don't know this number.
Let's not answer them!
First, let's get out of here.
How?
-It's Seon Jae Kyung!
-Jae Kyung-sshi, we have some questions for you!
-Is it true that you committed adultery?
!
Leave her alone!
Please move out of the way!
-Jae Kyung-ssi, you're keeping so silent about the adultery, what is the truth?
!
Don't you have anything to say?
-Lee Jang Woo said he would let you go, how do you feel about that?
-Say something!
-About Lee Jang Woo-sshi-!
Sorry.
That way!
That way!
-It's Seon Jae Kyung!
Oh, thank you.
What do we do now?
Should we just go on the cruise?
We can't go back home anyway...
We should just go on the trip as planned....ahhh!
The passports!
Ji Hee, where is your passport?
At home.
I packed up all of my stuff last night too.
And you, Jae Kyung?
At the office.
Then I'll take care of the passports.
How?
What should I do?
It's Ho Joo.
What are you looking at me for?
He's on a rampage about the fact that I'm friends with Jae Kyung.
Put me on.
Hey, is this Kang Ho Joo?
What do you mean, who am I?
Who else would it be?
I'm Ji Hee's lover.
I heard that you said that doing it with my Ji Hee is boring.
It's really fun for me, but why is it so boring for you?
It's because you're bad at it, you bastard.
Why is this guy so dirty?
I'm giving you this tip because I pity you.
It's the man's fault if the sex is boring, not the woman's.
So stop watching porn and read poems, you bastard.
That's not an area of technique, but of sensibility.
You don't understand what I mean, do you?
So, from today on, go to the library right away and read poems.
Got it?
-Oooooh!
-Oooooh!
Is this something that a co-writer does too?
Don't forget that you have to feed the dogs.
Am I a person who feeds the dogs?
Thank you, Na Hyun-sshi.
On my desk, there is a story construction.
Write the story based on it.
Call me if there's something you don't know.
You're not going to answer me?
Yes.
Is there anything you want?
I'll get it for you, so tell me what it is.
-Then, rocks.
-Huh?
Rocks?
Rocks don't change.
The others rot or dissapear.
Rocks.
Alright.
I'll bring one for you.
Ah, this.
That guy also had an article come out.
[Announcer Lee Still Loves His Wife He Gains the Sympathy of the Public...]
We shouldn't leave Jae Kyung alone, not even a moment.
We even have to go to the bathroom with her.
With her temper, she might try to kill herself.
Jae Kyung said she's not going out.
Don't you have to eat to take your medicine?
It's not that I'm not going out, it's that I can't go out.
Do you two want to go and eat first?
You go alone.
We'll stay with Jae Kyung.
We can't leave her alone.
You guys go first.
I'll bring her.
-I don't want to!
-I don't want to!
Fine.
Seon Jae Kyung.
I'll give you ten minutes.
If you have anything you want to say, say it all.
After ten minutes, I'll bring you out of this room, no matter what happens.
Do you feel angry and wronged?
No.
I'm angry at myself that I missed the timing.
I don't feel wronged.
Since I was going to do to Jang Woo what he did to me.
But, he took hold of that chance first.
Lee Jang Woo is trash now because he did that.
Since you couldn't do it, thankfully you didn't become trash.
No matter what the world says, we know that Jang Woo is trash.
And we also know that you aren't trash.
We know it.
If I did something like that, you guys wouldn't have let me off the hook?
Of course not, not ever.
But, I knew you wouldn't do it.
I was going to do it.
I hated him so much that I really wanted to kill him.
I wanted to ruin him so badly that he couldn't even try doing that again.
He's already going to ruins.
He just doesn't know it.
Just think of him as pitiful and forget him.
Will I be able to stand tall again?
How about it?
Do you think I'll be able to stand up again?
Of course!
Shamelessly and fiercely.
-Can I believe that?
-Yep!
It will definitely be very painful.
People will talk about and follow you around, and the company will suffer more too.
You'll be hurt more and your family will too.
But, you will definitely stand tall once again.
Rather than getting sympathy, it would be easier for you to get criticized.
Let's go eat now!
I'll go get my bag!
Okay, let's go!
Sunbae, I'm believing you and going out.
Okay, believe me.
Look, you're pretty when you smile.
That expression is the exact same expression that he looks at me with.
Anyone who looks would think they're dating, wouldn't they? Hey, that's a lie!
Why would I lie?
Don't you remember?
We once stowed away.
We didn't want to do our homework, there was a pile of postponed break homeworkand the due date was the next day.
Was it the third grade in elementary school?
I told her to ride the bus and it dropped us off at Incheon.
So I asked her if she wanted to run away to America, and she said she would like to!
So?
So we got on an empty boat and just hid.
After a short time of sleeping, we found out the boat was going to China.
That's not true.
It was a small boat.
A boat for catching crabs.
Hey, how big the ship was!
What are you talking about?
How did you get off?
Was it the Coast Guard?
No, Navy?
Right, you're a writer.
What an exaggerating..
No.
Sunbae, I think people just keep looking at me.
Who?
In the 9 o'clock direction.
I think they recognize me.
They've kept on staring over here and whispering since earlier.
Excuse me?
Where are you from?
From France.
Ah France...
I couldn't even tell.
Excuse me...that woman over there says that you look like a professor that taught her in the past.
Would it be alright if I asked for your name?
It's Pierre, but I've never taught an Asian woman before, and I'm not a teacher either.
My husband is a veterinarian.
Ah, I see.
Then, this is your first time seeing that woman, right?
Yes.
We've been staring at them since earlier because young people are so pretty.
Are they your friends?
Yes.
Excuse me then, please enjoy your meal and have a good time.
Goodbye.
See, it's not like that!
You saw that, right?
Is there anyone else?
Tell me and I'll check them all.
They're Korean, right? They're Chinese.
Anyone else?
No one here is interested in you.
What's happened to you is only special to you.
Everyone else will just wave their fingers once and end there.
What's happened to you is only special to you.
Everyone else will just wave their fingers once and end there.
You still don't know that?
Let's eat!
If Jae Kyung were me right now,
I would have misunderstood again.
That everything he's doing is because he loves me.
That morning...
Even if the person who was making and singing that song was Ji Hee, would it have been the same?
If the person who fell asleep in the library... was Jae Kyung, not me, would it have been the same?
Tonight...
Do you want to be together?
At that moment...
Even if it wasn't me...
Does Seok Hyun not care if it's not me, but someone else?
Yoon Seok Hyun's gaze is a gaze that seduces women.
Usually, Sunbae is harsh.
But sometimes when I say something, he smiles a little.
When he does that, he makes a person's heart flutter.
At those times, Sunbae knocks women off-guard.
The fact that I still don't have a reply to my confession...
Does that mean it's a rejection?
Is it really a rejection?
I could be someone who isn't a special person to him.
But...
Tonight...
Do you want to be together?
Being like this alone is foolish.
I have to make sure of it from Seok Hyun.
Whether this is love or not.
Sunbae went out.
and Jae Kyung is asleep.
Where did oppa go?
He said he was going to the swimming pool.
You didn't go to sleep?
Where's your swimsuit?
Didn't you come here to swim?
Just...
I heard you were here.
Oh.
Do you wanna go?
Aish, seriously!
Hey.
What's wrong?
I'm sorry!
Did you drink water?
What's wrong?
Why did you come along?
Are the others sleeping?
Would it be better to stop here?
You didn't answer.
I said that I fell in love with you again.
Are you... not going to give me an answer?
How long are you going to be so cowardly?
You keep your mouth shut like that and make me feel lonely.
Are you going to just leave it how it is and let me keep misunderstanding?
!
I guess you're not going to speak.
Is that a rejection?
I told you it was okay to reject me.
Even if you reject me, I don't like things how they are now.
Can't you tell me more clearly?
You're keeping your mouth shut again.
Do you know how long people can usually hold their breath?
I heard that they can do it for about 35 seconds.
But I can hold mine for about 40 seconds.
I'm going to dive in.
And...
I'm not going to come from under the water until you give a reply to my confession.
I can stay under for 60 seconds like a ghost.
Just need count a minute in half.
I got friendly with Metronome since I started music.
35 seconds.
35 seconds.
I'm running out of breath.
37 seconds.
38 seconds.
39 seconds.
40 seconds.
Yoon Seok Hyun has not answered yet.
I can't endure it anymore.
Yoon Seok Hyun!
This is why I don't like you.
I don't like you because you act like this!
Do you have to be so desperate?
Do you have to see the end?
!
If I don't say anything, can't you just let it be like that?
!
You're not that indecisive.
It's very first time since I was born.
Why?
Because I might make a mistake.
Because you might get hurt.
Because I don't like you getting hurt!
It's my problem if I get hurt!
You're starting to act like you're so great again.
I hate this attitude too!
You are the hardest woman to understand in the world!
Have you met all of the women in this world?
!
Why do you do this?
Why do you have to push me to the limit?
Why do you need think so hard?
Don't you know how you feel?
Is this a problem that you can fix by thinking?
!
If you keep on acting like this, there's only one thing that will come from my lips.
I don't have any thoughts of going back.
I don't want to go back.
I decided when you jumped into the water.
I'm not going!
We're over as man and woman.
Bad guy.
I couldn't say that he was bad just because he said that he wouldn't give me the answer I wanted.
But I said those words, and I'll say them again.
You bad bastard.
I want to be loved.
Because I couldn't tell him that, I spoke like that.
I've finally figured out his true feelings.
Oh, are you planning to get off today?
I want to look around a bit.
Are you guys going to stay in today?
Yes.
I will take Jae Kyung to the doctor in this cruise.
Is Yeol Mae still sleeping?
Yeol Mae isn't getting off either.
Eat your food.
I'll get off and come back.
Stay here.
It's no fun if you're not here.
Sunbae just left.
Is your neck feeling better?
My neck's fine, but my ribs are hurting pretty bad.
What's wrong with you?
Can't we just get off here?
What's wrong?
Did something happen?
Something happened between you and Sunbae, didn't it?
He was weird too.
I told him we weren't getting off, but he went alone.
I was completely dumped by Seok Hyun.
I got rejected early this morning.
What did he say when he rejected you?
That he doesn't like me.
What?
Was he really planning to just be friends with benefits?
Truthfully, Sunbae isn't that kind of person, since he doesn't have a woman.
It's pathetic.
So why did you ask?
It would have been good to just be friends with benefits.
That's not right.
We're 33 years old now, not teenagers.
He didn't show her a future, so how could she only look at him?
I'm going to dump Ho Joo soon too, so let's all live bravely!
Can't you comfort me with something else?
How great it is that you're Joo Yeol Mae and not Seon Jae Kyung!
You know my current circumstances, don't you?
Do you want to switch lives with me?
I'm sorry, but that won't do.
But there's still something good about my life.
What is that?
That my marriage life with Lee Jang Woo is totally over!
Right.
Congrats!
Here.
Cheers!
This is fun...
I didn't even tell anyone...
Those heels..are my heels.
The shoes, Hannah, which I made last year.
My shoes...are being circulated around the world.
-Um excuse me?
-Yes?
-Where are you from?
Oh I'm from New York.
Wow, what beautiful shoes.
They suit you!
Oh thanks, they're from Korea actually.
My Korean friend sent them to me for my birthday.
Actually, I designed those shoes.
Really?
Yea, do you like them?
Oh I love them.
Whenever I wear them, I feel sexy, confident, and attractive.
Yes, I create confidence.
Yea, well, they're great shoes.
You should be really proud.
Thank you so much!
Enjoy your trip.
Bye!
She said I made a great shoes that I should be proud of.
Look at that, your face got brighter!
Let's go!
I saw some bag in the duty free shop.
I have to buy perfume.
Let's go.
Did you eat?
Who's worried about who?
You just worry about your life.
Do you even know what you gave up last night?
What did I give up?
You're going to regret it.
Where did that confidence come from?
Don't laugh.
If you laugh one more time, I'm going to kill you.
I thought about my feelings.
About what I really wanted.
Tens, hundreds, and thousands of times.

I love you very very much.
I love you very very much.

I hurt you.
I kiss you.
And I sleep with you.
Out of all these numerous words, is there one that you don't associate with me?
If there is even one, tell me.
I'll give you another chance.
Now that I know how you truly feel,
I am not worried at all.
-Joo Yeol Mae...
-Would it be better for us to part ways and be strangers forever, or even if we fight over and over again, would it be better for us to search for true love together?
Think about it.
For me, even if we fight every day,
I have made up my mind to search for it with you.
I am going to find true love.
It's never over for you.
Even if you feel that this is the end, you keep on going.
Yup.
I am the type of person who keeps on going until the end.
So I can't help it even if you don't like it.
I am me.
I have to go to the end with you.
No matter where that is.
Do as you like.
You are not me, nor do you have to be me.
I choose my life, and you choose yours.
It's that simple.
Do as you like.
Hello, Kang Na Hyun.
I am about to land shortly.
Where are you?
Really?
Alright.
Sun Jae Kyung.
It is on the newspapers that we are on a cruise.
How did they know?
Ji Hee.
Switch shoes with me.
These shoes may be too big for you.
The doctor told you not to wear heels for some time because it puts a strain on your ribs.
Didn't you just hear that woman?
I have to wear heels, or stilettos.
I need to stand tall with my head high.
To look confident.
Uhm, okay, fighting!
Fighting!
Are you going to be okay?
Yes, I am okay.
Let's go.
Mrs. Sun Jae Kyung?
Is the adultery true?
Yes.
It is true.
Was your marriage with Lee Jang Woo miserable?
Why did you do it even though the two of you were famous for being devoted to one another?
Lee Jang Woo did everything he could possibly do for me.
This is all my fault.
Did you love the other person?
Yes.
I love him.
How do you feel right now?
What is going to happen between you and Lee Jang Woo?
How is she so impudent?
I am so jealous.
It's from those heels, she said.
I love how impudent that girl is.
Me too, me too.
Oppa, I am going to do the laundry.
Oh, my rocks!
1, 2, 3.
Thanks, sunbae.
When did you pick those up?
When I got off the cruise.
Aren't they pretty?
They are pretty.
I'm going to have one too, okay?
I'm taking this one.
I should have taken two.
Is the store not open yet?
No, we just opened.
You came here knowing that we don't charge the first customer of the day.
I don't want to be a burden.
A caramel macchiato.
Extra sweet.
Hmm?
Wait, is something going on?
It's very first order.
A caramel macchiato.
Especially extra sweet?
Something must be stressing you out.
Maybe.
Ho ho!
Who was the one who said it's okay to lean on others when you're having a hard time?
I'm having a really hard time.
Is it okay if I lean on you?
I was dumped by a man.
I confessed to the man I liked after I confessed, so I feel like my heart is being ripped out of my chest right now.
That's good.
So now you can just come to me, right?
I....
I'm a black belt so I won't sugar coat.
I ...
Like you.
Why?
Why do you like me?
I don't have a reason.
It's just... because you are Joo Yeol Mae.
By any chance, ...
That fated woman....
Is that woman... me?
Yes, It's you.
INeedRomance2012.
You're born with the same fate.
What kind of fate?
With a lot of obstacles.
How did you survive so far?
I was so uneasy for all that time.
Now, it's all so simple.
Just because he doesn't love me...
There are so many things that are more important than dating in the world.
I'm going live for this earth.
Have you two come to a settlement?
Stop acting.
Let's just get this over with and leave, okay?
Hey!
Do you want to divorce or not?
!
If we're this close of a distance away from each other, we could kiss.

Have you parked the bike?
Yes, it's perfectly placed next to yours.
Ah, I'm so tired!
Who told you to drink till dawn?
!
Who was it that took in this drunk man?
Oh, you were the one that threw yourself all over me as soon as the door opened!
Whatever, I'm tired.
Quickly get up and go wash!
I have to go to work!
I'm too lazy to move.
Want me to help you get up?
Hey Seon U In Yeong, you!
Oh, the smell!
Exactly what did you eat yesterday?
Hey, what are you looking at?
!
Last night was great, right?
Not sure...
I can't remember.
What?
I'd be really unhappy if you say that.
Do you know how much energy it took me after waking up last night?
What energy?
It's not like you did anything!
Try getting drunk like that again and you'll see.
Next time, I will really not open the door for you.
What's with you?
No matter how drunk I was, I've always done what you've stressed on.
"Kissing must start from the forehead."
"Touching your breasts before kissing you is a no-no."
"When unhooking your bra..."
And isn't that for both our sakes?
!
not just for me alone!
It's good that it's for both our sakes, but men are sometimes in a hurry.
So last night, were you in a hurry?
In a hurry?
In a hurry?
I got it!
I got it!
I got it already!
I'm at fault!
I was in such a hurry!
Of course, things didn't start off this well.
There are two kinds of people in this world...
Cool people who don't remember the promises made 10 years ago and foolish people who still remember the 10 year-old promises.
On graduation day, we made a promise amongst ourselves.
That we'd meet 10 years later when we'd be 23 years old, on Chistmas.
Even though I thought it was a childish promise,
I was still looking forward to see who'd show up.
I have always thought there would be another strange person like me.
So, I planned to wait for that person.
Among those 50 people, I was the only strange one.
That day was Christmas Day.
That day... was my birthday.
Who are you?
What are you doing?
That...
I am... that is...
I am...
Kim Seong Su.
Huh?
6th grade, Classroom 4's Kim Seong Su.
I see...
Hello.
You still live nearby?
Yeah.
Still at the same house?
Yeah.
What about your parents?
My mother and father are in Chungju managing an orchard.
My mother had cancer but she's fine now.
That's really fortunate.
So, now you're living alone in that house?
Mom told me not to say that I live alone.
But, you weren't in my class.
Why'd you come to the school today?
Your desk-mate Oh Eun Ho.
He was my good friend.
I heard he immigrated to Canada during high school.
You came today to see him?
No.
Then why did you come?
I don't know about the others, but I knew for sure you'd come.
But... why me?
You really don't know?
Yeah.
I came to see you.
I was curious to see how much you've changed.
Oh... it's like that.
Huh!
What's this?
It's snowing.
We've arrived.
Oh, you changed the front gate.
I remembered then it was different color.
It was already very old.
If I knew you hadn't moved, I would've come to see you before I went to study abroad.
You went to study abroad?
Yes.
I attended film school in New York.
This is my first time coming back to Korea in 3 years.
Isn't today your birthday?
That day was snowing.
That day was Christmas.
That day was my birthday.
Thank you very much.
This one guy who flew all the way from New York just to see me.
He gave me a bouquet of flowers and a birthday cake.
That was enough to become an epic story of love.
Furthermore, at 23 years-old, I was really in need of romance.
Can I kiss you?
I have always thought that my first kiss would definitely be under that streetlight.
No, you can't.
Why not?
It's just...
Do you have a boyfriend?
No, although I don't have one...
You already have someone you like, right?
No.
That's right...
I thought you'd have another man.
I was just curious about what kind of woman you'd turned out to be.
Have you kissed someone else before?
I think it would be all right to kiss me.
This is what happened 10 years ago.
During these 10 years,
Seong Su and I didn't face any problem.
We got along very well.
You broke up with him, didn't you?
It's written all over your face.
He hasn't even kissed you for the past 3 months.
We did it last night.
What is she saying?
You guys don't have that kind of excitement people should have when they're in love.
Oh, that is so right.
I haven't seen Motorbike ajussi in a long time.
Motorbike is Seong Su's nickname.
You broke up with him, right?
Or were you just tired of each other.
Did you really break up?
It has been a long time since I've seen him around.
Before, he always came over with his motorbike to bring you supper.
It's not like that.
He's really busy.
Really busy.
Also, the motorbike's been sold.
What's a slacker so busy doing?
He's not a slacker but a film director!
I've heard about this since you started working here.
How he's always been filming.
But untill now he has yet to debut.
Right, always saying he's preparing for something but he has been idling instead.
A slacker.
I'm saying he's not.
He will debut very soon.
Look forward to it.
It'll be realized soon!
Being a slacker, how does he support himself?
Does this man support himself?
Omo!
(Omo ?
Oh My)
Are you paying for everything while he's with you?
You even pay for the hotel bills, isn't that right?
I'm really speechless!
Manager Seon U, Manager Seon U!
Oh, come in.
Isn't this Motorbike?
Oh!
This really is Motorbike.
Omo, omo, omo!
He looks really dashing like this!
And look at his legs.
Looks like he's got some strength there...
And there's his interview.
It's even 5 pages long.
He didn't tell me anything about receiving an interview.
I heard his press conference turned out really well.
I didn't hear anything about a press conference either.
He really looks like a model.
Although I knew he is really handsome...
Manager, a reporter asked him about his girlfriend.
But he said he didn't want to talk about his private life.
He didn't want to talk about his private life?
Does that mean he is ashamed of me?
I heard Alex has checked in.
Yes, I saw him.
He wanted instant noodle as soon as he came, so I sent him a box.
Hey!
Isn't this Mr. Motorbike?
Yes, thank you for adding "Mr.".
Everybody else just calls him "Motorbike, Motorbike".
I have invitation tickets to this movie.
Sunbae, you have already seen it, right?
I heard it's very nice.
What?
Yes.
Yes.
Sunbae, you must have a lot of invitation tickets.
Can you give me a few?
That...
Jerk!
He didn't even give me tickets to the premiere.
I'll help you get them.
Wow, are you guys tying the knot soon?
Didn't he say he will propose to you once he debuts?
You've been in a relationship for 10 years already, not to mention you're over 30 years old.
There's got to be something wrong with the man if he still hasn't proposed to you.
-He will propose.
-He won't.
They've been together for 10 years.
I'm sure he will.
Don't hope for it.
Isn't he really busy right now?
Does preparing a proposal take a month or a year?
Seong Su is not the type of guy who'd leave others on the sidelines.
Men don't act based on their personality.
They are creatures of instinct.
See, he didn't even give you the tickets to the premiere.
He started to change long time ago.
You just didn't know it yet.
After ten years of suffering, it wasn't easy for him to debut.
If it were you, would you want to think about other matters?
Why not?
Men will change their mind 1000 times in 10 years.
Fine.
Don't mention it.
He cheated once before, didn't he?
It has been over 10 years.
If there's an engaged man who has never had an affair even once in 10 years, show him to me.
Haven't you heard of the saying,
"Once a windmill, always a windmill.
A turning windmill, its fan will rotate at the slightest breath."
Look who's talking.
A person who has been cheating everyday.
Hey, you're a typhoon and you're talking about a fan turned by the wind?
That's right.
So...
I always have this to say to my male colleagues,
"Don't ever have a relationship with a woman like me."
Cheating is not something I can control.
My heart can't control my body.
That's what having an affair is like.
My desires can't control my heart.
That's what having an affair is like.
Didn't you promise not to cheat anymore?
Stop it!
Cheating is not the issue here.
It's an instinct issue.
I'm an expert so I should understand it.
Is Seong Su the same as you?
Yes, you have always thought the world is a very beautiful place.
Hey!
She is getting married, even the invitations are done.
But seeing the situation, she couldn't take it out.
Kang Hyeon Ju, this girl's timing is truly miserable.
That's great!
Congratulations!
I really don't understand.
They've never even slept together, but they're getting married.
Is this worth congratulating?
Hey.
You haven't slept together yet, right?
Still a virgin at 33.
Shouldn't we hang a sign?
Stop it.
No, seeing that you're still a virgin after being together for 3 years, that man who's with you should be the one wearing the sign.
There's a reason they call the wedding night the first night.
Isn't it great for your first night to be on your wedding night?
Great?
!
What's so great about that?
Did you like your first time?
We learn about sex education during our teenage years.
We should experience more in our 20s.
Then in our 30s, we should have developed our own tricks already.
A time where you should be showing off your skills.
But you have neither experience nor secret skills!
So you'll surely have no tricks up your sleeves.
What man wants to sleep with a 30-year-old virgin?
He wants purity, but he'll also be looking for sophisticated skills.
A virgin, a woman without skill, is not charming at all.
Fine, you do make sense.
Even in the book stated the same problems.
So I have to make an effort.
What effort?
Is there any need for that?
When he kisses you at that moment, what should your hand do?
Undo the belt and put your hand inside his pants!
Can you also do it outside?
You've never let him inside your house?
He doesn't want to come in.
Wow, it seems like he really loves you.
What a joke.
Is her body made of crystal?
Will she break if they sleep together?
What's so good about loving dearly?
Hey, stop it.
Why not?
As friends, in such circumstances, how can we just give her our blessings?
Okay, okay, bless you all.
Go ahead and treasure it.
Then when you reach 60, do it 3 times a day, okay?
Fighting!
This couple has been together for 3 years.
However, they have only kissed.
What effort?
Is there any need for that?
When he kisses you at that moment, what should your hand do?
Undo the belt and put your hand inside his pants.
What is it?
It's late.
Go in.
Do you want to come inside for a while?
We're getting married soon.
I'll go back first today.
Okay.
Good night.
But Kang Hyeon Ju received a proposal from him, and they're getting married.
Kim Seong Su and I have been together for 10 years, but there's been no marriage proposal from him yet.
There is not much else to expect.
The only thing left is the wedding.
Hello dear, it's me.
Why are you not saying anything?
=Hello?
=
A woman is using his phone to make a call.
Butt!
You're listed as 'Butt' on his phone.
Did you drink a lot?
He drank with the reporters.
Today, we had an interview for the movie.
How should I know?
The responses are very good these days.
It looks like we're going to be successful.
We?
Get up!
Darling, get up!
Why did you drink so much?
Director Kim was indeed having a lot of hardships.
Producers, actors, and also the crew members, no one rested at that time.
We're just like this at the end of the day.
Occasionally, we just get really drunk to relax.
You really know a lot.
Did I do something wrong?
Of course you did.
You're beautiful and still very young.
Furthermore, your body is also very hot.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Thank you for bringing him back.
You're not living with the director, right?
Of course we're living together.
Why?
No, it's nothing.
Please go in.
Excuse me, can you return the cardigan?
The director said the evening was cold earlier.
I bought that cardigan for his birthday last year.
So return it now, okay?
During shooting, I'd always put on this cardigan as if it was mine.
I'm asking you to take it off.
My body's getting weaker.
I get drunk so easily these days.
You've been drinking all day.
That's why your body becomes weak.
Here drink a bit this honey water.
I've already brushed my teeth.
Did you drink, too?
I had a glass of red wine with the girls.
That's Yun Kang Hui, right?
The commercial model?
Mmm...
Is she in your movie?
She is the heroine.
Isn't she cute?
Is she?
I really didn't notice.
Why didn't you invite me to your premiere?
Give me an explanation.
I want to hear it.
Because I feel like it's garbage.
Huh?
I don't want you to see this movie.
I believe making a movie should not be like this.
That movie is only for commercial purposes.
Just to debut.
That's why I did it.
I feel very embarrassed to show it to you.
Why must you think like that?
I heard the responses were very good.
There are certain things that a man doesn't want to show to his beloved.
Why are you smiling?
I can smell her scent.
What scent?
It's not perfume but some nice fragrance.
A sweet smell.
Do you know what her other name is?
Hami melon.
I wanted to ask you...
Mmm...
What do I smell like?
Your scent?
Uh huh...
You have my scent.
You smell exactly the same as I do.
I don't have any feelings whatsoever.
Kim Seong Su's hand is on my breast.
But I don't feel anything.
Really, it wasn't like some other person's hand!
It felt just like my own hand.
My gosh, in the past, I would be stimulated by just a brush of his fingers.
This is outrageous, isn't it?
There's a person who's still a virgin here.
Well, that's you.
It can be like that when you've dated for 10 years.
The books also say that love's expiration date is 3 years.
And also, sexual excitement is not a measurement of love you know.
But still, how could it be so?
My body has his smell and my body is just like his body.
How can I accept this?
If it's been 10 years, then you just have to rely on the spirit of love.
And give up physical pleasure?
To be honest, I feel bored too.
Do you have any ideas?
How could I not have any methods?
Well, what should I do?
First, you have to come out with new tricks.
What new tricks?
First of all, change from your missionary position.
The human body is more flexible than we think.
If done correctly, the body can do just about anything.
To learn new tricks, you have to throw away all your old ideas.
Although there is only one climax, there are hundreds of positions.
God has made our bodies this way for a reason.
We must explore, and develop the bodies that have been given to us.
If you haven't even tried yet, how can you say that you're already tired it's an insult to god's gift.
People must live a holy life.
I feel that if you can't do that, then you guys should just break up.
Your relationship in the future will be meaningless.
You've both already ended things.
Kim Seong Su hasn't even proposed to you.
It's been over 3 years since we passed the age of 30.
There is only one thing a woman can do in this situation.
Give him one last passionate kiss and coolly break up.
10 years... we have been together for 10 years.
Although I have gone through a lot in the past,
I have a dream.
Just like this, we'll love each other until old age, then be buried together in one grave, that kind of dream.
That's true.
Me too, me too.
Honey!
Quick, come here, quickly come here.
Be careful, be careful.
-=Kim Seong Su and the love of his life, Seon U In Yeong, buried together.=-
Stop joking already.
Are you all simple-minded or stupid?
Or did you guys stop growing after high school?
Men will definitely not dream of those kinds of things.
Would they dream of that kind of future?
What do men dream of?
Do you really not know?
They only have one dream...
To sleep with all the women in this world.
Most men think that they're 20 years old forever, but we can understand that.
But do you know what is more crazier than that?
Even though they're promiscuous, they hope that their wives will always be faithful to them.
Bad, bad guys!
Just thinking about it makes me furious.
They really do not evolve.
They ought to return to ancient times and hunt tigers.
Then is there no way to get a man to love us forever?
Actually, there is one.
What is that?
What is that?
Change the man every 3 months, okay!
For those 3 months, they will totally be in love with you.
Youguysarealreadyover .
Ithink you'regoingtobreak up .
Hi, Alex!
What's up?
How is the room?
Do you like it?
It's great!
I really like it.
A gift.
Originally, I wanted to give you this gift on the day I checked in, but I was too tired.
Wow, it looks good!
Love candles, use them with Motorcyle.
It'll be very romantic.
We've always been very romantic even without using these.
Thank you!
Okay, I'm leaving.
Mmm...
You're not going to the restaurant to get drunk, right?
No, I'm afraid you'll scold me later.
I'm going.
Okay.
You bought this?
Let me take a look.
Hey, that's Yun Kang Hui.
She is the lead actress in Seong Su's movie.
She must be infatuated with him.
Let go.
-=Actress Yun Kang Hui and the movie director of "Breakdown Couple" are in love.=-
CanI behonest?
The directorisverycharming.
We've been working together for over a year.
Inthebeginning,Ididn 'teven know howtoact in thismovie.
Iwascompletelystiff,butthedirectorwasvery kindtome .
And also... he is really handsome.
I can't resist a gentle man like him.
Noweverybodyknows.
I'm the kindofpersonwhocan 'thidemyfeelings.
I've already confessed to the director that I like him.
He didn't seem to mind my confession.
If the director agrees, then we can see each other!
I am now 23 and already an adult.
Recently, fans are more understanding.
My director Kim is indeed very charming, and she is also very cute.
When did you buy this?
Is it good?
It's very good.
It's easy to use.
Have you sorted out the guest that have checked in for today?
No, not yet.
Sort the list out first.
Today is the wedding anniversary of Chairman Bae from Han Yeong Construction, right?
Ah, right.
Confirm a reservation later at the restaurant and prepare fresh flowers and cake.
Yes, Sunbae.
I don't know why Manager Park is not here yet...
Girls, what am I going to do?
Have you all seen the interview in Hangang Sports Entertainment News?
Read Yan Kang Hui's interview.
She is a formidable enemy.
I don't need loans.
If you continue to harass me, you'll see.
I'm going to call the police.
Isn't she very beautiful?
Only 23 years old.
I'm going crazy.
Younger than us by 10 years.
Game over!
How is Seong Su going to resist if she continues to pounce on him like that?
Hyeon Ju, you should know how soft-hearted he is.
I'm going crazy.
What should I do now?
I need to go for a walk.
I couldn't sleep well last night.
How long will I be frightened that his love will change?
I feel very sad and alone.
Sunbae... you don't feel like eating in the staff's canteen today, right?
Shall we go out and eat?
There is a newly opened Japanese restaurant nearby.
Its lunch sets are quite delicious.
I have a prior appointment.
Ah, is that so?
I'm sorry.
You go ahead and eat, okay?
What am I supposed to do now?
Really, what is the right thing to do?
You've both already ended things.
There is only one thing a woman can do in this situation.
Kiss and say goodbye.
Give him one last deep kiss and break up coolly.
Sunbae, run before the lights change!
Why?
What is going on?
Someone is following us.
Quickly, hurry!
What, what exactly is going on?
Are you out of breath?
Hey, what's going on?
Who's following us?
Stick out your chest and open your arms.
Breathe in, breathe out.
Have they left? Don't you feel much better now? Then, let's go to eat.
When your mind is troubled running is the best solution.
Hurry.
That was naive and very nauseating.
However, my heart is filled up with this gentle and warm feeling.
Why are you still standing there?
Hurry!
The sky feels closer, then further.
I'm higher than the trees, then lower.
Taller than Seung Hyeon, then shorter.
I feel that it can't be avoided anymore.
I must be strong and make a positive breakthrough.
Have you eaten dinner?
Yes, I ate at the hotel.
Why didn't you wait for me at home?
It would have end in just two hours.
I have read the interview...
Yun Kang Hui's interview.
Coverage in the Hangang Sports Entertainment.
Oh, that!
Were you worried?
Yes, I am worried.
I want to know what do you think about it.
Why are you worried about that kind of thing?
That's what I think.
I want to know what your thinking.
Can I be honest?
I came here just to hear that.
She is a very good person, open, cheerful, and cute.
She makes the people around her feel happy.
It gets awkward sometimes because she's so carefree.
Even when I got angry with her, she didn't care.
She is so honest about her feelings.
That is her strength, but it's also her weakness.
I don't want to lie to you, In Yeong.
When I see her, my heart races.
I really like her.
It's the truth.
But that is not all.
I also have you.
Your heart races when you see her.
Then I...
I...
I will not abandon you.
We've been together for a very long time.
I may no longer feel excited around you, but you're still just like family.
Like a sister, like a mother.
Occasionally, you're also like a little sister, and sometimes you're also like a child.
Actually, that is not a bad thing!
Yes, it is not a bad thing.
Everybody grows old like that.
It's not just me.
Men, when they're around other women, will often feel shaken at certain times.
Were you that shaken about it? To be honest, yes.
Why won't breaking up with me?
How can I do that?
I have a sense of obligation and responsibility towards you.
A sense of responsibility.
A sense of obligation.
It's not a sense of love, but a sense of responsibility.
A sense of obligation.
I will never throw you away, In Yeong.
Kim Seong Su, why are you acting so old-fashioned?
All I am is garbage to you?
That's not what I meant.
Please get up.
I want to go back home.
Why did I even ask for an explanation?
All of this was Seong Hyeon's fault.
In Yeong.
In Yeong.
Don't be like this.
In Yeong.
What are you doing, In Yeong?
Should we buy some beer?
No need.
Having a drink sounds good.
Let's have a drink.
I don't want to.
I want to sleep alone tonight.
If you are going to be like this, why did you bother to ask me?
Didn't you ask me to be honest with you?
Nothing good will come out of knowing how I really feel.
I know you are sad, but what have I done wrong?
Have I slept with her already?
Or did I date her behind your back?
Did I have an affair?
Why act like you've been wronged?
You did have an affair once, didn't you?
You act like I've wronged you.
That was five years ago.
Every time I almost forget, why must you bring it up again?
I don't know about you, but I've never forgotten it.
Not once.
So, what do you want from me?
Why bring up the past?
Over time, there will be turbulence.
Over time, you will become old.
Over time, everyone changes and will eventually break up.
It's the same for my love.
My love is rotting now.
I do not hate being useless.
I have already cried more than enough for the sake of love.
I don't want to hurt you anymore.
Can't you see I'm trying to control myself?
Do I have to reward you for that?
Yes, it's true whenever I see her my heart races.
Do you know how hard I've tried to not hurting you?
Can I kiss you?
I think it would be all right to kiss me.
Let's break up, okay?
Let's end everything here, okay?
Let's break up, okay?
The street light that witnessed our beginning 10 years ago is now quietly witnessing our parting.
Cheers!
Kim Seong Su, I'm happier without him.
Previously, I wasn't aware that my bed was so big and comfortable.
She is my classmate from primary school.
Even now, we often keep in touch.
Seon U In Yeong, thank you for blessing us!
Kim Seong Su, that jerk.
Right after breaking up with me he came to the hotel with Yun Kang Hui!
Furthermore, it's the hotel I work at!
Come to your senses.
He's a married man!
At times like these don't you know I'll lose all rationality?
Leave immediately!
Didn't you hear me telling you to get out?
You are here.
I heard he didn't come home last night.
Did something happen?
Kim Tae U, that mental person!
That son of a bitch!
The groom is not here yet?

Is this really funny?
I began to go out with Bae Sung Hyun.
I enjoyed this courtship.
I'll spit on your face, whore.
I was comfortable because my heart didn't get excited.

I liked that there were no games.
Why don't we like the same things?
Why don't you know how I feel?
Why don't you say you miss me?
Why don't you love me as much as I love you?
I liked that I felt none of the miseries of being in love.
Because I didn't love Sung Hyun, I felt comfortable with him.
But Sung Hyun felt differently.
Hey.
Were you waiting long?
When I was leaving, Maeda San was checking in.
Her daughter grew up so much.
Why didn't you answer my call this morning?
Oh, did you call?
Do you get my texts?
Did I get your texts?
Oh no.
Nevermind.
I really didn't see it.
I check my cellphone over a hundred times a day.
Because I don't want to miss your text.
Okay, okay.
I'll check over a hundred times too.
What did you do yesterday?
I was with friends.
Who?
Seo Yeon and Hyun Joo?
Yeah.
What did you do together?
We just ate and chat.
Now what?
Don't you want to know anything about me?
What I did today, what I'm going to do tomorrow, who I'm friends with.
Aren't you even curious?
I am curious.
Of course I want to know.
What did you do yesterday?
I waited for your call all day.
It was my day off.
Why didn't you call me?
Why do I always have to call first?
Don't you ever miss me?
Why don't you ever ask to meet first?
Do you really like me?
Of course.
Let's meet on your next day off.
Is there a movie you want to see?
Should I make a reservation?
How are my clothes today?
It's nice.
This is the outfit you said you liked when I was a concierge.
Ah, I thought I recognized the outfit.
No, you didn't remember at all.
Ah.
Yeah, high-five.
Again, again.
They're so childish.
And so?
That's why I'm drawing two floor plans.
One facing east.
One facing south.
I want to explore all possibilities.
Wow, Alex.
You're the best.
Alex, you rules.
I am the best.
No your not.
Did you always laugh that hard?
Why are you laughing so much?
Don't smile so easily at others.
Guys will think you're a tease.
Wait.
You have something here.
Oh, I'm so messy.
I said not to laugh like that.
What's wrong?
We're just friends.
Don't do this.
Don't touch Sunwoo In Young's face.
Talk about work in the office and not to Sun Woo In Young.
Play tennis by yourself and eat ramen by yourself.
Don't talk about your problems, okay?
Why not?
We're friends.
That's why you shouldn't do it.
In Young's boyfriend really doesn't like it, okay?
Motorcycle.
Where's Motorcycle?
I didn't dislike Sung Hyun like this.
But a part of me felt bad for him.
Oh, my little precious.
Seriously.
Did you wash your hands?
What are you doing?
Do you think that'll make me less upset?
Sung Hyun reminded me of my younger self.
Wow, that looks pretty.
Oh, how's this?
I like this.
Your eyeballs are about to fall out.
Hey.
Give me some tissue.
I don't have any.
Give me a napkin.
What is this?
I'm so embarrassed.
What are you doing?
It's just instinct.
This isn't your first time.
Why do you keep looking?
I said it's instinct.
The ancient instinct of hunting for more.
Hunting?
Are women something to hunt?
Think women don't have instincts?
What kind of instinct is that?
Women are constantly searching for a man who will build a better home.
Then just for an hour, let's be free to explore our options.
Only look at me.
I said only look at me.
In whatever relationship, the person who loves more is more miserable.
At night, I thought of Kim Sung Soo.
I slept with him.
I also realized, how close the word hate... was to the word love.
And I realized how it felt to truly miss someone.
I realized how much it hurt to wish that I could see him even from a distance.
It's Kim Sung Soo's car.
Hey, Kim Sung Soo.
Why are you here?
Hey, Kim Sung Soo.
Kim Sung Soo's car was parked in front of my house for an entire week.
Why on earth did he park his car in front of my house?
What is this supposed to mean?
Whatever the reason, I'll never fall for Kim Sung Soo again.

I thought you'd be cold.
This is so nice, right?
Ah, it's so nice to be here with you.
When I said it was so nice, I meant the night and the music.
Is this what love is?
Is it creating something out of growing misunderstandings?
Are we mistaking that something for love?
Let's be together tonight.
Be with me tonight.
That car's still here.
What's up with him?
Does he come every day?
He was there yesterday, isn't he busy?
Doesn't he have movies to shoot?
I know you're cheating but can't you be considerate?
This isn't a relay race.
Focus on me on days you're with me.
If you keep this up, I'm really going to feel hurt.
How could I not focus on you?
I'm with you every day.
Pay attention to me at night too.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Tell him that you're spending the night.
That you're not going home.
Wow, we're totally having an affair.
Doesn't this seem like an affair?
So why did you want to go out with someone who has an owner?
Owner?
Did you just say owner?
Don't you have any freedom?
Is that bastard your owner?
Can you really talk to me like this?
I'm really going to feel hurt if you keep this up.
I'm a detailed guy.
I'm a sensitive man who gets easily hurt.
Just go quietly.
Damn.
What are you doing Bae Sung Hyun?
I have no reason not to spend the night with Bae Sung Hyun.
But...
I need strength to sleep with him.
Oh.
Alex.
Hey, In Young.
It's Park Seo Yeon.
So nice.
What a work out.
Do you want to shower first or should I shower first?
You first.
I want to sit down for a while.
Are you sure?
Yes.
What is this?
This strange mood?
How are you going to explain?
Did you sleep with him?
You did?
You slept with him, really?
That's right.
I slept with him.
Oh.
He's my friend.
So what?
How?
How did you sleep with him?
Because I wanted to.
But still.
You barely know anything about him.
Why would you sleep with him?
I can get to know him now that I've slept with him.
Do I have to know him before I sleep with him?
Tell me what happened so that I know what's going on.
You made the first move, didn't you?
Why would I say that?
You have to make the man come to you first.
Was it that day?
The day of the house concert?
It was that day.
Wasn't it?
Hold on.
I forgot a book here.
Hey, Alex.
The wine is really good here.
Do you want to have a glass?
There's a tree.
If I build it facing south, I have to chop down the tree.
Otherwise the form has to be built around the tree.
Oh.
But they don't want the tree chopped down.
An hour later, we were in the hotel together.
But still.
I didn't realize you'd be like this with just anyone.
Who's just anyone?
A man you don't even love.
And that's why I won't sleep with Bae Sung Hyun.
I sleep with men I don't even like.
Are you okay with sleeping men you don't like?
Does that satisfy you?
Yeah.
I'm satisfied in my own way.
I like that man for just that moment.
Sometimes I even end up liking him after.
So I don't sleep with just anyone.
Do you think it's that simple for Alex?
Do I have to be responsible for Alex's feelings?
That's Alex's problem.
Seo Yeon.
He's the kind of guy who falls hard for women.
Last time he broke up with his girlfriend, he threatened to jump off the building.
What is it you want to say?
He doesn't easily give and take his heart.
Are you saying I'm wrong for him?
No, that's not...
Yes, that's what I mean.
Alex is my friend.
It's none of your business.
Just mind your own matters.
Fine.
I'll mind my own matters.
That girl... just you wait and see how complicated things get.
If feelings are that simple, I'll just go and fry my hand with pepper paste.
What the?
Why is that thing here?
He's gone.
It's been over a week since he's come home.
I can't reach him since he turned off his phone.
So what?
It's been over a week.
What do you want me to do about it?
Do you know where he might have gone?
Is there anywhere he may have gone?
Do you think I would tell you if you were me?
Didn't he go to you?
If he had come to me, were you planning to take him?
Everyone's looking for him.
The studio's worried and he's missed a couple of meetings.
That's right he came to me.
He came yesterday and the day before that.
So wait until he comes then take him away.
It's been over a week since he came home.
Where on earth could he have gone?
Look at this mess.
It's a mess unless I clean up after him.
Were you miserable too?
I'm satisfied.
My kicking skills is fucking awesome.
Director, it's Kang Hee.
I'm not doing this because we slept together.
The studio's worried.
Everyone's going crazy looking for you.
I lost.
I said I lost.
I know it was wrong of me to come between the two of you.
I know how you feel now.
If you come back, I won't cling onto you.
I'm a person who keeps my word.
What's so great about being Kim Sung Soo?
In some ways, that girl might be more naive than I thought.
But I'm not that forgiving.
Did you come to protect his car?
You must not have anything better to do.
You're a star.
Aren't you busy?
You should sleep at times like this.
How long was the car here?
How would I know?
Aren't you worried?
You two were a couple after all.
Would you be worried if you were me?
Truth is, I'm hoping someone will break Kim Sung Soo's leg.
He really didn't come here?
He came.
So just wait around.
I never open the door for him, but he's always shouting for me to let him in.
Please take him with you.
He's fucking annoying.
Around what time does he come?
How could a 23 year old like you follow around a man like this?
By the way, why is your boyfriend clinging to me like that?
He slept over last night.
He kept begging to let him in for just one night.
I'm not a noble and pure character in some fairy tale.
And I'm not a character in a melodrama full of those fucking crybabies.
I'm a character in reality.
The sun is so nice today.
I'm just asking this because I'm curious about you two.
Do you guys not have any morals?
He came over last night and asked to sleep with me one last time.
Are sluts like you always like that?
I'm being so cruel and ruthless right now.
No, I'm being evil.
Did he really come over last night?
I said he slept over.
The director's not that low.
In this situation...
He's already low.
Would a man who cheated be noble?
It was my fault.
That's right.
You're just as low as him.
If you know it's your fault, then self-reflect.
If this were a fight, I feel that Yoon Kang Hee just won.
We learn in fairy tales that the kind ones always win.
No one can deny kindness.
Everyone wants to be kind.
This girl wants me to feel bad for her.
Doesn't she want to pee?
So unnatural.
It's a relief that this is reality and not a fairy tale.
Because in reality, the cruel ones survive.
In Young.
I'm sorry for hurting you.
I'm not human.
Oh hell no.
Breaking news.
Director Kim Sung Soo, known for creating a new style of romantic comedy, ended his life at the young age of 33.
Director Kim's scandal with actress Yoon Kang Hee.
led to his unfortunate break-up with his girlfriend of 10 years Miss S.
It seems he was unable to get over the break-up and eventually committed suicide.
Sung Soo was so good to you.
Why couldn't you forgive him?
Are you so great?
Did you never make a mistake?
Do you feel better now?
You should have been good to him.
If you had, this wouldn't have happened.
Fucking skank.
You stupid bitch.
Bring back the director.
Stop crying.
What are we going to do about this?
I don't give a damn.
It's me.
In Young.
Why did you park the car in front of my place?
Hey.
I'm going to have your car towed away.
Why do you have it parked in front of my place?
I can't date because of your car.
I have a guy I want to bring home.
Take your car right now.
Here, here.
Here.
Have some.
I told you it had to be sticky to the touch.
Can't you get the texture right?
Not even a woman with all the seasoning in the world could get it right.
You would never be satisfied.
Nevermind if you don't want it.
Why can't you get it right?
After 50 years, you still don't know your husband's preferences?
Why do you want me to do the cooking?
You should ask the village floozy to do it.
That's all you have to say, right?
30 years of your lecturing.
That was so long ago.
You said she was good at making soo jae bi.
Eat what she makes.
Oh, she won't just cook what you like.
She'll do anything you want.
Aye coochie.
Make it again.
Here.
Have some while you eat.
Thank you.
Don't cheat if you get married.
That's the only way your wife will respect you.
Aye.
Don't get caught.
Just don't.
Why won't you eat?
Seo Yeon won't answer her phone.
I called her yesterday, but she said she was busy and hung up.
What do I do In Young?
Park Seo Yeon you cruel bitch.
I knew this would happen.
Alex, at times like this, you can't cling onto Seo Yeon.
Clingy guys are not cute.
So fresh.
Let's go.
Sure.
Let's go.
Hey, Miss Seo Yeon.
Aren't you taking this?
No, I'm not.
I can't do it alone.
Let's carry it together.
I don't want to.
I came as a model.
Ah, I almost forgot.
You're the type of woman who makes men hold your bags.
Say that again Seo Joon Yi.
Why am I wrong?
I saw a man hold your purse last fall.
The guy with the curly hair and glasses.
He held your bag.
I make men hold my bags during dates, but not during work.
Then why?
I said say it again.
That's your luggage.
You should ask me to help you politely.
Where did you learn to just hang it on a person's arm?
Can't you just help me?
There are 4 arms and a lot to carry.
It's not my stuff, so I don't need to carry it.
I have a lot to carry today, so just help me.
Can you please help me?
I have a lot to carry today.
Can you please help me?
Okay.
You should have asked that way from the beginning.
Let's go forward.
Very good.
A little closer.
Nice.
Do you need to shoot more?
Yes, keep running.
I'm going to adjust the exposure to capture the movement, so keep running.
Ah.
Keep running Seo Yeon.
Seo Yeon, are you tired.
Should we take a break?
No, I'm fine.
Then why do you keep limping?
Are you already tired?
I said I'm not tired.
I said I'm going to run.
It's okay if you splash some water.
So keep running.
Why the pharmacy?
What do you need to buy?
Contraceptive pills.
Why are you so curious?
Next time, make a reservation at a motel so that I can at least take a shower and change.
And do you know how much this dress costs?
It's over a thousand dollars.
If you had told me about the concept sooner, I would have brought a cheaper dress.
Give it to me.
Why didn't you tell me you were hurt?
If I had, you would have called me weak.
You're really hurt.
Do you have to go to a hospital?
If I go to Seoul, I have to get stuff done.
Ah!
Be gentle.
Don't make it personal and be gentle.
How did you get hurt?
A glass shard.
There's broken glass and shells all over the beach.
Didn't you notice?
What are you going to do with your eyes?
I got really mad at you today.
Meanwhile, Kang Hyun Joo played ping pong every night.

Why does he have to sing a song like that?
I really don't like trot music.
If Kim Duk Soo is a toothbrush, he's a useful one.
When you buy something useful, do you care about beauty or form?
Shit.
How does Park Seo Yeon seduce men?
Like this?
Would a man fall for this?
Do you have something to say to me?
There's a nice restaurant around the corner.
Should we sleep together?
Nevermind, nevermind.
I must be tired.
Let's go to eat.
Give me some food.
Yes.
Enjoy your meal.
Do you know the owners?
No.
It's just that they work in the same neighborhood.
People probably think you work here.
Who cares what they think.
It's fine.
Oh.
I bought that book.
I want to read it.
Really?
You should start by reading the two novels.
then you should read 'The Critique of Judgement' last.
I was about to do that anyway.
How could I sleep with such a dirty man?
Do you think he even showers properly?
You should have gone for drinks.
Why did you go eat?
You have a problem Kang Hyun Joo.
Don't tell me it's my problem.
This is totally his problem.
You said you wanted to touch him.
You said you liked his arms.
You said you get excited at the sound of his breathing.
You're finding excuses not to sleep with him because you're scared.
They're not excuses.
I want it too.
A virgin at this age?
I don't want that label.
I want to get rid of it too.
No.
You're scared.
You'll keep holding it off with different excuses.
Drink a little alcohol.
It might help your cause.
He might look better if you're drunk.
No, that'll never work with Kang Hyun Joo.
She'll lay on the bed thinking if there's a praying mantis.
She'll think about the shape of his belly button or be bothered by the smell of his breath.
She'll find enough reasons to stay a virgin.
She'll be one until she's 40.
You think so too, right?
You're determined to be chaste.
She's better than you.
No, Seo Yeon's right.
I think I am like that.
Everyone goes through trial and error in life.
It's true for men too.
You have to make mistakes in order to mature.
Is that why you and Alex...
Did it?
What about Alex?
What?
We had sex.
Why?
How could you so quickly?
How did you do it?
Lee Hyori once said, "Just give me 10 minutes."
I just need to die.
My first time wasn't easy either.
It was my first time after all.
I thought I'd keep loving him and we would get married.
But when I was about to break up with him.
I started to get scared.
What if I meet someone I really love, and he finds out I'm not a virgin?
You were naive back then Park Seo Yeon.
Your second guy was a mama's boy, right?
Baek Young Suk?
Yeah.
After I broke up with my second guy, the world seemed so scary.
I was 21 then.
That's when I realized how many men I would sleep with before I settled down.
That thief was your third, right?
The guy who stole your mother's jewelry in the middle of the night.
Do you remember other women's men?
At least 10.
That's right
Why didn't you repay me your debt?
You slept at my place for 2 months when your mom kicked you out.
You even used my allowance.
That's not important.
After I broke up with my third, my fourth and fifth were nothing.
After that, I don't remember any of them.
They don't mean anything.
Then what does have meaning?
I began to feel comfortable.
How should I put it?
I guess I realized that love doesn't last forever.
No matter how much two people love each other.
Their hearts will change.
Nothing never changes.
I suddenly felt lonely.
Seo Yeon is right.
Nothing never changes.
Because both Kim Sung Soo and I have changed.
So you.
Close your eyes and sleep with a guy who cleans his teeth with tissue paper.
It's better than not cleaning his teeth.
If you think about it.
Don't you think In Young is really lucky?
The first guy she gets, she dates for ten years.
If he didn't make that mistake, they would have gotten married.
Sung Soo's talented, romantic, and a gentlemen.
What more could you want?
The person I envy most is you.
She and Sung Soo are over.
I heard that you cried to Alex about it.
It's over, right?
Really?
Why?
Huh?
Why?
He cheated again, right?
He didn't.
He didn't, okay?
We just fought.
Hey, Kim Sung Soo.
Where on earth...
Where are you?
It's not that I'm worried.
Are you eating well?
Who is it?
Feed me.
Do you have food here?
I left rice here.
The one my father farmed.
What are you doing?
Go wash your hands.
You should wash your hands first.
By the way...
Can I take a shower?
Didn't you eat at all?
How could a body that sinned want to eat?
But still...
If you're done eating, hurry and go.
Sit down.
I have something to say.
You said it was teeth versus bread.
You're teeth, I'm bread.
You never know.
It might be different.
What's that supposed to mean?
How do I know you haven't cheated more?
The same goes for me.
You may have cheated me too.
I really only had my eyes on you.
I was such a fool.
You said you kissed someone while you were with me.
I was unfaithful twice while I was with you.
You're too attentive for me to decieve you.
Twice?
Might as well be 10 times.
If you feel jilted, then you can get even.
I wish you could just forgive me and go back to how things were.
But since you feel ripped off, you can get even.
You can date two people.
Let's resolve it like that.
The first guy can be that colleague who's younger than you.
Find the second guy.
Get it over with quickly, and then let's get married.
Kim Sung Soo.
Were you always this type of person?
Thanks for the meal.
Hello?
Hello?
This is In Young's phone.
Go ahead.
He's a wuss.
Why couldn't he just ask to talk to you?
Tell me.
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?
What didn't I have that she did?
It's because I'm a man.
That's the reason.
Don't be ridiculous, and tell the truth.
What did I ever do to you?
It's not because I didn't like you.
You know how much I loved you.
I never fell out of love.
Then why didn't you think of me in that moment?
You forgot about me in that moment, right?
You didn't think of me.
Was she that amazing?
Let go.
What's wrong with you?
I missed you.
What do you want?
Why are you doing this?
You.
You threw me away.
Why do you want trash?
I'm not going to lose you if I get you back.
I'm serious.
I'm sorry.
Were you with Motorcycle last night?
I'm busy right now.
Get the table right.
Is the ice cream coming?
It should be here soon.
I want to warn you that you're going to get a surprise soon.
I'm busy getting ready for the new Director's arrival.
I'm helping with the venue.
Change this.
In Young, they're looking for you at the front desk.
Tell them I'm coming.
Let's talk later.
Spray this here.
Yes.
So these two are taken care of.
Please take care of this one.
Oh, please wait.
I'm sorry.
Oh sir.
Hello.
Oh Manager, hello.
What are you doing here?
I called you about it.
Huh?
Why won't you leave me alone?
We'll talk later.
We are hoping to create a better service for our clients.
This is not a fairy tale.
This is not even a drama.
Is this real life?
Yes.
This must be a dream.
This can't be happening.
This has to be a dream.
Ahhh.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

Sexy hotty inauguration ceremony on behalf of staff members.
No fatty or blacky allow.
In life, you will inevitably have moments you regret.
If I knew this was going to happen.
Hurry up and go get the ddukbokgi.
(spicy ricecakes)
Wow.
I shouldn't have sent him on a ddukbokgi errand.
Is there any way we can get more alcohol?
Room service is so expensive.
President Kim in Room 4001 and that German maestro in Room 7023.
Can't you tell them you're sending drinks to their room, but then bring it here?
I can't do that, I'll have to bill you.
Take your hands out of your pockets.
I really shouldn't have done that.
I shouldn't have done it.
I'm going to the meeting.
♪ Fart #3
O_O
O_O
How dare you farted in front of a woman?
What?
You just farted.
You're the one who...
It was you.
Don't blame me.
Who else is in this room?
Wow, really.
I really shouldn't have farted.
I even kicked him.
Hurry up.
Most women would ask if I was interested in them.
But since you're a strange woman, I'll just say I loved you.
Ah.
I can't believe it.
I even hit his head.
The kiss.
The kiss.
What do I do?
I definitely shouldn't have kissed him.
Ah.
I shouldn't have dated him.
Oh, my little precious.
Seriously.
That's dirty.
I really shouldn't have dated him.
Why did I do it?
Why?
Come into my room.
What do I do?
I said come to my room.
Fifth floor, Room 2.
Don't you play tennis during lunch anymore?
Come to the park next to the parking lot.
So we can look like we ran into each other.
Otherwise, my feelings will get hurt.
You know I'm a busy person.
Miss Sunwoo In Young.
Yes, Director.
Stop by my room when you're leaving for work tomorrow.
Yes.
I can't avoid him anymore.
That's right.
You only live once.
Let's live life to the fullest.
Come in.
You're here.
You didn't have breakfast, right?
Sit down.
Yes, sir.
By the way, sir.
You.
I understand you're surprised.
But why won't you answer your phone?
Sir, please consider the situation and listen carefully to what I have to say.
Eat while you talk.
Yes, so the thing is.
Before you became the director.
When I said we should go out.
I only said that when Motorcycle and I...
Yes?
Well, I think we can talk about that later.
Yes, I'll do that.
Please sit down and have breakfast.
Yes.
Yes, Director.
I'm at home right now.
How could you already be home?
I know what your schedule is.
Are you avoiding me right now?
I told you I would get upset if you do this.
Let's talk in person.
Where are you?
Oh.
I'm at...
I know where you are.
Keep walking.
But I'm at home right now.
I just saw you.
Don't turn around and keep going.
Make sure none of the workers are watching and be natural.
Stop by the crosswalk.
I'm going to stop by at the red light, so get in quick, okay?
Answer me if you're listening.
Okay, I get it.
No one saw, right?
Awesome timing.
Let's go.
How long has it been?
I missed you so much.
Where should we go?
Where do you want to go?
I worked really hard to make time today.
I only slept for 2 hours last night.
Aren't you moved?
What's with that expression?
Can't you at least pretend to smile?
Eh?
So you never liked me.
You just met me because you were bored.
Wow.
You're an amazing woman.
You've made a fool of me.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Then keep it up.
I'll let you make a fool of me.
I would rather not do that, Director.
Why not?
Because I'm the owner?
Because I'm your boss?
Yes.
I'm not a hotelier for fun.
Are you going to keep speaking formally?
Yes.
Why?
Fine.
Just don't say no.
Since we ate, come and have a drink with me.
No, but.
I said not to say no.
But how could you?
You can't even drink.
I'm going to fix that.
Follow me.
Why isn't he calling?
He was definitely headed towards my hotel.
Wasn't he coming to see me?
Hehehe.
It's possible he was going to see Yoon Kang Hee.
That's not possible.
Then he's not even human.
Aren't you coming?
Yes.
You two fought.
You didn't break up with Motorcycle?
We didn't break up.
Whatever.
The point is he hurt you.
Why can't it be me?
I'm not the only one who played around.
You were just playing with me too.
There's no grief, no fires, no passion.
That's not love.
That's playing around.
Does it have to be hot and painful to be love?
Of course.
What else could it be?
I was in loved once too.
I know that pain isn't love.
Love is enduring the pain.
Love is going on even though things don't go my way.
So what?
Are you saying you're going to endure the pain?
It's not that I'm enduring the pain.
I'm protecting what's precious.
It hurts, but it's still precious.
So I don't want to lose it.
Even if it hurts.
I'm staying true to my heart.
I was hurt once.
The pain was deep.
Can't you say something to encourage me?
You're going to make me drink.
I really can't drink.
My body is very fragile so it can't handle alcohol.
I faint after one shot and I die after two.
I'm going to take two shots and just die in front of you.
Motorcycle
Oh, it's me.
Where am I?
Do I have to tell you all that?
I'm in Hongdae right now.
What's up?
Hurry up, I'm busy.
What about my place?
Where did you put the DVD I bought in America?
You know those pornos that weren't released in the country.
Did I put them in the study?
I'm not sure.
I may have misplaced them while I was cleaning.
Hang up.
Something happened.
Sung Hyun.
Bae Sung Hyun.
What's wrong with you?
Hey.
Did you faint?
Hey, Bae Sung Hyun.
Bae Sung Hyun.
This is crazy.
Hey, it's me.
Well, it's nothing really.
Who cares if he gets home?
Just leave him there.
Why would you call an ambulance?
Is he faking?
Why would he be faking?
For the first time ever, Kim Sung Soo is jealous.
Oh no.
I think I'll have to bring him to our home.
Over here please.
Is he really passed out?
Just help me out.
Hey, you.
Are you really sleeping?
Hey, you.
Mr. Bae.
Mr. Bae.
Don't call him that.
Hey lightweight.
Aren't you going to wake up?
Let's hurry up and take him inside.
Is he homeless?
Why should we bring him inside?
Shut the fuck up and move.
Driver, please help us.
Fine.
Sir, please be careful.
Sir.
Bring him this way.
Bring him this way.
We can't bring him to the bed, okay?
Just come this way.
I said not the bed.
Sir, how much?
That'll be 30 dollars.
Thank you.
Please call again.
Okay.
I was in this bed masturbating just a moment before.
So what?
You should call his home.
Doesn't he have a family?
There's a situation.
Strip him naked.
Why should I?
Fine.
I'll rape him myself.
Where do you think you're touching?
Undress him so he's comfortable.
Geez.
I hope Sung Soo feels pain.
I hope he cries, hurts and breaks down because of me.
What are you doing right now?
Can't you tell?
I'm unfolding a blanket.
Go.
Just go.
I'll find your DVDs, so just go.
Why would I go?
I can't go.
I'm going to keep my eye on that prick.
Seems like you two didn't have sex, but if you do, make sure he's sober.
Get up.
Get out.
What's wrong with you?
Just because I did something wrong doesn't mean you should do the same.
You said I should sleep with him.
I'm going to sleep with him tonight.
So don't interrupt and just go.
Whatever, whatever.
No.
I'll never leave you two alone.
Of course, he's too worried to leave.
How could he leave the two of us alone?
I'm leaving.
They were in the drawer.
Good night.
Hey you guys, get on IM.
We have an urgent situation.
I had to tell my friends what happened.
How could he have left?
How could he leave the two of us alone?
I don't understand it.
I thought Kim Sung Soo said you could sleep with two men.
So he meant it?
Men are a lot simpler than you think.
Just think of Kim Sung Soo's actions.
If that's what he said, that's what he meant.
No, it's not that simple.
You said he was jealous.
That's right.
He freaked out when I brought Sung Hyun home and put him on my bed.
But then he remembered what he did.
He must have a conscience.
He didn't like himself for being jealous that you got a man.
No.
While you were drinking water, something must have happened.
What on earth could have happened?
I'm telling you this as a prosecutor, but go back to the scene of the incident.
You'll probably find something.
There was nothing at the scene of the incident.
I think he really left for the two of us to sleep together.
Huh?
What the?
Why is his body so good?
Huh?
Why is it so hard?
You're wearing a t-shirt I bought you after cheating on me?
Take it off, take it off right now.
I bought you too many things.
Despite your gimmicks.
In Young won't fall for you.
All your efforts are in vain.
Good night, lightweight.
An hour later, a guest arrived at Hyun Joo's.
I hung the shelf.
Do you want to see it?
Thanks, Duk Soo.
You should wash your hands first.
Okay.
Not this, bring a black skirt from the closet.
Sure.
Tonight, I'm going to try the vulgar effect that In Young talked about.
How much do you think we'll need to drink?
Your table setting is all wrong.
You should be sitting right next to each other.
And you don't drink.
You make Duk Soo drink.
Music is also important.
Play some jazz and dim the lights.
I was about to play some music.
It's the World Ping-Pong Championships today.
Oh, it's on.
He shouldn't do that.
How could he let go of the ball?
Nice form.
Okay, smash it.
Smash it.
God.
Why did he do a drive?
He's always like that.
Try to make physically contact naturally.
Duk Soo.
Have a drink.
Look closely at the footwork.
The feet need to follow the ball.
Oh, yes.
The drink.
Put your drink here.
After you put some lemon on your hand.
Put on some salt.
You take a shot.
Then you put a lemon wedge in your mouth.
Yes.
Now that you know what to do, give it a try.
But, Hyun Joo.
Your face is red.
Hyun Joo.
I'm sorry, Hyun Joo.
It's just that your lemon wedge is in my mouth.
Then will you give it back to me?
Are you okay?
Should we stop here?
Close your eyes.
This is my cheek.
This is my nose.
My ear.
Eyes.
Eyebrows.
Lips.
Shoulder.
Can I get to know you now?
Oh my god, fuck yes.
In that room, there was nothing that Hyun Joo had ever dreamed of.
It wasn't the best hotel room.
No lilies.
There was no music or lavender.
But he was gentle and considerate.
It wasn't bad.
Hyun Joo felt she was loved.
While they're fucking in that room.
The morning arrived.
Why don't you say something, Director?
I'm so sorry, I don't remember anything.
How did I get here?
Just think that I gave you piggyback ride.
You're indebted to me but don't try to give me a piggyback ride in return.
You're a really strange woman.
Most women who speak formally appear retarded.
But your formality makes me feel bad.
How did you become like this?
Anyway, I think it's best if you don't drink from now on.
I don't like this is how I came into your house.
But why don't we continue our conversation from last night?
You're avoiding me because I'm the director of your hotel?
You said it was your dream to be General Manager?
It's a pretty absurd dream.
Don't most women like these situations?
Can't you think simply like most women?
No.
I must not be like most women.
I'm a bit upset.
Do you work better than me?
All you've done is work under me for a year.
I've been at this hotel for over 8 years.
You know the slippers I wear with my uniform?
I'll show them to you at the hotel.
I have to change soles twice a month from running around so much.
I work that hard but I'm still your subordinate.
Where are we going?
Follow me.
Oh.
Wear some comfortable shoes from now on.
This isn't what I meant.
I know what you meant.
I thought you would be upset.
Not just you but all the hotel employees.
You all work so hard to get ahead.
It must seem I was handed everything on a silver platter.
But I'm not a total floozy.
I studied all I could and I was your apprentice too.
And your dream of becoming General Manager.
I think it's honorable.
You have every right to go after that dream.
You're a hardworking employee.
These shoes are to thank you for working so hard for our hotel.
Try standing up.
How is it?
Do you think you can run around?
So you bought these to make me work more?
Think of it as an investment for the future of an employee?
Okay.
I'll accept it as an investment in my talents.
Oh, and your boyfriend is the owner of the hotel you work at.
This is something to celebrate.
Think of it simply.
There's truth in simplicity.
So what?
Are you going to buy me a car?
If I do, will you like me more?
Heck yeah.
Besides, if we work together, we can see each other more often.
It's like being together all day and dating all day.
That's how I feel.
Don't you?
Here we are.
Careful.
Thanks, I'll wear it well.
Rest well.
Haven't you forgotten something?
What?
Kiss me right here.
Hurry.
Now go.
I just demanded that.
Now you should offer.
You're an aggressive woman.
Here.
Do it however you like.
I said do whatever you want.
How does love start?
Is it okay if it begins as hesitantly as this?
Hey, I gave you such freedom.
Was that the best you could do?
Okay.
I'll accept this for today.
Not all love begins as if it's meant to be.
Do it however you like.
I said do whatever you want.
It's possible that there are relationships that start off hesitantly.
What is this?
Walking shoes.
You need new shoes.
They say these are nice, so wear them when you run.
Thank you.
In some ways, this might be a better love than one filled with resentment and hate.
Hyun Joo's morning began much later than mine.
Coco, you know what happened to me right?
I finally got to know what a man is.
It's not a big deal, right?
Can I haz food?
All you have to do is remember one thing.
Only an eternal virgin at heart.
You show them your body but never your heart.
Why?
Don't you just tell them?
I did when I was an amateur pornstar.
I didn't want to lie to them.
But?
I realized it only hurt the guy's feelings.
I'm a real woman.
But Duk Soo just left?
I thought he left.
You're awake.
Did you get some sleep?
You're here.
Breakfast and lunch.
Sit down.
I looked through your fridge because I wanted to make you breakfast.
But you didn't have much.
I bought this from the best café in the area, so enjoy.
And this is a sandwich.
Nothing fancy, but it's good.
Thank you.
You should have some too.
Feed me bitch.
You should have some too.
You should have some too.
Let me feed Coco first.
Coco.
Yay.
He was so nice, I felt bad.
You're not going to see him again?
But he's a good person.
I know, that's why my feelings are complicated.
How about you just date him until the next guy shows up?
Do you have to date a strange man?
You spend time like friends or lovers until the next man comes along.
Like you and Alex?
Not me.
Alex is still a strange man to me.
Whatever.
Duk Soo's a good person.
So I don't think I can do that to him.
Sure, maybe you should go out with him seriously.
But he's fucking stupid.
Love is about action.
It's not about thinking, it's action.
You're thinking of him as inventory.
The important thing is the man, not what he has.
I'm not judging him.
I don't care about his family status or education.
Same difference.
That's right.
How is there no difference?
You're too cunning.
Just say he doesn't meet your standards.
Just like every other man out there.
That's right.
Saying he's too stupid for you is saying he doesn't meet your standards.
But every relationship starts with standards.
And you look at their bodies.
Isn't that your standard?
True.
It is a problem to look at bodies.
But the difference between her and me.
Is that I acknowledge this fact honestly.
Being too honest can be a problem.
That's right.
You have problems too.
Yeah.
I know I have some serious problems.
But you don't even realize your problems.
Joon Hee, it's me.
Okay.
What was that?
You're dating Seo Joon Hee?
No, it's work.
Later bitches.
That fat slut.
Mmmm.
It's good.
Did you really make it yourself?
I learned to cook from cookbooks since I've been living away from family for 10 years.
I don't like eating alone.
Are you a good cook?
I don't cook because I think it's a waste of time.
How's your foot?
I thought it would get better, but I had to go to the hospital again.
Didn't you see I wore sneakers today?
Your clothes are more casual too.
I've never seen you dressed like that.
You usually wear some fuck up shit.
I'm going to change there anyway.
And you'll probably make me do manual labor.
Nice work.
You'll have to carry a bed.
Ah.
This is too much.
Just because you made some kimbap.
Let's just begin the shoot.
If we got a little further, there's a really nice spot.
We have to get there.
You said it was twice a month.
Gay.
I saved you during the exhibition.
Ugh.
Ah.
Oh, Seo Yeon.
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
Don't come here.
I'm fine.
Ah.
Wae.
Getting wet makes my nipples perky.
Haha.
Can we still take the pictures?
All I have to do is change.
Don't worry about the pictures.
We came here to take pictures and now it looks like we can't.
Ah.
Seo Yeon.
Doesn't your arm hurt?
Where?
Ugh.
It's bleeding.
I have to film a commercial tomorrow.
Now you're worried about the commercial.
What's wrong with you?
It's look infected.
Doesn't it hurt?
It hurts.
But there's no medicine.
But at least the bed didn't get wet.
Why are you so tough?
That's right.
I'm strong.
Let's go back.
We can't shoot anyway.
Here.
Hold this side.
Don't you want to go the hospital?
I know I should go to the hospital and get tested but nobody dies from fucking me.
I can treat this at home.
I read it in a book once.
It's about a writer-photographer.
He went to Africa for a shoot.
There were two brothers who were starving.
The younger brother was starving.
But the older brother looked after him dutifully.
Years later, the photographer returned to Africa to see how the brothers were doing.
One of them died.
Which one do you think did?
I don't know, all I hear is blah blah blah and look at those sexy lips.
One of them died.
The one who tries to be stronger always dies first.
I'm sure that's true because we never get pity.
But I don't want sympathy.
Are you saying I should act weak and complain to get sympathy?
I like being strong and secure.
You're an admirable woman.
I know.
You're still not my style.
How can you just leave?
It's embarrassing.
Do you do that to all men?
Do they all fall for your kisses?
I'm different.
I don't like women like you.
It's not that you don't like me.
It's just that you can't handle me.
Nevermind if you don't want me.
That's right, I don't want you.
Hey, you can't leave without me.
Hey.
Hey.
Stop.
Hey.
Aw.
Joon Hee.
Are you playing with me right now?
You're the one who's playing with me.
Don't do something like that again.
If you do, I'll really leave you alone.
Fine.
I won't do it again.
Wow.
Ridiculous.
So annoying.
This is the first time I've been rejected like this.
Look here.
You say things like that when you're alone.
So annoying.
It's annoying me to death.
Did you take care of the restaurant?
Yes.
I stopped by the front desk.
Oh.
Motorcycle stopped by after you left yesterday.
Oh, that's right.
He came to the hotel, right?
He said he's going to film the hotel for a movie.
Did you know about this?
Why does it have to be our hotel?
I decided on this hotel the moment I got the script.
If I had known, I would have contacted our PR department and prevented it.
Do you know whose room that is?
It's our Hotel Director's room.
The lightweight's room.
Bae Sung Hyun is a descendant of our hotel president.
Be careful how you talk to him.
Why should I be careful?
What's your hotel director got to do with me?
He has a lot to do with you.
You're going to be shooting here.
Our hotel's giving this room to you for free.
Have a nice day, sir.
You.
Do you really have feelings for him?
Yes, I do.
I feel as if I'm Cinde-fucking-rella.
And my ex-boyfriend is conveniently out of the picture.
This is totally a gift.
Do you like money that much?
Well, money doesn't hurt.
I lived with a bum for 10 years.
I said I was going to do it.
I did everything you asked when I got money.
I took you everywhere you wanted to go.
I really had no idea you liked money so much.
Don't be easy on him.
Be expensive.
What are you saying?
Men don't like women who are easy.
You're a bit easy.
You were like that on our first night.
You might as well have seduced me.
At that time, what could a man.
And are you so easy that you couldn't hold it for a minute?
You're driving me crazy.
A minute?
What do you mean?
It was longer than a minute.
It was probably 30 seconds.
30 seconds?
Oh really.
Geez, even if it's been 10 years.
Even if you sleep with him, make sure you use protection.
I know I was wrong to cheat on you twice.
But you can't get pregnant.
I'll never raise his kid.
You're so ridiculous.
I'm saying this out of concern.
Since when did you have to worry about contraception?
You lose your senses just because of one kiss.
Hey, Kim Sung Soo.
But do you think he can make you lose your mind?
He's too young.
At least he'll last longer than a minute.
I said that's not true.
Are you jealous right now?
Yeah.
I think I am.
I know I've done something wrong.
My heart really hurts right now.
It's a good reward.
You should be hurt, just as I was hurt.
That's my wish.
Can I tell you my wish?
Why not?
I hope he's lousy in bed.
I hope he hurts you even more.
How's it going to help you if I get hurt?
That way.
You'll come back to me.
Oh hell no.
I'm afraid he's too perfect for that to happen.

If you're going to live like that, don't even think about coming home.
Is that just your house?
I don't have anywhere to go besides that house!
You do, Joo Yeol Mae.
Let's go.
We should eat breakfast.
I don't know what you eat for breakfast.
This is what I eat for breakfast.
Here.
Would Yoon Seok Hyun still be out there?
I'm going to live however I want.
I'm going to date a man, when I want to or when I don't want to.
I'm going to kiss and sleep with a man if I want to.
What's wrong with that?
Should I just get out of here?
All I'm thinking of now is him.
You can do that.
I don't want to control what you're thinking.
He probably misunderstood.
Why don't we stop talking about him?
You will regret this when you fall in love with me.
- Are you sure about that?
- 100% sure.
Where can you buy that confidence?
I'd like to buy some too.
If you open your mind, you will find out that I'm a decent guy.
I'm asking you very seriously.
Why do you like me?
Since when did you like me?
I don't know when it started.
Do you think love can begin from a start line and people just start to love each other?
You don't know me well.
You have a short temper, blow hot and cold, and are too honest.
You don't look that smart but you think you're very smart.
You're very forgetful as if you have Alzheimers.
And...
Is there anything else that I don't know about you?
Fine.
This is why I got dumped so I lost my dignity.
Why do you like this kind of woman?
Most love starts without a reason.
Even if they fall in love with somebody for so many reasons, many of them can't tell the reasons.
I like you without reasons.
It just happened.
I'm thinking of Seok Hyun again.
I'm so happy.
What about you?
I'm happy.
I'm so happy.
What about you?
Do I have to say that?
Please say it.
- If you say it out loud, you feel better?
- Yeah, my feelings grow.
Listen.
We haven't seen each other for a week because of your work.
But when we met, you didn't tell me you missed me.
I hugged you and told you I missed you and love you.
You didn't tell me anything.
Why do you not express your feelings?
I like when I don't say stuff like that.
I like to keep my feeling in my mind.
I like that better.
Why do you like that?
If I don't say it out loud, I think my feelings grow more inside my mind.
You're just not being honest.
That's an excuse.
But Shin Ji Hoon is too honest.
Fine.
I don't hate you.
I can't say I'm not interested in you.
And I kind of want believe that you like me.
No.
I wish I liked you too.
I'd be happier to love somebody that loves me back, not someone that hates me.
So?
But Shin Ji Hoon, he and I might not be over yet.
What does that mean?
When we broke up, it's not like we didn't date anyone.
He dated a different woman and I dated a different man.
I like this book.
Haven't you read this?
- Have you?
- Yeah.
I didn't like the beginning but..
it gets better.
This book isn't translated well.
This book is better.
You should check a publisher before you buy it.
We just broke up.
How come you're dating another girl already?
- Then what about you?
- What do you think of him?
Isn't he great?
He looks inflexible.
She looks so stupid.
- Isn't this book good?
- Yeah, it is.
He looks decent.
You must be so happy that your girlfriend has a perfect body figure.
I'm sorry but can you go save a seat for us first?
What are you?
Do you want to die?
Why did you make her cry?
Stop crying and tell me.
What did he say to make you cry?
No!
I cried because of the movie we watched earlier.
I'm sorry.
Who is he?
Do you know him?
Don't worry.
He's just someone I know.
He's kind of crazy.
Who wrote that scenario?
I wrote it.
That's why I was your fan.
What about me now?
Not as a writer, as a man.
I look more sexy as a man, don't I?
Of course.
You're a snob.
So cheesy.
Did you have to come to the restaurant where we used go together?
What about you?
Don't go to motels where we used to go together, okay?
You don't go.
I'm getting this one.
Did you decide yet?
Is that one delicious?
I usually hate this dish but this is so delicious because I'm eating it with you.
Are you ready to order?
You...!
I see.
Even after all that, I dated him again.
Why are you telling me this?
I don't want you to get your hopes up.
I don't want you get hurt.
Why did you break up with ones you dated then?
Every date I went on was just a copy of what I did with him.
But the problem is, it stopped when it was about to be the same.
When I think he's the right guy, my heart stops beating.
So I just end up thinking that I should go back to him.
You didn't forget that we need to do a big clean-up today, did you?
I don't know what you're doing with that guy but you'd better get home in 10 minutes.
I think the relationship between you and him is expired.
Yeah, I think so too.
I think we're really over.
You said you don't want me get my hopes up, right?
Yeah, right.
I'm not 20.
What if I realize you're not the right guy after I accept your mind?
You and I both will suffer eventually.
You can be on any side you want.
You can come and go if you want to.
I don't care if it gets worse.
I don't care if you play with my feelings.
There's no right or wrong for being in a relationship.
If you want to judge if something's right or wrong, you should go save the world.
You told me earlier that you don't hate me.
You said you're interested in me.
Then you can start from there.
If you think you have to go back to him, you can do that.
Of course, you won't go back to him.
Because you will fall in love with me.
Are you not going to come, Joo Yeol Mae?
I should go.
Okay.
I'll give you ride home.
You can stop the car here.
- Thank you.
- I'll call you.
You're going to answer my calls, right?
Go now.
Don't forget to have breakfast.
You barely ate.
Bye.
There are two types of women in the world.
The one who looks back when she leaves, and the one who doesn't.
Shoot.
She doesn't even look back.
Joo Yeol Mae.
Yoon Seok Hyun.
Yoon Seok Hyun.
It's going to be tough.
I'm the one who looks back.
If you came, clean the house.
What are you looking at?
What should I do?
If you don't pay your employees, then the prosecution will be involved.
The prosecution?
Oh my God.
Do I have to go to court again?
If we can negotiate with our employees, it will be fine.
So how much is it that I owe them?
Here.
- Are you okay, Jung Min?
- What?
I mean your paycheck.
I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.
I'm going to a leather factory now.
They also don't believe us.
They told me to bring money in cash.
Let's figure things out with the leather factory first.
I'll be back.
Hug me before you go.
I'm getting so vulnerable.
It's okay.
It happens.
Okay.
I'm okay now.
Jae Kyung, I know you're facing a difficult situation.
- But you're not unhappy, are you?
- No, I'm not unhappy.
I have you.
All right.
- I'll be back.
- Okay.
Jae Kyung was the one who would never look back.
But what she's going through isn't easy to solve.
The moment has come where she has to look back.
Hello.
Lee Jang Woo, tell me the password for the house.
I should move my stuff out.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- I don't need that.
- Okay.
You even changed the password for the safe?
Why do you need to open it?
Your stuff isn't in there.
I should take back the wedding gifts that I gave you.
Don't you think so?
Are you crazy?
Bring back the wedding gift that I gave you first.
Your gifts?
I already sold them.
Yeah.
And you used that money for your business.
Who said I did that?
I didn't say that.
I used that money to support you.
When did you support me?
If you touch my safe...
If I touch it, are you going to tell the press?
Ah, are you going report it to the police?
You're cute when you threaten me.
I'm sorry but I'm not afraid of anything now.
Do you think I'd be scared of the police, press, or law?
I'm not scared of people because I'm an official bitch in Korea now.
- Don't you think so?
- You...!
I'm taking the safe anyway.
Bye.
Hey!
Hey!
Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Please move this safe too.
Dude.
Is this how you clean your house?
- Do it right!
- Don't you see what I'm doing?
Look at this.
What's this?
Huh?
What's Kang Na Hyun doing?
Is she doing nothing?
She's hanging the laundry.
Here, here, here, here, here.
Wipe it well!
It's all your hand prints.
After this, go bring the household accounts.
Why?
We haven't checked that in a year.
Go bring it to my room.
I'm glad that I broke up with him.
Why did I like him?
Your life will get better now, Joo Yeol Mae.
Is there anything you want to have?
I'll buy you one on the way.
- Umm...a stone.
- What?
A stone?
A stone never changes.
Everything else fades away or disappears.
So a stone.
All right.
I'll get you one.
Are you not going to care about your household account?
You didn't even put a receipt!
Look at this.
You didn't take care of this after you came back from the cruise.
Let's be humane while we talk.
Do you think I can care about that now?
- Why not?
- I got dumped by a man.
Would you want to punch numbers in a calculator?
Did I not break up with a woman?
It's a different situation.
You're the dumper and I'm the dumpee.
Do you think my heart doesn't bleed?
Does your heart bleed?
Really?
I'm so impressed.
Dude, you know what you saw this morning?
You didn't even care when you saw me leaving a different man's house.
You cleaned the house and now you're checking the accounts.
Is your heart bleeding?
Go bring your bankbook.
I'm not going to!
I'm not going to do what you tell me to.
You want me to be like a servant, don't you?
I'm sorry that I'm not an obedient and nice girl.
I don't expect you to be obedient.
I just wish you can at least respect me.
Did you respect my feelings?
You trampled on my feelings and you expect me to be nice to you?
I really hope you can live happily ever after with an obedient and nice girl.
Yeah, I will.
I hate you because you are not that kind of woman.
You never try to understand me and never make me feel comfortable when I'm with you.
Ah, I get what you're saying.
So you want to meet a young woman who dies if you want her to die and talks behind your back?
I think you can be very happy with that woman.
I want to meet a quiet woman at least.
You talk too much.
Oh, really?
Be careful when you kiss her, there might be maggots in her mouth.
Don't worry about it.
They're maggots that come from someone I love.
I can bear with that.
Sure!
Chew it well, you bastard.
Why am I bad?
I'm just going where my heart leads.
Why am I bad?
If somebody hurts my feelings, he's a bastard.
That's my standard.
That's so your standard.
Don't think emotionally.
Think rationally.
You should love a man emotionally but judge the situation rationally.
You're very rational!
Think rationally.
Where can you meet a woman like me?
I'm honest, capable, and have sense.
And even if I'm 33, I'm still pretty.
This kind of woman is very rare.
Yeah, just think that you're the best woman in the world and live happily ever after.
And I'm going to live happily ever after with an obedient, innocent and young woman who can assist me.
- Are we cool now?
- Who can assist you well?
Who's obedient, innocent and young?
Kang Na Hyun?
Kang Na Hyun?
Huh?
We can have sex only once in a week.
It's going to be in my room on 1st and 3rd week.
And in your room on 2nd and 4th week.
That's not going to work out.
Let's just do it when we both want to do it.
Okay.
Don't you think there should be a code when you don't want to?
Let's not get offended even if we get rejected.
Wouldn't the relationship be better if we respect it?
No more than once a week.
What are you talking about?
We should do it when we want even if it's 10 times.
I know it's impossible.
Stop being a jerk.
Do you want to see if it's impossible or not?
- You should use protection.
- When did I not do that?
I used it every time.
Did I make a mistake when we did it?
You should put some effort to find a way to entertain me.
You should put some effort into it.
You don't do anything.
You think you're that good?
Tell me if you need something more.
I don't feel anything when you kiss on my knees.
How can you moan when you don't feel anything?
Kang Na Hyun can't date you!
Ever.
Never!
I told you if you date her, I'm going to kill both of you.
You're so childish.
I mean it!
If you date her, I'm going to think you broke up with me because of her.
Where's your bankbook?
The bankbook!
I don't know.
Go check in my room.
What about kissing?
- I don't care if you don't.
- I'm going to.
Because I like to kiss you.
Damn it.
Why am I so immature?
Fine!
You guys can be together.
What are you doing?
The things you just threw out are my stones, right?
Explain why you did that.
- Hey, your bankbook...
- What about it?
- Did you find it?
- Yeah, you...
Don't try to avoid me.
You just threw my stones outside!
What is she talking about?
I just saw a very interesting thing.
Dude, let's not do that.
She threw the stones you bought for me into the yard.
Did you really?
Don't you know I'm mean and childish?
I should know the reason.
Why did you do that?
Why are you asking her that?
You know she's weird.
You're a freak in many ways.
What are you doing?
Go find it!
Why did you touch something that doesn't belong to you?
Where are they?
Damn it!
- What's wrong with my life?
- Do you want some ice cream?
I look pathetic, don't I?
I know I'm pathetic.
I don't know why I'm like this.
Why did I throw the stones out?
Your mind is there to hide things you don't want to say out loud.
From now on, just keep them in your mind.
Don't speak your mind.
Yeah, why can't I do that though?
That's your mind too.
Don't do it.
Don't touch mine.
After the relationship ends, you know who loved who more.
A person who can laugh first is the one who loved less than the other.
Because I know this fact, I smiled first.
Are you happy now?
I'm sorry.
I won't touch your belongings anymore.
I want to ask you something.
Whatever you think, it's over.
We should throw a welcoming party for him.
Can you do it tonight?
You don't have plans tonight, right?
I do.
She couldn't reject him again?
She's driving me nuts.
Tell me the truth.
The guy I was on the phone with last time didn't really sleep...with you, did he?
- Why do you thing he didn't?
- You think I'm stupid?
A innocent woman like you would never two-time me.
I am two-timing.
I'm still dating him.
He and I are enjoying our sex life.
- S..sex life?
- How could a woman use that word?
You said more harsh things to me!
I did that to better our relationship.
Let's end this relationship.
I can't stand it anymore.
- These are breakup gifts.
- Do you have to go this far?
Yeah.
Good bye, Kang Ho Joon.
I had very hard times with you pretending to have fun in bed.
I picked out the best ones.
So study hard.
Okay?
Study?
What the?
Are you a stalker?
Why did you follow me and eavesdrop on my private life?
I followed you because I'm worried about you.
Can I not do that?
And why didn't you break up with him earlier when you can clearly do it?
Are you interested in me?
I'm not interested in you.
I'm just worried.
You're worried about me because you're interested in me.
You waited for me to break up so you can date me?
Are you crazy?
You're a stone!
A huge stone.
I'm sorry, Ji Hee.
It's not that I believe what he said.
I have sexual fantasies as a man.
Do you know how hot I am?
- Ah, really?
- Do you want me to prove it to you?
I believe you're very hot.
- But I don't want to see it.
- I don't want to show you that either!
He's very nosy.
I think he can even save the world.
Yeol Mae, I thought I really liked Ho Joon.
But I feel so much better after I broke up with him.
- What's wrong with me?
- You didn't like him much.
That's why.
I'm jealous that you had a very simple relationship.
Wait.
It's Jae Kyung's call.
She asked me if you're on the phone with Ji Hee.
Why?
A meeting?
At where?
It's easy to wear any shoes.
But not easy to get attention without wearing a brand name product.
Why are we listening to this?
I don't know.
How would I know?
Do you know?
How would I know things you guys don't even know?
It's very popular because it's very classy.
What do you think?
Don't you want to do it?
- Do what?
- Invest in our business.
The only problem is money.
You guys know our shoes are great.
Wait, Jung Min.
I'm not interested in business.
- Me neither.
- Me neither.
I'm not telling you lend me money.
I'm telling you to invest.
We don't know what invest means exactly.
Can't you just invest money in this without knowing that?
You guys know my situation, right?
I'm an adulterer.
I'm an official bitch in Korea.
That's something you can brag about.
Who would invest in my business?
You three know how we tried so hard to manage this business.
Is it okay if it's not a big amount?
Are you going to do it?
- It can be a lot if I can get bonus.
- How much do you need?
Don't look at me.
That's not going to change my mind.
Let's say I get old and sick.
You can be taken care of because you have families.
But without my money, I just have to get sick and die.
I can't even get treatment.
I don't have family.
Do you think I'm going to let you die alone?
Shut up!
You dumped me because you hate me.
Is money more important to you than me?
If you're sick, I can even give you my liver.
Really?
Are you really giving me your liver?
Are you giving your money using her liver?
No, it's not that.
But she said she would.
Stupid, how can you take her liver when your blood types aren't the same?
Just invest.
It's not like you don't have money.
How much do you have?
I don't know.
It's these two.
I sang songs on the street when I was a college freshman to make money.
Can't you give me some time to think?
What the..?
Why do you have so much?
You send some money to your family but I use my money for only myself.
And there is some that I got from Mom.
Are you giving her all of this?
Then should I just give half of it even if I told her that I'd invest?
Maybe I should just give half.
I know you're going to give her all of it.
Don't be cranky.
Yeah, just invest it all.
I saved up for my marriage but now I don't need it.
- Yoon Seok Hyun.
- What?
If I need someone's liver, instead of Jae Kyung, you should give me yours.
We have the same blood type.
Sure.
I'll give you everything I can.
Hey.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Hey, Kang Na Hyun.
Dude.
Just because Yoon Seok Hyun likes her, I hate her.
Yoon Seok Hyun.
Come to my room.
- Why?
- Take your co-author out of my room.
Does she really sleep walk?
What is she doing here?
Na Hyun.
Na Hyun.
I tried to wake her up but she didn't.
- What are you doing now?
- You told me take her out.
Na Hyun, let's go to your room.
I'm not ready to see him doing that to her yet.
If you date Kang Na Hyun, I'm going to kill you both and serve a life sentence.
Why can't I date her?
You and I had a sex because we wanted to and broke up because we wanted to.
I can date anyone I want to.
It's legally, morally, ethically right.
Don't you think so?
Most loves start without a reason.
Even if they fall in love with somebody because of so many reasons, many of them can't explain the reasons.
I like you without reasons.
It just happened.
Can't you lean on me when you're having a hard time?
Can't you cry?
Please consider me too.
I hate myself who can't even say I'm jealous.
I like you, Yoon Seok Hyun.
I'm being indecisive for the first time in my life.
Why?
Because I don't want to make a mistake.
I'm worried that your feelings will get hurt!
I don't want that to happen!
Everyone's a stranger to you, right?
I'm a stranger to you, aren't I?
No!
You and I are over as a man and a woman.
Do like this.
Shin Ji Hoon.
You called.
Sorry I just checked it.
Are you sleeping?
What are you doing up at this late hour?
I was working.
What is that?
- I just bit the ice.
- Ice?
Yeah, because I want to eat red bean sherbet.
- Red bean sherbet.
- Yeah.
It was really hot today.
- Do you want me to make it now?
- What?
Now?
The cafe is closed.
No, no.
I'm at cafe now.
It's not closed yet.
It's 2 a.m now.
Yeah, I know.
I'm at the cafe now.
I am.
I had to finish something because my employees made some mistakes.
Anyway, it's not closed yet.
I'll make it quick and bring it to you.
I don't like your cafe's red bean sherbet.
Why?
- Why do you not like it?
- Too sweet.
And I know you just ran into the cafe.
How did you know?
How would I not know that?
I heard your heavy breathing.
So you're not going to eat it?
Make it and bring it.
Don't put jelly.
Make it light.
- Don't make it lose its original flavor.
- Okay.
Just wait.
Make it light.
- Ta-da!
- Wow!
Here.
Try some.
I tried so hard to make it light.
Thank you.
Oh, you put raisins.
- Yeah.
I thought you'd like it.
- Yes, I do.
But why is there one spoon?
Are you not eating?
- I know.
Why is there only one spoon?
- You don't like this?
It's delicious.
You made it well.
- Is it that delicious?
- Yeah.
Make it again later.
Yeah.
Now are you not wondering why there's only spoon anymore?
Don't you think you can give me one bite?
Just one bite.
It's so good.
Do you want more?
No, I'm good.
You can have the rest.
They're riding a bike at this late time?
That's it for today.
What do you think of this bike?
It's pretty.
After 5 minutes, you'll get this bike.
Ride this bike when you come to me.
I have a bike.
You're up?
Yeol Mae, why was I in your room?
I think you really do sleep walk.
- Where did you sleep?
- I slept next right next you hugging you.
Na Hyun, do you know how to ride a bike?
Do you want to keep that bike?
Why?
You don't ride bikes?
You can have that.
Why all of a sudden?
You keep that and forget about what I've done with the stones.
Okay?
Thank you so much.
Where's Ji Hoon?
He went to a flower market to buy flowers for the cafe.
- Bye then.
- Thank you.
What's this bike?
Isn't it pretty?
Yeah, it is.
You have a bike though.
- Did you buy another one?
- I gave it to Na Hyun.
Are you not coming in?
I bought ice cream.
Eat it with Na Hyun.
I have somewhere to go.
Where?
You don't have to know.
I'm on my way to you.
Do you like it?
Yeah, I like it very much.
Shin Ji Hoon.
I'll let you have my heart.
So make me change my mind.
Make me fall in love with you.
I'm giving you a chance.
Congratulations, Joo Yeol Mae.
You're going to have to get ready from now on.
Otherwise, your heart will explode.

I'll stay with you longer today.
- What's that?
- The menu I invented.
I didn't call you to worry about me.
Watch me comeback again.
Let's drink to my new life!
- Bottoms up.
- I used to be a lovely girl.
I'm a vegetarian, you know?
Ji Hee!
Mr. Kim?
!
- Are you really okay?
- I don't know if I'm okay.
I'm late.
You should ask me about that first.
You're stupid, right?
You came.
That's all that matters.
While having a meeting, I fell asleep.
It's 4 a.m. when I wake up.
I'm a kind and innocent man.
Let's suppose that a man storms into a woman's room and acts like that.
No matter what his intention was, he would be accused for potential sexual harrassment.
Even if he does nothing at this moment, in the next morning, a man would be accused again.
I thought that I had gotten out of it well.
I deserve to be praised for my flawless manner ethically and morally.
But I still...
You beastly bastard!
became a beast in the end.
Beastly bastard?
You want me to die?
What the heck were you thinking that you would say all whose horrible words to me?
What should I have done in that situation, then?
Huh?
Huh?
Sorry.
I was wrong.
Hit with the speed of 200km/hour.
Can't it be about 10km/hour?
Do you want to do 300?
Can't it be about 10km/hour?
Do you want to do 300?
I got it.
But I really don't understand!
Was she really sleepwalking?
Will she really not remember at all?
Then, are you saying that young kiddo tried to seduce me or what?
Maybe not, but if it's not sleepwalking, will it be possible?
Did you sleep well?
INeedRomance2012.
Ask her about it then.
Did you sleep well?
Yes.
Sunbae, did you possibly move me to lay in your room last night?
Wow, everything is the man's fault!
Hey, how would I pick you up and move you there?
!
I'm a tender and naive man, ok?
!
But then how did I end up sleeping in your room...?
You came with your own two feet and took your clothes off with your own hands!
If you ever come and invade my bed again, you're really out then!
Remember that!
No, wait...
I don't really remember...
That's why I'm saying my bed isn't a bed that just anyone can get in!
If you really want to sleep, then go to the sofa to sleep!
Got it?
!
A bed is a bed, what's the big deal?
It's not like I slept right next to him...
Ha, seriously...
A woman came into the space that I had made.
For some reason...
I feel uneasy.
Sunbaenim, I'm going to go buy some milk.
What are you looking at?
Huh?
Your face dropped like that...
Is it your first time seeing a woman's underwear?
Wow... the grass grew so much.
Look those dandelions, I need to pull them out on the weekend...
Don't play around.
You're staring at her underwear!
Hey, when did I look?
Just when?
I saw it!
Are you going to keep lying?
I saw where your eyes went to and where they stopped at!
Fine, I looked a little.
What did you think when you look at them?
Your eyes were half closed.
I thought "Kang Na Hyun doesn't wear a padded bra".
Satisfied?
You tease!
The next morning, there was something else waiting to tease me.
We're going jogging!
"We"?
Seok Hyun and I are the ones who are in a relationship where using "we" is appropriate.
These guys..!
Omo, what in the world!
It's raining!
Get soaked in the rain and come to your senses, Yoon Seok Hyun!
How is it?
Rainy days are really nice, aren't they!
Yea, it's not bad!
Saying that when you really like it!
That's right, I like it!
What are you doing?
Shh.
It's the sound of a piano.
So it is.
Why are you laughing?
That first time that I went to your house, I was totally kicked out by you.
That time, I walked down this road by myself.
Then, I heard the sound of piano.
Wow... seriously...
I couldn't just leave.
So?
Sitting here pitifully, I cried for a long time.
Listening to this music.
While running your mouth at me?
Yes.
"How great does he think he is?"
"I will see." That's what I thought.
Hey!
Was it the same song as this one then?
Ai, the player must not practise a lot.
There was the same mistake at this part.
Ah, what is this?
!
Come on!
Why?
Let's go now.
I enjoyed the music!
You're up?
Did you eat?
Yea, just some toast.
It must have been hard since it started raining.
You couldn't find any shelter?
We left when it was raining.
You're saying you knew it was raining when you left?
Yea!
It's really nice to be in the rain when you're jogging.
I was going to bring you along if you weren't asleep, but I saw that you were sleeping.
You know I don't like being out in the rain.
But it's fun!
Let's go together next time!
Sunbae kept saying that he didn't like it too, but he actually liked it a lot.
Did you eat?
How can we go to any restaurant in these wet clothes?
Do you have any bread left?
What the?
Laundry, please!
Ha!
I'm the one who suggested that we only be sex partners first.
It's because I didn't want to be hurt by him again.
Since I couldn't tell him that I started falling in love with him again,
I don't have any right to get jealous.
I'm crazy!
I put in a whole tub!
How could I not pay attention to that?
!
Sit down.
I warmed up the milk.
Ah, thank you.
Wow, it's so good to have warm milk.
I figured you'd be cold since you were out in the rain.
But, how did you two end up living like this?
Ah, his mom is friends with my mom.
The two of them built this house to live together after they lost their husbands.
Now Oppa and I are the only ones left in it.
His mother and brother moved to the country side, and my mother passed away.
Why so suddenly?
I keep getting curious about Writer Yoon.
"What kind of man is he?
What does he like?
What does he dislike?
And what kind of woman does he like?" Stuff like that.
He's not dating anyone, right?
Oh, I don't know...
I think I like him.
You've known him for just a few days.
He seems like a full grown-up man.
A man who is going far ahead.
Like it's good if I can just walk following him.
A man like that.
I think he's really cool.
He's charismatic too.
And...
Isn't he sexy?
Just a minute.
Maybe this is too much nosy if I say this, because I just recently met you.
But...
Yoon Seok Hyun isn't that good of a man.
Never!
I've known him for last 30 years.
He's totally a bomb as a lover.
What part of him?
He's handsome?
Do you earn a living from your face?
He's sexy?
That goes away as you get older.
Men's sexiness comes, not from their muscle, but from their sensibility.
He's not sensible at all!
I guarantee you.
He doesn't have the muscle on his body but on his mind!
He seems like a really emotional man though.
Don't be fooled!
If you go over to that side, your life ends right there!
Sunbaenim~
Mmm, the food smells good!
Wow, Sunbaenim.
You're really cool when you wear a robe.
Is that the only time I'm cool?
I just got it ready.
I warmed the milk up too.
Help me out!
I made that.
What?
Why are you lying?
I made it.
I'm the one who heated the milk up too.
You're really weird.
Hey, you're the weirdest!
I'm really petty, aren't I?
Yea.
Aren't I really childish?
Yeah.
Aigo, bad bitches.
We met to talk about vacation today!
Why didn't you bring Sunbae with you?
Cruise travelling is not important at this moment.
Cruise travelling is not important at this moment.
Ah, such a tease!
She's so bold and honest, so I can't confront at all.
And you said she looks so innocent but at the same time, she is curvy as well.
Right.
What would I beat her with?
She beats me in both body and prettiness.
And her personality is definitely better than yours.
Just tell her that you like Yoon Seok Hyun too.
Don't you know what kind of relationship we're in?
We're not in a relationship where I could confidently say that we're dating!
Just tell her the truth!
"I'm sleeping partners with that man."
Just pure facts!
I have to get married since it's like this.
If she saw that he was my husband, do you think she would have done stuff like that?
You're saying some wishful stuff.
Do you think that young people these days stay away from married men?
What in the world!
The number one married man that single women in their 20's want to snatch away is Lee Jang Woo?
!
They must be crazy!
Why make something like this?
!
Hey, do people in their 20's really have no conscience?
How could they, even married men...?
!
I really want to make a request to women in their 20's earnestly to give up the men in their 30's to us!
They're going to get old someday!
I've thought about it.
The government needs to control this!
What can the government do?
That they have to change the constitution!
People in their 20's dating those in their 20's, and people in their 30's dating those in their 30's should be made into a law!
That's good, good!
If there's a person who makes that kind of law, I'll definitely vote for them!
So that men in their 30's can't even meet eyes with women in their 20's, they need to be separated into different cities and live in different societies!
So that they can't be taken in by them!
So people in their 20's live with people in their 20's and people in their 30's live with people in their 30's?
But will there really be men in the next city over who won't meet eyes with the young women?
A barbwire fence would have to be set up called "The 38th Parallel of Dating" (38th parallel is line dividing North Korea from South Korea.)
Ok!
No matter how much you force the law, they'll find a way to do it.
Love is something that no one can stop.
Those kind of people should be punished by the law.
We should punish them strictly to build the law and order strongly.
-How?
-How?
Those kind of bad people should be executed!
Na Hyun!
Na Hyun!
Na Hyun!
Na Hyun!
Na Hyun, Na Hyun!
Na Hyun!
Come back to your senses, OK?
!
Na Hyun!
Na Hyun!
Do you want to go with me?
I hate older women.
You hate them more than dying?
Yes.
I hate all the women younger and prettier than me.
Me too, me too!
You guys, just go to the Antartic.
-The Antartic?
-The Antartic?
They say that there's a ratio of 250 men to 1 woman there.
Try going there and catching somebody and don't concern yourselves over those in their 20's.
The important thing is style, not age.
-You're so great, so awesome!
-You're so great, so awesome!
Now that I look at it,
I haven't used these shoes because of Kang Na Hyun.
Those dolls also haven't moved from that position since then.
Lifting the shoulders!
1, 2!
So fun!
Unni!
Let's do this together!
If you do this, your whole body relaxes.
What is this?
What is this?
What are you doing?
I met up with Ji Hee and Jae Kyung because of a trip.
Ah, I'm stopping.
Stopping?
Oh, why didn't you bring me there?
They said you should copy your passport and send it to the travel agency.
You have fun when you're with Kang Na Hyun, don't you?
Huh?
It's too obvious you're having fun with her.
It can be noticeable even in far distance like 40km.
Why?
I can't have fun?
Yea, it is fun.
You look like an idiot going "Ha ha".
Is it possible that you're jealous?
Wow, your Prince Disease is here again!
Do you think I'm the same Yeol Mae from the past?
I don't have any other feelings for you.
It's not good to be jealous, Joo Yeol Mae.
It becomes so tiring for both of us.
I said I'm not!
Don't make me tired because of her.
It looks so unnatural.
I haven't done anything to bring any misunderstanding.
And I won't do anything to bring one in the future.
What happened?
Gradually, I started to feel skeptical about this relation.
Will it be fine like this?
Ji Hee was thinking the same thing as me at the same time.
Why do you hate motels?
Why did we leave the house and come here?
Let's just try going once, huh?
Can we not go?
Let's just go home, OK?
You... you don't know that you have a lot of problems, do you?
Why do you keep blaming me?
Then whose fault is it?
I didn't have ANY problems with other women.
Then do it with those women, because I don't want to anymore.
At that moment, Ji Hee realized... that she is not a teenager any more.
If you hate it that much, then let's go home.
I'll take you.
No, hold on a moment.
Do you not care about what I want?
What?
Your feelings are the only important thing and you don't have any interest in what I want, even though you say you love me.
No.
I mean...
Since you don't say anything...
For me, too...
Doing it with you is boring for me too.
No, wait...why are you telling me that now?
I didn't have problems with other men either.
You said that you didn't have much experience with men before!
Try to see who really has the problem for once.
Can I kill you tonight?
Go and brace yourself, because I'm going to kill you.
-What?
-Huh?
You're not getting out?
Yea...
What do I do?
I must have been crazy there for a minute.
What will I use to kill Ho Joo?
And I just now tried on animal print underwear.
It would be better to take them off in advance, right?
No, should I turn the light off?
-Just focus on yourself.
-Huh?
Let go of your worries about whether it will work or not, and just focus on the present moment.
Understand?
Ok, self.
Don't be afraid.
That's right, you're living in the moment! Woo Ji Hee!
What are you doing so shamelessly?
!
Housemaster B?
Yea,
Housemaster B.
Hey Woo Ji Hee, you're coming here without wearing your underclothes?
I just took them off because it's hot.
-Get out of the way.
-Hey Joo Yeol Mae.
You're not going to lower your skirt?
My legs are short, so...
Move out of the way.
Everything about you is the problem!
Look at this mess of hair!
Why is your chest sticking out so much again?
!
It's always been big; what can I do about it?
This girl!
Why are you hitting me?
You should use words!
Oh, look!
You girl, when?
!
When will you snap to your senses?
!
I heard that teacher's voice all of a sudden.
At that moment, the shame covered all over me, and I felt like I became a prostitute.
And I thought, "What am I doing here right now?"
So?
I ran out of there before Ho Joo came out of the bathroom.
It must be true that the problem isn't Ho Joo, but me.
I must be insensible.
What should I do?
I have always had a hard time concentrating.
It was like somebody was watching me, and when I felt a bit hot, I came back to square one again.
And I always felt uncomfortable with any positions.
Can't you tell Ho Joo truthfully and then try to work it out together?
It's already too late.
What's too late?
Men also don't know well about sex when they are 20's.
Since both men and women don't know well, they experience together to reach the moment.
But now, when men already know the pleasure, how can they wait until then?
You should've figured out earlier than now, what your body wants.
And what it likes.
So what?
What's your conclusion?
Play around.
Hey, don't listen to her.
She can't live her life well either.
You don't have any right to give an advice, Seon Jae Kyung.
Ah, I'm going crazy...
Even my work is not going well...
One thing I realized from working in music is that if you live like a coward, your music turns out to be a mess.
If I'm not honest in my life, my music becomes dishonest as well.
[Alarm :
Coffee Class]
The hearts are the easiest.
It's because my heart is completely messed up right now.
Shall we try again?
First scoop the milk in again.
Before you start, you should clean it up like this.
If you cut into it carefully.
Success!
Better, isn't it?
Try doing it again.
What caused your heart to be messed up?
There is something like that.
Oh yeah, come and see me before you leave.
Why?
Oh, I did it!
I made a heart!
Oh, so you did.
I'm the one who fixed your heart.
Good job everyone.
Thank you!
Why me?
Do you want to go somewhere with me tomorrow?
Where to?
An orphanage?
Yes.
He said it's just playing with kids for a day.
When did you get so close to that LP guy?
We always drink coffee together.
There's an ulterior motive.
It's an invitation for a date.
Why are you so dense?
It's not like that.
It's just a volunteer work.
LP guy, he's interested in you.
I'm sure of it.
No, he said he had fate with a woman...
This relationship may perhaps may still have some hope.
Why, does it bother you?
No.
Concern about what?
Go if you want to.
The more I think about it
I do think that he's interested in me.
He said that I was pretty.
Right out loud.
Yes.
When you're trying to look pretty there are times that you do look pretty.
Sometimes that is.
No, he seemed to have a crush on me.
Shin Ji Hoon must have seen something from me.
What did you show him?
What did you show him?
You know my radiant aura just oozes out of every pore.
I'm a walking charm magnet!
Hey, a snot bubble just shot out from your nose.
Do your best.
If your going to congratulate me you could at least do it in a pleasant manner.
Don't act like you did when we were dating.
What did I do?
Liking me then hating me.
Pulling me then pushing me.
Coming then going.
Did you ever pretend to come and go when I said to come and go?
Of course not because I knew it was all talk.
How could I have matched your fickle personality?
When I thought you were boiling, you turned cold and when I thought you were cold, you were boiling.
If you are bothered by the idea I'm meeting LP guy, then just say so.
It doesn't bother me.
Go if you want because I couldn't care less.
Oh,I bettergo .
With Shin Ji Hoon.
You are going to the orphanage with LP guy today, right?
Yes, how do I look?
Isn't it tacky to be overdressed?
Why, what's the matter?
It's childish to be so over the top.
I think it would be better to be more natural.
Would it be better to be more natural?
Wait just a minute.
I'm going to meet Na Hyun at the film company.
I'll drop you off on my way there.
Should I mess with you a little more?
Did you change again?
Yes, you said that it was tacky to be overdressed.
It's more natural now, isn't it?
Wow, you even sprayed on some perfume.
Aw, my head is killing me.
Hey, don't you remember buying this for me when I went to the movie premier with Kim Sung Soo?
Did the perfume go bad or something?
Why does it smell like that?
The wind will make my hair messy!
Let's just go like this.
My head is killing me.
Can't you cooperate?
Why are you doing things that you normally don't do?
What did I do?
Have you ever put so much effort into looking good when you were seeing me?
I did more.
I had a facial massage a night before, and the shower and hair...
What's wrong with you!
?
You have been snapping since earlier.
Are you suddenly jealous right now?
Do you think it's a waste to give me to others?
Is it ok to reveal your real mind in this way?
A man must be like a gentleman.
Just say it honestly.
If it bothers you say it does.
It won't work, right?
Do you want me not to go?
We're here.
Get out.
Don't forget our plan to go to see a movie.
He's not a kind of guy to be jealous, Yoon Seok Hyun.
Oh, you're here.
Give it to me.
Thatguyslooksnice.
Doyourbest.
Thanks for giving me your blessing.
Hmm, what's that?
It's just a little something.
If that's the case
Let's go!
This song has 3 cords but
I'm not a good singer so please just look at my left hand playing the codes.
Is there anything you want to hear?
Unnie will sing you something fun.
Unnie, why are you such a terrible singer?
Hey, you embarrass me so much.
My singing is pretty good.
It's because you haven't acquired the taste for music yet.
Hyung is a better singer!
Just one second.
Let's dry them here.
Alright!
This is the last!
When did you start coming here?
I lived here when I was younger for a while.
For how long?
About three years.
I attended middle school while living here.
After my father passed away, mother remarried.
After that?
After that, at my uncle's house, my father's properties were found later.
They took and raised you because of money?
I'm pretty sure that's why.
How can you tell such a sad story with a smile on your face?
Then am I supposed to cry over something that's in the past?
At this age?
You've never acted like a kid, have you?
No, never.
In my memory.
I'm telling you this in honor of us becoming friends.
It's better to cry when you're sad.
It's alright to lean on someone when things get hard.
We all live in the same universe.
Why are men like that?
What?
Why do they not share their hard times with others?
It's not just because I'm a man.
It's because I'm a Taekwondo expert.
A black belt at that.
I decided when I got my black belt that I was definately not going to cry!
I'm a man!
I really dislike that.
A man who doesn't cry.
Why do you dislike that?
You're suppose to cry when things are hard.
That's the only way your partner can know how you feel.
That's how you bond to them.
Care for them more and become closer.
Why do men go into a cave when they're having a hard time?
Do you know how frustrated the women are, when they wait outside of the cave?
They should endure together, no matter what it is..
Who is this man you're talking about?
It's nothing.
Anyways, don't you act like that!
Why isn't unnie coming?
She must be enjoying her date.
She went on a date?
Unnie, I'm sitting in your spot.
This is yours.
Later when we're eating dinner would you mind not staying around?
I'm going to tell sunbae that I like him tonight.
Be quiet.
Sunbae, let's go eat something delicious.
Somewhere with a nice atmosphere.
What do you want to eat?
Somewhere we can eat and drink too.
Eat while your drinking.
Why are you drinking so much?
Do you have a problem with me?
Well, I wouldn't say it's a problem.
You must be happy, since you're young, pretty, and full of confidence.
Did something happen between the two of you?
You find this situation enjoyable?
I hate this situation.
I can't leave it like this.
I'm sorry, Kang Na Hyun, but..
You better leave today.
With your sunbae, who is so cool like the sky, I need some in-depth conversation.
Did you and unnie argue?
You leave!
What?
Go home.
You can come out late tomorrow.
Yes, sunbae.
Wow, that's exactly the style you like.
She left when you told her to leave.
If that had been me I would have wanted a detailed reason for leaving.
I would have never left, isn't that so?
Was there something happened between you and Na Hyun?
I'm acting jealous right now.
Because I hate that Kang Na Hyun likes you.
Why?
Can't I be jealous?
Is it petty of me to feel jealous?
I don't think that jealousy is childish.
Jealousy is the world's most honest confession.
You're the odd one for not knowing what jealousy is.
Oww, this is so annoying!
Come over here.
Why does the oil keep splashing you?
Even the pork rinds are mocking me.
Even the pork rinds are mocking me.
Let's end this relationship.
Let's stop.
If it's not love then I don't want it.
Just stop.
The friends with benefits relationship.
I can't leave it like this.
I want more.
I want something that is more defined.
I don't like another girl lingering around.
While knowing this
I even dislike you who is enjoying this.
I hate myself who feels jealous but can't tell you that
I like you, Yoon Seok Hyun.
The more I think about it.
I have never "not" liked you, not even once.
I'm tired and it's so hard for me because I don't know what you really feel, but still, I like you.
I'm crazy, aren't I?
You can reject me.
I hate fake stuff.
Although I said that, at that moment, I desperately wished....
That love would be on my side for once.
At least, today...

Jae Kyung wasn't alone at that time either.
It's nice to get out of the city once in a while.
Open it.
A ring was rejected once before, so I thought of giving you a necklace, but you have so many already.
I just thought that if you have at least one thing that reminds you of me,
I would feel a little bit better.
Do it for me.
Don't you hate me, Jung Min?
If I were you, I would really hate me.
I don't hate you.
Jae Kyung.
That car behind us, 5678.
Didn't we see it yesterday too?
I don't know.
No, that car smells fishy.
I think I saw it yesterday.
Speed up a little bit.
What is that?
Why is it following us?
SunJaeKyung,ifyoukeepupyour attitude, you might head into some problems.
Youareabit smart, but not enough to compete with me.
It's a tail.
Lee Jang Woo put a tail on us.
What do I do?
This is too dangerous.
Just stop.
If we have been followed since earlier, he already...
You don't know how relentless Jang Woo is.
Mostdaysoutoftheyearareordinary.
Destiny is only in a movie, and the inevitable things only happen in TV dramas.
I think we ditched the tail.
Really?
You can't see any, right?
But to Jae Kyung, at that time, on that day, it wasn't ordinary.

- Ji Hee!
- They said she was sent to the X ray room.
- X ray?
- Yes.
It's Jung Min.
Jung Min!
Why are you here?
Oh, you are here.
Hey, are you all right?
Next is Han Jeong Min.
-Okay.
-Jeong Min-sshi.
Sit down.
You got into an accident while you were together with Jeong Min?
It's Jeong Min?
!
The person you're cheating with is Han Jeong Min?
!
Hey, you knew?
Yea, I found out.
How could you do something like that?
!
You threw away Jeong Min and married Jang Woo!
Ji Hee, stop.
I already said all of that.
You said Jung Min didn't have any capacity.
Don't you remember how cruelly you dumped him?
It's all water under the bridge anyway.
What do you want me to do?
If you want to have fun, go ahead.
But do it moderately.
Did I harm your life?
Am I cheating with your man?
Unbelievable.
Jae Kyung.
Your husband, Lee Jang Woo is having an affair, and, yes, it must have been painful and difficult for you.
But the world is not so generous to women.
It's not fair, but it's the reality.
Moreover, your couple, everyone is interested in your..
Did I call you guys to get lectured?
Friends are people who support you, not go against you.
Ok, then.
We'll cheer for you.
Live your whole life having an affair.
I can't understand you, no matter how much I try to!
Neither Ji Hee nor I can understand!
Do you think I understand you?
You broke up with Yoon Seok Hyun long time ago, but now you cry like a baby because you like him.
You!
You think the matter with Kang Ho Joon is the biggest concern in the world.
You think the matter between Ho Joon and you is so common that all people in the world would understand.
I don't want to get either acknowledged by you or evaluated.
I just... want your support.
Do you understand?
How on earth can we cheer for you in this situation?
I'm worried because you are injured.
But still, this isn't right.
To me, my happiness is my top priority.
But the method... is wrong!
Are you guys judges?
Why are you judging if my life is right or wrong?
When you walk into mud, are you saying we shouldn't even stick out a hand to you?
Shut up and just stick out your hands!
Seon Jae Kyung!
What's going on?
Why are you taking photos?
What are you doing now?
Don't take photos!
INeedRomance2012.
It was weird.
On that day when I had an accident, it looked like there was a tail, and the reporters rushed into the hospital, as if it was all planned in advance.
You said you would never get caught.
Why weren't you more careful?
and the reporters rushed into the hospital, as if it was all planned in advance.
You said you would never get caught.
Why weren't you more careful?
What will we do?
The reporters have started to gather outside.
- Is it really an adultery?
- She is a patient, please!
Is this Kang Ho Joon?
Sex being boring is a man's fault, not a woman's.
So stop watching porn and get a life, you bastard.
- Will we just get on a cruise?
- Anyway we can't go home, so it would be better to go on a trip as planned.
Touch.
Grab.
Cry.
Smile.
Get hurt.
Love.
Love very, very much.
Kiss.
"Where Did the Passion Go?"
Episode 4 "Where Did the Passion Go?"
A concierge was what they called servants in the Middle Ages.
A concierge is a type of servant who meets the personal demands of a hotel customer.
Yes, this is concierge Sunwoo In Young.
My shoelaces are broken.
The Korean streets are so bad.
What will I do?
Oh no.
I don't have any time.
What am I gonna do?
Next week is my daughter's birthday.
What should I get her?
Please get me two tickets to the Nutcracker ballet.
Thank you.
Can you believe they don't make beef-bone noodle soup anymore?
In Young, why can't Koreans understand the deep flavor of beef-bone noodle soup?
Alex, there are other brands of ramen.
The types of ramen are more various than you think.
I'll introduce you to some of them.
Okay?
You promise?
Yes.
What is that?
Room 6013.
It's the blouse Jessica's going to wear to the party.
We call ourselves a service center, but truth is, we only do errands.
This is all we do.
Don't you feel it's unfair when you see people pay so much money to spend a night here?
Hey.
Is this how I taught you?
Who's the godfather of our profession?
Jesus.
He washed the feet of all his disciples.
That's how you should think.
Being humble enough to lower yourself is the cornerstone of our profession.
Repeat.
Obey.
But that's the problem.
You can't always feel that way.
Aren't there days you want to give up?
35 years ago, the general manager carried serving trays just like us.
Don't overthink and sew the button unless you want to deal with Jessica.
I'm going to the servers' meeting... ♪ Fart #3 ♪
O.O
How dare you in front of a woman?
What?
You just farted!
You're the one who...
It was you.
Don't blame me.
Who else is in this room?
Wow.
Really.
I've never farted in my life.
Next time, do it in the bathroom.
Okay?
Sung Hyun is right.
Trying to be like Jesus is bound to be stressful.
But...
I have a night planned that will get rid of this stress once and for all.
Tehehe.
Once a month, I become a different woman for the night.

What should I wear?
Hey, wear this.
What is that?
Don't you know?
Is it a bra?
Haven't you heard of wearing a nude bra in place of a bra?
No.
She doesn't have to wear them.
You just put these on.
You put it over your bare skin.
Don't you know how great these are?
Men can't tell they're fake even if they feel them.
Are you speaking from experience?
Hey.
You know theory is my strong point.
They say that men have no idea how much the world of breast-enhancing bras have grown.
Just take a look at that cleavage.
Hey.
It enhances cleavage too.
They gather them together.
Am I right?
Mmmm, perfect for flat-chested A cups like you.
My breasts are literary.
Are they philosophical too?
Anyway, congratulations on calling your engagement off.
Hey.
That evil bastard.
What did he say?
I heard he ran away as soon as he saw her.
Tae Woo did track in junior high.
It's been a week since he's been missing.
Don't look for him anymore.
He has another woman.
I'm sure of it.
You'll only get hurt in the end.
But isn't there something wrong here?
Of course there's something wrong.
That's why you separated.
You need beautiful form when you separate too.
For the sake of a new beginning.
Here she goes again.
But if you think of the time when they loved each other, don't you think this is wrong?
Where did that passionate love go?
Where do you think it went?
To another woman probably.

How's it over there?
It's lame.
I came to dance, but now they're talking about books.
Who's Orhan Pamuk?
Dotorimuk's friend?
(Pamuk and Dotorimuk are types of jellies)
They're too slimy here.
The water is great here.
Come over girls.
I'm in the VIP room.
There are enough guys for us all.
This gentleman is studying to be a political science professor at Columbia.
I'm Park Kang Ho.
Hello.
This over here is Ahn Ra Hee.
She's a fashion model.
And doesn't this gentleman look very familiar?
Oh, I know.
You write the Wine Club.
Mr. Jang Ka Beng?
How do you know that?
Oh she works at a hotel...
Oh, she loves hotel wines so much.
Yeah.
Ah.
This is Kang Ae Ri.
She's a ballerina.
Hello.
What do you guys think of my friends?
Aren't they pretty?
Where's the third guy?
The third guy's on his way.
They can't say his name because he's the descendent of a hotel owner.
Which hotel is it?
You should ask him yourself when he comes.
He's getting business administration training.
We also know someone who's a hotelier, don't we girls?
Right.
She's a concierge at RH Hotel.
Stop it.
You're here Sung Hyun.
Sorry.
26 year old ballerina, Kang Ae Ri.
Do you always lie like this outside the office?
Your breasts are out too.
You've dropped the honorifics.
Am I not an elder outside the office?
Yes, Madam Sunwoo In Young.
And what?
A descendant of a hotel president?
You're related to our hotel president?
Sewing buttons as a concierge is training for business administration?
Oh my.
And why are you driving a car like that given your wage?
Whose car are you borrowing?
Who would lend a new car?
So this is your car?
You borrowed it from those guys right?
Those guys?
Those guys?
Oh.
I'm getting tipsy.
Stop!
Stop!
Is this it?
We almost passed it.
Anyway thanks.
Be careful on your way back.
Yeah.
Don't scratch this borrowed car.
By the way, don't be late tomorrow.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Huh.
But how does he know where I live?
Hey, get a hold of yourself.
You're drunk right now.
Yeah.
He just drove me home.
Nothing happened.
Really?
It's really that expensive?
Really?
What kind of clothes are that expensive?
Okay, Hyun Joo.
I'll hang up for now.
What is it?
I'm not late.
I hear you were wearing designer clothes yesterday?
Maybe.
The brand's not anything we carry in our duty-free.
Your shoes, even your watch are the all the best brands.
So what?
What's your point?
Why spend money on all that given your salary?
Oh my!
What's this?
Sit up straight and look at me.
I'm telling you this because I've thought of you as my younger brother this past year.
Think of this as advice from your older sister.
You look down on a lot of our hotel guests, don't you?
Those fancy things at the duty-free catch your eye, don't they?
Whenever I go there, I feel my shoes are just slippers and my purse is just a plastic bag.
But I'm serious this time.
Listen well, okay?
You think our employers won't get fired for going in and out of duty-free shops?
I know our salary doesn't seem like much based on what our customers spend.
But there are a lot of people who live off of $800 a month.
Be grateful and don't waste money.
Don't give your generation a bad name by becoming greedy.
Then what about you?
That clutch you had last night.
That clutch is as expensive as your paycheck.
That was a gift from some of my better-off friends.
Helping me out is their version of relief for the poor.
Do you know that much about me?
I don't know much.
Except that you go around spreading lies about being the descendant of our company president.
At least I didn't lie about my age.
A person should live with a conscience.
If you look at me a bit blurred, I can look 26.
Richard in Room 5032 says he left his bag.
I came to pick it up for him.
Thanks.
Bye.
It's Yoon Kang Hee.
Why do you always hide when you see me?
I wasn't hiding.
Who says?
You must work here.
Since you're a hotelier.
Yes.
I go to the fitness center here.
I should come often to see you.
Why would you want to see me?
I'm fine with it, but I guess I make you uncomfortable.
Of course it's uncomfortable, why wouldn't it be?
Do you prefer this or this?
This one.
Then I'll get this one.
I'm going to give this to the director as a gift.
I don't think it'll suit him.
I think you're a decent woman Miss In Young.
I don't know much about you.
But since the director loved you, you're probably pretty cool.
The prize is very important in a war, but so is the enemy, right?
What do you mean?
The opponent needs to be formidable to put a good fight.
If the opponent isn't worthy, she won't be worth fighting, right?
What are you talking about?
I'm declaring war.
I really like Director Kim.
He's exactly my type.
See you next time Miss Sunwoo In Young.
I acknowledge it.
Yoon Kang Hee is young, sweet, and cute.
And she knows that being young and beautiful is useful in this world.
23.
When I was Yoon Kang Hee's age, I also thought I was the prettiest girl in the world.
But now I'm the sort of woman who lies about my age in the club.
Because men like being the older ones.
Seo Joon Yi, 34, Photographer
This man is causing Park Seo Yeon grief these days.
Turn a bit this way.
Lower your chin.
I told you my left side is better.
You have to shoot my left side.
Look at this.
How could you photograph a jumpsuit like this?
Don't you have a sense of fashion?
The back is the highlight.
How could you photograph from the front?
Ah, really.
Ah.
The pose is so awkward.
You should have told me to pull back my shoulders.
I don't like any of his pictures.
Find another photographer.
You should have treat Joon Yi better.
It's not easy to find a good photographer like him.
Whatever, they're just shopping mall pictures.
Not at all.
Everyone talks about how good our pictures are.
They're practically editorials.
Plus, Seo Joon Yi is really good at photoshop.
Your skin always looks flawless.
She really pisses me off.
What?
I won't work with you anymore.
Find someone new.
Someone better than Seo Joon Yi.
Yes, I understand.
Fine.
I'm a professional and this is business.
This is President Park Seo Yeon of YStyle.
Let's talk.
Pick the time and place.
It's not professional to quit just because you don't approve of my personal life.
Don't you think?
When is a good time for you?
President Park Seo Yeon.
If you want to do business properly, learn how to treat your partner.
That morning was Park Seo Yeon's first time being rejected by a man in 33 years.
Her pride was deeply wounded, but it's not her style to give up.
Forget it.
No use letting pride get in the way.
President, an envelope's arrived.
I think it came from court.
What?
Court?
Call the factory and see if they have the RT blouse.
Yes.
Seo Joon Yi is a piece of cake.
A bigger challenge awaits Seo Yeon.
Are you defending your wife right now?
Imagine how miserable she must be.
You're a woman, so you should know.
The baby's about to be born, and I can't sleep thinking about the pain I've caused her.
I can't sleep either because of what your wife sent me.
I wonder if she's lonely at the house or if she's eating properly.
The bathroom light was flickering.
Who's going to fix it?
I don't even know if she got the baby's diapers and clothes.
I wanted to do that for her.
Did she kick you out?
Yeah.
In these clothes.
Your wife is no joke.
How did you end up with a woman like her?
She's a good woman.
She's usually such a loveable woman.
She's kind and sweet.
Don't call me from now on.
I even texted my wife to let her know I was meeting you today.
I don't want to lie to her anymore.
That bastard.
I'm the one who lives alone, but he was worrying about his wife.
His wife's the one... who sued me.
Of course, he takes her side.
Why would he take yours?
He might not be a lost cause after all.
Hey, do you know how he treated me when we first met?
He worked for 4 months to get with me.
That was then.
Look at me.
What about me and Tae Woo?
You think we didn't love like you did?
My fiancé left me.
What's the point of talking?
Where did all our passion go?
He said he didn't love his wife.
You believe that?
You wouldn't believe it?
You believe the words of a married man?
Hey.
Do you guys know what happened to me on my honeymoon?
There was a really suave guy.
A woman notices a thousand things in a second.
Luxurious skin, his cologne.
The best quality necktie.
Height is 184-185 cm.
Weight about 87 kg?
He has at least a masters degree.
He was exactly my type.
I was hoping we would be on the same plane.
But he was wearing a ring.
If we see a good man, that's what we look for.
Whether he has a ring or not.
We see if the wedding ring is visible.
But that bastard took off his ring.
Do you have business in Hong Kong?
Yes, but how do you...
I saw you boarding before.
I see.
Where are you staying in Hong Kong?
Avirana Hotel.
Wow.
I'm staying there too.
They have a nice rooftop bar.
From your room, you have a night view of the Tsim Sha Tsui too.
Madam Tussaud's Museum is nearby too.
It's nice for taking a walk by the water in the morning too.
That's right.
That's why I...
So you're staying at Avirana?
Yes, I'm there whenever I visit Hong Kong.
Then should we have a drink at the bar after we unpack?
That would be nice.
I was wondering what I would do tonight.
But where's the Avirana Hotel?
What?
I've been to Hong Kong several times, but I've never heard of Avirana.
So... well, you just seemed nice so, I just wanted to be friends...
I don't want to be your friend.
Besides, your married.
I got married yesterday and now I'm going to my honeymoon alone.
Put your ring back on, and don't talk to me if you see me in Hong Kong.
Got it?
Yes.
What are you doing?
It's time to board.
Don't forget your luggage.
Don't forget your head either.
Yes.
Kang Hyun Joo, you must have been disappointed.
Not at all.
I thought it was a good thing I didn't get married.
What if my husband acted that way.
Anyway, nice guys are always taken.
There are plenty of woman who don't care whether men are taken.
Yoon Kang Hee makes me so mad these days.
There's another one right here who doesn't care whether a man is taken.
Hey, how is he taken?
A man is not an object.
That's just being posessive and obsessive.
Hey, do you two love each other?
He leaves behind a woman he loves.
So do you two love each other?
I never claimed it was love.
The heart wants what it wants.
A man wearing a ring, going around trying to pick up other women.
Aren't men at fault too?
Did Kim Sung Soo do nothing wrong?
My point is women are at fault too.
Yoon Kang Hee is the one seducing him.
She told me she was declaring war.
That's not right.
That can't be.
Sunwoo In Young, that can't be.
You're saying Kim Sung Soo didn't do anything to encourage her?
That's ridiculous.
That's true.
I tried to send him away.
But he kept clinging to me, saying he didn't love his wife.
Sexless did he say?
He said he couldn't remember the last time they had sex.
They're sexless, but they made a baby.
How did she get pregnant?
So ridiculous.
That's right.
That's it.
All he has to do is decide he wants the woman in front of him.
He won't think of anything else.
If he decides he wants that woman, why wouldn't he lie about it?
The bastard in the airport did.
Wouldn't he think of his woman back home when he's around another woman?
Why bother asking?
Wouldn't he think of his long-time girlfriend?
A dark suspicion suddenly re-emerged.
So in this scene, listen closely.
In the scene before, So Young's friend says something about her boyfriend.
So in this scene, So Young feels...
I heard you have a girlfriend.
What?
I heard you were together for 10 years.
Oh, her.
Is she the one whose butt is in your cell phone?
Well, I guess she thinks she has a pretty butt.
So she drew it in my cell phone.
Do you still like her after 10 years?
Do you still get excited?
What excitement?
I'm with her because I'm used to her.
But you still love her right?
I can't break up with her after all this time.
When I was broke, she took care of me.
Plus, she's over 30, so if not for me, she has nowhere to go.
What?
She's over 30?
She's an old miss.
If not for me, she can't get married.
Men don't see women over 30 as women.
I don't see her as a woman either.
Oh, her poor butt.
Yeah, if you think about it, she's really pitiful.
Let's go.
Men who insult their wives when they're not around.
Aside from their personality and integrity.
I think they completely lack loyalty.
That's right Kim Sung Soo.
You're not human if you do this.
He eats the food his wife sets.
He wears the clothes his wife washes.
He shouldn't insult her.
That's right Kim Sung Soo.
I even wash your socks.
You better not do that.
What's wrong with you?
It's nothing.
She is pretty.
Hateful girl.
In Young.
What?
Do you exercise here too?
No, I came to see you.
I had lunch with Director Baek on the third floor.
Oh, Kang Hee is here.
Does she work out here?
I don't know.
I guess.
Ah, should I work out here too?
My stomach is getting flabby.
With Yoon Kang Hee?
Don't raise your eyebrows.
You'll get old.
Director!
Director!
I work out here.
Did In Young tell you?
Yeah.
Good idea.
Focus on your arms.
It won't look good on camera if you gain weight there.
I'm not fat here.
I'm not trying to lose weight.
I'm just trying to maintain my bodyline.
Aren't you going to the restaurant?
I thought you were meeting Director Baek.
Oh my.
Are you meeting Director Baek?
I want to meet him too.
Can't I go too?
I'm going to eat anyway.
I'm going.
Bye.
Where are you going?
We're not done talking.
Let's go camping.
Really?
Did you buy camping equipment?
It's your wish, so we have to go.
I hear it's raining this weekend.
It's not raining.
I checked.
Okay.
I'll take care of the food.
Oh yeah.
Here.
What is this?
They're walking shoes.
You need new shoes.
They say these shoes are good, so run using these.
Okay, thanks.
See you this weekend.
Director.
Director, do you know I have supernatural powers?
Stop being ridiculous.
Just go and exercise.
I really do have supernatural powers.
I can make it rain.
It'll rain this weekend.
Don't go camping.
If you don't listen to me and go camping, you'll suffer a lot.
Don't you believe me?
I really can make it rain.
It'll fall from the sky.
Do you know how much rain I've caused before?
You won't go.
You won't go, right?
Hey, Yoon Kang Hee.
Stop joking around and go exercise.
And focus on your arms.
They don't look good.
Weekend likelihood of precipitation: 1%.
Score!
What do you mean supernatural powers?
I'm the one with supernatural powers.
The power to receive love from the same man after 10 years.
That's supernatural power.
The love is still passionate.
♪ Let's go camping, let's march forth ♪
♪ Let's link arms and march forth ♪
Honey, have some coffee.
Miss Sunwoo In Young.
How do you feel to finally be camping?
I like it so much.
My boyfriend has a pretty discerning eye.
What's your boyfriend like?
He's a very famous director named Kim Sung Soo.
I said I wanted to go camping and look at this.
He prepared all this for me.
We're going to have a barbecue party at night.
I'll ask a little bit more about your boyfriend.
This Kim Sung Soo...
Is he good looking?
Can't you tell just by looking at me?
With this face and this body, think I'd meet just any man?
Is he really that good looking?
He's not just good looking.
He's talented, handsome, and he's even sexy.
I'm a very happy woman.
What did you just do?
Did you just fart?
Why is it suddenly raining?
This can't be happening.
I can't believe it.
Yoon Kang Hee.
You cruel witch.
Hello?
Director.
It's raining.
It's so nice that it's raining.
It's so romantic.
Right?
Hang up.
It's Yoon Kang Hee, right?
Yeah.
What's her problem?
Don't worry about her.
She's just a kid.
Then why do you bother with her?
What did I do wrong?
Why did you answer her call?
She called to annoy me.
Do you have to answer her every time?
Do you have your period?
Why are you asking me that?
Are you just going to go?
I don't think it'll stop raining any time soon.
Let's pack up for today.
We can come back next time.
It took 2 hours to set this all up.
Wait in the car.
I'll do this myself.
Whatever!
I'm going in the car.
I'm really going to wait in the car like a princess.
There's a laptop in the back.
You can watch a movie.
Why?
I said go wait in the car.
It's cold.
I feel bad seeing you do this alone.
Do this.
Hurry up.
How are we going to dry everything?
Hurry and just do this.
Now close your eyes.
Can you hear the rain?
If you listen carefully.
It sounds like rain.
You can hear it, right?
I can hear it.
I can.
♪ When it rains ♪
♪ And the music pours ♪
♪ I'll think of you, my love. ♪
Don't do that.
It's a beautiful season.
The scent of spring flowers was mixed into the rain.
The sound of rain, the sound of water.
The sound of the wind, the sound of my breath.
The sound of his laughter, all of it more divine that Beethoven's sonatas.
All in all, it was a beautiful day.
I was genuinely grateful for her supernatural powers.
As much as I envied and resented Yoon Kang.
I realized that our 10 year relationship is not as fragile as I thought.
Seoul Court
Some people who have been hurt by love.
They try to erase the memories and forget the love.
Coco!
And some people find a new love.
Coco.
Coco, where have you gone?
Did you lose your cat?
Yes, have you seen it?
You lost Coco?
Where are you going?
We need to find your cat.
Hey.
Food won't work.
Then what should I do?
I've been looking for over 3 hours.
He wasn't feeling well either.
If you put the food down like this, your cat will be chased away by alley cats.
Alley cats will crowd around this.
If Coco tries to come near their food, the alley cats might attack him.
What should I do?
It's practically my baby.
I have to find it tonight.
He was feeling sick or the last few days.
I was about to take it to the hospital.
Go bring Coco's cat litter.
You should bring it all.
Okay.
Coco.
Coco.
Cats are more advanced than dogs.
If they smell something familiar to them, they're more likely to come back.
The smell drives other cats away too.
By the way, is there a song you sang to it at home?
If there was, you should sing it.
♪ The man is a strolling singer ♪
♪ The man is a nasty person ♪
The woman working here sings it.
Coco likes this song.
Go on.
♪ I don't know, I don't care ♪
♪ Dumped four times, I don't care ♪
♪ I eat bulkgogi and ddukbokgi alone.♪ (marinated beef and spicy ricecakes)
♪ Cucumbers and bean sprouts... ♪
Coco!
Oh, wait.
Hold on.
It's probably sensitive.
It might run away.
Where were you?
I was looking all over for you.
But do you raise cats?
Then why do you carry around cat food for a snack?
No.
Last year, I read an article on alley cats.
So I carry around cat food so that I can feed them when I see them.
I see.
I guess you had business around here.
No.
A ping-pong club opened on the main road.
You should come to play ping-pong some time.
And take Coco to the vet tomorrow.
It seems to have hematuria.
It might mean he has kidney problems.
If he does, he should go see the vet right away.
It's getting late.
I'll be going.
See you next time.
We're home Coco.
Let's play after I have some water.
So cute.
Hold onto it tight so you don't lose it.
If you get distracted, squeeze my hand.
Just think, 'There's a bottle cap in this hand.'
It's will all pass by.
It's not the end of the world.
At this very moment, all sorts of new loves will be starting.
You never know when it'll end.
What are you doing?
Can't you tell by looking?
The rain ruined everything, right?
No.
It made things more fun.
Liar.
You don't have to lie to me.
Yoon Kang Hee, don't drop your honorifics.
Aren't you supposed to film a commercial?
I finished in the afternoon.
I'm on my way to shoot for a magazine.
Director.
What?
What do you think of me?
Go away.
This book's difficult.
If I lose my focus, I'll have to read it from the beginning.
Look at me and answer my question.
How do I look today?
You're pretty.
Now go.
Director.
Director.
Can't you like me?
Love triangles are only complicated if you make it that way.
It can be simple if you think of it that way.
All we have to do is keep quiet.
I'll stay quiet.
Let's be together.
I'll keep it a secret from In Young, okay?
Stop.
Director.
What kind of friends are three of you?
Ah, we have been friends since we were in the junior high school.
Were we 9th grade?
Yes, a few days before the summer break when we were 9th grade.
Then, were you all attending the same school?
No, we all attended different schools, but later we went to the same high school.
We became friends because of a man.
What should I do?
It's a "trench-coat" man!
[An exhibitionist pervert]
The first one I met was Woo Ji Hee.
- Hey!
Let go of me!
Don't we need to run away?
!
- Do something!
What a fXXXing #%$^%^@$ bastard!
Jae Kyung was a bit different from us since then.
Hey are you going to let that bastard run away?
Catch him!
Hey, get back here, you!
HEY!
HEY!
HEY!
HEY!
YOU'RE DEAD WHEN WE CATCH YOU!
-HEY YOU PERVERTED BASTARD!
-STOP!
HEY!
KILL HIM!
Ow, it hurts!
It hurts!
I haven't done anything wrong.
I was going to buy ramen, but it was bothersome to wear clothings, so I just wore this coat only.
But they came and just started hitting me.
No we didn't!
That man is a flasher.
I've seen him three times!
He's really popular at my school-
There's no need for those words.
Just...
Make him take off his underwear.
There is a mole near his bellybutton.
One at 3 o'clock direction, and another at 7 o'clock.
Right, at his thigh, there is red spot looking like Korean peninsula.
You're saying that you saw it?
!
Anyway, it's obvious that this guy flashed us.
Do you need anything more definite?
You're really detailed and smart.
Totally cool, totally!
How old are you guys?
Even though no one sees me that way, I am 16.
-Me too.
-Me too.
Starting with you, give me your names.
Woo Ji Hee from Sameun Girl's Junior High School.
"Woo Ji Hee
The most common 33-year-old
Studied devotedly and got into the company that she wanted.
Steadily building up her career!
Joo Yeol Mae, Kayeon Girl's Junior High School.

Woo Ji Hee, Joo Yeol Mae, Seon Jae Kyung.
The characters of your last names make up "U-Ju-Seon".(Pun
- Ujuseon in Korean means space ship)
Space ship.
Space ship?
So it's been 17 years now.
What do you think the key is to maintaining such a long friendship?
Having no secrets.
We tell each other everything.
Even the most embarassing parts.
I still couldn't tell Ji Hee about what happened that day.
Actually, we can't tell each other everything.
But what I believe is key is that no matter when, no matter what happens, we'll be on each other's side in the end.
Even if we can't understand each other 100%, we always accept each other the way we are.
Since we do that, we can really understand at least some parts.
I see.
I'll take your pictures now.
All three of you, please turn toward the camera this way.
1, 2, 3!
My story is the smallest one...
Excuse me.
Oh my god.
Hello.
Why do you keep following me?
!
Do you work here?
You're a stranger.
It doesn't matter whether I work here or not.
If you are here, watch a movie and go!
I don't remember you at all.
Don't act like you know me!
-Boss, the new manager is here today-
-Hold on a minute.
I need to breathe deeply first.
What's wrong?
I just met the person that I didn't want to meet.
Why is the world so small?
Anyway, the new manager was actually coming from the marketing team of the head office.
The rumor about him is very bad.
Last year, he was going to marry, but later he was disengaged.
His ex-fiancee was a lawyer.
But, his ex and her friends came to the office and made all rukus.
She must have gotten caught cheating.
Anyway, after that, his reputation at Marketing team was ruined, so this is a demotion for him.
Why is coming here a demotion?
There are so many people who desperately want to work here!
Excuse me....
You must be crazy.
Why the hell are you here?
!
Miss Ji Hee, wait.
Why are you acting like this, really?
!
Our new manager is coming soon.
Get out!
Please hurry up and leave!
Manager, the HR file!
Manager, please take a look at this first.
I must be crazy!
Why do they look so similar?
Please get a hold of yourself, Manager.
Are you possibly....this person, Branch Manager Kim Tae Woo?
Yes, that's me.
Yeol Mae,
I think I should die.
If you want to leave your will, tell Jae Kyung, not me.
You're too harsh.
The guy who witnessed the bottom of my sex life came here as the branch manager of my company.
Mr. Namsan Nosy?
Yea.
It's the time I should die, isn't it?
Are you planning on quitting?
To work in this company, you know how hard I studied.
Why would I write a resignation letter for that?
You spoke well for once.
Embarrassment is short but earning a living is long.
Will my embarrassment really be short?
Yea.
Shorter than earning a living.
Boss, shall I put this here?
Yes.
Thank you.
But, what is this piece of wood?
When you orgasmed, you were as stiff as a piece of wood!
It's a piece of jujube tree which was struck by lightening.
Ah, so this is the one known to chase out all the evil spirits, isn't it!
Yes that's right.
I went through some bad things in the past.
Often I had nightmares during sleeping.
So did you had good effects?
Yes, well...
What are these stones?
It was totally like a rock!
Like a huge rock!
What do you mean, a rock?
You can just call this a small stone, ok?
You're so sensitive.
A rock or a small stone...
How are they the same?
!
Rocks and stones are different.
But why are you bringing these rocks with you?
That rock is....
That stone is for Kohkhloma, which is a folk art to paint on the stone..
Miss Kang Mi Joo!
Yes?
Will you leave for a minute?
I have something to discuss with the Branch Manager.
Yes.
What is this?
So...it's a resignation letter?
Miss Ji Hee.
I know that you feel embarrassed and ashamed.
I understand, ok?
But on this kind of unlucky day, throwing a resignation might look a bit cool for a moment, but after that, it's not cool at all.
Do you understand?
It's the reality that if we put the recruitment notice for one person, 1,000 people apply for it.
Even people with master degrees.
So, when I was in the head office, I endured more..
It's not a resignation though..
Why are you going overboard?
Protocol.
Name:
Kim Tae Woo 1.
I, the aforementioned, will never reveal the events that were seen and heard on June 24th at Namsan.
2.
I will not tease Woo Ji Hee with those events later on.
3.
Especially words like "orgasm", "piece of wood", and "rock" will not come from my lips.
4.
If I break any of these even by accident, I, Kim Tae Woo, will hand in my resignation and transfer jobs.
I have to quit?
5.
Finally, Kim Tae Woo and Woo Ji Hee met for the first time today.
Sign it and stamp your fingerprint, please.
What happens if I don't?
STD, sterility, premature ejaculation, impotence!
I'll curse you so that you'll never be able to get out of any of these!
You know what happens if a woman bear a grudge on you.
Please, ok?
You two are finished talking, right?
Since the new manager came, let's celebrate with cola.
Let's do a cheers refreshingly once~!
-Why did it have to be cola?
- Let's do it with sprite!
Ah, seriously.
In the meantime, my 6th dating with Seok Hyun was going on smoothly.
Miss, where do you like it?
I haven't had enough yet.
Let's kiss a litte more.
Yoon Seok Hyun!
We got more and more passionate.
You're leaving again?
Just for 1 hour!
No, 2 hours!
I keep on starting to like this man again.
I'll have to set up a new law.
You keep on breaking things we decided we weren't going to do.
Like what?
Holding my hand and skinship outside of bed.
So?
You don't like it?
We have to make it definite!
You agreed too.
I like it the way it is right now though.
I almost told him that I started loving him again.
Why are you hesitating?
If you confess that you like him, will you get choked to death or something?
You two, don't forget that Yoon Seok Hyun and I are just sex partners.
It's too liberal of a relationship.
No, it's too classic.
"Dating" was the concept developed from Europe in 19th century.
It didn't exist before then.
Then what did people in old times do instead of dating?
They just slept together.
No way!
Originally, the instincts of animals don't include dating.
Oher than humans, are there any animals dating?
If there is, tell me.
They probably did, it's just that we don't know about it.
I heard that a male lion doesn't mate with other female lion if his parter is sick.
What's the reason for that?
In case of lions, female ones are stronger, so he must be scared to be beaten up to death.
Isn't it simple?
Then are you saying we have to catch men with strength too?
No, with instincts.
The chance that's been given to you is the night.
At night, try to catch him well then.
How?
Try to become the most passionate woman in the world so that he'll never want to let you go to another man.
I'm already passionate enough without doing that.
What's the problem?
If you've started liking him again, you can just like him.
Nothing's changed.
It seems like he still has no thoughts of getting married.
Really?
I really don't understand that about Sunbae.
Right?
Sleeping with Seok Hyun?
Yea, it's good.
The kissing is good, sleeping together is good, waking up and holding each other is good too.
But something's missing:
There's no future.
You didn't realize that there are a lot of couples break up after the promise to get married?
But when Sunbae said he had no thoughts of marrying you, was that how he really felt?
Those are his true feelings.
-Can you be sure of that?
-Yea.
Three years ago we talked about it, and we didn't break up right away.
I kept waiting and trying to persuade him because I couldn't believe it either.
We broke up in the end because of that.
Think of the present only.
Don't make the unhappiness while worrying about the future which your don't know if it will come or not.
If you want to touch, then touch.
If you want to sleep together, then sleep together.
I'm saying that I want more!
Do you really want to get married that badly?
Take a look at me!
I want to have kids that look like Seok Hyun and raise them together with him.
My grandmom keeps asking me why I don't have a family.
I want to make my own household, though it's a bit old-fashioned.
No it's not.
I'm also getting worried more and more.
What if I miss the timing to have a baby while I'm wasting my time.
This seems like a problem with instinct.
Even if you're greedy about it, there is no end to it.
Just concede if it looks enough.
If you don't like it, you can just end it.
So, such a smart person like you, how...
Why did you stop in the middle of talking?
Anyway, you alone is so cool!
(sarcastic)
Just a minute.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Until when are you going to hide it from her?
I already told her that I was cheating.
Ji Hee doesn't believe that.
I didn't either until I saw you at that motel.
You your husband, you're the "show window" couple, aren't you?
What's so wrong about that?
How long do you think that you can fool people?
You two are cheating on each other behind, but in front of others, you pretend as a perfect couple.
Aren't you anxious?
Jang Woo doesn't know that I'm meeting up with Jeong Min.
It's your life, and I don't have any right to intervene in it.
I'm just scared that you'll get hurt.
Nothing like that will happen.
Who am I?
I'm Seon Jae Kyung.
Jae Kyung smiled like that, but she didn't realize that everything wasn't as easy as she thought it was.
Because of your husband's request,
I reviewed all documents from you, but the financial status of you company isn't doing so well, so...
In case of the finance, if you, CEO Eom, decide the investment this time, it will all be solved.
Personally, I want to invest trusting you 100%, but my company also has its own protocol.
The executive team is opposing it.
Tell Jeong Woo to make an investment as an individual investor.
It's anyway his wife's company.
Oh, you came home early.
Yea.
Shall we have a glass of wine?
Yeah, sounds good.
You selected a Bordeaux wine, but prepared the glasses for Bourgogne?
Oh, sorry!
I forgot.
Bring the right glasses.
You met CEO Eom today, right?
You heard?
Is the situation of your company that bad?
So that's why I'm saying, will you invest in my company?
That's a bit difficult.
Then, lend me some.
We promised each other before we got married that we would never talk about money.
Haven't we agreed to deal with money separately?
That's why I added money too when we bought this house.
Of course, you had to.
Is this my house only?
You're a co-owner of it as well.
So, because of that, you received the award for "Equality Husband".
Did I take it because I wanted to?
I took it because they gave it to me.
The company is going through a hard time.
It will be enough if we hang in there until the launching show.
The products of our new brand came out really great.
I need to lauch it before the fall.
I'm really confident, Jang Woo.
Solve it yourself.
It's your company.
Then, let me get a loan from the bank in security for our house.
If you go to the bank for that, you will die by my hands.
Behave yourself.
You're the former model known to all people in Korea, and a wife of Lee Jang Woo, who is the nationally renown TV announcer.
If there is a rumor you're trying to borrow money, do you think it will be good for us?
Are we a couple?
When one of us is having a hard time, we're worse than strangers.
Can we call that a couple?
Life is anyway living alone.
Don't lean on me.
I picked you because I don't like women who do that.
Don't you know that?
Is the wine good?
It's nice.
When I sit and watch you, it's funny to see you acting like you're so great.
Stop acting up.
Wine glasses?
You actually don't know which one is for Bordeaux and which one is for Bourgogne, do you?
First one I prepared was for Bordeaux.
Long body line so that the fragrance of wine can be left in the glass longer.
This is the glass for Bordeaux, you moron.
You crazy bitch...
Seon Jae Kyung, if you keep acting up like that, you will be struck at your back by me one day.
Have you been enduring me cheating until then?
You haven't, since you figure that there's something to gain, right?
Calculating the time, place and even the method.
What are you talking about?
You're pretty smart, but you're still far from being a match for me.
Jae Kyung couldn't even guess what her husband's words meant.
Only she could feel that something is approaching.
Can we become lovers even with this kind of relationship?
What I wanted was, not his flesh, but his soul.
This became more obvious as time went on.
I fulfilled that longing through my imagination.
Wake up, it's already the morning!
Take the sleep out of my eyes.
Iwantedto be loved.
But...
I didn't want to beg for it.
Get up!
Get up!
Why are you sleeping in someone else's room?
I had some alcohol last night...
So?
I know right?
Why did I come in here?
I don't like people climbing into my bed without my permission!
Ah, I don't feel good.
Will you go to have some hangover food with me?
Thank you.
Is she your girlfriend?
-Yes.
-No, I'm not!
She is my girlfriend.
We'll marry soon.
She's pretty, your girlfriend is.
What are you doing?
If someone asks, tell them we're dating.
Why should I become an accomplice of your lie?
She keeps saying that she would introduce her youngest daughter to me.
Because of what from you?
Just by looking at me,
I'm the top class candidate of grooms..
Why didn't you meet her once?
I don't like the mother-in-law.
She plays card games here every night.
You should tell her we're dating when we come here again.
Are you crazy?
If the rumor spreads,
I won't be able to find a groom!
If you can't find a groom, find a bride.
Even if it's an empty word, couldn't you say
"If you don't find any groom, pick me"?
If you don't find any, will you pick me?
Are you crazy?
I'm not good at hiding my mind, but I hid my real mind which got deeper and deeper behind the joke.
WhatI want... isn't passion.
It's warmth.
Oppa.
Act like you love me.
I said, act like you love me.
How do I do that?
When you started your first love, there's something that just comes out of them, a gaze that makes the heart flutter.
It's affectionate and warm... and shining.
That kind of gaze?
You know, when men want to draw women in, there's that kind of loving gaze.
Why so suddenly?
What I needed was not sex with Seok Hyun; rather, it was romance.
Oppa, do you know that you're really cool when you look at women with that kind of gaze?
Of course.
Because I'm doing that to look cool.
Try it!
Look at me with that kind of gaze.
Oh, you womanizer!
How could you do it that fast?
What is it?
Are you crying?
No!
When I looked at that, it felt like we were still in love.
I know right.
We went back to the old days, didn't we?
I still love Seok Hyun.
But, I'm not going to tell him that.
I'm definitely not going to go to him until he comes to me first.
What's up with you?
!
Go to your house.
Why?
There's beer left over.
Turn it back on.
I said go, go!
Go to your house!
Why do you keep coming over here?
!
Aigo, you're really crazy!
You're really out of your mind when you're like this!
That's right, I'm out of my mind!
So leave!
Just leave!
LEAVE!
Aish, what a crazy thing!
I'm right here.
What are you going to do?
!
I wasn't the only one who wanted romance more than I wanted sex.
Why don't you pick up your phone?
Do you think that I said that to hurt you?
I was trying to make sure we get along well because I really like you!
I meant that we should match each other on a basic level.
You put a mirror by the bed and bought racy panties.
Is that the basic level?
Just.. meeting my level,
I just wanted to enjoy my sex life better than the average level.
Baby, you said you love me!
That's right, I love you.
I love you, but-
Then why don't you pick up the phone?
I also have something that I'm dissatisfied with about you.
Dissatisfied?
What are you dissatisfied about?
I'll fix all of it!
I can fix everything, Ji Hee!
It's so boring doing it with you!
You are really
REALLY bad at it!
Ji Hee couldn't say those words, even to the end.
Don't you have to say it for me to know?
Ah, this is so frustrating, really.
At the end, she told him her sincere feeling.
Of course, she turned it around in a truly Ji Hee way.
Well... that's not everything about you and me, is it?
Then, what is everything?
Actually, I like it more when we're hugging each other than sleeping together.
When you lie down next to me giving your arm for my pillow.
Psychological interaction is also important, isn't it?
To me, the physical interaction is more important!
Sex life is more important than food to me!
Please bring it outside.
Yes, I understand.
I was definitely getting more lonely.
Where's the boss?
He didn't come today?
Why are you looking for me?
Can I go to listen to music today?
What's the mood for today?
I feel depressed and I hate myself?
It would be great if I had some kind of different love.
Are you dating?
No, it's nothing like that.
It's from "Chum Mil Mil"!
("Comrades:
Almost A Love Story")
"Yue Liang Dai Biao Wo De Xin."
[Moonlight shines to my heart.]
It's a song that I really like.
There's no way I wouldn't know it.
I watched this movie with Seok Hyun and he said that he definitely wanted to write a script for a love story like this movie.
Can I do it now?
No!
Hey!
What would it be like if we went back to that time?
If I had avoided Seok Hyun and ran away back then, what would we have been like now?
What are you thinking about?
If there is such a thing as fate.
What kind of fate?
The kind where no matter how much you turn and turn, you meet that person in the end.
Just like this movie.
So if you want to find out whether it's fate or not, you should go the end no matter what, huh?
What does that mean?
One day you meet by chance, and after that, the chance meetings keep repeating.
If you stick the name fate to chance, then don't you have to accept chance as fate in the end?
That's difficult.
For example?
For example...
I attended an academy in the past.
What kind of academy?
Just an academy, where I learned this and that.
I met a woman there.
[Guitar Class]
Hello.
Did you practice a lot?
Your fingers hurt a lot, don't they?
Was she pretty?
She wasn't that pretty...just, kind of alright?
Her body isn't all that great and she's kind of short.
And she doesn't really give off a particularly sexy feel.
But why are you looking at me?
Making me feel bad...
Anyway, that was a conincidence.
But exactly 5 years later,
I met that woman again.
You must have been so glad, right?
I couldn't even imagine that that woman was the same woman from the academy.
My memory isn't that good, just like someone else here.
I mean, there are even women who can't remember the men they've kissed.
Anyway, so then?
What are you doing, not waking her up?
Is this a hotel?
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
I just thought, "Some weird woman keeps coming to my coffee shop."
"I wish she wouldn't come."
How much is it?
$4.80.
Coffee King Coffee Class

I want to enter this.
When does it start?
The coffee class?
It starts next month, and it's 1 hour per week.
What time is it at?
There are various time schedules, so check about those and apply it.
[Application form for Hoon's Coffee Class]
Hyung..when did this woman come?
She came in the afternoon.
The...
The woman who often comes and sleeps here.
How did you remember the woman's name?
It's a unique name.
Hey, it can't be as unique as mine.
My nick name was "heavy-laden" Joo Yeol Mae.
["Yeol Mae" means "fruit" in Korean.]
So, when does the fate show up?
Excuse me, so did we possibly...
Did we kiss?
We also met by coincidence at a different location...
Here.
How much is it?
Because we kept meeting by coincidence like that, one day I realized that.
It's fate?
Would it be as big as fate?
I just think she's interesting, so I'm observing her now.
"We must be bound by something" is what I thought.
It's fate, fate!
Don't miss out on that woman and be sure to catch her!
It's ok even if her face is not so pretty.
People don't realize I'm pretty either when they first look at me.
But this kind of face gets pretty the more you look at it.
And a woman's body shape?
You can't figure out from outside look.
Originally, a skinny-looking woman can have a fruitful body inside.
Fr...fruitful?
!
I'm sorry.
I usually speak roughly.
So, you play the guitar?
It's tuned well.
Do you play it often?
Well, just from time to time.
Give me your hand.
My hand?
Why?
I'm a composer anyway.
If I see the hand, I know right away.
Oh, you must play a lot!
Looking at the calluses on your hands.
Do you usually just grab mens' hands like it's nothing at all?
So, Shin Ji Hoon, your hobbies are playing guitar, using tools, listening music, taking photos, and what..?
Ah, reading books.
Are they all?
Well, I can say they are.
So, you like things you can do by yourself.
Things you should try by yourself.
I knew it!
That's because you have a bad personality.
Picky and secretive.
So, it's hard for you to get along with other people.
But wait, why are you speaking informally to me?
Are you close to me?
That's..
I'm talking to myself, not talking informally.
But you just spoke informally again.
How old are you?
I'm 33.
People don't think so because I look younger than my age...but, I'm your nuna, right?
I'm 33 too.
So what?
Then what?
We can just be friends then and both speak informally.
Fine!
One moment!
Do you know how happy I was after writing that scenario?
So what are you telling me to do?
You know how that feels because you're a writer, right?
That scenario you cut, pasted and remade as you wanted,
I put my heart into it and really thought I wrote it well, so I couldn't sleep for several days.
You know how that felt, in the past.
She came here yesterday too.
She asked if she can return the prize money so that she can take the scenario back.
She's as stubborn as a bull.
I Need Romance 2012
It's pretty, isn't it?
When I'm not here, you can put it over there in the corner, and when we work together, we can pull it out here.
Ah, but as I put the desk here,
I feel like being a student in front of the teacher.
By the way, what is this big bag?
We're co-writers.
Now I'll eat and sleep here often.
For sleeping, go to your home.
I'm not working at night unless really necessary.
You have lots of rooms here.
You're so harsh.
Uh?
Hello!
I'm co-writing with sunbae now.
I was really rude, wasn't I?
Please take care of me in the future.
Please take care of me.
Okay.
Explain to me how this happened.
I couldn't do it.
And I remembered the old days.
So, are you going to co-write with her?
Yea.
I couldn't believe it was the same girl on the other night.
She looks much brighter.
Doesn't she?
After diciding to co-write, from the moment we stepped out of the coffee shop, she never stopped talking.
When we came home, she ran around all places, my work room and 2nd floor.
I thought she was bold and wild, but she's just a kid.
A baby.
Your face turned red.
Who?
That isn't funny!
Do you know how old she is?
She's 25.
How big is our age difference?
Men like younger women.
I'm not into that kind of woman.
I like a woman who's in the age group as me.
That's me, Yoon Seok Hyun.
A woman who grew up in same time, feeling same sentiments.
There's a woman like that, right here!
She was such a girl who stormed into the home of the writer who adapted her piece, and argued.
That's why you brought her home.
Because you were unconsciously attracted by her such acts.
Isn't it?
That kind of interpretation is delusion,
Joo Yeol Mae.
It's a lie.
This is the habit that comes out when Seok Hyun is lying.
I can't say for sure with the impressions I get from the other night, yesterday and today, but she is pretty comfortable than I thought.
How many times are you going to say that?
So be good to her.
Why do I have to do that?
She'll spend time here as of tomorrow, but you're a bit picky to other people.
Aren't you picky then?
Yes, I know I'm picky.
But is it natural to bring her to your house even though she didn't have a good first impression?
You don't even know what time of woman she is, how can you conduct business together?
And I live here too!
Even if there are walls,
I often come in and out.
I'm like an idiot.
I'm being jealous of a kid I've only seen twice.
At that moment, I really hated myself.
I hated the me that started falling in love with him again and the me that couldn't tell him truthfully.
The me that was obsessed over marriage...
The me that couldn't just coolly say "Let's just sleep together"....
The me that kept getting greedier and greedier...
Hey, where are you going without washing the dishes?
Ah!
Are you ok?
Don't put your hands on me.
So, I always told you to put the chair back after eating!
Let's have a look.
I told you not to touch me!
I'm fine!
I said I'm fine!
No.
I'm not okay.
What's wrong?
I'm really a mess.
It hurts so much...
Doesn't it seem swollen?
No.
It's not swollen.
It doesn't even hurt that much.
Try to walk.
I said I'm perfectly fine.
Something's wrong, isn't there?
Why else would a person's emotions change so suddenly?
When did they not?
You need to talk about it.
I'll never tell you, even if you look at me like that.
Why?
Because I don't want to be hurt by you again.
He's this kind of man.
The kind of man that doesn't catch on to what those words mean.
A man who doesn't ask back.
A man that didn't hold onto me when I said to break up.
He was always that kind of man.
It's not like I didn't know.
It's not that I didn't know that the closer I went to him, the more he would push me away.
But my heart kept going to that man.
Of course.
We're only in a relationship where we sleep together.
Don't forget what you said.
That we're only sex partners.
Remember that if we find a new person, then we end this relationship quietly too.
Don't forget that it's the same if I find a new woman.
You cleaned.
I went for grocery shopping.
The fridge was totally empty.
Did you eat?
You monster.
What is it?
!
Why are you acting like this again?
!
Go die.
I wish you would die!
Aish, this..!
Are you being jealous?
His prince disease is back.
I don't have other feelings for you.
Try and find out who's the one with the problem.
You'd better be prepared, because I'm going to kill you.
No, that car's being weird.
Seon Jae Kyung, if you keep acting up likd this, you will be struck at your back by me one day.
What is it?
You're pretty smart, but you're still far from being a match for me.
Why are you acting like this?
You've been snapping since earlier!
Are you being jealous?
Am I too valuable to give away?
We're here.
Get off.
My heart is completely messed up right now.
My heart's messed up because of you.
Oh!
It worked!
I made a heart!
Ohh~
I fixed your heart.
Previously on "Lights Out"...
Were you a good dancer, Bampa?
Not bad.
Not as good as my wife.
I bet on the fight.
How much?
You looked good the other night.
Boxing.
It used to be the sport of kings.
Just needs someone to reclaim the throne.
I'd like to help you get it back.
You got no choice, Lights.
I own your comeback.
Barry's got the rights to your next fight.
And options on your next two.
Brother Patrick, we're partners.
Barry Word is a cancer on this sport.
How hard would it be to promote a fight without him?
Who's that man with aunt Margaret?
How much does Barry want?
More than we can afford.
I'll talk him down and I'll front that.
We're almost family now.
Just get me to the fight.
Time.
Time.
Good.
Got to give Romeo credit.
You look much freer in there.
I feel good.
Two weeks to go.
You're peaking at the right time.
When are we gonna talk strategy?
Huh?
When are we gonna talk strategy?
How many fights have you fought... 37 professional, 100 amateur?
112.
So what can I tell you that you don't already know?
Pops, I box, you think.
That's our deal.
Yeah.
Well, if I hadn't thought so goddamn much, you might have won your last fight against Reynolds.
You didn't cost me my me...
It's history.
I can't do this with you and me tap-dancing around each other.
Okay.
You want my two cents?
No bullshit?
He's a much better fighter than he was five years ago.
He's added 20 pounds of muscle, and he's got the confidence of a champion.
Now, you cannot let him dictate the pace of this fight.
You got to tie him up, and you got to pick your spots.
Think Ali-Foreman.
A war of attrition.
You let him punch himself out for seven or eight rounds, and then, when he begins to tire, you make your move and you knock him out.
You'll be the last man standing.
How do you know?
Because you always are.
I need to speak with you.
When we're done, Barry.
Now.
In private.
Away from the circus.
What the hell are you up to?
Getting ready for the fight.
Do not toy with me.
The odds of your winning this fight are in free fall.
Overnight, they've gone from 2-1 to 5-1.
That does not happen from out of nowhere.
You think I'm taking a dive?
Are you crazy?
Why would I do that?
Because you're dead broke and you know you can't win.
I'm getting my belt back, Barry.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Lights.
You listen to me, now.
Listen to me.
Barry K. Word does not promote fixed fights.
You can't sell them.
And you tell your new partner, Mr. Brennan, whatever he's planning is not going to happen.
This is my fight.
This is my division.
This is my game.
Nothing happens behind my back...
No-thing!
Mom?
Oh!
Hello, pumpkin.
Oh!
What are you doing here?
I'm back.
I could've scrap money together and go somewhere...
Arizona or Palm Springs, but I hate the heat.
And Arizona, it's like a furnace.
That's what I hear.
This one was near Joliet, and it was an outpatient program... you know, 12 steps, one day at a time.
Good for you, mom.
Well, we both know it was time for me to get sober.
I'm happy for you.
You look terrific.
Oh.
Sunglasses are the secret, sweetie.
Sunglasses and a little lipstick will take you to the market.
You been getting the money I sent you?
I know it's not much.
Stop.
That money saved my life, honey... every month.
All the years you've supported me,
I want to do the same for you.
I'm fine, mom.
That's not what I've been reading.
Arrested?
Stabbed?
If it was Johnny, I'd get it, but you?
What is going on with my baby?
Just hit a bad run.
It's all behind me.
Good, because not everyone gets a second chance in life.
You still with your drummer friend?
Lester passed away in march.
Emphysema.
I'm sorry.
Look, I don't want to be a distraction.
I just wanted to see you.
Where you staying?
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'll find something.
Come on.
You haven't seen the house we built.
And I got three girls at home that ask about you all the time.
You know, I held Ava when she was born, but the others...
Is it too late, do you think, for them to have a grandma?
� Da-dun, da-dun, da-dun-dun-dun �
You're so pretty.
Where do you girls think you got your cheekbones?
Oh.
What have we here?
Oh.
Oh.
Wow.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, honey.
I forgot the...
Oh, that's okay.
Thank you.
What is it?
A nail rescue kit.
You know, it's very important for young ladies to have luxurious nails.
Katie, how do I look?
Is this from when you were a dancer?
Now, how do you know about that?
Grandpa told her.
Oh, did he?
Well, I don't like to brag, but I could move.
When I was Ava's age, I was a showgirl in Las Vegas.
I even spent one winter in Rio.
Rio?
I'm so dying to go there.
She still looks great, doesn't she?
Yeah, of course she does.
When was the last time you two talked?
I mean...
I call and leave messages on her birthday and on mother's day.
You do?
Mm-hmm.
You never told me.
I thought you were still furious with her.
I think she's here to make amends.
With your family?
Good luck.
I know.
But if not now, when?
Just take it one step at a time with her, okay?
I'll go make up her room.
Yeah.
They were big and famous like Michael Jackson.
You see the line?
5-1.
6-1 as of this morning.
I locked my money in.
What the hell is going on?
Well, you're 40 years old, you've fought two rounds in five years, and you're coming off a stab wound?
You're lucky you're not 10-1.
Right, but how could the line move so fast?
Could they have the ref?
No, it's too early.
Besides, the ref's not a guarantee.
Neither is a judge.
The only lock...
Is a fighter.
Did someone come to you?
What are you talking about?
Barry thinks Brennan's gonna try to fix this fight.
Nobody came to me.
I swear on Dylan's life.
No matter what I've done...
I don't even have the time to list it right now...
I would never do that.
Ever.
It's my belt.
No one's gonna stop me from getting it back.
There you are.
I've been saving your booth for an hour.
Yeah?
Who you saving all these other booths for?
Coffee?
Stay for a sec?
Family meeting?
If this is about Hal...
No.
Nothing like that.
I don't even know how to start this.
You're having another kid?
No way.
If it's a girl, you better throw it back.
Enough out of you.
What?
It's common sense.
Mom's in town.
She showed up yesterday.
Did she?
Two weeks before a championship fight.
It's not like that.
She seems different.
She wants to see you guys...
to apologize, I guess.
So I'm having dinner at the house Saturday night, and I'd like you both to come.
I don't have a mother.
She's been dead to me since the day she walked out.
Come on, Margaret.
She can go to hell.
I guess she's not coming to dinner.
Champ, I know mom's got like five mini operas and a tragedy, but you got the biggest fight of your life coming up.
She's the last thing we need right now.
But she's here.
And something about it feels right.
I want you to give her a chance.
I mean, how many have I given you?
Now, on "All Access", we put Leary and Reynolds "In the Box!"
Your host, Charlie Bey.
All right, gentlemen.
Round 1.
Lights, Vegas has you as a 6-1 underdog.
Is that fair?
I've been underestimated my whole life.
It just gives me strength.
Why don't you ask Rich if the odds are helping him sleep better.
Ask him yourself.
The whole world knows who won our last fight, and so do you.
We're gonna settle this.
Trillion-dollar question...
What does Death Row say next?
"We're gonna settle this..."
"Once and for all"?
No.
"On September 6th"?
Nope.
"For the last time"?
No.
And it doesn't matter, because it's all the same.
It's crap.
Predictable and boring.
What are you talking about?
These guys couldn't hate each other more.
That's not a show, it's a loop.
I've got Lights saying, "You ducked me."
I've got Reynolds threatening to retire him for good.
It's like every fight since the dawn of time.
Morales drank his own urine on my show.
That was entertainment.
I need Lights to amp things up.
He did get stabbed, then indicted.
That's not enough for you?
It's before camp.
None of it's on film.
Wow.
You're insatiable.
You want to take me out to dinner?
For real?
No.
But I can suck it up if you can make things interesting.
I need a story.
Otherwise I'm gonna have to make shit up.
You would do that?
That's the great thing about news today.
It's halfway around the world before anyone checks a single fact.
Throw a rock in a pond, watch the ripples.
That's it.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
All right.
You look sharp, kid.
That's everything we talked about.
Now I want you to change your shoes and get ready to run.
You owe me six miles.
Look at you.
Hm.
Still in the ring with our boy.
Mom.
What are you doing here?
I came to watch you spar.
I hope that's okay.
Hello, sailor.
He's got to keep that right up.
Yeah.
I know.
He knows.
Did you see his left cross?
Oh.
Thing of beauty.
Mae-Mae.
Um, when did you get here?
Day before yesterday.
Ah.
Listen, um, I want to get out of this, uh, wet shirt.
Um, get your mom, uh, something to drink or...
Or something to eat or...
All we got are these lousy sports waters.
Mom, you should have called or something, given me a heads-up.
You still worry too much, Patrick.
You can't take care of everyone all the time.
The place still smells the same.
Just for clarity...
Um, when you say dinner, are you including breakfast the next morning?
What's she doing here?
John Fitzgerald Leary.
Just look at you.
You're so handsome!
And tall.
Who stretched you?
A lot happens when you miss 17 years, mom.
All right.
It's okay.
I deserve it.
How's your son?
His name is Dylan.
Oh, good.
You named him after your grandfather.
That's thoughtful.
Is this your lady friend?
No.
She's...
I'm Charlie.
Short for Charlotte.
I'm doing interviews.
I'm Mae.
Short for Mae.
I'm the mom.
I didn't know there was one.
Nice story.
Oh, you're looking for stories, sweets?
Have I got stories.
No.
Unh-unh.
Turn it off.
Turn it off.
Keep rolling.
Charlie, shoot anything you want around here, okay?
Go talk to the janitor for all I care.
He's a bigger part of the story than she ever was.
Maybe I should go.
Go where?
I was thinking of going by the old house.
Are you still there?
Where else would I be?
I hear the neighborhood's really gone uphill.
Is Judickie's bakery still around the corner?
Dad?
I'll buy you a powdered doughnut.
Big spender!
Hang on, pops.
We're in the middle of a workout.
Damn right you are.
Don't you, uh, owe me a run?
Huh?
I understand Barry came to the gym.
He did.
He's upset about the line.
Thinks you and me are gonna fix the fight.
What did he say exactly?
It doesn't matter.
'Cause if you're planning on asking me to take a dive, get another plan.
Dive?
Son, that is the last...
I've worked too hard to get here.
You'll have to kill me first.
And do me a favor.
Stop calling me "son."
We're not family.
Grandma!
Grandma, look!
Oh, sweetie!
That's lovely.
Katie, let me see.
Come here.
No!
No!
What are you doing?
No!
Just a taste.
No, you can't have that.
Mmm.
Reminds me of St. Patrick's day.
You remember.
When we were kids, she would never let us taste it.
She made us wait forever.
That's because it's supposed to simmer all day long.
Hey, honey.
Dylan.
Why don't you take a taste of this?
You can have a taste of this.
Here.
Tell grandma what you think.
There.
It's rich.
Yes!
Rich.
Rich is good.
Rich is good.
Why don't you stir for grandma?
Sure.
He's very intuitive, Johnny.
An old soul.
I'll tell you what he is.
He's very sensitive.
So if you're planning on picking up and leaving any time soon, do me a favor...
Don't even talk to him.
Johnny, help me move some chairs?
Take it easy, will you?
You wanted me here.
This is how I get through it.
I can't believe you kept in touch with her for all these years.
Whose side are you on?
She's our mother.
Then how come she's never done anything in her whole life that wasn't for her?
Should we set the table, mom?
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, honey.
No, the good China.
Oh.
Okay.
Honey, why don't you help the kids go set the table?
Okay?
Okay.
You know, Johnny was Dylan's age when Robert made him start boxing.
That's why I left the first time.
Really?
Yeah.
The family business.
You know, I couldn't stand it.
You should get down on your knees every day and thank God you've got three daughters.
They're safe.
I was so happy when I learned that you got Patrick to retire.
Yeah.
Well, and here we are, so...
Well, you can take the boxer out of the ring, but...
You left Robert for a musician?
Not a musician.
A drummer.
It was a lateral move.
So...
Do you think he'll win this fight?
Yeah.
Of course.
And then what?
Look who's here.
Looking very handsome.
Mmm.
Mae's Irish stew.
I brought dessert.
Oh, thanks, Robert.
And this is for you.
Why, thank you.
You look good in blue.
Yoo-hoo. [ Indistinct conversations, glass chiming ]
Oh, everybody.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
All right.
I have to say,
I-I wasn't expecting to be welcomed at all.
Patrick and Theresa, it means everything to be here tonight.
I've missed so many birthdays and special occasions.
This feels like one...
to me, at least.
I know I wasn't much of a mother.
I can't make up for lost time.
But with the days I have left,
I am going to make every one of them count If you'll let me.
Ah.
I'll drink to that.
I won't.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Grandma, we downloaded some music.
We've got the mambo.
We want to see you dance.
Oh, my goodness.
Robert?
Dance.
Come on.
Grandpa.
Ooh, grandpa!
Whoo!
Yeah, grandma.
Grandma, you go.
Yeah, grandpa.
Whoo!
Good job, grandpa.
Whoo!
Good job, grandma.
Whoo-hoo!
Oh, you guys are doing great.
Grandma can still dance.
Wow!
You still got it, Mae.
You always said that a boxer, the last thing to go was the punch.
Well, the last thing on a dancer is the legs.
Not yours.
This house...
It's sure a long way from our pull-out couch.
Yeah, there's a big price on this place.
I'm not just talking about dollars.
Peace.
I'm out of here.
I've seen this dance before.
It doesn't end well.
Thanks for coming.
Yeah.
I meant to ask...
You heard from Barry?
Not a peep.
Talk to Brennan?
He knows where I stand.
Good night.
He'll come around.
My mother didn't just leave 20 years ago.
She left every four or five.
She'd go out on a binge, disappear, and then crawl back.
I had to fill in for her...
Do my dad's laundry, take care of my brothers.
It robbed me of my life.
You know what I believe?
I believe the best days of your life are yet to come.
You promise?
Yeah.
Get down!
Get down!
Are you all right?
I'm f-fine.
What the hell happened?
Nobody got hurt.
I needed new windows anyway.
Maggie.
You got to be kidding me.
Flowers.
Purple posies, honey.
Your favorite as a girl.
Oh, don't even try.
Dad, get her out of here.
Margaret.
I-I just want be here for you, honey.
It figures you'd show up now.
Always a crisis junkie.
You know, I've been in the hospital before, and it must be nice to have your family around.
I am the one who got shot at!
I don't want her here.
Get her out.
Get her out!
Okay.
Come on, Mae.
Mae, let's go outside.
Margaret...
For Christ's sake.
I told you she was dead to me.
I'm sorry.
She just...
We're all...
If anything happened to you, I'd never forgive myself.
I told you...
it was no big deal.
It is a big deal.
Were you alone?
So Brennan was with you.
Yeah.
And he saved my life, okay?
Great.
Patrick?
Your mom's a little shaky.
Take her home.
We'll ride home with Johnny.
Home?
Are we safe?
Are the girls safe?
We'll put security on.
We'll be okay.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Yeah.
Well, I've seen this before.
I know what's going on.
You remember a middleweight in the '50s, a kid named Colletta?
Well, about a week before his fight,
Blinky Palermo and his goons put a bullet through his father's grocery.
Kid took a dive in the third round.
They're softening you up, son.
Softening me up?
Who?
Who knows?
It could be anybody.
Could be Barry.
Could be the Russians.
Could even be Brennan taking a shot at himself just to make it look good.
It doesn't matter.
All I know is somebody is coming.
They picked the wrong guy.
My honor's in that ring.
Everything you taught me.
I ain't taking a dive.
That's not what the line is saying.
Then we got to move it back.
How?
How are we gonna do that?
Throw a rock in the pond and watch the ripples.
Things are getting a little complicated.
It's going to take time.
Oh.
Sorry.
I got to go.
Robert.
He understands me.
Oh.
Well, uh, I made some lunch.
I-I thought you might be hungry.
Oh.
All right.
She thinks I abandoned her.
Come on.
She must have been 20 the last time I left.
Give me a break.
Now watch.
Just watch.
She's going to make it so toxic around here.
She's going to turn Robert against me.
What are you looking for?
A little Long Island for my iced tea.
Bingo!
Bingo, bingo, bingo.
Just a drop to steady my nerves.
Don't tell Patrick, please.
You understand, Theresa.
I know you do.
Understand what?
Well, how suffocating it is.
And you're in this house.
I was on a fold-out couch in the living room, taking care of all four of them.
I used to go into the city just for the conversation.
I went once and came back a year later.
Look, I'm not judging you, Mae.
It's why I went back to school.
I needed more.
But at the end of the day,
I don't want to miss out on this, on my family.
Well, I stayed as long as I could stomach it.
And this is what I get.
I'm standing outside Death Row Reynolds' apartment, where it appears the champ collapsed this morning after his workout.
Initial reports are that he suffered a mild heart attack.
Good lord.
Poor guy.
Is this for real?
It's on the news.
It must be true.
E.M.S. workers were called to the apartment but did not take Mr. Reynolds with them, fueling speculation of a possible domestic altercation in the Reynolds household.
And now back to you, Ben.
What did you do?
You said move the line.
It's at 3-1 and falling.
Nobody thinks you're throwing this fight anymore.
Oh, I got to take this.
Mike Fumosa.
Hey, buddy.
Nothing.
I'm watching the same news you're watching.
Not bad.
Got to wonder why a man in his prime is having a heart attack.
Yeah.
It's not a good time.
It's not great here either.
It's your mom.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
She's pretty upset.
She...
She had a drink or two at lunch.
She told me not to tell you.
You got to be kidding me.
Let me talk to her.
She just left.
I...
I called a car for her.
To go where?
I don't know.
I think to see your dad.
I know she was talking to him earlier.
Hey, pops.
Yeah.
Did you talk to mom today?
No.
Is she all right?
Which car company was it?
Tick-tock, baby.
Yeah, yeah.
What's taking you so long?
I told you...
It's more complicated than I thought.
It's not Robert's house, it's your house.
It's in your goddamn name, huh?
So just take him down to the bank and let's get the hell out of here.
To hell with his house.
Patrick's about to fight.
He wins, and we really go to the bank.
So just sit down and relax.
Don't you tell me to relax!
Hi, mom.
It's not what you think.
No?
No.
Unh-unh.
It's just, um...
You must be Lester.
You look good for a dead man.
You told him I was dead?
Shut up.
I don't see why she has to lie to you.
She's your mother.
You should give her what she deserves.
But no.
What do you do, hmm?
You send her a couple of hundred bucks every once in a while.
Big shot.
Heavyweight champ.
That's enough, Lester.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Shut the hell up.
You don't ever talk...
Watch out!
Watch out!
No!
No!
No!
What are you doing?
No!
Be careful...
Not his hand!
He has to play!
Come on.
Mae...
Mae...
We'll get it fixed.
Don't worry about it.
He broke my hand, baby.
We'll get it fixed.
We'll get it fixed.
He broke my hand.
Don't worry about it.
Oh.
He broke my hand.
Was any of it true?
He broke my hand.
Mae...
Mae...
He broke my hand, baby.
It's okay.
We'll get it fixed.
We'll get it fixed.
Do you have your interview?
Yeah.
Hey, honey.
You gonna be okay?
I guess.
I thought this time was different.
Her coming back.
The whole family together again.
Now...
Yeah, but we're together, the ones who matter, and we're behind you.
She's my mom.
I know.
I'm sorry.
You did everything you could.
Now, on "All Access,"
we put Leary and Reynolds "In the Box!"
Your host, Charlie Bey.
Okay, gentlemen.
Round two.
Perception versus reality.
Death Row, two days ago, you were a 6-1 favorite.
Now you're even money.
The world is wondering if you're okay.
I'm fine, 'cause nothing happened.
In fact, took an EKG this morning.
Take a look at it.
Look at it!
Yeah, I'm no doctor, but the lead-up to a fight can be very stressful.
If he's having health problems, my heart goes out to him.
Death Row, there are some other rumors swirling around, including one about a domestic incident...
No, Charlie.
There was no such thing.
Don't you get it?
You're smarter than that.
That's what desperation does.
This whole thing is a stunt.
He's the bum.
Lights, what do you say to that?
All I know is, a lot goes on in a family before a fight.
I'm blessed to have mine in my corner.
Death Row, will you be seeking a postponement?
That's a good question, Charlie.
Because after the fight, I don't want to hear any excuses.
Death Row don't make excuses.
I'll beat your ass right now.
We can do this right here!
Right now!
Save it for the fight.
Save it for the fight, guys.
Get off me.
I'm will whup that ass, Leary.
Bullshitting around.
You're lucky, son.
You know that?
You're a punk-ass bitch!
You all right?
You want to play games?
!
Play the game of whup-ass on your Irish ass.
You and me, Lights, in the box.
You having fun.
You and Johnny celebrating.
The cat that ate the canary!
This bullshit with the ambulance went too far.
I didn't have anything to do with that.
But you want to talk about too far?
Someone took a shot at my sister.
That wasn't me.
I had nothing to do with that.
Mm-hmm.
Nobody controls me, Barry.
And stay away from my family.
He said he would leave me if I didn't do it.
Mm-hmm.
It was his idea.
He forced me to do it.
I should have broken both his hands.
I'm so sorry, Patrick.
The last thing I want to do is hurt you.
I know.
I mean, you most of all.
You've been so good to me.
Just help me.
Please help me.
Help me get away from him.
I want to get clean...
I do, once and for all.
I want to be here with my real family, with my grandchildren.
I know you do.
Here.
20 grand.
Enough for a fresh start.
No, Patrick.
Please.
Go to Port Authority.
Take a bus to anywhere.
Stop it.
Was this Johnny's idea?
Or Theresa's?
She doesn't want me here.
I can tell.
She's restless, Patrick.
I know it when I see it.
You're going to lose her.
Mom...
Let's just pretend you never came.
It was better that way.
Oh, Patrick.
No.
Patrick.
That's it!
That's it!
Now finish him!
All right!
That's it!
Well done, son.
The fight should be tonight!
Whoo!
Great work.
Hey, why don't we all go out and grab some food?
Invite Mae, too.
Just like the old days.
Dad?
Yeah.
We need to talk.
She's gone.
Pretty lady.
Can I give you a lift home?
No, thanks.
I'll walk.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
My sister's fine, Hal.
Thanks for asking.
I'm as upset as you are, and I promise you,
I will never let her get in harm's way again.
Ever.
But you got to stop messing with things you don't understand.
That line was moved for a reason.
You win this fight, my house walks away with enough money to buy out your contract from Barry.
One week from tonight, you are heavyweight champion of the world,
I am running the game, and Barry Word is gone.
Forever.
Just be patient, son.
And get ready for war.
Previously on "Lights Out"...
Were you a good dancer, Bampa?
Not bad.
Not as good as my wife.
I bet on the fight.
How much?
You looked good the other night.
Boxing.
It used to be the sport of kings.
Just needs someone to reclaim the throne.
I'd like to help you get it back.
You got no choice, Lights.
I own your comeback.
Barry's got the rights to your next fight.
And options on your next two.
Brother Patrick, we're partners.
Barry Word is a cancer on this sport.
How hard would it be to promote a fight without him?
Who's that man with aunt Margaret?
How much does Barry want?
More than we can afford.
I'll talk him down and I'll front that.
We're almost family now.
Just get me to the fight.
Time.
Time.
Good.
Got to give Romeo credit.
You look much freer in there.
I feel good.
Two weeks to go.
You're peaking at the right time.
When are we gonna talk strategy?
Huh?
When are we gonna talk strategy?
How many fights have you fought... 37 professional, 100 amateur?
112.
So what can I tell you that you don't already know?
Pops, I box, you think.
That's our deal.
Yeah.
Well, if I hadn't thought so goddamn much, you might have won your last fight against Reynolds.
You didn't cost me my me...
It's history.
I can't do this with you and me tap-dancing around each other.
Okay.
You want my two cents?
No bullshit?
He's a much better fighter than he was five years ago.
He's added 20 pounds of muscle, and he's got the confidence of a champion.
Now, you cannot let him dictate the pace of this fight.
You got to tie him up, and you got to pick your spots.
Think Ali-Foreman.
A war of attrition.
You let him punch himself out for seven or eight rounds, and then, when he begins to tire, you make your move and you knock him out.
You'll be the last man standing.
How do you know?
Because you always are.
I need to speak with you.
When we're done, Barry.
Now.
In private.
Away from the circus.
What the hell are you up to?
Getting ready for the fight.
Do not toy with me.
The odds of your winning this fight are in free fall.
Overnight, they've gone from 2-1 to 5-1.
That does not happen from out of nowhere.
You think I'm taking a dive?
Are you crazy?
Why would I do that?
Because you're dead broke and you know you can't win.
I'm getting my belt back, Barry.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Lights.
You listen to me, now.
Listen to me.
Barry K. Word does not promote fixed fights.
You can't sell them.
And you tell your new partner, Mr. Brennan, whatever he's planning is not going to happen.
This is my fight.
This is my division.
This is my game.
Nothing happens behind my back...
No-thing!
Mom?
Oh!
Hello, pumpkin.
Oh!
What are you doing here?
I'm back.
I could've scrap money together and go somewhere...
Arizona or Palm Springs, but I hate the heat.
And Arizona, it's like a furnace.
That's what I hear.
This one was near Joliet, and it was an outpatient program... you know, 12 steps, one day at a time.
Good for you, mom.
Well, we both know it was time for me to get sober.
I'm happy for you.
You look terrific.
Oh.
Sunglasses are the secret, sweetie.
Sunglasses and a little lipstick will take you to the market.
You been getting the money I sent you?
I know it's not much.
Stop.
That money saved my life, honey... every month.
All the years you've supported me,
I want to do the same for you.
I'm fine, mom.
That's not what I've been reading.
Arrested?
Stabbed?
If it was Johnny, I'd get it, but you?
What is going on with my baby?
Just hit a bad run.
It's all behind me.
Good, because not everyone gets a second chance in life.
You still with your drummer friend?
Lester passed away in march.
Emphysema.
I'm sorry.
Look, I don't want to be a distraction.
I just wanted to see you.
Where you staying?
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'll find something.
Come on.
You haven't seen the house we built.
And I got three girls at home that ask about you all the time.
You know, I held Ava when she was born, but the others...
Is it too late, do you think, for them to have a grandma?
� Da-dun, da-dun, da-dun-dun-dun �
You're so pretty.
Where do you girls think you got your cheekbones?
Oh.
What have we here?
Oh.
Oh.
Wow.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, honey.
I forgot the...
Oh, that's okay.
Thank you.
What is it?
A nail rescue kit.
You know, it's very important for young ladies to have luxurious nails.
Katie, how do I look?
Is this from when you were a dancer?
Now, how do you know about that?
Grandpa told her.
Oh, did he?
Well, I don't like to brag, but I could move.
When I was Ava's age, I was a showgirl in Las Vegas.
I even spent one winter in Rio.
Rio?
I'm so dying to go there.
She still looks great, doesn't she?
Yeah, of course she does.
When was the last time you two talked?
I mean...
I call and leave messages on her birthday and on mother's day.
You do?
Mm-hmm.
You never told me.
I thought you were still furious with her.
I think she's here to make amends.
With your family?
Good luck.
I know.
But if not now, when?
Just take it one step at a time with her, okay?
I'll go make up her room.
Yeah.
They were big and famous like Michael Jackson.
You see the line?
5-1.
6-1 as of this morning.
I locked my money in.
What the hell is going on?
Well, you're 40 years old, you've fought two rounds in five years, and you're coming off a stab wound?
You're lucky you're not 10-1.
Right, but how could the line move so fast?
Could they have the ref?
No, it's too early.
Besides, the ref's not a guarantee.
Neither is a judge.
The only lock...
Is a fighter.
Did someone come to you?
What are you talking about?
Barry thinks Brennan's gonna try to fix this fight.
Nobody came to me.
I swear on Dylan's life.
No matter what I've done...
I don't even have the time to list it right now...
I would never do that.
Ever.
It's my belt.
No one's gonna stop me from getting it back.
There you are.
I've been saving your booth for an hour.
Yeah?
Who you saving all these other booths for?
Coffee?
Stay for a sec?
Family meeting?
If this is about Hal...
No.
Nothing like that.
I don't even know how to start this.
You're having another kid?
No way.
If it's a girl, you better throw it back.
Enough out of you.
What?
It's common sense.
Mom's in town.
She showed up yesterday.
Did she?
Two weeks before a championship fight.
It's not like that.
She seems different.
She wants to see you guys...
to apologize, I guess.
So I'm having dinner at the house Saturday night, and I'd like you both to come.
I don't have a mother.
She's been dead to me since the day she walked out.
Come on, Margaret.
She can go to hell.
I guess she's not coming to dinner.
Champ, I know mom's got like five mini operas and a tragedy, but you got the biggest fight of your life coming up.
She's the last thing we need right now.
But she's here.
And something about it feels right.
I want you to give her a chance.
I mean, how many have I given you?
Now, on "All Access", we put Leary and Reynolds "In the Box!"
Your host, Charlie Bey.
All right, gentlemen.
Round 1.
Lights, Vegas has you as a 6-1 underdog.
Is that fair?
I've been underestimated my whole life.
It just gives me strength.
Why don't you ask Rich if the odds are helping him sleep better.
Ask him yourself.
The whole world knows who won our last fight, and so do you.
We're gonna settle this.
Trillion-dollar question...
What does Death Row say next?
"We're gonna settle this..."
"Once and for all"?
No.
"On September 6th"?
Nope.
"For the last time"?
No.
And it doesn't matter, because it's all the same.
It's crap.
Predictable and boring.
What are you talking about?
These guys couldn't hate each other more.
That's not a show, it's a loop.
I've got Lights saying, "You ducked me."
I've got Reynolds threatening to retire him for good.
It's like every fight since the dawn of time.
Morales drank his own urine on my show.
That was entertainment.
I need Lights to amp things up.
He did get stabbed, then indicted.
That's not enough for you?
It's before camp.
None of it's on film.
Wow.
You're insatiable.
You want to take me out to dinner?
For real?
No.
But I can suck it up if you can make things interesting.
I need a story.
Otherwise I'm gonna have to make shit up.
You would do that?
That's the great thing about news today.
It's halfway around the world before anyone checks a single fact.
Throw a rock in a pond, watch the ripples.
That's it.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
All right.
You look sharp, kid.
That's everything we talked about.
Now I want you to change your shoes and get ready to run.
You owe me six miles.
Look at you.
Hm.
Still in the ring with our boy.
Mom.
What are you doing here?
I came to watch you spar.
I hope that's okay.
Hello, sailor.
He's got to keep that right up.
Yeah.
I know.
He knows.
Did you see his left cross?
Oh.
Thing of beauty.
Mae-Mae.
Um, when did you get here?
Day before yesterday.
Ah.
Listen, um, I want to get out of this, uh, wet shirt.
Um, get your mom, uh, something to drink or...
Or something to eat or...
All we got are these lousy sports waters.
Mom, you should have called or something, given me a heads-up.
You still worry too much, Patrick.
You can't take care of everyone all the time.
The place still smells the same.
Just for clarity...
Um, when you say dinner, are you including breakfast the next morning?
What's she doing here?
John Fitzgerald Leary.
Just look at you.
You're so handsome!
And tall.
Who stretched you?
A lot happens when you miss 17 years, mom.
All right.
It's okay.
I deserve it.
How's your son?
His name is Dylan.
Oh, good.
You named him after your grandfather.
That's thoughtful.
Is this your lady friend?
No.
She's...
I'm Charlie.
Short for Charlotte.
I'm doing interviews.
I'm Mae.
Short for Mae.
I'm the mom.
I didn't know there was one.
Nice story.
Oh, you're looking for stories, sweets?
Have I got stories.
No.
Unh-unh.
Turn it off.
Turn it off.
Keep rolling.
Charlie, shoot anything you want around here, okay?
Go talk to the janitor for all I care.
He's a bigger part of the story than she ever was.
Maybe I should go.
Go where?
I was thinking of going by the old house.
Are you still there?
Where else would I be?
I hear the neighborhood's really gone uphill.
Is Judickie's bakery still around the corner?
Dad?
I'll buy you a powdered doughnut.
Big spender!
Hang on, pops.
We're in the middle of a workout.
Damn right you are.
Don't you, uh, owe me a run?
Huh?
I understand Barry came to the gym.
He did.
He's upset about the line.
Thinks you and me are gonna fix the fight.
What did he say exactly?
It doesn't matter.
'Cause if you're planning on asking me to take a dive, get another plan.
Dive?
Son, that is the last...
I've worked too hard to get here.
You'll have to kill me first.
And do me a favor.
Stop calling me "son."
We're not family.
Grandma!
Grandma, look!
Oh, sweetie!
That's lovely.
Katie, let me see.
Come here.
No!
No!
What are you doing?
No!
Just a taste.
No, you can't have that.
Mmm.
Reminds me of St. Patrick's day.
You remember.
When we were kids, she would never let us taste it.
She made us wait forever.
That's because it's supposed to simmer all day long.
Hey, honey.
Dylan.
Why don't you take a taste of this?
You can have a taste of this.
Here.
Tell grandma what you think.
There.
It's rich.
Yes!
Rich.
Rich is good.
Rich is good.
Why don't you stir for grandma?
Sure.
He's very intuitive, Johnny.
An old soul.
I'll tell you what he is.
He's very sensitive.
So if you're planning on picking up and leaving any time soon, do me a favor...
Don't even talk to him.
Johnny, help me move some chairs?
Take it easy, will you?
You wanted me here.
This is how I get through it.
I can't believe you kept in touch with her for all these years.
Whose side are you on?
She's our mother.
Then how come she's never done anything in her whole life that wasn't for her?
Should we set the table, mom?
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, honey.
No, the good China.
Oh.
Okay.
Honey, why don't you help the kids go set the table?
Okay?
Okay.
You know, Johnny was Dylan's age when Robert made him start boxing.
That's why I left the first time.
Really?
Yeah.
The family business.
You know, I couldn't stand it.
You should get down on your knees every day and thank God you've got three daughters.
They're safe.
I was so happy when I learned that you got Patrick to retire.
Yeah.
Well, and here we are, so...
Well, you can take the boxer out of the ring, but...
You left Robert for a musician?
Not a musician.
A drummer.
It was a lateral move.
So...
Do you think he'll win this fight?
Yeah.
Of course.
And then what?
Look who's here.
Looking very handsome.
Mmm.
Mae's Irish stew.
I brought dessert.
Oh, thanks, Robert.
And this is for you.
Why, thank you.
You look good in blue.
Yoo-hoo. [ Indistinct conversations, glass chiming ]
Oh, everybody.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
All right.
I have to say,
I-I wasn't expecting to be welcomed at all.
Patrick and Theresa, it means everything to be here tonight.
I've missed so many birthdays and special occasions.
This feels like one...
to me, at least.
I know I wasn't much of a mother.
I can't make up for lost time.
But with the days I have left,
I am going to make every one of them count If you'll let me.
Ah.
I'll drink to that.
I won't.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Grandma, we downloaded some music.
We've got the mambo.
We want to see you dance.
Oh, my goodness.
Robert?
Dance.
Come on.
Grandpa.
Ooh, grandpa!
Whoo!
Yeah, grandma.
Grandma, you go.
Yeah, grandpa.
Whoo!
Good job, grandpa.
Whoo!
Good job, grandma.
Whoo-hoo!
Oh, you guys are doing great.
Grandma can still dance.
Wow!
You still got it, Mae.
You always said that a boxer, the last thing to go was the punch.
Well, the last thing on a dancer is the legs.
Not yours.
This house...
It's sure a long way from our pull-out couch.
Yeah, there's a big price on this place.
I'm not just talking about dollars.
Peace.
I'm out of here.
I've seen this dance before.
It doesn't end well.
Thanks for coming.
Yeah.
I meant to ask...
You heard from Barry?
Not a peep.
Talk to Brennan?
He knows where I stand.
Good night.
He'll come around.
My mother didn't just leave 20 years ago.
She left every four or five.
She'd go out on a binge, disappear, and then crawl back.
I had to fill in for her...
Do my dad's laundry, take care of my brothers.
It robbed me of my life.
You know what I believe?
I believe the best days of your life are yet to come.
You promise?
Yeah.
Get down!
Get down!
Are you all right?
I'm f-fine.
What the hell happened?
Nobody got hurt.
I needed new windows anyway.
Maggie.
You got to be kidding me.
Flowers.
Purple posies, honey.
Your favorite as a girl.
Oh, don't even try.
Dad, get her out of here.
Margaret.
I-I just want be here for you, honey.
It figures you'd show up now.
Always a crisis junkie.
You know, I've been in the hospital before, and it must be nice to have your family around.
I am the one who got shot at!
I don't want her here.
Get her out.
Get her out!
Okay.
Come on, Mae.
Mae, let's go outside.
Margaret...
For Christ's sake.
I told you she was dead to me.
I'm sorry.
She just...
We're all...
If anything happened to you, I'd never forgive myself.
I told you...
it was no big deal.
It is a big deal.
Were you alone?
So Brennan was with you.
Yeah.
And he saved my life, okay?
Great.
Patrick?
Your mom's a little shaky.
Take her home.
We'll ride home with Johnny.
Home?
Are we safe?
Are the girls safe?
We'll put security on.
We'll be okay.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Yeah.
Well, I've seen this before.
I know what's going on.
You remember a middleweight in the '50s, a kid named Colletta?
Well, about a week before his fight,
Blinky Palermo and his goons put a bullet through his father's grocery.
Kid took a dive in the third round.
They're softening you up, son.
Softening me up?
Who?
Who knows?
It could be anybody.
Could be Barry.
Could be the Russians.
Could even be Brennan taking a shot at himself just to make it look good.
It doesn't matter.
All I know is somebody is coming.
They picked the wrong guy.
My honor's in that ring.
Everything you taught me.
I ain't taking a dive.
That's not what the line is saying.
Then we got to move it back.
How?
How are we gonna do that?
Throw a rock in the pond and watch the ripples.
Things are getting a little complicated.
It's going to take time.
Oh.
Sorry.
I got to go.
Robert.
He understands me.
Oh.
Well, uh, I made some lunch.
I-I thought you might be hungry.
Oh.
All right.
She thinks I abandoned her.
Come on.
She must have been 20 the last time I left.
Give me a break.
Now watch.
Just watch.
She's going to make it so toxic around here.
She's going to turn Robert against me.
What are you looking for?
A little Long Island for my iced tea.
Bingo!
Bingo, bingo, bingo.
Just a drop to steady my nerves.
Don't tell Patrick, please.
You understand, Theresa.
I know you do.
Understand what?
Well, how suffocating it is.
And you're in this house.
I was on a fold-out couch in the living room, taking care of all four of them.
I used to go into the city just for the conversation.
I went once and came back a year later.
Look, I'm not judging you, Mae.
It's why I went back to school.
I needed more.
But at the end of the day,
I don't want to miss out on this, on my family.
Well, I stayed as long as I could stomach it.
And this is what I get.
I'm standing outside Death Row Reynolds' apartment, where it appears the champ collapsed this morning after his workout.
Initial reports are that he suffered a mild heart attack.
Good lord.
Poor guy.
Is this for real?
It's on the news.
It must be true.
E.M.S. workers were called to the apartment but did not take Mr. Reynolds with them, fueling speculation of a possible domestic altercation in the Reynolds household.
And now back to you, Ben.
What did you do?
You said move the line.
It's at 3-1 and falling.
Nobody thinks you're throwing this fight anymore.
Oh, I got to take this.
Mike Fumosa.
Hey, buddy.
Nothing.
I'm watching the same news you're watching.
Not bad.
Got to wonder why a man in his prime is having a heart attack.
Yeah.
It's not a good time.
It's not great here either.
It's your mom.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
She's pretty upset.
She...
She had a drink or two at lunch.
She told me not to tell you.
You got to be kidding me.
Let me talk to her.
She just left.
I...
I called a car for her.
To go where?
I don't know.
I think to see your dad.
I know she was talking to him earlier.
Hey, pops.
Yeah.
Did you talk to mom today?
No.
Is she all right?
Which car company was it?
Tick-tock, baby.
Yeah, yeah.
What's taking you so long?
I told you...
It's more complicated than I thought.
It's not Robert's house, it's your house.
It's in your goddamn name, huh?
So just take him down to the bank and let's get the hell out of here.
To hell with his house.
Patrick's about to fight.
He wins, and we really go to the bank.
So just sit down and relax.
Don't you tell me to relax!
Hi, mom.
It's not what you think.
No?
No.
Unh-unh.
It's just, um...
You must be Lester.
You look good for a dead man.
You told him I was dead?
Shut up.
I don't see why she has to lie to you.
She's your mother.
You should give her what she deserves.
But no.
What do you do, hmm?
You send her a couple of hundred bucks every once in a while.
Big shot.
Heavyweight champ.
That's enough, Lester.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Shut the hell up.
You don't ever talk...
Watch out!
Watch out!
No!
No!
No!
What are you doing?
No!
Be careful...
Not his hand!
He has to play!
Come on.
Mae...
Mae...
We'll get it fixed.
Don't worry about it.
He broke my hand, baby.
We'll get it fixed.
We'll get it fixed.
He broke my hand.
Don't worry about it.
Oh.
He broke my hand.
Was any of it true?
He broke my hand.
Mae...
Mae...
He broke my hand, baby.
It's okay.
We'll get it fixed.
We'll get it fixed.
Do you have your interview?
Yeah.
Hey, honey.
You gonna be okay?
I guess.
I thought this time was different.
Her coming back.
The whole family together again.
Now...
Yeah, but we're together, the ones who matter, and we're behind you.
She's my mom.
I know.
I'm sorry.
You did everything you could.
Now, on "All Access,"
we put Leary and Reynolds "In the Box!"
Your host, Charlie Bey.
Okay, gentlemen.
Round two.
Perception versus reality.
Death Row, two days ago, you were a 6-1 favorite.
Now you're even money.
The world is wondering if you're okay.
I'm fine, 'cause nothing happened.
In fact, took an EKG this morning.
Take a look at it.
Look at it!
Yeah, I'm no doctor, but the lead-up to a fight can be very stressful.
If he's having health problems, my heart goes out to him.
Death Row, there are some other rumors swirling around, including one about a domestic incident...
No, Charlie.
There was no such thing.
Don't you get it?
You're smarter than that.
That's what desperation does.
This whole thing is a stunt.
He's the bum.
Lights, what do you say to that?
All I know is, a lot goes on in a family before a fight.
I'm blessed to have mine in my corner.
Death Row, will you be seeking a postponement?
That's a good question, Charlie.
Because after the fight, I don't want to hear any excuses.
Death Row don't make excuses.
I'll beat your ass right now.
We can do this right here!
Right now!
Save it for the fight.
Save it for the fight, guys.
Get off me.
I'm will whup that ass, Leary.
Bullshitting around.
You're lucky, son.
You know that?
You're a punk-ass bitch!
You all right?
You want to play games?
!
Play the game of whup-ass on your Irish ass.
You and me, Lights, in the box.
You having fun.
You and Johnny celebrating.
The cat that ate the canary!
This bullshit with the ambulance went too far.
I didn't have anything to do with that.
But you want to talk about too far?
Someone took a shot at my sister.
That wasn't me.
I had nothing to do with that.
Mm-hmm.
Nobody controls me, Barry.
And stay away from my family.
He said he would leave me if I didn't do it.
Mm-hmm.
It was his idea.
He forced me to do it.
I should have broken both his hands.
I'm so sorry, Patrick.
The last thing I want to do is hurt you.
I know.
I mean, you most of all.
You've been so good to me.
Just help me.
Please help me.
Help me get away from him.
I want to get clean...
I do, once and for all.
I want to be here with my real family, with my grandchildren.
I know you do.
Here.
20 grand.
Enough for a fresh start.
No, Patrick.
Please.
Go to Port Authority.
Take a bus to anywhere.
Stop it.
Was this Johnny's idea?
Or Theresa's?
She doesn't want me here.
I can tell.
She's restless, Patrick.
I know it when I see it.
You're going to lose her.
Mom...
Let's just pretend you never came.
It was better that way.
Oh, Patrick.
No.
Patrick.
That's it!
That's it!
Now finish him!
All right!
That's it!
Well done, son.
The fight should be tonight!
Whoo!
Great work.
Hey, why don't we all go out and grab some food?
Invite Mae, too.
Just like the old days.
Dad?
Yeah.
We need to talk.
She's gone.
Pretty lady.
Can I give you a lift home?
No, thanks.
I'll walk.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
My sister's fine, Hal.
Thanks for asking.
I'm as upset as you are, and I promise you,
I will never let her get in harm's way again.
Ever.
But you got to stop messing with things you don't understand.
That line was moved for a reason.
You win this fight, my house walks away with enough money to buy out your contract from Barry.
One week from tonight, you are heavyweight champion of the world,
I am running the game, and Barry Word is gone.
Forever.
Just be patient, son.
And get ready for war.
(Male announcer) Previously on MasterChef...
One word for that-- [bleep].
(Announcer) A formidable ingredient...
This is a great example of what garbage is.
If you're gonna serve us crap like that, then you're really wasting our time.
(Announcer) That led to some disastrous results...
That is raw.
Raw pork!
(Announcer) And cost one cook the competition.
Alejandra, your time is done in MasterChef.
(Announcer) Tonight...
Christina's going down!
(Announcer) The cooks face off in a team challenge.
200 very hungry children.
[Bleep].
[Chanting] Burgers, burgers, burgers!
Here comes the big, bad wolf.
A chicken nugget burger deep-fried scares the [bleep] out of me.
(Announcer) The losing team competes in a terrifying pressure test.
(Gordon) The dish that puts the fear of God into any professional chef anywhere in the world.
(Announcer) Eight cooks remain to battle it out in front of three culinary heavyweights.
At stake-- $1/4 million and above all else, the title of MasterChef.
MasterChef 2x14 Top 8 Compete Original Air Date on August 1, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
The remaining eight home cooks have been dropped off in a Los Angeles neighborhood for an epic challenge where they'll be cooking for some very small but opinionated young critics.
(Suzy) We're walking up this hill and we see
"MasterChef Block Party."
I've done a ton of block parties, so I can definitely barbecue up a storm if that's what this challenge calls for.
(Derrick) Is that Graham hula hooping?
Graham is jumping around with his hula hoop.
For a big man, he's agile.
[Laughter]
That is impressive!
(Gordon) Good morning.
Morning.
Welcome to our block party.
Unfortunately today, you're not the guests.
There are 200 very hungry children...
[bleep] on their way.
200 children?
Just hurtling toward you, hungry, ready to stuff greasy food in their mouths and wipe their grubby little fingers all over you.
Worst nightmare I can think of.
And you are gonna have to prepare a stunning slider and a side for them.
Sounds easy, right?
But you know on MasterChef there are always catches.
(Graham) It'd be way too easy to please those kids with a meaty hamburger or greasy French fries.
Which is why you won't be able to use beef or potatoes.
[Overlapping chatter]
Oh, my God.
Get the kids to love what you do, because they're not just your guests.
They're also your judges in today's challenge.
What?
Kids have no filter, so they're gonna be as honest and as brutal as any of our critics have been.
So that part scares me a little bit.
As always, you'll be split into two teams.
Christian and Christine, the two of you had the best dishes in yesterday's elimination test, so you'll be today's team captains.
All right, Christian, you're picking first.
I need someone that can get on the grill.
He's been in the top quite a few times.
Being on Christian's team, I know he's just like,
"This is how it is.
This is how it goes."
And you have Christine who's kinda in like all over the place like emotionally.
I don't want to be on either team just because they're captains.
I'm going with Adrien.
(Gordon) Adrien.
Wow.
Christine.
I think this person is creative, has a delicate hand, possibly great with children.
So I pick Tracy.
(Gordon) Excellent.
Tracy, welcome to the red team.
He works well in the kitchen, and I think he's gonna be good on the prep.
Derrick.
You don't thin the undertaker's gonna cost you votes from these kids?
No.
I'm not gonna let him interact with the children.
(Gordon) Christine.
I think this person is great at strategizing, and it's Ben.
Welcome to red team.
Christian.
I really want to be on Christine's team.
I think she's gonna be a better leader.
Christian runs a team by dictatorship, and that's not really how I work.
I need somebody that's good with children.
Jennifer.
(Gordon) Wow.
Good choice.
[Quietly] Aaaah...
I'm not really thrilled, but I have to suck it up, and I know that I have to get my mindset in the right direction.
Suzy, last pick?
[Laughter]
I am left with Suzy.
You like her and you hate her.
She's annoying.
But as long as she remembers that I am the team Captain and that she follows my direction, then we'll be great.
Listen carefully.
The losing team will face the most difficult pressure test in MasterChef so far.
Trust me, this challenge is anything but child's play.
So focus.
Two hours prep, and then 60 minutes to serve.
Are you ready?
Yes, Chef.
Your time starts...
Now.
Off you go.
(Announcer) Each team will have two hours to prepare and cook sliders and sides for 200 hungry children.
The team that receives the most votes from the kids will be the winner, but first they must decide on their menus.
We're gonna do a simple Turkey burger.
Anything in it?
Salt, pepper?
Salt, pepper, little bit of onion and garlic?
Grated onion?
No, no, no.
Not even the grated, dude?
Just a little bit of-- dude, no.
Christian's not listening to us right now.
Derrick and I both have brought up flavoring the burger, putting something in there to give it moisture, but Christian never listens to anybody except for Christian.
Eggs?
No, no, no, no.
They want ketchup, a piece of cheese, [bleep].
(Christine) Guys, what if we do fruit for a side?
Strawberries and grapes-- it's hot out...
Or we can do apple fries.
(Jennifer) Sugar?
Make some caramel?
Yeah.
There's not much give and take when it comes to the menu, but Christian's got a nine-year-old kid, so I'm thinking he's gonna know better than any of us.
(Announcer) Christian has talked his blue team into making a plain and simple Turkey slider with cheese, ketchup, mustard, and a pickle.
The side will be raw apple sticks with a caramel dipping sauce.
Oh, yeah, that's looking good.
(Announcer) While there's already friction in team blue, the opposition is united in their decision.
We want to do the breaded chicken sandwich slider?
We should definitely call it a...
Chicken nugget sandwich?
Chicken nuggets.
What kid doesn't love chicken nuggets?
So let's give 'em a chicken nugget burger.
Ben thinks he really can make a corn fritter and make it awesome.
(Ben) We have to serve a side dish, and we see corn up there in the pantry.
And so my initial response is those little corn nuggets that you see on all-you-can-eat buffets-- the kids just go and take 'em by the handfuls.
Chicken and corn nuggets.
Christine's red team is making a chicken nugget slider seasoned with salt, pepper, and onion powder.
It will be topped with cheese, ranch sauce, and lettuce.
For their side, they'll serve corn fritters.
How did you divide up the work?
Ben and Tracy are on the corn fritters, and Suzy and I are on the sliders.
He's got a formidable bunch of cooks over there.
We have a better team.
You have a better team you think.
Yes.
Why's that?
'Cause we all communicate.
We all work well together.
But at the end of the day, you're calling the shots.
You're team Captain.
Yes, I am the Captain.
Victory or failure really falls squarely on your shoulders.
It does.
Good luck.
Thank you so much.
(Christian) Jennifer's working on making caramel sauce.
I'm cutting the apples, and Adrien and Derrick are pattying up.
Christine is goin'...
Down.
What's going on, you guys?
What are you making?
Burgers and fries.
Burgers and fries.
Burgers and fries.
Whoa!
Is that sugar?
Do I see caramel coming?
We're gonna do apple dippers, so Christian's working on our apples right now.
What are you trying to do, like a healthy twist?
You think that's gonna get you votes?
Kids love caramel.
What kid doesn't love caramel?
And every kid loves an apple.
Have you made this before?
Caramel?
I've made it one time before, so we're just trying not to touch it as much as possible, but there's so much in there, so we're just trying to get it all around.
(Joe) You're gonna win this with green apple?
Yeah.
What do you think about the red team?
I think they're gonna overcomplicate their [bleep].
I gotta say, I think a lot of your competition around here are looking at you as the guy to beat, so...
I think they're thinking the right way.
Wow.
No lack of confidence here.
No lack of confidence.
(Announcer) While stay-at-home-dad Christian is expecting the blue team to win with a healthy Turkey burger and apple side, single mom Christine and her red team have an entirely different approach.
All right, Christine, what's on the menu?
We have chicken nugget burger.
And you're serving that with what?
Corn nuggets.
And in terms of cooking the corn, you're gonna fry it?
Yes.
Shallow fry or deep-fried?
I think deep-fry.
Where is the burger?
I saw one he cooked.
Is that it there?
That is one, yes.
We're actually gonna be deep-frying it.
Why are we deep-frying burgers?
They're chicken nuggets.
Are we doing a burger or are we doing a nugget?
We're doing a nugget sandwich.
A nugget sandwich.
Yes.
Can we just get a little bit serious?
A chicken nugget burger deep-fried scares the [bleep] out of me.
Here comes the big, bad wolf.
Well, you're not a five-year-old kid, Chef.
No, I have four children.
Nuggets don't get served in buns.
Chef Ramsay strides into the middle of our perfect harmony and says, "Why are you serving chicken nuggets?"
We're deep-frying the slider, and we're deep-frying the side dish.
I'm telling you as a judge in this [bleep] competition, that's junk food.
Gordon's doubting my team, and I'm thinking to myself, "oh [bleep]."
[Bleep] Hell.
(Announcer) In this MasterChef challenge, two teams are going head-to-head cooking sliders and sides for 200 hungry children.
Chef Ramsay is concerned that the red team's unhealthy menu will not go down well with the kids.
We're deep-frying the slider, and we're deep-frying the side dish.
I'm telling you as a judge in this [bleep] competition, that's junk food.
Kids love that, Chef.
It may not be healthy, but today is not the day for us to revamp the nutritional system for children in this country.
Today is the day to get the kids to vote.
I've got concerns already on the red team.
Really?
They're gonna be making a slider dressed as a nugget and deep-fried.
Really?
Is it a chicken nugget sandwich or a chicken burger?
According to Ben, kids love nuggets in a bun.
That's a new one for me.
Blue team's much clearer.
They're making a straight Turkey burger.
They decided to go apples with caramel sauce.
A little healthy choice for the kids, but maybe it'll work for them.
(Christian) So you know I think I'm thinking, Adrien, ketchup on the top.
That way you can ketchup, throw some pickles down.
(Announcer) Christian has a clear vision of the blue team's menu, even if his team members disagree.
We'll split all the buns in half, and then we can lay out all the tops.
A lot of kids don't like mustard, though.
Just my opinion.
Yeah, but with the ketchup together, it's kinda--
I wouldn't have put mustard on it, but I've voiced my opinion so many times, and it's been ignored, so I'm just gonna follow along with what he wants to do.
How you losers doin' over there?
We're getting ready to kick your ass.
Hah!
How's that?
They're trying to do like a fried chicken nuggest sandwich.
They're gonna back themselves up.
They're doing something with the corn for dessert.
Come on.
You're a kid.
You want one of these with [bleep], or do you want a [bleep] corn fritter?
I want an apple with caramel.
The blue team continues to move ahead with Christian's menu while the red team takes a team approach to problem-solving.
So we're gonna deep-fry these?
We're gonna Dee-fry them.
Yes.
Is the oil hot enough?
It's on, right?
This is taking me forever.
These pans are not [bleep] hot.
This is not gonna work.
It's definitely not gonna work.
We can't cook 200 burgers on that, so we gotta come up with a plan "b."
Christine, I would start looking at the grill option.
Pan-frying these chicken nuggets will not work.
We cannot turn out 200 of these in the time frame which we need to, so we have to grill them.
(Announcer) On the blue team, everyone's been assigned their own job, but Christian does not trust Jennifer to handle the caramel.
I'm gonna go like another maybe two minutes.
You're gonna have to move it around so the heat can hit everything.
Christian thinks he knows the best way to do everything, and he does not know how to relinquish control.
I don't want to keep scraping the sides because it's bringing in sugar that's not been caramelizing.
As soon as you start moving dissolved sugar around, it starts to crystallize.
It's very difficult to salvage.
Give me this [bleep] pot.
There's not enough heat, and Jennifer's obviously not smart enough to figure out to use the fryolater burner, and she [bleep] up the caramel.
Christian, what do you want me to do with this?
Is that draining too, yes?
Yeah.
That's why I didn't want it to be stirred.
I'm not really happy about it, but I'm gonna try to strain it see if maybe I can get something out of it.
Our sauce is a train wreck right now.
90 minutes gone.
30 minutes to go.
(Announcer) Things aren't going much smoother on the red team.
Now that they've decided to grill their chicken sliders, they're running into another unexpected problem.
Is this the one for us to taste?
Yes.
Is it dry?
No.
The bread crumb's keeping them moist.
I don't know if the breading adds anything, except sandpaper.
Pulls moisture out.
Graham and Joe think the sliders are gonna be dry 'cause it's breaded in bread crumbs.
They're not really confident about our team, which makes me a little pissed off.
All right, let's see this fritter, man.
A little dry.
They're very dry.
That chicken looks dry.
That's why we have sauces for everything.
All right.
I hope that can pull it through, because it's like the Sahara desert here.
Joe's like, "don't you think everything's just gonna be dry, dry, dry?"
We're like, no, we have ranch dressing to dip the fritters in, and for our burger.
Of course, it's not gonna be dry.
12 minutes to go, blue team, please.
Have you finished your caramel now?
Yes.
Okay, and this is the, uh-- this is the sauce?
Damn, it's grainy.
It's crystallized, isn't it?
Chef, how many five-year-olds do you know that know about crystallized caramel?
That's not what I'm saying.
Understood, Chef.
I understand, but, I mean-- listen, you can try and be smart.
Look at me.
Just saying the sauce is [bleep].
It's just grainy, and it tastes of raw sugar.
I know Christian doesn't understand what I'm trying to-- right, I know exactly what you're saying, yes.
Rule number one when making a caramel, you never stir it.
Correct.
(Christian) Jenny wanted to try and shift the blame for the caramel sauce onto me, because I stirred it a couple times.
Now, do I think that ruined the caramel?
[Bleep], no.
Yeah, that's why I told you, you can't stir it.
(Christian) I don't think it's a huge ordeal, so I'm still gonna serve it to the kids.
[Bleep]
Just over one minute to go.
I can hear the children coming.
Let's go.
I'm super nervous about the chicken patties being ready for all of these kids.
200 chicken patties at one time?
No way.
Christine, you got the burgers?
Okay.
Last ten seconds.
(Ben) The first pan of fritters, salted, ready to go.
(Tracy) Let's go, team.
Do we have 20 burgers ready to go?
Come on, come on, come on.
Time's up!
Here come the kids!
Oh, my God!
Here come your judges, guys.
Holy crap.
(Announcer) The children will try a slider and side from both the red team and the blue team and vote on their favorite.
All of a sudden, there's, like, herds of children coming up the hill, and I think fear washed over me.
Let's go!
Bring the burgers, bring the burgers.
(Christine) Aah!
Keep bringin' burgers, guys, quickly as possible.
Remember, if you don't like it, spit it out, throw it at them.
Do whatever you wish.
You're in charge.
All right, guys, here we go.
Can I take one?
There we go.
(Announcer) The blue team is serving a grilled Turkey slider, topped with cheese, pickles, ketchup, and mustard.
On the side, they're serving raw apple sticks with caramel dipping sauce.
These caramel apples are awesome!
(Jennifer) Thank you, buddy!
You're the best!
Vote blue.
Don't forget.
Who had the best sides?
I like the apple one, but, um, the caramel had, like, chunks in it.
It was weird.
That's a very acute observation.
Red team or blue team?
Blue.
The blue?
Why the blue?
Because the red one was a lot more dry.
Wow.
(Announcer) While the blue team has an efficient assembly line going, the red team is already falling behind.
(Christine) Are you guys hungry?
(Kids) Yeah!
(Christine) I swear I cooked, like, 50 burgers.
All of a sudden, they're all gone.
What the hell just happened?
I gotta hurry up.
I gotta make these nugget sliders as quick as I can.
Tell 'em not to fall behind.
Say burgers!
Burgers!
[Chanting] Burgers!
Burgers!
Burgers!
Burgers!
(Announcer) Red team is serving up a chicken nugget burger, topped with cheese and ranch sauce.
For their side, they're serving corn fritters.
How were your burgers?
I was on the blue team.
Now we're on the red team.
Oh, you're waiting for the burgers from the red team.
I wish they'd hurry up.
Burgers!
Burgers!
There seems to be a long, long wait for these burgers.
(Ben) The kids are, like, screaming and banging on the table, like, "we want food!
We want food!"
We want burgers!
The blood pressure starts to go up, and you're thinking, "how on earth are we gonna be able to feed all these children?"
That would take a miracle.
Hold on, guys!
They're comin'!
Not fast enough!
We want burgers!
We want burgers!
[Bleep].
We want burgers!
(announcer) It's the MasterChef Block Party.
200 kids are trying a slider and side from both the blue and red teams.
Once they've eaten both, the kids will vote for their favorite.
But Christine's red team is working slowly and can't keep up with the demand.
Hold on, guys!
They're comin'!
Not fast enough!
We want burgers!
We want burgers!
Who wants chicken nuggets?
I do!
Yeah!
That's what I like to hear!
Come on, guys, I need some, uh, burgers.
Burgers!
There's two.
Thank you.
(Christian) We're getting our food out, and the red team is not, and that's why we're hearing a lot of cheering and yelling over there, and they're kind of getting the kids pumped up.
Shenanigans.
Keep them entertained.
Just keep them entertained.
They're almost done.
Go red team!
Go red team!
It took a long time for us to wait for the red.
Why, because they're slow?
No, I think it's because they took some time, 'cause the red was infinitely better.
Infinitely better.
Which one do you prefer?
Is it the cooking from the red team or is it the cooking from the blue team?
♪ It's the cooking from red team!
♪
I love the way you sing that as well.
You're amazing.
(Announcer) While the red team is playing catch-up, the blue team is having trouble meeting the demands of some finicky customers.
No ketchup!
No ketchup!
No mustard!
Yeah, we'll have to scrape it off.
Kids, when they don't like something, they're gonna tell you.
I don't like too much ketchup and sauce.
The blue burger just had too much stuff, because it had pickle, mustard, ketchup, burger, cheese.
It was just, like, mixing all those flavors.
I love the blue burger.
Oh, thank you!
Which one did you like?
You like-- you like this one?
I like that and that.
You like that and that.
Could I have some more of the apple?
You know it's good when they're coming back for seconds.
(Announcer) It's clear both team's dishes have won fans, but as service draws to a close, only the team with the majority of votes can win the challenge.
(Christine) Finally, the last burger goes out.
Thank God that's over.
I think we did an amazing job,
I'm very proud of us, red team!
Awesome!
Whoo-hoo!
Good job, guys.
All the kids are served, and we got about 40 extra burgers.
[Cheering]
Listen up, all of you are junior masterchefs, and you're gonna be receiving the hottest cooking kits around, courtesy of MasterChef and Kidsline.
Here you go, guys.
Start passin' 'em back.
(Graham) You'll get all the tools you need to start off right at home from burgers to pancakes and cupcakes.
[Kids cheering]
(Announcer) The kids have tried sliders from Christine's red team and Christian's blue team.
Now it's time for them to vote.
When Gordon signals them, the kids will run to the team whose sliders and sides they preferred.
The team with the most kids will win.
On the count of three, you're gonna run up there and make sure you land in the circle that you think has cooked the most delicious burger.
The red team [Cheering]
And the blue team.
Blue team!
One...
Two...
Three!
Go!
[Kids screaming]
(Gordon) Go!
Go!
(Ben) You see the kids, they're laughing and screaming and running as fast as they possibly can.
You know, we're screaming, "come on!
Come to the red team!
Come to the red team!"
Red!
(Ben) And you see a big herd of them break off and start going over to blue, and I'm like, "oh, no!
How many are there?"
We know our food was better.
(Gordon) Who has the best burger, red team or blue team?
I want to hear you!
[Cheering]
Red team!
Red team!
(Christine) It's just crazy.
Kid are running, and you're trying to see if they're in your circle, or if they're in the blue circle.
And you're trying to count how many kids.
Oh.
[Cheering]
Red team, blue team, we're going to have a count.
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
37, 38, 39.
Okay, perfect, guys!
The winner of the block party...
Congratulations to...
The red team!
Yes!
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!
I'm just so happy that I won.
No pressure test!
No pressure test!
Yeah!
Aah!
Whoo!
[Cheering]
(Gordon) Blue team, you will be facing the pressure test, where at least one of you will be leaving MasterChef.
I'm pissed off.
Five to ten-year-old kids aren't judging solely on food, I don't think.
They took a long time to get their food out, so they were able to gain votes by talking their ears off.
They got the popularity vote.
I gave her extra apples.
I'm really pissed off.
I think we lost because Christian's not willing to open up to other ideas unless they come out of his mouth.
Christian was an absolutely horrendous leader today.
[Dramatic music]
♪ ♪
Let's go, guys.
(Derrick) Any time we walk into this kitchen and it's a pressure test, it's always a nerve-racking experience.
You don't know what they're gonna throw at you, and there's a chance you're going home.
(Gordon) Welcome, everyone.
Yesterday, you flipped burgers for 200 very calm, very quiet, unopinionated children, right?
Yes, Chef.
Red team, you won by two-to-one votes.
Wow.
Wow.
(Gordon) Well done.
(Christine) I kicked Christian's ass.
Boo-yah!
You can slide on up to the gallery.
Congratulations.
Off you go.
I know that they are pissed, and they are frustrated, and they are scared.
(Gordon) All right, Christian, team Captain.
Yes, Chef.
Why did you lose that challenge?
Kids are tricky to please.
When you can only make 200 burgers 1 way, and they don't like something, then you're gonna lose their vote.
Kids are smart.
They pick up on what's happening.
They probably pick up certainly on dissention within the team.
(Gordon) You were assertive, and you made every decision.
And it was really bizarre, because every time a member of your team was coming forward with an idea, [slap] Bang!
You squashed them.
Is that just arrogance or selfishness?
I was the team Captain, so I took charge of my team.
(Gordon) Jennifer, was...
Christian a good Captain?
Absolutely not.
Every time I brought up an idea, it was pushed to the side.
I told us we had to put onions to make that burger juicy.
I disagree.
Kids don't like mustard,
I certainly don't think they're gonna like onions.
Across the board, 200 kids, you're gonna have a kid that's not gonna like an onion.
They're never even gonna know it's in there if it's shaved.
It's gonna flavor it.
Okay, I had my five-year-old nephew, and let me tell you something, kid doesn't eat [bleep], and he [bleep] would eat that.
(Christine) I love the fact that Jennifer stood up to him and was like, "You suck as a leader.
You're an arrogant bastard."
I thought it was pretty damn funny.
The harsh reality of your failure cooking for that block party is that at least one of you will be leaving MasterChef.
Christian, tell me the two weakest performers that should face the pressure test from your losing team.
Um, me, because I was the Captain.
And Jennifer.
If she didn't know how to make caramel sauce, she should have said something.
(Jennifer) I didn't stick a spoon in there and stir it around like you were.
(Gordon) Jennifer, would you go head to head in this tough pressure test against Christian?
I think I'm a better cook than him, so if it's cooking, absolutely.
[Scoffs] Christian?
I'll go head to head right now.
I know I'm a better cook than her.
Derrick, who would you put your money on?
Uh, if it's just straight-up cooking and technique,
I'd have to go with Christian.
Adrien?
It's gonna be Christian.
(Gordon) Christian, Jennifer, you'll be facing the pressure test.
Alongside...
Derrick and Adrien.
All four of you are gonna do it.
I definitely feel like I'm not the cook that Adrien or Christian is, so this is a really scary pressure test for me.
Today's challenge really puts the pressure in the pressure test.
It's the dish that puts the fear of God into any professional chef anywhere in the world.
Because today's pressure test is all about a stunning, unique, delicious...
Cheese souffle.
(Jennifer) I'm super excited to see that the souffle is the pressure test.
I've done them a few times for dinner parties, so I'm excited.
(Christian) It's like a chef's nightmare, one of the hardest challenges they've ever made anybody in MasterChef face.
(Joe) It truly takes a MasterChef to craft a perfect, savory souffle.
Nothing will be able to really define your skill as much as being able to do a souffle.
Step behind your stations, please.
Your 90 minutes start from...
Now.
Good luck.
(Announcer) In this pressure test, the home cooks will have 90 minutes to make as many cheese souffles as they want, but can only present one to the judges.
At any time during the challenge, the contestants can present their perfect souffle.
The judges will be looking for texture, proper rise of the dough, and overall flavor.
It's gonna be one of the most exciting pressure tests.
Chefs anywhere in the world will still screw up a souffle.
Cheese souffle is less forgiving than even a sweet souffle.
(Gordon) Think of the oils and the fats in cheese.
That can go so wrong across the egg whites.
And then if it's too light and it's packed with egg white and you haven't got that cheese richness, that lovely sort of cheese puff, that's what we're looking for.
I have done savory souffles and sweet souffles.
Making the perfect one's the scary part.
There's a lot of things that can go wrong with a souffle.
You gotta have a lot of patience, um, you really have to be accurate about everything.
Souffle is one of those things where you have to have exact measurement, and if you don't, it falls.
Right now, I'm just, uh, pulling the butter up to the top of the ramekin so when the souffle comes up, it'll rise out of there the right way.
(Graham) All right, guys, you have just 45 minutes to go.
(Announcer) The four MasterChef competitors are racing to create the roux, a mixture of flour and butter, which is a building block of a perfect souffle.
(Ben) He didn't cook his roux.
He never cooked his roux.
(Ben) That's gonna taste nasty.
Gonna taste disgusting.
(Christian) I'm very confident in my skills.
I cook by touch and feel and instinct.
Takes a little bit of balls.
I'm gonna make a great souffle my way.
What you doing?
I'm gonna combine both the cheeses, both the parmesan and the cheddar.
What texture you going for?
Nice and creamy.
Who's gonna come up short?
Christian.
I think he's an arrogant son of a bitch, and I think he's a liar.
I don't know what the hell Jennifer's talking about.
She just wants to throw me under the bus, 'cause she's mad that she has to be down here doing this.
I didn't come here to let some punk-ass little piece of [bleep] run his mouth and treat people like [bleep].
It's not who I want representing me as a MasterChef.
(Announcer) After a loss in this week's team challenge,
Christian, Derrick, Adrien, and Jennifer must face the toughest pressure test yet-- a cheese souffle.
Tension between Christian and Jennifer reaches a boiling point.
I didn't come here to let some punk-ass little piece of [bleep] treat people like [bleep].
Om?
No, I don't feel anything from anyone.
Nothing?
Just on your island over here?
I'm trying to make a souffle.
I'm not trying to draw up a peace treaty for Jennifer and Christian.
They can handle that themselves.
I'm focusing on staying here.
Christian, you're lookin' nice and organized.
Yesterday, you succeeded in pissing a lot of people off.
Maybe people think that you cost them the challenge.
You know, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
Today, someone's gonna go home on the back of your lack of leadership.
We're here to play the game.
Who do you want to go home?
I want Jennifer to go home.
(Announcer) Nearly an hour into this difficult pressure test, most of the competitors are moving on to the second critical phase of making a souffle, the egg whites.
(Jennifer) The way that a souffle rises is from the egg whites.
So if you don't have your egg whites mixed properly from the beginning, you're gonna get a flat souffle and it's not gonna rise.
And that's definitely not what you want.
Right.
Talk to me about who's gonna fall flat on their ass on this one.
Christian seems like he's in a bad mood, which is definitely not good.
Who do you want to see leave MasterChef tonight?
[Sighs]
Christian, because I feel like he's big competition.
Good luck.
(Announcer) During this challenge, the home cooks can choose to serve up their souffle at any time, but they only get one shot.
(Joe) How many souffles do you think each one will make?
(Graham) I think you're gonna have one person out there that's gonna try to be a tough guy and just use his first one.
Like who?
I'm thinking Christian might do that.
You think Christian is...
Puttin' one up, his first one.
Is that bold as to serve the first--
I think ego gets in the way.
(Derrick) My plan is, let me just get one batch done, taste it, adjust, and do a second batch, so I make sure that I serve something that I'm comfortable with.
(Christine) Oh, wow.
(Suzy) They look beautiful.
There we go.
Such a good cook, she has a whole peanut gallery to help her.
People actually like me, Christian.
[Bleep] 'cause you're a [bleep] mind [bleep].
[Laughs]
She can go ahead and say she's a better cook than me, but I think that's a [bleep] arrogant thing to say, because she knows it's baloney.
Wah wah wah wah-wah wah-wah-wah-wah.
That's all I here.
You know what, if that's what you need to make yourself feel better and confident, it's sad.
35 minutes to go.
It should take between 14 to 17 minutes in the oven.
[Click]
(Announcer) Derrick is ahead of the game, as his first batch of souffles is already finished.
(Derrick) So I pull out my first batch of test souffles, and they've got the right texture, but I just really am thinking they need a little more kick.
Think I'm just gonna try to put a little more cheese in it.
I'd like it definitely to be a little bolder than this.
(Announcer) With Derrick already starting his second batch, the other three home cooks are anxiously awaiting the outcome of their first souffles.
[Ticking]
Comin' up really nice.
Not gettin' too brown.
The one on the left is...
[Kiss] Ahh! "Souferb."
(Announcer) Despite having more than enough time to bake a second batch,
Christian decides to serve his very first souffle.
I'm like, "cook another souffle!"
To serve something that you haven't had the chance to perfect right off the bat to the judges could be suicide.
You could be going home because of that choice.
I would never do that.
This is it, yes?
(Christian) That is my souffle.
Okay, great.
What's in there?
Cheddar, pinch of parmesan, little bit of chive, um, some mustard powder, some garlic powder, and I rimmed the, uh, ramekin with parmesan.
Okay, visually, it's got the impact.
Smells good from here.
What's the texture we're looking for in the center?
It should be nice and fluffy, and still have that little bit of creamy edge from the cheese.
(Christian) The waiting's killing me.
I think he just needs to say something, 'cause, uh, it's nerve-racking.
(Gordon) 20 minutes to go.
If you're going in for the last batch now, they should be in the oven in the next three to four minutes.
(Derrick) I just put the second batch in.
It better be the batch that works 'cause I don't have time to make another batch of souffles.
This is all or nothing for me right now.
I'm looking at my first batch through the oven, and it's rising just the right amount.
It's perfect.
I'm gonna serve it.
I'm not even gonna put another batch in the oven.
Okay, Adrien.
It's light and fluffy, a little creamy.
Four parts gruyere, two parts cheddar.
Structure looks good to you?
Yes.
Good color on top?
Yes.
You looking for it to be more wet or more dry?
A little more wet.
The fact that they're not responding instantly after tasting it is torture.
I'm looking at my test souffle, and it looks beautiful, so I'm gonna go with this one.
This is gonna be the winner.
Should be nice and rich.
I actually steeped my chives in my milk, so you'll have that background of onion flavor.
So when I cut right through here in the middle...
Should be nice and gooey.
Very custardy.
Yeah.
Eggs have been your undoing in the past.
[Exhales]
You count on the salinity, the salt coming from the parmesan, or did you add additional salt?
I backed off the salt just a hair, because of the salt in the parmesan cheese, yes.
(Gordon) Come on, Derrick.
(Derrick) I'm running out of time.
The only thing I can do is just keep looking at my oven and see how my souffles are doing.
(Gordon) How long, Derrick?
Uh, momentarily.
One minute to go.
(Derrick) They're rising, they look good, but they still need a little more time.
(Gordon) Derrick, 30 seconds to go!
(Announcer) Share the joy of cooking with your kids with cooking kits as seen on MasterChef.
These oven-ready kits are chef inspired for kids who cook by Kidsline.
One minute to go.
(Announcer) Derrick is the only home cook to make a second batch of souffles, but with only seconds left, will his decision leave him with nothing to serve?
Ay yi yi.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on!
[Clapping]
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Here you go.
Light and creamy, predominantly gruyere cheese.
I went for sharp, and, uh, there's some parmesan, intermixed throughout.
I garnished it with some parmesan and some chives on top.
Second attempt or third attempt?
Second, chef.
Second?
This is your best?
Yes.
What kind of cheese predominantly?
Predominantly gruyere with some parmesan in there.
(Announcer) The judges must decide based purely on their souffle who will move on in the competition and who will be sent home.
(Graham) Yeah, Jennifer.
Jennifer, with the cheese flavor and texture.
(Graham) With the chives, the question is... (Gordon) Yeah, interesting.
Yeah, seriously.
Yeah.
It's close.
[Judges speaking quietly]
That was intense.
And for us, so far, the most difficult pressure test ever on MasterChef.
Okay.

== sync, corrected by elderman ==
The remaining eight home cooks have been dropped off in a Los Angeles neighborhood for an epic challenge where they'll be cooking for some very small but opinionated young critics.
We're walking up this hill and we see
"MasterChef Block Party."
I've done a ton of block parties, so I can definitely barbecue up a storm if that's what this challenge calls for.
Is that Graham hula hooping?
Graham is jumping around with his hula hoop.
For a big man, he's agile.
That is impressive!
Good morning.
Morning.
Welcome to our block party.
Unfortunately today, you're not the guests.
There are 200 very hungry children... on their way.
200 children?
Just hurtling toward you, hungry, ready to stuff greasy food in their mouths and wipe their grubby little fingers all over you.
Worst nightmare I can think of.
And you are gonna have to prepare a stunning slider and a side for them.
Sounds easy, right?
But you know on MasterChef there are always catches.
It'd be way too easy to please those kids with a meaty hamburger or greasy French fries.
Which is why you won't be able to use beef or potatoes.
Oh, my God.
Get the kids to love what you do, because they're not just your guests.
They're also your judges in today's challenge.
What?
Kids have no filter, so they're gonna be as honest and as brutal as any of our critics have been.
So that part scares me a little bit.
As always, you'll be split into two teams.
Christian and Christine, the two of you had the best dishes in yesterday's elimination test, so you'll be today's team captains.
All right, Christian, you're picking first.
I need someone that can get on the grill.
He's been in the top quite a few times.
Being on Christian's team, I know he's just like,
"This is how it is.
This is how it goes."
And you have Christine who's kinda in like all over the place like emotionally.
I don't want to be on either team just because they're captains.
I'm going with Adrien.
Adrien.
Wow.
Christine.
I think this person is creative, has a delicate hand, possibly great with children.
So I pick Tracy.
Excellent.
Tracy, welcome to the red team.
He works well in the kitchen, and I think he's gonna be good on the prep.
Derrick.
You don't thin the undertaker's gonna cost you votes from these kids?
No.
I'm not gonna let him interact with the children.
Christine.
I think this person is great at strategizing, and it's Ben.
Welcome to red team.
Christian.
I really want to be on Christine's team.
I think she's gonna be a better leader.
Christian runs a team by dictatorship, and that's not really how I work.
I need somebody that's good with children.
Jennifer.
Wow.
Good choice.
Aaaah...
I'm not really thrilled, but I have to suck it up, and I know that I have to get my mindset in the right direction.
Suzy, last pick?
I am left with Suzy.
You like her and you hate her.
She's annoying.
But as long as she remembers that I am the team Captain and that she follows my direction, then we'll be great.
Listen carefully.
The losing team will face the most difficult pressure test in MasterChef so far.
Trust me, this challenge is anything but child's play.
So focus.
Two hours prep, and then 60 minutes to serve.
Are you ready?
Yes, Chef.
Your time starts...
Now.
Off you go.
Each team will have two hours to prepare and cook sliders and sides for 200 hungry children.
The team that receives the most votes from the kids will be the winner, but first they must decide on their menus.
We're gonna do a simple Turkey burger.
Anything in it?
Salt, pepper?
Salt, pepper, little bit of onion and garlic?
Grated onion?
No, no, no.
Not even the grated, dude?
Just a little bit of-- dude, no.
Christian's not listening to us right now.
Derrick and I both have brought up flavoring the burger, putting something in there to give it moisture, but Christian never listens to anybody except for Christian.
Eggs?
No, no, no, no.
They want ketchup, a piece of cheese, .
Guys, what if we do fruit for a side?
Strawberries and grapes-- it's hot out...
Or we can do apple fries.
Sugar?
Make some caramel?
Yeah.
There's not much give and take when it comes to the menu, but Christian's got a nine-year-old kid, so I'm thinking he's gonna know better than any of us.
Christian has talked his blue team into making a plain and simple Turkey slider with cheese, ketchup, mustard, and a pickle.
The side will be raw apple sticks with a caramel dipping sauce.
Oh, yeah, that's looking good.
While there's already friction in team blue, the opposition is united in their decision.
We want to do the breaded chicken sandwich slider?
We should definitely call it a...
Chicken nugget sandwich?
Chicken nuggets.
What kid doesn't love chicken nuggets?
So let's give 'em a chicken nugget burger.
Ben thinks he really can make a corn fritter and make it awesome.
We have to serve a side dish, and we see corn up there in the pantry.
And so my initial response is those little corn nuggets that you see on all-you-can-eat buffets-- the kids just go and take 'em by the handfuls.
Chicken and corn nuggets.
Christine's red team is making a chicken nugget slider seasoned with salt, pepper, and onion powder.
It will be topped with cheese, ranch sauce, and lettuce.
For their side, they'll serve corn fritters.
How did you divide up the work?
Ben and Tracy are on the corn fritters, and Suzy and I are on the sliders.
He's got a formidable bunch of cooks over there.
We have a better team.
You have a better team you think.
Yes.
Why's that?
'Cause we all communicate.
We all work well together.
But at the end of the day, you're calling the shots.
You're team Captain.
Yes, I am the Captain.
Victory or failure really falls squarely on your shoulders.
It does.
Good luck.
Thank you so much.
Jennifer's working on making caramel sauce.
I'm cutting the apples, and Adrien and Derrick are pattying up.
Christine is goin'...
Down.
What's going on, you guys?
What are you making?
Burgers and fries.
Burgers and fries.
Burgers and fries.
Whoa!
Is that sugar?
Do I see caramel coming?
We're gonna do apple dippers, so Christian's working on our apples right now.
What are you trying to do, like a healthy twist?
You think that's gonna get you votes?
Kids love caramel.
What kid doesn't love caramel?
And every kid loves an apple.
Have you made this before?
Caramel?
I've made it one time before, so we're just trying not to touch it as much as possible, but there's so much in there, so we're just trying to get it all around.
You're gonna win this with green apple?
Yeah.
What do you think about the red team?
I think they're gonna overcomplicate their .
I gotta say, I think a lot of your competition around here are looking at you as the guy to beat, so...
I think they're thinking the right way.
Wow.
No lack of confidence here.
No lack of confidence.
While stay-at-home-dad Christian is expecting the blue team to win with a healthy Turkey burger and apple side, single mom Christine and her red team have an entirely different approach.
All right, Christine, what's on the menu?
We have chicken nugget burger.
And you're serving that with what?
Corn nuggets.
And in terms of cooking the corn, you're gonna fry it?
Yes.
Shallow fry or deep-fried?
I think deep-fry.
Where is the burger?
I saw one he cooked.
Is that it there?
That is one, yes.
We're actually gonna be deep-frying it.
Why are we deep-frying burgers?
They're chicken nuggets.
Are we doing a burger or are we doing a nugget?
We're doing a nugget sandwich.
A nugget sandwich.
Yes.
Can we just get a little bit serious?
A chicken nugget burger deep-fried scares the out of me.
Here comes the big, bad wolf.
Well, you're not a five-year-old kid, Chef.
No, I have four children.
Nuggets don't get served in buns.
Chef Ramsay strides into the middle of our perfect harmony and says, "Why are you serving chicken nuggets?"
We're deep-frying the slider, and we're deep-frying the side dish.
I'm telling you as a judge in this competition, that's junk food.
Gordon's doubting my team, and I'm thinking to myself, "oh ."
Hell.
In this MasterChef challenge, two teams are going head-to-head cooking sliders and sides for 200 hungry children.
Chef Ramsay is concerned that the red team's unhealthy menu will not go down well with the kids.
We're deep-frying the slider, and we're deep-frying the side dish.
I'm telling you as a judge in this competition, that's junk food.
Kids love that, Chef.
It may not be healthy, but today is not the day for us to revamp the nutritional system for children in this country.
Today is the day to get the kids to vote.
I've got concerns already on the red team.
Really?
They're gonna be making a slider dressed as a nugget and deep-fried.
Really?
Is it a chicken nugget sandwich or a chicken burger?
According to Ben, kids love nuggets in a bun.
That's a new one for me.
Blue team's much clearer.
They're making a straight Turkey burger.
They decided to go apples with caramel sauce.
A little healthy choice for the kids, but maybe it'll work for them.
So you know I think I'm thinking, Adrien, ketchup on the top.
That way you can ketchup, throw some pickles down.
Christian has a clear vision of the blue team's menu, even if his team members disagree.
We'll split all the buns in half, and then we can lay out all the tops.
A lot of kids don't like mustard, though.
Just my opinion.
Yeah, but with the ketchup together, it's kinda--
I wouldn't have put mustard on it, but I've voiced my opinion so many times, and it's been ignored, so I'm just gonna follow along with what he wants to do.
How you losers doin' over there?
We're getting ready to kick your ass.
Hah!
How's that?
They're trying to do like a fried chicken nuggest sandwich.
They're gonna back themselves up.
They're doing something with the corn for dessert.
Come on.
You're a kid.
You want one of these with , or do you want a corn fritter?
I want an apple with caramel.
The blue team continues to move ahead with Christian's menu while the red team takes a team approach to problem-solving.
So we're gonna deep-fry these?
We're gonna Dee-fry them.
Yes.
Is the oil hot enough?
It's on, right?
This is taking me forever.
These pans are not hot.
This is not gonna work.
It's definitely not gonna work.
We can't cook 200 burgers on that, so we gotta come up with a plan "b."
Christine, I would start looking at the grill option.
Pan-frying these chicken nuggets will not work.
We cannot turn out 200 of these in the time frame which we need to, so we have to grill them.
On the blue team, everyone's been assigned their own job, but Christian does not trust Jennifer to handle the caramel.
I'm gonna go like another maybe two minutes.
You're gonna have to move it around so the heat can hit everything.
Christian thinks he knows the best way to do everything, and he does not know how to relinquish control.
I don't want to keep scraping the sides because it's bringing in sugar that's not been caramelizing.
As soon as you start moving dissolved sugar around, it starts to crystallize.
It's very difficult to salvage.
Give me this pot.
There's not enough heat, and Jennifer's obviously not smart enough to figure out to use the fryolater burner, and she up the caramel.
Christian, what do you want me to do with this?
Is that draining too, yes?
Yeah.
That's why I didn't want it to be stirred.
I'm not really happy about it, but I'm gonna try to strain it see if maybe I can get something out of it.
Our sauce is a train wreck right now.
90 minutes gone.
30 minutes to go.
Things aren't going much smoother on the red team.
Now that they've decided to grill their chicken sliders, they're running into another unexpected problem.
Is this the one for us to taste?
Yes.
Is it dry?
No.
The bread crumb's keeping them moist.
I don't know if the breading adds anything, except sandpaper.
Pulls moisture out.
Graham and Joe think the sliders are gonna be dry 'cause it's breaded in bread crumbs.
They're not really confident about our team, which makes me a little pissed off.
All right, let's see this fritter, man.
A little dry.
They're very dry.
That chicken looks dry.
That's why we have sauces for everything.
All right.
I hope that can pull it through, because it's like the Sahara desert here.
Joe's like, "don't you think everything's just gonna be dry, dry, dry?"
We're like, no, we have ranch dressing to dip the fritters in, and for our burger.
Of course, it's not gonna be dry.
12 minutes to go, blue team, please.
Have you finished your caramel now?
Yes.
Okay, and this is the, uh-- this is the sauce?
Damn, it's grainy.
It's crystallized, isn't it?
Chef, how many five-year-olds do you know that know about crystallized caramel?
That's not what I'm saying.
Understood, Chef.
I understand, but, I mean-- listen, you can try and be smart.
Look at me.
Just saying the sauce is .
It's just grainy, and it tastes of raw sugar.
I know Christian doesn't understand what I'm trying to-- right, I know exactly what you're saying, yes.
Rule number one when making a caramel, you never stir it.
Correct.
Jenny wanted to try and shift the blame for the caramel sauce onto me, because I stirred it a couple times.
Now, do I think that ruined the caramel?
, no.
Yeah, that's why I told you, you can't stir it.
I don't think it's a huge ordeal, so I'm still gonna serve it to the kids.
Just over one minute to go.
I can hear the children coming.
Let's go.
I'm super nervous about the chicken patties being ready for all of these kids.
200 chicken patties at one time?
No way.
Christine, you got the burgers?
Okay.
Last ten seconds.
The first pan of fritters, salted, ready to go.
Let's go, team.
Do we have 20 burgers ready to go?
Come on, come on, come on.
Time's up!
Here come the kids!
Oh, my God!
Here come your judges, guys.
Holy crap.
The children will try a slider and side from both the red team and the blue team and vote on their favorite.
All of a sudden, there's, like, herds of children coming up the hill, and I think fear washed over me.
Let's go!
Bring the burgers, bring the burgers.
Aah!
Keep bringin' burgers, guys, quickly as possible.
Remember, if you don't like it, spit it out, throw it at them.
Do whatever you wish.
You're in charge.
All right, guys, here we go.
Can I take one?
There we go.
The blue team is serving a grilled Turkey slider, topped with cheese, pickles, ketchup, and mustard.
On the side, they're serving raw apple sticks with caramel dipping sauce.
These caramel apples are awesome!
Thank you, buddy!
You're the best!
Vote blue.
Don't forget.
Who had the best sides?
I like the apple one, but, um, the caramel had, like, chunks in it.
It was weird.
That's a very acute observation.
Red team or blue team?
Blue.
The blue?
Why the blue?
Because the red one was a lot more dry.
Wow.
While the blue team has an efficient assembly line going, the red team is already falling behind.
Are you guys hungry?
Yeah!
I swear I cooked, like, 50 burgers.
All of a sudden, they're all gone.
What the hell just happened?
I gotta hurry up.
I gotta make these nugget sliders as quick as I can.
Tell 'em not to fall behind.
Say burgers!
Burgers!
Burgers!
Burgers!
Burgers!
Burgers!
Red team is serving up a chicken nugget burger, topped with cheese and ranch sauce.
For their side, they're serving corn fritters.
How were your burgers?
I was on the blue team.
Now we're on the red team.
Oh, you're waiting for the burgers from the red team.
I wish they'd hurry up.
Burgers!
Burgers!
There seems to be a long, long wait for these burgers.
The kids are, like, screaming and banging on the table, like, "we want food!
We want food!"
We want burgers!
The blood pressure starts to go up, and you're thinking, "how on earth are we gonna be able to feed all these children?"
That would take a miracle.
Hold on, guys!
They're comin'!
Not fast enough!
We want burgers!
We want burgers!
We want burgers!
It's the MasterChef Block Party.
200 kids are trying a slider and side from both the blue and red teams.
Once they've eaten both, the kids will vote for their favorite.
But Christine's red team is working slowly and can't keep up with the demand.
Hold on, guys!
They're comin'!
Not fast enough!
We want burgers!
We want burgers!
Who wants chicken nuggets?
I do!
Yeah!
That's what I like to hear!
Come on, guys, I need some, uh, burgers.
Burgers!
There's two.
Thank you.
We're getting our food out, and the red team is not, and that's why we're hearing a lot of cheering and yelling over there, and they're kind of getting the kids pumped up.
Shenanigans.
Keep them entertained.
Just keep them entertained.
They're almost done.
Go red team!
Go red team!
It took a long time for us to wait for the red.
Why, because they're slow?
No, I think it's because they took some time, 'cause the red was infinitely better.
Infinitely better.
Which one do you prefer?
Is it the cooking from the red team or is it the cooking from the blue team?
♪ It's the cooking from red team!
♪
I love the way you sing that as well.
You're amazing.
While the red team is playing catch-up, the blue team is having trouble meeting the demands of some finicky customers.
No ketchup!
No ketchup!
No mustard!
Yeah, we'll have to scrape it off.
Kids, when they don't like something, they're gonna tell you.
I don't like too much ketchup and sauce.
The blue burger just had too much stuff, because it had pickle, mustard, ketchup, burger, cheese.
It was just, like, mixing all those flavors.
I love the blue burger.
Oh, thank you!
Which one did you like?
You like-- you like this one?
I like that and that.
You like that and that.
Could I have some more of the apple?
You know it's good when they're coming back for seconds.
It's clear both team's dishes have won fans, but as service draws to a close, only the team with the majority of votes can win the challenge.
Finally, the last burger goes out.
Thank God that's over.
I think we did an amazing job,
I'm very proud of us, red team!
Awesome!
Whoo-hoo!
Good job, guys.
All the kids are served, and we got about 40 extra burgers.
Listen up, all of you are junior masterchefs, and you're gonna be receiving the hottest cooking kits around, courtesy of MasterChef and Kidsline.
Here you go, guys.
Start passin' 'em back.
You'll get all the tools you need to start off right at home from burgers to pancakes and cupcakes.
The kids have tried sliders from Christine's red team and Christian's blue team.
Now it's time for them to vote.
When Gordon signals them, the kids will run to the team whose sliders and sides they preferred.
The team with the most kids will win.
On the count of three, you're gonna run up there and make sure you land in the circle that you think has cooked the most delicious burger.
The red team
And the blue team.
Blue team!
One...
Two...
Three!
Go!
Go!
Go!
You see the kids, they're laughing and screaming and running as fast as they possibly can.
You know, we're screaming, "come on!
Come to the red team!
Come to the red team!"
Red!
And you see a big herd of them break off and start going over to blue, and I'm like, "oh, no!
How many are there?"
We know our food was better.
Who has the best burger, red team or blue team?
I want to hear you!
Red team!
Red team!
It's just crazy.
Kid are running, and you're trying to see if they're in your circle, or if they're in the blue circle.
And you're trying to count how many kids.
Oh.
Red team, blue team, we're going to have a count.
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
37, 38, 39.
Okay, perfect, guys!
The winner of the block party...
Congratulations to...
The red team!
Yes!
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!
I'm just so happy that I won.
No pressure test!
No pressure test!
Yeah!
Aah!
Whoo!
Blue team, you will be facing the pressure test, where at least one of you will be leaving MasterChef.
I'm pissed off.
Five to ten-year-old kids aren't judging solely on food, I don't think.
They took a long time to get their food out, so they were able to gain votes by talking their ears off.
They got the popularity vote.
I gave her extra apples.
I'm really pissed off.
I think we lost because Christian's not willing to open up to other ideas unless they come out of his mouth.
Christian was an absolutely horrendous leader today.
♪ ♪
Let's go, guys.
Any time we walk into this kitchen and it's a pressure test, it's always a nerve-racking experience.
You don't know what they're gonna throw at you, and there's a chance you're going home.
Welcome, everyone.
Yesterday, you flipped burgers for 200 very calm, very quiet, unopinionated children, right?
Yes, Chef.
Red team, you won by two-to-one votes.
Wow.
Wow.
Well done.
I kicked Christian's ass.
Boo-yah!
You can slide on up to the gallery.
Congratulations.
Off you go.
I know that they are pissed, and they are frustrated, and they are scared.
All right, Christian, team Captain.
Yes, Chef.
Why did you lose that challenge?
Kids are tricky to please.
When you can only make 200 burgers 1 way, and they don't like something, then you're gonna lose their vote.
Kids are smart.
They pick up on what's happening.
They probably pick up certainly on dissention within the team.
You were assertive, and you made every decision.
And it was really bizarre, because every time a member of your team was coming forward with an idea,
Bang!
You squashed them.
Is that just arrogance or selfishness?
I was the team Captain, so I took charge of my team.
Jennifer, was...
Christian a good Captain?
Absolutely not.
Every time I brought up an idea, it was pushed to the side.
I told us we had to put onions to make that burger juicy.
I disagree.
Kids don't like mustard,
I certainly don't think they're gonna like onions.
Across the board, 200 kids, you're gonna have a kid that's not gonna like an onion.
They're never even gonna know it's in there if it's shaved.
It's gonna flavor it.
Okay, I had my five-year-old nephew, and let me tell you something, kid doesn't eat , and he would eat that.
I love the fact that Jennifer stood up to him and was like, "You suck as a leader.
You're an arrogant bastard."
I thought it was pretty damn funny.
The harsh reality of your failure cooking for that block party is that at least one of you will be leaving MasterChef.
Christian, tell me the two weakest performers that should face the pressure test from your losing team.
Um, me, because I was the Captain.
And Jennifer.
If she didn't know how to make caramel sauce, she should have said something.
I didn't stick a spoon in there and stir it around like you were.
Jennifer, would you go head to head in this tough pressure test against Christian?
I think I'm a better cook than him, so if it's cooking, absolutely.
Christian?
I'll go head to head right now.
I know I'm a better cook than her.
Derrick, who would you put your money on?
Uh, if it's just straight-up cooking and technique,
I'd have to go with Christian.
Adrien?
It's gonna be Christian.
Christian, Jennifer, you'll be facing the pressure test.
Alongside...
Derrick and Adrien.
All four of you are gonna do it.
I definitely feel like I'm not the cook that Adrien or Christian is, so this is a really scary pressure test for me.
Today's challenge really puts the pressure in the pressure test.
It's the dish that puts the fear of God into any professional chef anywhere in the world.
Because today's pressure test is all about a stunning, unique, delicious...
Cheese souffle.
I'm super excited to see that the souffle is the pressure test.
I've done them a few times for dinner parties, so I'm excited.
It's like a chef's nightmare, one of the hardest challenges they've ever made anybody in MasterChef face.
It truly takes a MasterChef to craft a perfect, savory souffle.
Nothing will be able to really define your skill as much as being able to do a souffle.
Step behind your stations, please.
Your 90 minutes start from...
Now.
Good luck.
In this pressure test, the home cooks will have 90 minutes to make as many cheese souffles as they want, but can only present one to the judges.
At any time during the challenge, the contestants can present their perfect souffle.
The judges will be looking for texture, proper rise of the dough, and overall flavor.
It's gonna be one of the most exciting pressure tests.
Chefs anywhere in the world will still screw up a souffle.
Cheese souffle is less forgiving than even a sweet souffle.
Think of the oils and the fats in cheese.
That can go so wrong across the egg whites.
And then if it's too light and it's packed with egg white and you haven't got that cheese richness, that lovely sort of cheese puff, that's what we're looking for.
I have done savory souffles and sweet souffles.
Making the perfect one's the scary part.
There's a lot of things that can go wrong with a souffle.
You gotta have a lot of patience, um, you really have to be accurate about everything.
Souffle is one of those things where you have to have exact measurement, and if you don't, it falls.
Right now, I'm just, uh, pulling the butter up to the top of the ramekin so when the souffle comes up, it'll rise out of there the right way.
All right, guys, you have just 45 minutes to go.
The four MasterChef competitors are racing to create the roux, a mixture of flour and butter, which is a building block of a perfect souffle.
He didn't cook his roux.
He never cooked his roux.
That's gonna taste nasty.
Gonna taste disgusting.
I'm very confident in my skills.
I cook by touch and feel and instinct.
Takes a little bit of balls.
I'm gonna make a great souffle my way.
What you doing?
I'm gonna combine both the cheeses, both the parmesan and the cheddar.
What texture you going for?
Nice and creamy.
Who's gonna come up short?
Christian.
I think he's an arrogant son of a bitch, and I think he's a liar.
I don't know what the hell Jennifer's talking about.
She just wants to throw me under the bus, 'cause she's mad that she has to be down here doing this.
I didn't come here to let some punk-ass little piece of run his mouth and treat people like .
It's not who I want representing me as a MasterChef.
After a loss in this week's team challenge,
Christian, Derrick, Adrien, and Jennifer must face the toughest pressure test yet-- a cheese souffle.
Tension between Christian and Jennifer reaches a boiling point.
I didn't come here to let some punk-ass little piece of treat people like .
Om?
No, I don't feel anything from anyone.
Nothing?
Just on your island over here?
I'm trying to make a souffle.
I'm not trying to draw up a peace treaty for Jennifer and Christian.
They can handle that themselves.
I'm focusing on staying here.
Christian, you're lookin' nice and organized.
Yesterday, you succeeded in pissing a lot of people off.
Maybe people think that you cost them the challenge.
You know, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
Today, someone's gonna go home on the back of your lack of leadership.
We're here to play the game.
Who do you want to go home?
I want Jennifer to go home.
Nearly an hour into this difficult pressure test, most of the competitors are moving on to the second critical phase of making a souffle, the egg whites.
The way that a souffle rises is from the egg whites.
So if you don't have your egg whites mixed properly from the beginning, you're gonna get a flat souffle and it's not gonna rise.
And that's definitely not what you want.
Right.
Talk to me about who's gonna fall flat on their ass on this one.
Christian seems like he's in a bad mood, which is definitely not good.
Who do you want to see leave MasterChef tonight?
Christian, because I feel like he's big competition.
Good luck.
During this challenge, the home cooks can choose to serve up their souffle at any time, but they only get one shot.
How many souffles do you think each one will make?
I think you're gonna have one person out there that's gonna try to be a tough guy and just use his first one.
Like who?
I'm thinking Christian might do that.
You think Christian is...
Puttin' one up, his first one.
Is that bold as to serve the first--
I think ego gets in the way.
My plan is, let me just get one batch done, taste it, adjust, and do a second batch, so I make sure that I serve something that I'm comfortable with.
Oh, wow.
They look beautiful.
There we go.
Such a good cook, she has a whole peanut gallery to help her.
People actually like me, Christian.
'cause you're a mind .
She can go ahead and say she's a better cook than me, but I think that's a arrogant thing to say, because she knows it's baloney.
Wah wah wah wah-wah wah-wah-wah-wah.
That's all I here.
You know what, if that's what you need to make yourself feel better and confident, it's sad.
35 minutes to go.
It should take between 14 to 17 minutes in the oven.
Derrick is ahead of the game, as his first batch of souffles is already finished.
So I pull out my first batch of test souffles, and they've got the right texture, but I just really am thinking they need a little more kick.
Think I'm just gonna try to put a little more cheese in it.
I'd like it definitely to be a little bolder than this.
With Derrick already starting his second batch, the other three home cooks are anxiously awaiting the outcome of their first souffles.
Comin' up really nice.
Not gettin' too brown.
The one on the left is...
Ahh! "Souferb."
Despite having more than enough time to bake a second batch,
Christian decides to serve his very first souffle.
I'm like, "cook another souffle!"
To serve something that you haven't had the chance to perfect right off the bat to the judges could be suicide.
You could be going home because of that choice.
I would never do that.
This is it, yes?
That is my souffle.
Okay, great.
What's in there?
Cheddar, pinch of parmesan, little bit of chive, um, some mustard powder, some garlic powder, and I rimmed the, uh, ramekin with parmesan.
Okay, visually, it's got the impact.
Smells good from here.
What's the texture we're looking for in the center?
It should be nice and fluffy, and still have that little bit of creamy edge from the cheese.
The waiting's killing me.
I think he just needs to say something, 'cause, uh, it's nerve-racking.
20 minutes to go.
If you're going in for the last batch now, they should be in the oven in the next three to four minutes.
I just put the second batch in.
It better be the batch that works 'cause I don't have time to make another batch of souffles.
This is all or nothing for me right now.
I'm looking at my first batch through the oven, and it's rising just the right amount.
It's perfect.
I'm gonna serve it.
I'm not even gonna put another batch in the oven.
Okay, Adrien.
It's light and fluffy, a little creamy.
Four parts gruyere, two parts cheddar.
Structure looks good to you?
Yes.
Good color on top?
Yes.
You looking for it to be more wet or more dry?
A little more wet.
The fact that they're not responding instantly after tasting it is torture.
I'm looking at my test souffle, and it looks beautiful, so I'm gonna go with this one.
This is gonna be the winner.
Should be nice and rich.
I actually steeped my chives in my milk, so you'll have that background of onion flavor.
So when I cut right through here in the middle...
Should be nice and gooey.
Very custardy.
Yeah.
Eggs have been your undoing in the past.
You count on the salinity, the salt coming from the parmesan, or did you add additional salt?
I backed off the salt just a hair, because of the salt in the parmesan cheese, yes.
Come on, Derrick.
I'm running out of time.
The only thing I can do is just keep looking at my oven and see how my souffles are doing.
How long, Derrick?
Uh, momentarily.
One minute to go.
They're rising, they look good, but they still need a little more time.
Derrick, 30 seconds to go!
Share the joy of cooking with your kids with cooking kits as seen on MasterChef.
These oven-ready kits are chef inspired for kids who cook by Kidsline.
One minute to go.
Derrick is the only home cook to make a second batch of souffles, but with only seconds left, will his decision leave him with nothing to serve?
Ay yi yi.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Here you go.
Light and creamy, predominantly gruyere cheese.
I went for sharp, and, uh, there's some parmesan, intermixed throughout.
I garnished it with some parmesan and some chives on top.
Second attempt or third attempt?
Second, chef.
Second?
This is your best?
Yes.
What kind of cheese predominantly?
Predominantly gruyere with some parmesan in there.
The judges must decide based purely on their souffle who will move on in the competition and who will be sent home.
Yeah, Jennifer.
Jennifer, with the cheese flavor and texture.
With the chives, the question is...
Yeah, interesting.
Yeah, seriously.
Yeah.
It's close.
That was intense.
And for us, so far, the most difficult pressure test ever on MasterChef.
Okay.

You look like you're on star search.
Turn into their worst nightmares.
That is one of your worst performances in MasterChef.
And at least one more home cook's

Lesson twenty-eight.
Say "Hi" instead of "Hello" in informal conversations.
She asked what the matter was and what was wrong.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm not bad.
How did they make Pasand agree with this?
I was not worried about Pasand at all.
She always listens to others.
I don't know what made my uncle change his mind.
Mother knows how to talk him into something.
Mom?
!
I'm coming.
What are you doing there, Ali?
Don't!
Don't!
- Ali!
- Hi.
How are you, auntie?
- Hi.
- Where are you going?
Why did you take your clothes off?
Didn't you learn your lesson last year?
- Hi.
- I have missed you.
- You have lost weight.
- Shush!
What are you doing?
Don't you..
Why isn't it right?
Do you expect me to cry or something?
It's not like we are mourning or anything.
She is getting married, for God's sake!
See?
You said we were late, but we got here first.
Could we be your bridesmaids, ma'am?
!
- Oh, God!
Look at them!
- This isn't her.
- She will be the next bride.
- Don't you laugh at us!
We had a flat tire.
Otherwise we would get here sooner than you.
- Hold the baby.
- No need.
Get the luggage and the blanket from the car.
- Hello!
- Come in, Hajj Naser!
- Did you have a good pilgrimage?
- Hi, Mother.
Thank you.
- I hope we could go together next time.
- You are late again, Hajji!
Were you driving in top gear again?
You could break down your car engine, man.
- Hi.
- Sister Marzieh!
- Come on.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
- I have missed you a lot.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Please go get your mother.
Why?
Don't you want to come in?
I will come in later.
I don't want your grandma to find out.
Ok.
Instead of taking care of me, he just hurts me.
You shouldn't cry in front of the children.
I'll show him.
Go get some sugar-cubes from auntie, sweetie.
- He always yells at me.
- Go now!
Good girl!
They make him do it.
He hurts me all the time.
He even shaved his hair on the wedding day.
I know why he's doing this.
He wants to make me mad.
- Hello.
- Hajj Naser!
- Excuse me.
- Hi, Mahnaz.
- Hi.
- I didn't see Hamid here.
- He'll come later.
- Look at Marzieh!
- You are almost as tall as your mother.
- Thanks.
Wow!
Look at the food.
It smells great.
- What's the problem?
- I can't find my cell-phone.
- Maybe you left it at home.
- No, I had it in the car.
- Maybe it's still in the car.
- I already looked.
It wasn't there.
Isn't it back there?
It must be somewhere around here.
Don't worry, you'll find it.
It isn't here.
Producer and Director Reza Mir-Karimi
- Is my uncle alright?
- Just do the dishes.
Who came?
Was it Mahnaz?
Yeah.
She's at the kitchen.
- So?
- Nothing.
Look at all these sugar-cubes.
Your husband is a very accurate man, auntie.
- They're all the same size!
- Her hearing-device isn't working.
She can't hear you.
That's Azam's husband.
- Did you enjoy your pilgrimage?
- It's not him.
Shamsi lives in Qom.
Shamsi promised she'd take her to pilgrimage.
You naughty!
You remember things that benefit you only.
- Listen!
- Masoumeh called last night.
Would you like some tea?
She said she'd come tomorrow, because of Masoud's exams.
I think it's because of Naser.
You should give Hormoz a call.
How dare Hormoz?
He could call.
- I'll make him come.
- Here you are.
- I just made tea.
- Thank you.
Why does your brother look so upset, by the way?
- You said he was fine with it.
- He is.
He's been breaking the sugarloaves since yesterday.
- Pasand!
- Yes?
Don't touch his things.
He'll be mad.
Come on!
I need some practice for tonight.
Would you like to have a daughter or a son?
If I break it with two strikes, she'll have a daughter.
That's true you have good son-in-laws.
But she's gonna need a son in such a faraway place.
Look how they compliment themselves!
Give it to me.
Just watch and learn how I'll break it.
Auntie!
He went to Karbala.
But he not only hasn't brought us anything, but also he hasn't changed at all.
But he not only hasn't brought us anything, but also he hasn't changed at all.
- Left or right?
Which one?
- Come on, you smarty-pants!
You should take it with your left hand.
Even Ali could do it with his right hand.
You can't do it.
Look what you did!
She'll have a son.
He'll be a bit small, actually!
Remember, auntie?
He broke a sugarloaf for Hamid and me too and we only have daughters.
Look at the mother and daughter speaking alone.
Where have those been all along?
If you make a mess breaking the sugarloaf tonight, we'll show you.
Using these!
You don't need a gun to make me obey you, darling.
I can't believe that your uncle agreed to put them up on the wall.
- I guess he really likes the guy.
- I want to put it somewhere too.
- Let me...
- How I love you!
You want to show off to the neighbors, don't you?
Of course not.
This isn't any of their business.
- Yes, it is.
- There!
It looks great!
I take responsibility for that.
Naser!
Naser!
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Let me kiss your hand.
- No need.
My hands are wet.
People used to go to pilgrimage with horses and donkeys...
- How are you?
- You should take care of the stew, Jafar.
We have a lot to do.
Why don't you ever ask Hajji to do anything?
Wish you were there with us.
I prayed for you at Imam Ali's holy shrine.
How long did it take you to get there?
We took off at noon and the next day in midnight, we were...
- Two days it was.
- Yes, two days.
We bought you this from Karbala.
We wanted to put off the pilgrimage to some other time when we have more money but it was getting late as we had taken a vow to go there after our children were born.
- We got this from Najaf.
- From the same man you told us about.
- No, that's not true.
- It is.
That man is dead, we got this from his son.
- It wasn't his son.
- Mom!
I am tall enough to walk in the pool now.
I won't drown again!
- I swear it's true.
- Ok.
- Go dry your body.
- Pasand!
Pasand!
It's from them.
Look at that!
Look at that!
That's too bad to have a rich brother-in-law!
- Bravo, Jafar!
- You should pick it up.
Poor he!
You can't leave a long distance call unanswered.
- The color looks great on you, mom.
- The waist is too tight, honey.
- I am too old to wear this.
- I don't know about you.
But my mom is still very young.
Look at her!
- She's standing right here.
- Auntie!
- Yes, honey?
- Isn't your husband abroad?
- Yes, he is.
- Is Karbala abroad too?
- It is, honey.
- I told you!
You shouldn't take all your pictures with you.
Your luggage will be just heavy.
Let me put this here.
Everything I did, I did for your happiness.
I love you.
Your late dad would be happy too, if he were here.
Mom!
Mom!
Auntie!
Auntie!
Masoum shouldn't listen to everything her husband says.
She should have come.
They need to be here when we are breaking the sugarloaf.
Look!
They have a lot of guests.
Since Hormoz went to jail he's been acting even worse.
He's been like this, since I can remember.
That's why his first wife left him.
- Who?
- Poor Masoumeh!
- She didn't want him to quit his job.
- He didn't quit.
- They fired him.
- No, sister...
Mom!
Ali went by the pool.
- You can go to him too.
- Auntie!
Auntie!
Can I see your cell-phone?
- It's in the room, honey.
- So, Pasand!
- What was the groom telling you?
- Yeah...
- Tell us what he said.
- Nothing.
Just things, you know!
Wait!
What things?
!
It's ok.
The groom doesn't speak Farsi well.
"I have been in love with you since I were a child, Mademoiselle Pasand!"
"Now let me have a kiss, if you don't mind!"
"Now let me have a kiss, if you don't mind!"
(Singing)
How I love her!
She doesn't talk at all.
She is very shy.
Look at her!
It won't remain the same.
When she sees how marriage life really is she will both wear beautiful clothes and learn to argue.
- She will change.
- That poor guy!
Don't say that, sister.
It is hard to live away from your country.
Why?
It's actually great.
She'll be away from her in-laws, at least.
And if her husband bosses her around, she can call the police and get him arrested.
Give me that.
Hello?
Is that the police station?
My sister bothers us a lot.
How could we file a complaint?
- Give that to me.
- Pardon?
Hold on a second.
What?
What are you doing?
Give it to me.
Excuse me, sir...
I guess you don't have any woman colleagues, so...
- Watch the food.
- Ali!
Only if I catch you!
Ali!
It was your mom's fault.
I wanted to get her arrested.
Shamsi!
She's hanging your children's clothes.
Go!
What are you looking for?
You'll get sick if you touch a frog.
It gives you warts.
There are a lot of frogs here at the beginning of the spring.
There aren't many of them here now.
Remember?
I'm here, you silly!
Is that your dad?
Isn't he afraid of going there alone?
There are a lot of ghosts in the stock-house.
Do you want me to catch you a frog?
A frog.
What was that?
They say whoever tramples over a frog, will lose his dad.
Tell me-- Have you been to that stock-house?
Have you seen the ghosts?
Tell me the truth.
I haven't seen them.
They aren't there in daylight.
You can mostly find them at night time.
Ghasem...
who just took off to military service used to study there.
Maybe he's seen the ghosts.
Take this.
Marzieh!
Please watch the babies for a second.
I'll be right back.
Hi, honey.
Hi, sweetie!
Look at her!
What are you doing?
Crazy kid!
You are unbelievable!
This one is blocked.
Hold it for a second, Ali.
Come on.
Watch them.
I'll be right back.
You behave, Ali!
Drink this.
Drink it.
That's enough.
You can have some too.
There, there!
Don't cry...
That's enough.
Let your sister drink some too.
I can't believe it!
Your sister is hungry too.
You need to wait for your turn.
Do we have more rice, Azam?
We have two buckets full.
Bring the second one too.
We're gonna need it.
- Mom!
- What?
- Take.
- What is it?
Nothing.
Just to take care of the ceremony.
I can pay for that.
Jafar needs this money.
Jafar will get offended if you don't accept it.
- You have lots of expenses.
- Why should Jafar get offended?
Just forget it.
I'll go get the rice.
Azam!
God won't leave me empty-handed.
Just think that God sent you that too.
Twenty four..
- One... two...
- A lot of great girls here.
- Isn't it true, honey?
- I'm hungry.
I'll set the table soon.
Are you counting?
How many times did she bend?
- Twice.
- Bravo!
- Two!
- Wish we had brought Jafar something.
- He keeps talking about it.
- Come on!
It's Karbala.
The best gift you could bring from there is its soil.
- What are you doing?
- What?
!
What are you laughing at, kid?
It will happen to you too.
You naughty!
- Who is that?
- That's the guy who brought the lamps.
He is such a liar!
- Is he a bold kid?
- Oh, yeah!
I went in the pool and the water was this high!
- How high?
- This high!
Hormoz will come.
I talked to him and convinced him to come.
Reza!
Ali!
Lunch is ready.
I hope he feels like coming, because if he doesn't...
Here you are, auntie.
He will ruin the wedding, if he doesn't feel like it.
- Give me my lunch.
- Sure.
He has a good heart.
You shouldn't mess with him.
I didn't say anything.
He starts joking and then he gets offended all of a sudden!
There is room for him at the table.
It means that he will come.
Mom!
Mom!
What does it mean when there is extra room at the table?
- It means that a guest will come.
- Great!
- We will have more guests!
- Keep it down.
- Did you wash your hands, Ali?
- Yes.
Can I have some fries, auntie?
I want water.
Sure.
Is that true that mom's uncle has killed a bear with his bare hands?
- Eat your food.
- Mom!
- What does a bear look like?
- I don't know.
It looks like a dog...
It's just a little bigger than that.
The chicken isn't salty, brother.
Kitty!
Would you like something else?
Didn't Ghasem come?
I told him to come.
- Maybe he couldn't take a leave...
- You should have called him.
- I don't want him to feel uncomfortable.
- He couldn't take a leave.
Even if he can't come tonight he will definitely be here tomorrow when they'll register the marriage.
You should call so that he won't be upset.
- Hi.
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Come here.
- Hello.
- Welcome.
- Thanks.
I brought you some new English Conversation CDs.
Did you listen to the last ones?
Were they any good?
- Hi.
- Hi, sister.
Congratulations.
- Did Hormoz come?
- I made him come because of you.
I hope he won't get into a fight with Hajj Naser.
Hey!
Come here.
- Who just came?
- Auntie Masoumeh.
Great, Missy!
You are doing the right thing.
You shouldn't stay in this godforsaken place.
You wouldn't come if Jafar didn't call, would you?
Jafar?
!
We took off half an hour before he called.
I didn't tell him because I knew he would enjoy bragging about it.
You said the engagement party was tomorrow and the marriage was the day after that.
- Didn't you?
- They couldn't find tickets for Thursday.
That's why we're holding it one day sooner.
We're gonna watch the game!
- Hi, auntie.
- Hi, honey.
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.
- How was your exam, Reza?
- It was ok.
Why are you standing there, honey?
Didn't you say you had to pee?
- There's a hole in there.
- No one can see through it.
Go.
- So, Samira should stand over there.
- Ok.
Go.
Samira!
Could you please stand over there, honey?
I'll stand in front of the hole, so that no one see you.
I told her the same thing.
But she didn't listen to me.
How I love you!
You've become such a lady!
Look at her beautiful hair!
I'm sure mom will buy you a beautiful scarf soon.
You said you'd stand in front of the hole, mom.
I'm coming, honey.
You make me fall in love with you, whenever you wear those shades!
- Who bought you those?
- My dad.
And aunt Pasand made me a wedding dress!
- It has decorations and everything!
- Great!
- It's very fluffy and I have a tiara too.
- I have one too.
- Mind your business!
- Why didn't your dad come?
- He was busy.
- You need to shake.
Go on and shake hands.
There you go!
- He's just come back from pilgrimage.
- May God accept your prayers!
I prayed for you a lot.
Maybe I would still be behind the bars, if it weren't for your prayers!
Of course not.
Ok, I won't read you any more of my text messages.
- Just forward them to him!
- Help yourselves!
I brought an LCD TV so that we can watch the game together.
Masoud!
Where are you going?
Why didn't you eat?
- I'll eat later.
- Masoud!
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How are you?
I hope you enjoyed your pilgrimage.
How are you, auntie?
Congratulations, mom!
How are you?
Stop!
Eat this.
Don't touch it!
Aren't you done?
I want to decorate the place.
There is no one to help me.
- What?
- Nothing.
It is two gigabytes.
It will take some time.
- Marzieh!
- You should go outside sometimes.
These days, they teach such things to young people before they get married.
- How does it look?
- Some even have tutors.
What are you laughing at?
Are you laughing at me?
- Of course not.
- Wow!
She looks great!
[Giggly talks]
Come on!
Are you laughing at me?
Of course not.
By the way...
How old is the groom?
I don't even remember how he looks like.
Isn't Keyvan the tall guy with green eyes?
Keyvan isn't tall at all!
The one Shamsi is talking about is Shahrokh.
Oh no!
Are you awake?
Oh no!
Are you awake?
You must be ashamed of yourself!
I can't sleep with you here.
She is right.
Shahrokh was the tall one.
He was the best looking among them all.
- Stop it, Azam!
- Why?
I'm telling the truth.
Maybe it's bitter, but it's true.
Shush!
She's not wearing her hearing device, is she?
You know, Pasand!
They will ask you personal questions in order to make sure that you didn't get married just to go abroad.
- Why?
What are they going to ask?
- Just questions.
Where you met...
How you fell in love.
You should tell the truth.
Tell them you don't care about love.
- All it matters is that he is a Vaziri!
- I can't believe you!
- Where are you going, auntie?
- You will get tired.
Anything you need, auntie?
Here's your cell-phone, auntie.
I didn't find mine.
The grooms rich.
You should have bought a wedding gown, instead of making one.
- Who is going to make my clothes?
- Forget about you.
- What about Samira?
- It's ok.
Her auntie will send her designer's clothes from abroad.
Don't forget it, honey.
How should I do it?
Use pearl and confetti...
Ouch!
- Mahnaz!
- It's kicking hard.
Do you think the ultrasound results might be wrong?
- Maybe.
- Don't get your hopes high, sister.
These days, girls kick harder than boys!
Samira!
Come here.
Did you shave your hair, because you didn't have any customers?
- Give it to me.
- I said come here.
I want to cheer you up, so...
I can't believe that even my own child has no respect for me.
Listen!
Let me read you some text messages.
"Before getting married, open your eyes."
"And close them, after you get married."
- Where are you going?
- Come on.
Give me one.
Match!
Guess you have quit buying cigarettes, not smoking them!
I made a lot of friends in jail.
Scientists, doctors, engineers, poor and rich...
They're all into texting.
Prison is like college.
- Did you get your PhD?
- Listen to this one!
"Marriage is made up of three weeks of courting..."
"Three months of love..." "Three years of war... "
- "And thirty years of..."
- What are you doing?
- Come here.
- Let him be.
He could hurt himself.
He almost got himself killed last year.
The whole family is crazy.
Their daughters are insensitive.
And they all give birth to girls.
Those who have sons have raised monsters instead of boys!
Listen!
"When you are single, the only thing you lack is a wife."
"But once you get married, the only thing you have is a wife."
- That's by Plato!
- No, brother!
Only if I find her, I'll show you that I have everything!
So, tell me--
I thought you found the old books and sold them while I was in jail.
They're not among the other stuff in the stock-house.
They are buried there.
- Watch out for the tree, Ali!
- I'll go find them when no one is here.
I don't want mother to find out.
Oh no!
She's coming.
- You are in trouble.
- Deeply!
Mahnaz!
The decorations shouldn't be in the middle of the room.
Take them to the side.
Look at my sister's beautiful eyes!
Why are you looking at me like that?
My little sister is getting married.
Such a beautiful lady!
How I love you.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
- Did they bring the decorations?
- It's your husband.
- Who?
Hamid?
- He's your only husband, isn't he?
!
Sit down.
Put it down.
- I'm busy here.
- Look at him.
- He's trying to look innocent.
- Mahnaz!
Let him be.
Come and iron your dress.
Good for you!
You deserve it.
He yells at me all the time.
Pasand!
You should take this to the Louvre museum.
They might buy it from you.
- The Louvre museum isn't in the US.
- Any museum would work!
You should do the ironing, Shamsi.
Come here.
- Take this.
- Thank you.
I went to the Vaziris' house once, when I was a child.
- I think it was about twenty years ago.
- I went there a lot.
The last time, I went there for Shahrokh's wedding.
- I told you I wanted to decorate this.
- Ok, do as you wish.
- Please iron this.
- Such politeness is admirable!
- Mahnaz!
- Yes?
- Aren't my eyebrows asymmetrical?
- Let me see..
Yes, this one is shorter.
You shouldn't let the school servant wax your eyebrows.
- She took 5.000 Tomans for this.
- Let me see.
They don't even listen to you when they are busy.
- This one is shorter.
- No, it's this one.
- Oh!
- Does it look good?
- Can I go with you, mom?
- Of course not.
Grandma will get mad.
Are you going to wear these?
Yeah, what's wrong with them?
I look better than you.
- Look at my skin..
- Pasand!
Does the groom even remember you?
Maybe he's mistaken her for one of us!
Yeah, and that would be you!
Give me your necklace.
They have seen that before.
Come and take this.
Thanks, honey.
You should lend me your earrings too.
Tell me if you need something else.
Let me go with you, mom.
- Say something, auntie.
- Please take Marzieh with you, sister.
- I'll see.
- You should take a young girl with you.
- It brings luck.
- It's not like we are old!
Hello, Mrs. Vaziri!
What a surprise!
I can't believe it!
All these girls in the neighboring house have been waiting for your sons to propose.
Cyrus, Shahrokh, Shahab...
- Fereydoun.
- Right, Fereydoun.
You waited so long that all the good ones got married.
- That's the only remaining one.
- Shall I get dressed or not, mom?
- Did you say your prayers?
- I will.
- Hurry!
- Ouch!
There is a hole in your sock, you beauty queen!
Oh no!
I don't have any other socks here.
- Anybody has tan socks I can borrow?
- Not tan, but I have black ones.
- I really shouldn't come wearing these?
- No, we are going to the Vaziris' house.
- You aren't going to work.
- You already took all I had.
You can have these too.
Anybody who'd like to lend me their high-heels?
!
Good girl!
Good!
What's the rush, honey?
Take your time.
- Hi.
- Where are you going?
- To Mahnaz.
- With your shoes on?
You didn't help us wash the rugs and now you want to walk on them wearing your shoes?
!
Hi, Shamsi.
How was your pilgrimage?
- How are you?
- Look at her!
- Why didn't you come here for lunch?
- I was busy with work.
- Mahnaz is changing her clothes.
- Ok, thanks.
- Hamid!
- Sorry!
- Azam!
Pasand!
Everyone!
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Mahnaz!
- Mahnaz!
- What?
- What do you want?
- Didn't you bring me a clean shirt?
- You said you weren't going.
- l can't go wearing this.
No, you can't.
Poor he!
He doesn't have a shirt to wear.
That was his excuse to talk to me.
He was supposed to be there with the shirt he is wearing.
- Just let go of it, Mahnaz.
- Auntie!
- Be careful!
- Fereshteh!
Honey!
Come here.
They'll find you soon, if you both hide in the same place.
Mom is going out.
I'll be back soon.
- Ok.
- Go find somewhere else to hide.
Ok?
- Ok.
- Let's go.
Don't come.
How many times do you have to count them?
Wish I had some more.
Counting won't make them grow more in number!
- Where should I hide?
- You want to hide somewhere?
Come here.
Come here.
- I'm coming.
- Don't!
- What did you do about the fruits?
- We washed them all.
They're in the fridge.
How I love you!
- Don't say anything to embarrass us.
- No one will embarrass you.
What else?
- Go!
Go!
Go!
- What about me?
I'm here.
What's up, Reza?
- Are you looking for something?
- No.
So, come and help me with these lights.
Come on.
Take them.
Who turned these on?
We could get electro-shocked!
[Singing]
Masoud.
Are you here?
Look if I'm right.
Ghorban-Ali is very punctual.
He turns the power off at the same time everyday.
This is the university I have applied for.
- Oh!
It's your resume?
- Pasand!
- Give me a light, please.
- Ok, sister.
Take it to her.
- Your suit is in the room.
- I don't like wearing suits.
I'll take one of these, auntie.
Thank you.
Listen carefully!
I don't want my hair short.
Ok.
I won't change anything.
- Don't touch the hair up here, Hamid.
- I know how to do my work.
It brings bad luck if you cut hair at night.
It's ok, auntie.
It's for the wedding.
Wait!
What did you just do?
- You cut my hair too short.
- No, I didn't.
- I haven't even started yet.
- You know what?
No need.
I look fine.
You need to cut your hair for tomorrow, don't you?
Let Hamid take care of it for you.
I can't let him touch my hair even when it's light.
- Let alone doing it in this dark.
- It will be finished soon.
That's exactly why I don't need that.
Why don't you leave me alone?
- Hamid!
Let him be.
- Leave me alone.
- It's their fault.
I didn't do anything.
Now I know who my wife took after in being so stubborn.
Even bears can't get away from him.
How could you?
Don't be so naive.
If he had killed a bear, he wouldn't have kept bulls' pictures!
I give him every right to be afraid, if you cut hair like you do electric works.
I plugged something in and the fuse went off.
That's not the fuse.
It's an-electricity cut.
We've had power shortage for two weeks now.
- Didn't you know that?
- Why?
They opened a powerhouse a month ago.
They did.
But then they remembered that they needed to change the cables too.
So, are we to break the sugarloaf in the dark?
Don't worry.
My cousin is the power factory manager.
He will make an exception for us tonight.
- Masoud!
Get down.
- What a country has it become, Hajji!
- It's not like phone lines that they can.
C) They cannot let go of their worldly attachments.
- D) All the above.
- Of course it's D.
Which of the followings are the reasons for development of western countries in comparison to the Islamic nations?
A) Science and development is not more than a mirage in west.
Excuse me...
B) The western countries owe their progress to the old age Islamic scientists.
C) The Islamic nations have been colonized throughout history.
D) Al-lsra Surah, Verse 20.
Well, I don't know what that verse is.
We need to look it up in the Holy Quran.
What is obvious is that God helps everyone.
That's the divine tradition.
How should I put it?
The more you try, the more God provides for you.
Time is up.
You only have twenty seconds for each question.
I could never raise them, without your help.
You helped them all get married.
Pasand was born in your house.
- This isn't my size.
- It is fine.
That's just what you think.
Even you picked her name.
Here's your watch.
Great!
They may even mistakenly take you for the groom.
- This watch doesn't work.
- It doesn't matter.
It looks nice.
I can't be happy, unless you are happy, brother.
What are you doing, Hamid?
Give it up for Ghorban-Ali, the electricity company manager!
I love you, brother.
We all respect you.
Let's leave the disagreements behind.
- Take it away.
- This isn't my fault.
Take this hat.
They shouldn't have brought it here.
Unbelievable!
It looks great on you.
Where are you going?
He was pulling my thread!
Oh no!
Azam said I should take care of her.
Auntie!
It's over.
You said your prayers.
You should end it.
I wasn't here, Hajji.
I don't know if she's done.
It is ok.
It's still acceptable from her.
Auntie!
Please pray for me.
- Don't touch the guests' shoes.
- What are you doing?
Let me wear these.
You'll see.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you please call Jafar?
- Azam!
- Jafar!
- How do I look?
- How did you change so much?
!
- Hello.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Welcome.
- Congratulations.
- Make yourself comfortable, please.
What are you doing?
- Here you are.
- No, thanks.
- Give him one.
- Come on!
- You can have one as this is a wedding.
- I just told you.
I have diabetes.
Here you are.
- Have some sweets, please.
- No, thanks.
- Mansour.
- Yes?
- What are you doing?
- That's none of your business.
- What do you want?
- I want to use the bathroom.
Feel free!
Here's the groom.
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!
- This is from the bride's oldest sister.
- Please pass this.
- Here comes the sugarloaf!
- Pass it to Hajji to break it.
- Peace be upon Prophet Muhammad!
- Peace be upon Prophet Muhammad!
- You should do it.
- My arm hurts.
Let someone else do it.
With your and Mr. Vaziri's permission let the oldest son-in-law break it.
Go on.
Thanks.
Wish them happiness.
Let's hear it for the happiness of this beautiful bride and the groom!
That's a cool torch!
With three big batteries, you can see anything with this.
- Let me see.
- No, you'll break it.
- It's not mine.
- What's that?
- What's with the electricity tonight?
- What the heck are you doing here?
You said you were going to the bathroom.
I will use the bathroom later.
Where are you two going?
- We want to go see the ghosts.
- What is it?
- You shouldn't have told him.
- Ghosts?
- Shall I?
- Please!
- Who turned on the light there?
- Maybe they've forgotten to turn it off.
No.
Maybe the ghosts turned it on.
Shush!
Did you hear that?
I heard something.
What was it?
Maybe we should come back some other night.
Take away the light from us and let's see what's going on there.
No.
I don't want to make the ghosts mad.
Run!
I told him not to go with us.
It was his fault.
- Drink this and you'll be fine.
- Leave him alone.
Go.
He doesn't need that.
I'll take care of him.
But I brought you the test results.
True.
Well, I still feel the same.
I'm nauseous and...
The day after tomorrow.
Why?
Why is it canceled, Doctor?
Right!
Oh!
Chemotherapy...
No, I'm not worried.
Let's keep it between ourselves, Doctor!
My wife nurses the babies and I don't want her to...
Hello?
Are you frightened?
Of course you are.
It is frightening.
We didn't even have a gate here before.
It looked like a jungle out there.
You could find anything there.
Lions, bears, wolves...
I used to take my dad's gun with me whenever I needed to use the bathroom.
My dad was a gunner.
I went to the bathroom once when I heard something from the back of the yard.
A pair of leopard eyes was staring at me through the hole in the bathroom door.
I was frightened to death!
I was lucky I was already in the bathroom.
Or I could wet my pants!
You should drink this.
It's good for you.
Can you take the sugar-cube like me?
Look!
Put it here.
Hit the palm of your hand with your other hand and the sugar-cube will bounce!
You'll learn by practicing.
- What happened next?
- What?
- The leopard...
- Oh!
It wasn't a leopard.
It was a cat.
It had a piece of bone stuck in his throat and that's why he was roaring.
When you are scared, even you see a cat as a leopard.
Look what you did.
Ali was frightened to death.
- What's this for?
- It's good for the burn.
- It's alright.
- No, it isn't.
You ruined the ceremony.
Everyone thought it was poor Ghorban-Ali.
It's done.
Turn it on now.
- I should connect the fuse.
- Hajj Naser is here.
Thanks for the toothpaste.
The burn wasn't that bad.
It wasn't my fault.
The pickax hit the wire.
Why are you so upset?
You shouldn't get the wrong idea, Hajj Naser!
I swear I haven't drunk since I made a promise to you.
- Not at all.
- Come in, Hajji!
Join us in the fun.
Why are you sitting out there?
He's not serious.
Don't you believe him!
See?
Why did you dig a hole there?
Oh!
Let me tell you that.
I found the map.
We'll all be rich.
I swear my shovel hit something.
Hajj Naser!
You shouldn't joke, Hormoz.
He believed it.
- Don't mess with him.
- Is this you, aunt Masoum?
- Look at your hair!
- Oh!
That's in college.
Yeah, that's where you got rid of your accent!
- Look at auntie!
- Such a hottie!
- What do you mean hottie?
!
- I mean graceful and nice!
Doesn't anyone want to get some sleep?
She's getting married tomorrow.
She shouldn't be giving auntie a bath!
She wanted to do it.
Yeah, auntie doesn't let anyone but Pasand wash her.
- Where did you find those pictures?
- In aunt Pasand's album.
- I haven't seen those.
- Is this aunt Pasand?
!
Look at her!
She looks like Samira a lot.
- Who is this guy?
- It's Ghasem.
- Her cousin?
- No, he is auntie's nephew.
They raised him after he lost his parents.
- Shush!
- Why didn't you dye my hair?
I will.
I'll do it right away.
I told mom about it when Ghasem came here to get ready for the university entrance exam.
I told her that she shouldn't let him come here if he doesn't want to let Pasand marry him.
That's what our uncle wanted.
He wanted for Pasand and Ghasem to get married.
It's not his decision.
Ghasem didn't even propose.
He just comes here anytime he has a leave and he never says anything.
- What are they doing?
- Let me see.
- Marzi!
- She is pregnant, for God's sake!
Come here, auntie.
The wedding we're holding is very much different from theirs.
What if they hold the same party for men and women?
- No, Hajj Naser wouldn't allow that.
- Azam!
This could break.
[Singing]
Is the game still on?
Even if you find the treasure, you should make sure if it's lawful or not.
Isn't it true, Hajji?
- Did you hear him, Naser?
- It's lawful for you.
You don't have to give away anything.
I won't forget to give you your share.
Hajjis get as much as they could from people!
- All these troubles are because of you.
- What have I done?
Suppose that you find the books.
What the heck are you going to do with them?
- I'll use the money to get a second wife.
- That's because you are an idiot.
I don't care.
You shouldn't make the same mistake twice.
Are you happy with your marriages?
Are you?
Of course you aren't.
- It's Reza.
- Come in.
Come in.
Why are you standing there?
Do you want to watch the game with us?
- Come on.
- Like you.
- What do you wish for?
- Well, cows had no benefit for me.
Maybe I'll start a turkey business!
Maybe that will be beneficial.
You are all about animals!
What about you, Jafar?
I won't let you watch.
- I don't want to watch.
- Please!
Just answer me.
- Come on!
Tell us!
- Well, you know?
These days, there are a lot of construction workers out there.
A lot of competition...
There is this shop, that..
- I shouldn't have even talked to them.
- Spain has a good team.
They're gonna score.
Bravo!
Smart boy!
Give me five!
- That was a foul!
- Not a good game.
- They are losers, even if they win.
- How are you, man?
Having wisher isn't a sin, is it?
That hole you dug, reminds me of a grave.
- A grave?
!
- This sucks!
Hajji!
Where are you going?
- We were talking here.
- I'm allergic to too much talking.
I'm going to the roof.
There is not as warm as here.
Of course.
He has no worries, as he's sure he'll be sent to Heaven.
We need to practice taking the heat, as we could use it in Hell.
Stop it.
Hajj Naser isn't that well tonight.
- He's never well.
- Don't take off my clothes, auntie.
- Ok.
- Tell me a story.
You are tired now, honey.
I'll tell you one tomorrow night.
Ok?
- You promise?
- I do.
The kids must have played with this again.
It wasn't working yesterday, either.
Nothing works in this house.
This place will turn into a ruin soon.
Ghasem is the only one who fixes things here every now and then that he shows up.
Well, I-
- I wanted to say that...
You shouldn't eat that.
I'm heating some bread.
- I'll get it.
- There are like ten men here today.
And no one went to buy some fresh bread.
Kitty!
I'm still here.
And I'm not gonna go anywhere in five or six months.
It's ok.
I'll be gone for a few days only.
Uncle Ezzat.
Uncle Ezzat!
Mom!
Mom!
- What?
- It's Uncle Ezzat.
What's the time?
What about your uncle?
- Oh God!
- Wake up!
Is he breathing?
Ezzat!
Ezzat!
- Give him his pill.
- Uncle Ezzat!
- Must be a cardiac arrest.
- Ezzat!
Brother!
- Leave him alone.
- Give him CPR.
- I don't know how.
- Masoud knows.
- Masoud!
- Come here.
- Can you hear me, Uncle Ezzat!
- Uncle Ezzat!
- Marzieh knows how to do it.
- He isn't breathing.
He has a pulse.
Don't worry.
- He'll be fine.
- Go get a doctor.
- Do you want me to go with you?
- No.
- What happened?
- Just go!
What is it?
Is it Uncle Ezzat?
- Don't worry.
- Put a pillow under his head.
- What happened, Jafar?
- I don't know.
- What's wrong?
- Don't go there.
- It's nothing.
- I want to see my uncle.
Uncle Ezzat!
- I can't believe you!
This was the fastest ride I've ever had.
Sorry.
Let's go.
- I need that bag.
- Ok.
- Here you are
- Let's go.
- Lock it.
- Ok, I will.
- Hello.
- Come in.
Congratulations!
- Hello.
- How are you?
Hello.
- How are you, man?
- Is it your heart again?
- His heart beats.
- And he has a pulse.
- Did this happen in sleep?
- What is it?
- Will he be alright?
Please stay back.
Unbutton his shirt, please.
- Will he be ok, Doctor?
- I hope so.
- It's been fifteen to twenty minutes.
- God will decide about that.
We gave him CPR.
Marzieh did.
Oh!
Look at these old scars.
Is that a cat?
!
Must be a leopard...
Oh!
Let them cry.
Let them cry as much as they want.
Are you his grandson?
No.
He was my mom's uncle.
Your mom's uncle...
May he rest in peace!
[Reciting a poem]
That guy made me hurry.
I forgot to bring my license.
I hope I have the stamp...
Thank God I do.
This is the death certificate.
Here you are.
God bless you, son.
See you.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Auntie!
Where are you going?
- I'll go wake Ezzat.
- It's too early.
- I should make him tea.
- Not now.
- I'll do it.
- Let me go.
- Auntie!
- God bless you!
Please stay there, auntie.
I'll make tea.
Go hide her hearing aid.
Hello, neighbors.
Hello, neighbors.
[Announcing the death]
My mom says that the smell of the dead remains in the house for three days.
Go!
Go!
Go away!
What are you doing?
May late Ezzatollah Rasoulian rest in peace!
Peace be upon Prophet Muhammad!
That's enough.
- Don't be upset.
- Eat your drug, you'll have headache.
- You go inside.
- Where were you?
You just went to get a coffin.
What took you so long?
- The cemetery is very close.
- Of course not.
- I had to go to the new cemetery.
- Ok.
This one looks better and is more decent.
Here you are.
Here are the black shirts.
Give one to Jafar.
- Someone needs to go to the cemetery.
- I can't go.
I have to take care of Mahnaz.
- Have some sweet water, Mahnaz.
- Give me my black chador.
- I want to go.
- Where do you want to go?
You can't go.
Pasand!
What's his cousin's number?
- 6-6-2-4-4-2-0.
Where do you want to go?
You can't go to the funeral.
Azam!
Azam!
Ok.
Ok, bye.
You can't wear black clothes today.
Uncle Ezzat doesn't want you to be unhappy either.
Why can't I wear black?
The black scarf you are wearing is enough.
Come here, Hamid.
Mahnaz isn't well.
What happened?
What happened?
Get up!
Get up!
- Let me wear that black dress.
- Come on.
Come on.
[Reading Quran]
Hajj Naser!
Hajji!
- Hajj Naser!
- I'm coming.
[Children singing a song]
- Louder, guys.
- Lie down.
You can't go anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere, either.
I'll be right here.
Louder, kids!
Don't worry.
You can go.
Wish I could go too.
What would people think?
Go get some pots from the stock-house.
Why are you back?
They said I should help Javaher make dinner.
You'd better go if you mean to work with your laptop instead of helping.
No, I will help.
Late uncle Ezzat used to blame people for doing things at the wrong time.
He had reproached me for that a lot.
Now he took his revenge on Vaziri by dying at the wrong time!
God knows why this happened.
We are having a funeral instead of a wedding now.
What?
Nothing.
- What do you want?
- I want to get the pots.
I'll get them.
Go help Javaher.
Just go!
[Singing]
[Singing]
Ouch!
Damn it!
- We were playing, mom!
- You should get something to eat.
- Sit down.
- I am surprised all those people showed up at his funeral in this hot weather.
- I'm not hungry.
- Would you like something else?
I'm just not hungry.
That red bus-- it was coming from Ardakan.
When did they hear of it?
!
A lot of people came here to go to the cemetery with us.
- The Vaziris were astonished.
- We were astonished too.
- Is Uncle Ezzat dead?
- You shouldn't underestimate him.
Javaher said he used to bring enough meat for the whole Shams-Abad whenever he would come back from hunting.
- Isn't it true, Hormoz?
- Don't sit on the floor.
- You can catch a cold.
- It's very warm in here.
Poor he!
He was always worried about us.
- I want some water, mom.
- Me too.
Could you please give me two glasses?
- May he rest in peace!
- Where is Hajj Naser?
He said he'd stay at the cemetery to pray for the deceased's soul.
Maybe we should get some meat.
Don't get back home from the cemetery soon, when I die.
Stay by my grave for a few hours.
Feel free to die, Hormoz!
Because I am planning to set a tent and stay by your grave for a week.
- Ok?
- Ok.
But I wish someone else had made that promise.
Someone who would still be alive when I die, as I do not intend to die before you!
Shush!
- You know what, Mahnaz?
- What?
You must be ashamed of yourself.
We are mourning here.
Vaziri's oldest son was talking to Jafar about the wedding at the cemetery.
- Bring some food for your auntie, Azam.
- Sure.
- You didn't eat anything, mother.
- She hasn't eaten since morning.
What do I tell them?
Their return tickets are due to the day after tomorrow.
They can cancel the tickets and get new ones.
It's not about the tickets.
It's the embassy.
They have made an appointment.
If they don't go now, it will be delayed for a couple of months.
- What's that pretty guy called?
- Shahrokh.
- Oh!
The polite one.
- He's lost his hair.
Really?
He said he knew someone at the registry office.
He suggested that they make it official tomorrow, without telling anyone.
- Without telling anyone!
- What?
!
Without telling anyone?
!
Great!
That's true they are rich and we aren't.
But they can't treat us like that.
- Why are you mad at me?
!
- I'm not.
What do you want?
- Someone needs to talk to Pasand.
- Pasand?
!
Someone needs to talk to Pasand's mother!
Shush!
She could hear you, Mahnaz.
Well, that's true.
Pasand listens to everything mom says.
By the way...
Did you notice your mother at the cemetery?
She didn't cry at all.
She isn't well.
She didn't cry at all.
She isn't well.
Of course she isn't.
This isn't at all what she expected.
Jafar!
Azam!
Ghasem is here.
What do we tell him?
Grandma!
Ghasem is here.
Hello.
May he rest in peace!
- Come in.
- Welcome.
- Hi, mother.
- Hi, son.
Come on.
Come on in.
You are too late, anyway!
He went to the cemetery after you left.
He wanted to leave from there.
Naser saw him and brought him home.
Poor he!
He probably didn't feel comfortable.
He is heart broken.
Give me the tray.
Give it to me.
I'll take it.
Let me.
I'll take it.
- Go.
- Shall I?
- I tripped.
- It's ok.
I'll clean up.
We have more food.
No worries.
We have more.
- Hi, Ghasem.
- Hi.
- Sorry for your loss.
- Sorry for your loss.
- How is auntie?
- She doesn't know.
They have hidden her hearing aid.
The food will get cold.
Hajji!
You still have one other prayer to say.
I'll do it later.
Pasandideh!
What happened?
He was sitting here.
He was nagging about his radio that wasn't working.
I brought him breakfast.
I went to get some bread.
When I came back, I found him...
I don't know what happened.
Mom!
Mom!
Not enough.
These aren't enough.
I need to get some Qurans from the mosque.
Where are my glasses?
You are wearing them, mom.
And I was looking for them!
Put the dishes away.
Marzieh!
Put the dates in the tray.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Please accept my condolences.
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.
- Hi, Hajji!
- How are you?
Please accept my condolences.
- May he rest in peace!
- God bless his soul!
- Thank you.
- Hello, Hajji.
- Hello.
- Sorry for your loss.
- It's one hundred thirty five.
- One hundred and thirty five.
- Sit down.
- We need some more in that room.
- Give me ten more.
- Masoud!
- Tell the kids not to eat now.
- Please help yourselves.
Please sit.
Anything else you need?
Peace be upon Prophet Muhammad!
Hi, auntie.
Hi, auntie.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me, auntie?
- What is it?
- I am Ghasem, auntie.
- Ghasem.
- I can't hear you.
- Well, that...
- It was disconnected.
- I fixed it.
- The wire...
This is the problem.
I don't think it's anything else.
Let me...
That's where it should be.
Auntie!
This is Ghasem.
Late Seyyed Reza's son.
Your nephew.
Where were you?
- Right here.
- Not here.
He came today.
He's on a leave again.
True.
But this is the last time.
Next time I come home, I'll stay with you.
Pasand!
Come here, Pasand.
Mrs. Vaziri is leaving.
Can you make us a house?
Remember the last time we made one together?
It fell apart!
Please make us another one.
- Are you Fereshteh?
- No, I am Samira.
- Wow!
- Bravo!
- Thanks a lot.
This is one beautiful house!
Thank you very much.
- Please give me my food.
- Could we have a door too?
Wait!
Let me see what I can find.
- Take this, Samira.
- The child is outside.
The child is outside.
Why did you let her go?
She's all dirty!
Mom!
You don't have to do anything.
We'll take care of everything.
We want to set the table for the children to eat.
- Aren't you coming?
- I don't understand.
You are a clergyman, so you probably know how to sing an elegy.
- Sing something.
- Leave me alone!
My voice is husky.
I can't sing.
Just sing something short, so that she'll cry.
It's nothing serious.
If I sing, I might burst into tears, which isn't professional.
I can sing.
Shall I?
Forget it, Hamid!
This is no joke.
She will die out of grief if she doesn't cry tonight.
- Do you understand?
- Of course I do.
I really can sing.
Why don't you believe me?
He is telling the truth.
He doesn't have a bad voice.
Come here, Hamid.
Masoud!
- Haven't you seen Ghasem?
- He left.
- He said bye to Uncle Jafar and he left.
- He left?
Where did he go?
He said his leave was over and that he had to be at the base in the morning.
He said he wouldn't find a taxi if he waits any longer.
- Did he leave a long time ago?
- No, he just left.
- I can go after him, if you want.
- What?
No...
[Singing an elegy]
- She's finally crying.
- Thank God.
- He sings well.
- He does.
- Thank God the food was enough.
- It was.
May he rest in peace!
- I am thirsty, mom.
- Have some coke.
- I'm thirsty, mom.
- Just drink it.
- I want water, not coke.
- Didn't you bring water, Shamsi?
- No, I forgot.
- Pasand!
- Sit down.
- Water...
Sit.
Whoever wants water, can go get it.
We've been here for two days and you've been working all the time.
Who knows where we're gonna be tomorrow.
Here.
Have some.
- Shall I get your phone, auntie?
- No need.
Sit.
Well...
What should we tell them?
I don't know.
We'll wait...
And we'll give them an answer when forty days passes Uncle Ezzat's death.
That's for the best.
It was a great funeral.
- All the neighbors showed up.
- Ali!
- Don't make a mess here.
- You want some water?
No.
How I love you!
Previously on Awkward...
I'm not gonna hook up with Matty again until we DTR.
- What are you talking about?
- Define the relationship.
Thanks again for ditching out of the party with me.
It was the best part of the night.
Jenna, I like you.
I'm just not sure I'm ready to be in a relationship.
In high school, perception's everything.
And being dropped off by a parent is like owning a rolling backpack or kissing your grandparent on the mouth.
Unsavory.
In an environment where everyone was playing the role of judge and jury, the only way to survive was to assert some kind of independence.
All right, all right, all right.
I'm getting out.
You need to blend, and then change that shirt.
People are gonna think that we can't afford nice things.
Here.
And it's backless, so you don't even have to wear a bra.
Nice.
That'll be interesting in gym when I have to run the mile.
Jenna, it would not kill you to take a risk.
Be bold once in a while.
My mother's perception of being bold was free-boobin'.
I'd had enough.
If you're not into the shirt, at least take these so you look hip.
They're fake.
And they'll help you hide your big unibrow.
I wanted an excuse to walk in together.
But what I really needed was an excuse to talk.
Matty said he wasn't ready to be in a relationship with anyone.
But maybe he just didn't want to be in a relationship with me.
And why would he?
I was the suicide girl.
So the front said "Jenna lives,"
and the back said "in tribute."
That's clearly about me, right?
As clear as the cold sore on vera Herbert's face.
I'd say it's oozingly obvi.
I mean, crap to the **** pile,
I saw a girl get out of Matty's truck.
I mean, I think he's hooking up with someone else.
You're like a daytime talk show.
Except nobody's pregnant... yet.
All this happened before the bell even rang.
What did I do to deserve all this effed-up karma?
Okay, act totally normal and don't look now, but up on the right, she's the one in the bleachers.
- The whore!
- Yes, but don't stare!
- Not looking.
- No idea who she is.
- Ah, cramp.
- Me either.
I think she's a junior.
And she kinda looks like you.
Yeah, but prettier.
And cooler.
With bigger boobs.
She's Jenna plus.
No way.
She's Jenna minus!
You don't taste like ashtray, and you put out.
She probably puts out too.
But she's older, so the sex is super dirty.
What?
I don't mean hot dirty, I mean gross dirty.
You know, like amateur porn.
There's that guy with the shirt.
No wonder Matty wants to keep his options open.
It's hard to be seen as girlfriend material with a lurker around.
Your suicide stigma is like the herps.
Just when you think it's gone, it comes back.
So he gave someone a ride in his truck.
What's the big deal?
You're getting all worked up over a jaggoff.
The girl's just some...
Chick.
You're right, I'm probably just overreacting.
It's a friendly hug.
Like this.
See, totes friendly.
There's nothing going on with this.
Nothing below the neck.
Platonic.
Hey.
Yeah!
You wish, cretin!
It's not a friendly hug, is it?
Surrender your pain to the sugar.
I'm fine.
It's not like he's cheating on me.
We're not together.
He can get HPV from whoever he wants.
See you later.
I couldn't control Jenna plus from spreading her disease, but I could stop Kyle from spreading his.
You have to take that shirt off.
No.
Yes.
You're glorifying the suicide
I didn't even commit.
- "Jenna lives" is my band.
- Really?
You have a band?
What kind of music do you play?
- It's not your style.
- Oh, and you know this because you're clearly obsessed with me, so go change your shirt!
I don't even know you.
Plus, I know, like, a hundred Jennas.
It says "in tribute."
It's a tribute band.
Maybe it was all in my head.
I wanted to believe him.
But everywhere I went...
He was there!
Would you stop following me!
You're in the boys' bathroom.
Hey.
I have a stalker.
It's this guy named Kyle, and he's following me around making light of a very sensitive situation with a very insensitive T-shirt.
I need you to make him stop.
I mean, isn't that, like, a rights infringement or something?
Are you sure you aren't being
- a little bit paranoid?
- No!
I see him everywhere.
I mean, the shirt is pretty blatant.
Maybe Kyle designed that shirt as a fan.
You know, maybe he wants to be your dawg.
My what?
I know a little girl with a name that rhymes with Dalerie, and she didn't have any friends growing up.
And it was very painful.
Okay, are you suggesting that this is his way of trying to be my friend?
It's certainly possible.
Really?
'Cause to me it just seems like he'd rather cut off a piece of my hair and wear it in a locket around his neck.
I think the worst thing you can do right now is go to a crazy place.
Okay, I'm tired of being seen as the girl who tried to kill herself.
I didn't.
Kyle's shirt only reminds people that I'm still that girl.
And then they don't want to be seen with me, and then they don't want to date me.
And his stupid T-shirt is keeping me from moving on, not to mention, it is in really bad taste.
Oh, sweetie...
I thought it was a fan shirt.
You know what, I'll take it off.
I'll take it off.
I don't need it.
I don't care.
I'll just take it off.
Never happened.
Okay...
Where were we?
Oh, I don't know.
Thanks for saving me some tots, Kel.
What would I do without you?
McKibbs, nice hat trick yesterday, man.
Oh, thanks, dude.
Oh, hey.
I didn't see you there.
I'm so hungry.
- You hungry?
- Starved.
I could eat, like, four sandwiches or something.
Maybe some soup.
Mmm.
Well, I think they have chicken tortilla.
So listen, I know we never talked about it, but you know I didn't try to kill myself, right?
Misunderstanding.
Okay.
Uh...
Jell-o?
Mmm.
Hello.
Uh...
Your mouth is saying okay, but your eyes are saying,
"save me from this lunatic."
Which I totally understand because I'm rambling and sounding like a whack job.
But just so you know, I was having a bad day, and I slipped-
- I had an accident.
Normal people have accidents.
And that's exactly what I had because I'm perfectly normal.
Oh, what was I saying?
You're-- you're totally normal.
- Yes.
- I got it.
- I'll see ya.
- Okay.
Matty ditched me to bring that chick a sandwich?
I fooled around with the guy at least eight times, and he never bought me a sandwich.
He just bought her a sandwich.
We have to follow them.
Who?
Your face is all red, and you have crazy eyes.
Did you feed the rabid squirrels in the quad?
Listen, those shirts are spreading, and I know Matty's seen them.
Did you see those people wearing them?
I just need to find out if they're together.
You're going to a dark place, J.
Stay with us.
I just need concrete proof that they're dating.
I knew it.
You're totally cashing in on my faux suicide attempt.
That is illegal.
I could have you arrested!
You're stalking me.
Admit it.
I saw you at least five times last period.
I'm an office aid.
Mm.
Yeah?
Take the damn shirt off--now.
You are ruining my life.
Those are mine.
- Take it off.
- No.
Take it... off.
- No.
- Fine.
I will.
Just stop it, okay?
People are getting the wrong idea.
They think I'm crazy, okay?
Just stop it!
Stop stalking me, stop with these stupid T-shirts!
Just stop it!
Just stop it!
Just stop it!
- Stop it!
- You're crazy.
Does this really warrant detention?
If you were 18, it could warrant some time in the slammer.
Sorry I couldn't give you special treatment.
I mean, I could have, but there were so many witnesses.
I see some new faces...
Mixed in with the old.
To the rookies-- we're on the honor system here.
Now, I'll be back to check on you, but you won't know when.
So you best be on your best.
Like busy little worker bees-- zzz-- you will be working on your homework honey pot, and I will be in my office attending to my piles and piles of work.
Sometimes it feels like I have detention too.
We have exactly two hours.
Starting now.
Two hours for, uh, for what?
Valerie's nap.
We're heading to Giuseppe's.
Guess Jenna plus was a regular in detention.
And the leader among the rebel herd.
Maybe Matty thought being bad... was good.
Come on, newbie.
From the small bird tattoo on her ankle to the simple carmex she wore instead of lip gloss, everything about Jenna plus was cool.
Bitch.
So what are you in detention for, wonder boy?
I was caught holding the hose at the bonfire.
- Kinky.
- Yeah.
And your crime, Hamilton?
Oh, just a little...
Misunderstanding.
At lunch.
What are you in for?
I'm a detention rewards card member.
Today I blew off history 'cause I was on the phone having a meltdown with this guy.
Was she talking about Matty, or was I having a paranoia stroke?
Speak of the devil.
What?
No!
What does that even mean?
Can I bum a smoke?
Sure.
I wondered if Matty liked smokers.
And if so, could I fake a pro?
Okay, then why don't you take your sweet ass time to think about it and call me back?
Everything okay?
Yeah.
It's just my ex.
We've been on a break, and we're in the process of maybe getting back together.
Did that mean I was Matty's rebound?
Breaks are hard.
Someone always hooks up with another person, maybe even falls for them.
Think he's into someone else?
I thought so.
But now I'm not so sure.
When we're together, it's...
It's amazing.
It's like...
The world falls away...
Then the next day, he's indifferent, he doesn't call me.
He doesn't even want to be seen with me.
So started to wonder if maybe I'm imagining all the good stuff.
Jenna plus and I might have been from different planets, but her Matty heartbreak was the same.
There it was.
The answer I was chasing.
I couldn't live in the safety of denial anymore.
She was with Matty.
He was with her.
And I was with cancer.
I'm gonna let him sweat it for a little while.
Thanks for listening.
Are you okay?
Whatever the misunderstanding was today, it'll blow over.
Nothing's ever as bad as it seems.
Here.
Take my last smoke.
I'm gonna grab another pack.
As much as I wanted to hate on Jenna plus,
I couldn't.
The bitch was decent.
Maybe even sweet.
And it made me really want to kill myself.
I didn't know you were a smoker.
I'm not.
Well, I hear lung cancer does make your ass look huge.
Well, I'm having a crappy day.
Everyone thinks I tried to kill myself, and there's a lame guy selling T-shirts keeping the stupid story alive.
I don't think you tried to kill yourself.
- Really?
- No.
You're not the type.
Well, unless you keep smoking.
And there's a guy...
Oh.
Mysterious.
I really like him, but he has a girlfriend.
Who is it?
I can't say.
Oh.
So I'd know him.
No comment.
Aw, come on.
Does this guy even know that you like him?
I'd say it's pretty clear.
I mean...
He's funny and he's cool, and everybody likes him, which is part of the problem.
But I feel like I see who he really is, and he gets me.
Yeah.
But we're not on the same level, and he can never be with a freak like me, so...
It's kinda hopeless.
Maybe you're misjudging the situation, and this guy really does like you...
Just the way you are.
Naptime's almost over.
Good day today!
I snuck by earlier and checked on your progress, and you were all busy working away.
As always, I appreciate your respect of the honor system.
You make my job a pleasure.
You're all dismissed.
Hey, mom, it's me.
Uh...
When your tan is dry, come pick me up.
Jenna.
I, um...
I just wanted to say I, uh...
Okay.
You know that guy that we were talking about?
Yes.
Um, I just want to throw in my two cents and say that I'm sure you're on his radar.
I mean, he'd be lucky-- well, I--I mean, anyone would be lucky to be with you.
Well, thank you for the pity party.
But I think I'll live.
The T-shirts say so.
No, um, seriously.
I'll bet you anything if this guy didn't have a girlfriend that he'd be all over you.
- Would he now?
- Yeah.
He would.
It was nice to hear.
If Jake could see me in a positive light, maybe other people could too.
Thank you.
Don't stop on account of me.
She's acting out.
We gave her too much rope.
She's never had detention before.
There have to be consequences.
Isn't detention a consequence?
She needs parental punishing too.
But nothing too harsh.
What do you think?
Should we send her to bed without dessert?
So that she wakes up skinnier?
No, that's not a punishment, that's a reward.
We can't let her think we're taking this lightly.
How do we do this?
We start by presenting a unified front.
Your behavior at school today was unacceptable.
Getting physical with someone is never the answer.
We're... disappointed in you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to flip out.
I was just trying to stand up for myself.
I mean, mom told me to take more risks.
You told her to take more risks?
In the context of what she was wearing.
What does that even mean?
I told her to wear a shirt without a bra.
Why would you tell her that?
Our daughter is 15!
She doesn't need to skip the bra!
It was a backless shirt!
Do you guys want me to come back in ten minutes?
15!
Everything that once was simple was now complicated.
Matty's best friend had kissed me.
And Matty didn't want me to be his girlfriend.
'Cause he already had one.
And no matter how much I wanted her to disappear, she wouldn't.
She was real and she had a name.
Olivia.
As expected, it was prettier than mine.
So how was juvie?
Nothing like I thought it would be.
That's pretty much the theme of the day.
Brace yourself, J.
I CSI'd your barnacle.
Check out his page.
You're not the object of his affection.
See, his hand is on miss Burndahl's knee.
Um, hurl.
He is an office aid.
I am such a jerk.
Kyle's not a stalker, Jenna plus is nice.
What'next?
So you attacked an innocent office aid.
We're all spun out on the crazy car.
It happens to the best of us.
I mean, I shame-spiral, like, weekly.
No bigs.
Call me if you want to ugly-cry.
Turns out I had been smoking the emotional crack pipe and I needed to take a drastic 12 steps back to recovery.
I had already acknowledged I had a problem.
So I decided to skip the middle steps and go straight to number nine-- making amends.
I'm not wearing the shirt!
I know!
I'm sorry!
Listen, I made a huge mistake calling you out in front of everyone.
You're surprisingly strong.
I feel really bad about all of this, and I'd like to make it up to you.
Can I buy a shirt to support your band?
You can just have it.
No, let me pay for it, I insist.
This whole thing is just ridiculous.
I mean, I just kept seeing you everywhere.
And I thought you were a... creeper.
Turns out, I am.
Okay.
We cool?
Yeah.
You should hear my band play sometime.
We kill it.
Yeah, I'd love to.
♪ ♪
Come sit with me!
Cool specs.
They're not real or anything.
I like to wear them so that people take me seriously.
Funny, even Jenna plus was concerned with how people perceived her.
I didn't know you two knew each other.
Busted.
We're detention buddies.
I need ranch.
You don't seem like the type that would be in detention.
Maybe you don't know what type I am.
So, um...
How do you guys know each other?
Who, Liv?
She's kinda my girlfriend.
In-law.
She and my brother have been off and on for a while.
I don't really know what's going on.
Weird.
So you two kinda look alike.
Yeah.
Nah, she's way prettier than me.
It was our first lunch together.
And I realized it wasn't my stigma or another girl keeping me from Matty.
It was how I saw myself.
Next on Awkward.
You know this is a charity league.
Not a charity, right?
We are gonna rock the knick knackers.
We are!
You have to be cruel to be kind.
Sadie wrote the letter!
Do you think Matty knows Jake kissed me?
No way.
Guys don't talk.
- I kissed Jenna Hamilton.
- What?
- I'M NOT GONNA HOOK UP WITH MATTY AGAIN UNTIL WE DTR.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- "DEFINE THE RELATIONSHIP."
- THANKS AGAIN FOR DITCHING OUT OF THE PARTY WITH ME.
IT WAS THE BEST PART OF THE NIGHT.
JENNA, I LIKE YOU.
I'M JUST NOT SURE I'M READY
TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP.
- IN HIGH SCHOOL, PERCEPTION'S EVERYTHING.
AND BEING DROPPED OFF BY A PARENT
IS LIKE OWNING A ROLLING BACKPACK
OR KISSING YOUR GRANDPARENT ON THE MOUTH.
UNSAVORY.
IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE EVERYONE WAS PLAYING THE ROLE
OF JUDGE AND JURY,
THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE WAS TO ASSERT
SOME KIND OF INDEPENDENCE.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT--
I'M GETTING OUT.
- YOU NEED TO BLEND, AND THEN CHANGE THAT SHIRT.
PEOPLE ARE GONNA THINK THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD NICE THINGS.
HERE.
AND IT'S BACKLESS,
SO YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WEAR A BRA.
- NICE.
THAT'LL BE INTERESTING IN GYM
WHEN I HAVE TO RUN THE MILE.
- JENNA, IT WOULD NOT KILL YOU TO TAKE A RISK.
BE BOLD ONCE IN A WHILE.
- MY MOTHER'S PERCEPTION OF BEING BOLD
WAS FREE-BOOBIN'.
I'D HAD ENOUGH.
- IF YOU'RE NOT INTO THE SHIRT,
AT LEAST TAKE THESE SO YOU LOOK HIP.
THEY'RE FAKE.
AND THEY'LL HELP YOU HIDE YOUR BIG UNIBROW.
- I WANTED AN EXCUSE TO WALK IN TOGETHER.
BUT WHAT I REALLY NEEDED WAS AN EXCUSE TO TALK.
MATTY SAID HE WASN'T READY TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANYONE.
- * DON'T STOP THE MUSIC NOW COME ON *
*
* OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH *
- BUT MAYBE HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ME.
AND WHY WOULD HE?
I WAS THE SUICIDE GIRL.
[computer keyboard tapping] [gunshot] [coach's whistle blowing]
SO THE FRONT SAID "JENNA LIVES,"
AND THE BACK SAID "IN TRIBUTE."
THAT'S CLEARLY ABOUT ME, RIGHT?
- AS CLEAR AS THE COLD SORE ON VERA HERBERT'S FACE.
I'D SAY IT'S OOZINGLY OBVI.
- I MEAN, CRAP TO THE [bleep] PILE,
I SAW A GIRL GET OUT OF MATTY'S TRUCK.
I MEAN, I THINK HE'S HOOKING UP WITH SOMEONE ELSE.
- YOU'RE LIKE A DAYTIME TALK SHOW.
- EXCEPT NOBODY'S PREGNANT...
YET.
- ALL THIS HAPPENED BEFORE THE BELL EVEN RANG.
WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE ALL THIS EFFED-UP KARMA?
OKAY, ACT TOTALLY NORMAL AND DON'T LOOK NOW,
BUT UP ON THE RIGHT, SHE'S THE ONE IN THE BLEACHERS.
- THE WHORE!
- YES, BUT DON'T STARE!
- NOT LOOKING.
- NO IDEA WHO SHE IS.
AH, CRAMP.
- ME EITHER.
I THINK SHE'S A JUNIOR.
AND SHE KINDA LOOKS LIKE YOU.
- YEAH, BUT PRETTIER.
AND COOLER.
WITH BIGGER BOOBS.
SHE'S JENNA PLUS.
- NO WAY.
SHE'S JENNA MINUS!
YOU DON'T TASTE LIKE ASHTRAY, AND YOU PUT OUT.
- SHE PROBABLY PUTS OUT TOO.
- BUT SHE'S OLDER, SO THE SEX IS SUPER DIRTY.
WHAT?
I DON'T MEAN HOT DIRTY, I MEAN GROSS DIRTY.
YOU KNOW, LIKE AMATEUR PORN.
- THERE'S THAT GUY WITH THE SHIRT.
NO WONDER MATTY WANTS TO KEEP HIS OPTIONS OPEN.
IT'S HARD TO BE SEEN AS GIRLFRIEND MATERIAL
WITH A LURKER AROUND.
- YOUR SUICIDE STIGMA IS LIKE THE HERPS.
JUST WHEN YOU THINK IT'S GONE, IT COMES BACK.
- SO HE GAVE SOMEONE A RIDE IN HIS TRUCK.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
YOU'RE GETTING ALL WORKED UP OVER A JAGGOFF.
THE GIRL'S JUST SOME...
CHICK.
- YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M PROBABLY JUST OVERREACTING.
- IT'S A FRIENDLY HUG.
LIKE THIS.
SEE, TOTES FRIENDLY.
THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON WITH THIS.
NOTHING BELOW THE NECK.
PLATONIC.
- HEY.
YEAH!
- YOU WISH, CRETIN!
- IT'S NOT A FRIENDLY HUG, IS IT?
- SURRENDER YOUR PAIN TO THE SUGAR.
- I'M FINE.
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S CHEATING ON ME.
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.
HE CAN GET HPV FROM WHOEVER HE WANTS.
- SEE YOU LATER.
- I COULDN'T CONTROL JENNA PLUS
FROM SPREADING HER DISEASE,
BUT I COULD STOP KYLE FROM SPREADING HIS.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT SHIRT OFF.
- NO.
- YES.
YOU'RE GLORIFYING THE SUICIDE
I DIDN'T EVEN COMMIT.
- "JENNA LIVES" IS MY BAND.
- REALLY?
YOU HAVE A BAND?
WHAT KIND OF MUSIC DO YOU PLAY?
- IT'S NOT YOUR STYLE.
- OH, AND YOU KNOW THIS
BECAUSE YOU'RE CLEARLY OBSESSED WITH ME,
SO GO CHANGE YOUR SHIRT!
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
PLUS, I KNOW, LIKE, A HUNDRED JENNAS.
- IT SAYS "IN TRIBUTE."
- IT'S A TRIBUTE BAND.
- MAYBE IT WAS ALL IN MY HEAD.
I WANTED TO BELIEVE HIM.
BUT EVERYWHERE I WENT...
HE WAS THERE!
WOULD YOU STOP FOLLOWING ME!
- YOU'RE IN THE BOYS' BATHROOM.
- HEY.
[toilet flushes]
- I HAVE A STALKER.
IT'S THIS GUY NAMED KYLE, AND HE'S FOLLOWING ME AROUND
MAKING LIGHT OF A VERY SENSITIVE SITUATION
WITH A VERY INSENSITIVE T-SHIRT.
I NEED YOU TO MAKE HIM STOP.
I MEAN,
ISN'T THAT, LIKE, A RIGHTS INFRINGEMENT OR SOMETHING?
- ARE YOU SURE YOU AREN'T BEING
A LITTLE BIT PARANOID?
- NO!
I SEE HIM EVERYWHERE.
I MEAN, THE SHIRT IS PRETTY BLATANT.
- MAYBE KYLE DESIGNED THAT SHIRT AS A FAN.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE WANTS TO BE YOUR DAWG.
- MY WHAT?
- I KNOW A LITTLE GIRL
WITH A NAME THAT RHYMES WITH DALERIE,
AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS GROWING UP.
AND IT WAS VERY PAINFUL.
- OKAY, ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THIS IS HIS WAY
OF TRYING TO BE MY FRIEND?
- IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.
- REALLY?
'CAUSE TO ME IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
HE'D RATHER CUT OFF A PIECE OF MY HAIR
AND WEAR IT IN A LOCKET AROUND HIS NECK.
- I THINK THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW
IS GO TO A CRAZY PLACE.
- OKAY, I'M TIRED OF BEING SEEN
AS THE GIRL WHO TRIED TO KILL HERSELF.
I DIDN'T.
KYLE'S SHIRT ONLY REMINDS PEOPLE
THAT I'M STILL THAT GIRL.
AND THEN THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN WITH ME,
AND THEN THEY DON'T WANT TO DATE ME.
AND HIS STUPID T-SHIRT IS KEEPING ME FROM MOVING ON,
NOT TO MENTION, IT IS IN REALLY BAD TASTE.
- OH, SWEETIE...
I THOUGHT IT WAS A FAN SHIRT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL TAKE IT OFF.
I'LL TAKE IT OFF.
I DON'T NEED IT.
I DON'T CARE.
I'LL JUST TAKE IT OFF.
NEVER HAPPENED.
OKAY...
WHERE WERE WE?
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.
- THANKS FOR SAVING ME SOME TOTS, KEL.
WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT YOU?
- McKIBBS, NICE HAT TRICK YESTERDAY, MAN.
- OH, THANKS, DUDE.
- OH, HEY.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.
I'M SO HUNGRY.
YOU HUNGRY?
- STARVED.
- I COULD EAT, LIKE, FOUR SANDWICHES OR SOMETHING.
MAYBE SOME SOUP.
MMM.
- WELL, I THINK THEY HAVE CHICKEN TORTILLA.
- SO LISTEN, I KNOW WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT,
BUT YOU KNOW I DIDN'T TRY TO KILL MYSELF, RIGHT?
MISUNDERSTANDING.
- OKAY.
UH...
JELL-O?
- MMM.
HELLO.
UH...
YOUR MOUTH IS SAYING OKAY, BUT YOUR EYES ARE SAYING,
"SAVE ME FROM THIS LUNATIC."
WHICH I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I'M RAMBLING
AND SOUNDING LIKE A WHACK JOB.
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW, I WAS HAVING A BAD DAY,
AND I SLIPPED-- I HAD AN ACCIDENT.
NORMAL PEOPLE HAVE ACCIDENTS.
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I HAD BECAUSE I'M PERFECTLY NORMAL.
[forced laugh]
OH, WHAT WAS I SAYING?
- YOU'RE-- YOU'RE TOTALLY NORMAL.
- YES.
- I GOT IT.
I'LL SEE YA.
- OKAY.
MATTY DITCHED ME TO BRING THAT CHICK A SANDWICH?
I FOOLED AROUND WITH THE GUY AT LEAST EIGHT TIMES,
AND HE NEVER BOUGHT ME A SANDWICH.
HE JUST BOUGHT HER A SANDWICH.
WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THEM.
- WHO?
- YOUR FACE IS ALL RED, AND YOU HAVE CRAZY EYES.
DID YOU FEED THE RABID SQUIRRELS IN THE QUAD?
- LISTEN, THOSE SHIRTS ARE SPREADING,
AND I KNOW MATTY'S SEEN THEM.
DID YOU SEE THOSE PEOPLE WEARING THEM?
I JUST NEED TO FIND OUT IF THEY'RE TOGETHER.
- YOU'RE GOING TO A DARK PLACE, J.
STAY WITH US.
- I JUST NEED CONCRETE PROOF THAT THEY'RE DATING.
I KNEW IT.
YOU'RE TOTALLY CASHING IN ON MY FAUX SUICIDE ATTEMPT.
THAT IS ILLEGAL.
I COULD HAVE YOU ARRESTED!
YOU'RE STALKING ME.
ADMIT IT.
I SAW YOU AT LEAST FIVE TIMES LAST PERIOD.
- I'M AN OFFICE AID.
- MM. YEAH?
TAKE THE DAMN SHIRT OFF--NOW.
YOU ARE RUINING MY LIFE.
- THOSE ARE MINE.
- TAKE IT OFF.
- NO.
- TAKE IT...
OFF.
- NO.
- FINE.
I WILL.
JUST STOP IT, OKAY?
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE WRONG IDEA.
THEY THINK I'M CRAZY, OKAY?
JUST STOP IT!
STOP STALKING ME, STOP WITH THESE STUPID T-SHIRTS!
JUST STOP IT!
JUST STOP IT!
JUST STOP IT!
STOP IT!
- YOU'RE CRAZY.
- DOES THIS REALLY WARRANT DETENTION?
- IF YOU WERE 18,
IT COULD WARRANT SOME TIME IN THE SLAMMER.
SORRY I COULDN'T GIVE YOU SPECIAL TREATMENT.
I MEAN, I COULD HAVE,
BUT THERE WERE SO MANY WITNESSES.
- I SEE SOME NEW FACES...
MIXED IN WITH THE OLD.
TO THE ROOKIES--
WE'RE ON THE HONOR SYSTEM HERE.
NOW, I'LL BE BACK TO CHECK ON YOU,
BUT YOU WON'T KNOW WHEN.
SO YOU BEST BE ON YOUR BEST.
LIKE BUSY LITTLE WORKER BEES--
ZZZ--
YOU WILL BE WORKING ON YOUR HOMEWORK HONEY POT,
AND I WILL BE IN MY OFFICE
ATTENDING TO MY PILES
AND PILES OF WORK.
SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE I HAVE DETENTION TOO.
- WE HAVE EXACTLY TWO HOURS.
STARTING NOW.
[snaps]
- TWO HOURS FOR, UH, FOR WHAT?
- VALERIE'S NAP.
WE'RE HEADING TO GIUSEPPE'S.
- GUESS JENNA PLUS WAS A REGULAR IN DETENTION.
AND THE LEADER AMONG THE REBEL HERD.
MAYBE MATTY THOUGHT BEING BAD...
WAS GOOD.
COME ON, NEWBIE.
FROM THE SMALL BIRD TATTOO ON HER ANKLE
TO THE SIMPLE CARMEX SHE WORE INSTEAD OF LIP GLOSS,
EVERYTHING ABOUT JENNA PLUS WAS COOL.
BITCH.
- SO WHAT ARE YOU IN DETENTION FOR, WONDER BOY?
- I WAS CAUGHT HOLDING THE HOSE AT THE BONFIRE.
- KINKY.
- [laughs] YEAH.
- AND YOUR CRIME, HAMILTON?
- OH, JUST A LITTLE... [ahem] MISUNDERSTANDING.
AT LUNCH.
WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR?
- I'M A DETENTION REWARDS CARD MEMBER.
TODAY I BLEW OFF HISTORY
'CAUSE I WAS ON THE PHONE HAVING A MELTDOWN WITH THIS GUY.
- WAS SHE TALKING ABOUT MATTY,
OR WAS I HAVING A PARANOIA STROKE?
[cell phone tune]
- SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.
WHAT?
NO!
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?
- CAN I BUM A SMOKE?
- SURE.
- I WONDERED IF MATTY LIKED SMOKERS.
AND IF SO, COULD I FAKE A PRO?
- OKAY, THEN WHY DON'T YOU TAKE YOUR SWEET ASS TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT AND CALL ME BACK?
- [coughs]
EVERYTHING OKAY?
- YEAH.
IT'S JUST MY EX.
WE'VE BEEN ON A BREAK,
AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF MAYBE GETTING BACK TOGETHER.
- DID THAT MEAN I WAS MATTY'S REBOUND?
BREAKS ARE HARD.
SOMEONE ALWAYS HOOKS UP WITH ANOTHER PERSON,
MAYBE EVEN FALLS FOR THEM.
THINK HE'S INTO SOMEONE ELSE?
- I THOUGHT SO.
BUT NOW I'M NOT SO SURE.
WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER, IT'S...
IT'S AMAZING.
IT'S LIKE...
THE WORLD FALLS AWAY...
THEN THE NEXT DAY,
HE'S INDIFFERENT, HE DOESN'T CALL ME.
HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO BE SEEN WITH ME.
SO STARTED TO WONDER
IF MAYBE I'M IMAGINING ALL THE GOOD STUFF.
- JENNA PLUS AND I MIGHT HAVE BEEN FROM DIFFERENT PLANETS,
BUT HER MATTY HEARTBREAK WAS THE SAME.
[cell phone tune]
THERE IT WAS.
THE ANSWER I WAS CHASING.
I COULDN'T LIVE IN THE SAFETY OF DENIAL ANYMORE.
SHE WAS WITH MATTY.
HE WAS WITH HER.
AND I WAS WITH CANCER.
- I'M GONNA LET HIM SWEAT IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
THANKS FOR LISTENING.
ARE YOU OKAY?
WHATEVER THE MISUNDERSTANDING WAS TODAY,
IT'LL BLOW OVER.
NOTHING'S EVER AS BAD AS IT SEEMS.
HERE.
TAKE MY LAST SMOKE.
I'M GONNA GRAB ANOTHER PACK.
- AS MUCH AS I WANTED TO HATE ON JENNA PLUS,
I COULDN'T.
THE BITCH WAS DECENT.
MAYBE EVEN SWEET.
AND IT MADE ME REALLY WANT TO KILL MYSELF.
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A SMOKER.
- I'M NOT.
- WELL, I HEAR LUNG CANCER DOES MAKE YOUR ASS LOOK HUGE.
- WELL, I'M HAVING A CRAPPY DAY.
EVERYONE THINKS I TRIED TO KILL MYSELF,
AND THERE'S A LAME GUY SELLING T-SHIRTS
KEEPING THE STUPID STORY ALIVE.
- I DON'T THINK YOU TRIED TO KILL YOURSELF.
- REALLY?
- NO.
YOU'RE NOT THE TYPE.
WELL, UNLESS YOU KEEP SMOKING.
- AND THERE'S A GUY...
- OH.
MYSTERIOUS.
- I REALLY LIKE HIM, BUT HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND.
- WHO IS IT?
- I CAN'T SAY.
- OH.
SO I'D KNOW HIM.
- NO COMMENT.
- AW, COME ON.
DOES THIS GUY EVEN KNOW THAT YOU LIKE HIM?
- I'D SAY IT'S PRETTY CLEAR.
I MEAN...
HE'S FUNNY AND HE'S COOL,
AND EVERYBODY LIKES HIM,
WHICH IS PART OF THE PROBLEM.
BUT I FEEL LIKE I SEE WHO HE REALLY IS,
AND HE GETS ME.
- YEAH.
- BUT WE'RE NOT ON THE SAME LEVEL,
AND HE CAN NEVER BE WITH A FREAK LIKE ME, SO...
IT'S KINDA HOPELESS.
- MAYBE YOU'RE MISJUDGING THE SITUATION,
AND THIS GUY REALLY DOES LIKE YOU...
JUST THE WAY YOU ARE.
- NAPTIME'S ALMOST OVER.
[door slams]
- GOOD DAY TODAY!
I SNUCK BY EARLIER
AND CHECKED ON YOUR PROGRESS,
AND YOU WERE ALL BUSY WORKING AWAY.
AS ALWAYS, I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPECT
OF THE HONOR SYSTEM.
YOU MAKE MY JOB A PLEASURE.
YOU'RE ALL DISMISSED.
- HEY, MOM, IT'S ME.
UH...
WHEN YOUR TAN IS DRY, COME PICK ME UP.
- JENNA.
I, UM...
I JUST WANTED TO SAY I, UH...
OKAY.
YOU KNOW THAT GUY THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT?
- YES.
- UM, I JUST WANT TO THROW IN MY TWO CENTS
AND SAY THAT I'M SURE YOU'RE ON HIS RADAR.
I MEAN, HE'D BE LUCKY--
WELL, I--I MEAN, ANYONE WOULD BE LUCKY TO BE WITH YOU.
- WELL, THANK YOU FOR THE PITY PARTY.
BUT I THINK I'LL LIVE.
THE T-SHIRTS SAY SO.
- [chuckles]
NO, UM, SERIOUSLY.
I'LL BET YOU ANYTHING IF THIS GUY DIDN'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND
THAT HE'D BE ALL OVER YOU.
- WOULD HE NOW?
- YEAH.
HE WOULD.
- IT WAS NICE TO HEAR.
IF JAKE COULD SEE ME IN A POSITIVE LIGHT,
MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE COULD TOO.
THANK YOU.
- DON'T STOP ON ACCOUNT OF ME.
- SHE'S ACTING OUT.
WE GAVE HER TOO MUCH ROPE.
SHE'S NEVER HAD DETENTION BEFORE.
THERE HAVE TO BE CONSEQUENCES.
- ISN'T DETENTION A CONSEQUENCE?
- SHE NEEDS PARENTAL PUNISHING TOO.
BUT NOTHING TOO HARSH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
SHOULD WE SEND HER TO BED WITHOUT DESSERT?
- SO THAT SHE WAKES UP SKINNIER?
NO, THAT'S NOT A PUNISHMENT, THAT'S A REWARD.
- WE CAN'T LET HER THINK WE'RE TAKING THIS LIGHTLY.
- HOW DO WE DO THIS?
- WE START BY PRESENTING A UNIFIED FRONT.
- YOUR BEHAVIOR AT SCHOOL TODAY WAS UNACCEPTABLE.
GETTING PHYSICAL WITH SOMEONE IS NEVER THE ANSWER.
WE'RE...
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.
- I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO FLIP OUT.
I WAS JUST TRYING TO STAND UP FOR MYSELF.
I MEAN, MOM TOLD ME TO TAKE MORE RISKS.
- YOU TOLD HER TO TAKE MORE RISKS?
- IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT SHE WAS WEARING.
- WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?
- I TOLD HER TO WEAR A SHIRT WITHOUT A BRA.
- WHY WOULD YOU TELL HER THAT?
OUR DAUGHTER IS 15!
SHE DOESN'T NEED TO SKIP THE BRA!
- IT WAS A BACKLESS SHIRT!
- DO YOU GUYS WANT ME TO COME BACK IN TEN MINUTES?
both: 15!
- EVERYTHING THAT ONCE WAS SIMPLE WAS NOW COMPLICATED.
MATTY'S BEST FRIEND HAD KISSED ME.
AND MATTY DIDN'T WANT ME TO BE HIS GIRLFRIEND.
'CAUSE HE ALREADY HAD ONE.
AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WANTED HER TO DISAPPEAR,
SHE WOULDN'T.
SHE WAS REAL AND SHE HAD A NAME.
OLIVIA.
AS EXPECTED, IT WAS PRETTIER THAN MINE.
[cell phone tune]
HEY.
- SO HOW WAS JUVIE?
- NOTHING LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.
- THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE THEME OF THE DAY.
BRACE YOURSELF, J.
I CSI'D YOUR BARNACLE.
CHECK OUT HIS PAGE.
YOU'RE NOT THE OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTION.
SEE, HIS HAND IS ON MISS BURNDAHL'S KNEE.
UM, HURL.
- [sighs]
HE IS AN OFFICE AID.
I AM SUCH A JERK.
KYLE'S NOT A STALKER, JENNA PLUS IS NICE.
WHAT'S NEXT?
- SO YOU ATTACKED AN INNOCENT OFFICE AID.
WE'RE ALL SPUN OUT ON THE CRAZY CAR.
IT HAPPENS TO THE BEST OF US.
I MEAN, I SHAME-SPIRAL, LIKE, WEEKLY.
NO BIGS.
CALL ME IF YOU WANT TO UGLY-CRY.
- [sighs]
TURNS OUT I HAD BEEN SMOKING THE EMOTIONAL CRACK PIPE
AND I NEEDED TO TAKE A DRASTIC 12 STEPS BACK TO RECOVERY.
I HAD ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED I HAD A PROBLEM.
SO I DECIDED TO SKIP THE MIDDLE STEPS
AND GO STRAIGHT TO NUMBER NINE--
MAKING AMENDS.
- I'M NOT WEARING THE SHIRT!
- I KNOW!
I'M SORRY!
LISTEN, I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE
CALLING YOU OUT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.
- YOU'RE SURPRISINGLY STRONG.
- I FEEL REALLY BAD ABOUT ALL OF THIS,
AND I'D LIKE TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
CAN I BUY A SHIRT TO SUPPORT YOUR BAND?
- YOU CAN JUST HAVE IT.
- NO, LET ME PAY FOR IT, I INSIST.
THIS WHOLE THING IS JUST RIDICULOUS.
I MEAN, I JUST KEPT SEEING YOU EVERYWHERE.
AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE A...
CREEPER.
TURNS OUT, I AM.
- OKAY.
- WE COOL?
- YEAH.
HEY!
YOU SHOULD HEAR MY BAND PLAY SOMETIME.
WE KILL IT.
- YEAH, I'D LOVE TO.
[hinges squeak] [comically ominous music]
*
- COME SIT WITH ME!
- COOL SPECS.
- THEY'RE NOT REAL OR ANYTHING.
I LIKE TO WEAR THEM SO THAT PEOPLE TAKE ME SERIOUSLY.
- FUNNY, EVEN JENNA PLUS WAS CONCERNED
WITH HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVED HER.
- HEY!
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU TWO KNEW EACH OTHER.
- BUSTED.
- WE'RE DETENTION BUDDIES.
I NEED RANCH.
- YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE THE TYPE THAT WOULD BE IN DETENTION.
- MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TYPE I AM.
SO, UM...
HOW DO YOU GUYS KNOW EACH OTHER?
- WHO, LIV?
SHE'S KINDA MY GIRLFRIEND.
IN-LAW.
SHE AND MY BROTHER HAVE BEEN OFF AND ON FOR A WHILE.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
HEY.
WEIRD.
SO YOU TWO KINDA LOOK ALIKE.
- [laughs]
- YEAH.
- NAH, SHE'S WAY PRETTIER THAN ME.
- IT WAS OUR FIRST LUNCH TOGETHER.
AND I REALIZED IT WASN'T MY STIGMA OR ANOTHER GIRL
KEEPING ME FROM MATTY.
IT WAS HOW I SAW MYSELF.
Previously on Awkward...
I'm not gonna hook up with Matty again until we DTR.
- What are you talking about?
- Define the relationship.
Thanks again for ditching out of the party with me.
It was the best part of the night.
Jenna, I like you.
I'm just not sure I'm ready to be in a relationship.
In high school, perception's everything.
And being dropped off by a parent is like owning a rolling backpack or kissing your grandparent on the mouth.
Unsavory.
In an environment where everyone was playing the role of judge and jury, the only way to survive was to assert some kind of independence.
All right, all right, all right.
I'm getting out.
You need to blend, and then change that shirt.
People are gonna think that we can't afford nice things.
Here.
And it's backless, so you don't even have to wear a bra.
Nice.
That'll be interesting in gym when I have to run the mile.
Jenna, it would not kill you to take a risk.
Be bold once in a while.
My mother's perception of being bold was free-boobin'.
I'd had enough.
If you're not into the shirt, at least take these so you look hip.
They're fake.
And they'll help you hide your big unibrow.
I wanted an excuse to walk in together.
But what I really needed was an excuse to talk.
Matty said he wasn't ready to be in a relationship with anyone.
But maybe he just didn't want to be in a relationship with me.
And why would he?
I was the suicide girl.
[Computer keyboard tapping]
[Gunshot]
[Coach's whistle blowing]
So the front said "Jenna lives,"
and the back said "in tribute."
That's clearly about me, right?
As clear as the cold sore on vera Herbert's face.
I'd say it's oozingly obvi.
I mean, crap to the **** pile,
I saw a girl get out of Matty's truck.
I mean, I think he's hooking up with someone else.
You're like a daytime talk show.
Except nobody's pregnant... yet.
All this happened before the bell even rang.
What did I do to deserve all this effed-up karma?
Okay, act totally normal and don't look now, but up on the right, she's the one in the bleachers.
- The whore!
- Yes, but don't stare!
- Not looking.
- No idea who she is.
- Ah, cramp.
- Me either.
I think she's a junior.
And she kinda looks like you.
Yeah, but prettier.
And cooler.
With bigger boobs.
She's Jenna plus.
No way.
She's Jenna minus!
You don't taste like ashtray, and you put out.
She probably puts out too.
But she's older, so the sex is super dirty.
What?
I don't mean hot dirty, I mean gross dirty.
You know, like amateur porn.
There's that guy with the shirt.
No wonder Matty wants to keep his options open.
It's hard to be seen as girlfriend material with a lurker around.
Your suicide stigma is like the herps.
Just when you think it's gone, it comes back.
So he gave someone a ride in his truck.
What's the big deal?
You're getting all worked up over a jaggoff.
The girl's just some...
Chick.
You're right, I'm probably just overreacting.
It's a friendly hug.
Like this.
See, totes friendly.
There's nothing going on with this.
Nothing below the neck.
Platonic.
Hey.
Yeah!
You wish, cretin!
It's not a friendly hug, is it?
Surrender your pain to the sugar.
I'm fine.
It's not like he's cheating on me.
We're not together.
He can get HPV from whoever he wants.
See you later.
I couldn't control Jenna plus from spreading her disease, but I could stop Kyle from spreading his.
You have to take that shirt off.
No.
Yes.
You're glorifying the suicide
I didn't even commit.
- "Jenna lives" is my band.
- Really?
You have a band?
What kind of music do you play?
- It's not your style.
- Oh, and you know this because you're clearly obsessed with me, so go change your shirt!
I don't even know you.
Plus, I know, like, a hundred Jennas.
It says "in tribute."
It's a tribute band.
Maybe it was all in my head.
I wanted to believe him.
But everywhere I went...
He was there!
Would you stop following me!
You're in the boys' bathroom.
Hey.
[Toilet flushes]
I have a stalker.
It's this guy named Kyle, and he's following me around making light of a very sensitive situation with a very insensitive T-shirt.
I need you to make him stop.
I mean, isn't that, like, a rights infringement or something?
Are you sure you aren't being
- a little bit paranoid?
- No!
I see him everywhere.
I mean, the shirt is pretty blatant.
Maybe Kyle designed that shirt as a fan.
You know, maybe he wants to be your dawg.
My what?
I know a little girl with a name that rhymes with Dalerie, and she didn't have any friends growing up.
And it was very painful.
Okay, are you suggesting that this is his way of trying to be my friend?
It's certainly possible.
Really?
'Cause to me it just seems like he'd rather cut off a piece of my hair and wear it in a locket around his neck.
I think the worst thing you can do right now is go to a crazy place.
Okay, I'm tired of being seen as the girl who tried to kill herself.
I didn't.
Kyle's shirt only reminds people that I'm still that girl.
And then they don't want to be seen with me, and then they don't want to date me.
And his stupid T-shirt is keeping me from moving on, not to mention, it is in really bad taste.
Oh, sweetie...
I thought it was a fan shirt.
You know what, I'll take it off.
I'll take it off.
I don't need it.
I don't care.
I'll just take it off.
Never happened.
Okay...
Where were we?
Oh, I don't know.
Thanks for saving me some tots, Kel.
What would I do without you?
McKibbs, nice hat trick yesterday, man.
Oh, thanks, dude.
Oh, hey.
I didn't see you there.
I'm so hungry.
- You hungry?
- Starved.
I could eat, like, four sandwiches or something.
Maybe some soup.
Mmm.
Well, I think they have chicken tortilla.
So listen, I know we never talked about it, but you know I didn't try to kill myself, right?
Misunderstanding.
Okay.
Uh...
Jell-o?
Mmm.
Hello.
Uh...
Your mouth is saying okay, but your eyes are saying,
"save me from this lunatic."
Which I totally understand because I'm rambling and sounding like a whack job.
But just so you know, I was having a bad day, and I slipped-
- I had an accident.
Normal people have accidents.
And that's exactly what I had because I'm perfectly normal.
[Forced laugh]
Oh, what was I saying?
You're-- you're totally normal.
- Yes.
- I got it.
- I'll see ya.
- Okay.
Matty ditched me to bring that chick a sandwich?
I fooled around with the guy at least eight times, and he never bought me a sandwich.
He just bought her a sandwich.
We have to follow them.
Who?
Your face is all red, and you have crazy eyes.
Did you feed the rabid squirrels in the quad?
Listen, those shirts are spreading, and I know Matty's seen them.
Did you see those people wearing them?
I just need to find out if they're together.
You're going to a dark place, J.
Stay with us.
I just need concrete proof that they're dating.
I knew it.
You're totally cashing in on my faux suicide attempt.
That is illegal.
I could have you arrested!
You're stalking me.
Admit it.
I saw you at least five times last period.
I'm an office aid.
Mm.
Yeah?
Take the damn shirt off--now.
You are ruining my life.
Those are mine.
- Take it off.
- No.
Take it... off.
- No.
- Fine.
I will.
Just stop it, okay?
People are getting the wrong idea.
They think I'm crazy, okay?
Just stop it!
Stop stalking me, stop with these stupid T-shirts!
Just stop it!
Just stop it!
Just stop it!
- Stop it!
- You're crazy.
Does this really warrant detention?
If you were 18, it could warrant some time in the slammer.
Sorry I couldn't give you special treatment.
I mean, I could have, but there were so many witnesses.
I see some new faces...
Mixed in with the old.
To the rookies-- we're on the honor system here.
Now, I'll be back to check on you, but you won't know when.
So you best be on your best.
Like busy little worker bees-- zzz-- you will be working on your homework honey pot, and I will be in my office attending to my piles and piles of work.
Sometimes it feels like I have detention too.
We have exactly two hours.
Starting now.
[Snaps]
Two hours for, uh, for what?
Valerie's nap.
We're heading to Giuseppe's.
Guess Jenna plus was a regular in detention.
And the leader among the rebel herd.
Maybe Matty thought being bad... was good.
Come on, newbie.
From the small bird tattoo on her ankle to the simple carmex she wore instead of lip gloss, everything about Jenna plus was cool.
Bitch.
So what are you in detention for, wonder boy?
I was caught holding the hose at the bonfire.
- Kinky.
- [Laughs] Yeah.
And your crime, Hamilton?
Oh, just a little...
[Ahem] Misunderstanding.
At lunch.
What are you in for?
I'm a detention rewards card member.
Today I blew off history 'cause I was on the phone having a meltdown with this guy.
Was she talking about Matty, or was I having a paranoia stroke?
[Cell phone tune]
Speak of the devil.
What?
No!
What does that even mean?
Can I bum a smoke?
Sure.
I wondered if Matty liked smokers.
And if so, could I fake a pro?
Okay, then why don't you take your sweet ass time to think about it and call me back?
[Coughs]
Everything okay?
Yeah.
It's just my ex.
We've been on a break, and we're in the process of maybe getting back together.
Did that mean I was Matty's rebound?
Breaks are hard.
Someone always hooks up with another person, maybe even falls for them.
Think he's into someone else?
I thought so.
But now I'm not so sure.
When we're together, it's...
It's amazing.
It's like...
The world falls away...
Then the next day, he's indifferent, he doesn't call me.
He doesn't even want to be seen with me.
So started to wonder if maybe I'm imagining all the good stuff.
Jenna plus and I might have been from different planets, but her Matty heartbreak was the same.
[Cell phone tune]
There it was.
The answer I was chasing.
I couldn't live in the safety of denial anymore.
She was with Matty.
He was with her.
And I was with cancer.
I'm gonna let him sweat it for a little while.
Thanks for listening.
Are you okay?
Whatever the misunderstanding was today, it'll blow over.
Nothing's ever as bad as it seems.
Here.
Take my last smoke.
I'm gonna grab another pack.
As much as I wanted to hate on Jenna plus,
I couldn't.
The bitch was decent.
Maybe even sweet.
And it made me really want to kill myself.
I didn't know you were a smoker.
I'm not.
Well, I hear lung cancer does make your ass look huge.
Well, I'm having a crappy day.
Everyone thinks I tried to kill myself, and there's a lame guy selling T-shirts keeping the stupid story alive.
I don't think you tried to kill yourself.
- Really?
- No.
You're not the type.
Well, unless you keep smoking.
And there's a guy...
Oh.
Mysterious.
I really like him, but he has a girlfriend.
Who is it?
I can't say.
Oh.
So I'd know him.
No comment.
Aw, come on.
Does this guy even know that you like him?
I'd say it's pretty clear.
I mean...
He's funny and he's cool, and everybody likes him, which is part of the problem.
But I feel like I see who he really is, and he gets me.
Yeah.
But we're not on the same level, and he can never be with a freak like me, so...
It's kinda hopeless.
Maybe you're misjudging the situation, and this guy really does like you...
Just the way you are.
Naptime's almost over.
[Door slams]
Good day today!
I snuck by earlier and checked on your progress, and you were all busy working away.
As always, I appreciate your respect of the honor system.
You make my job a pleasure.
You're all dismissed.
Hey, mom, it's me.
Uh...
When your tan is dry, come pick me up.
Jenna.
I, um...
I just wanted to say I, uh...
Okay.
You know that guy that we were talking about?
Yes.
Um, I just want to throw in my two cents and say that I'm sure you're on his radar.
I mean, he'd be lucky-- well, I--I mean, anyone would be lucky to be with you.
Well, thank you for the pity party.
But I think I'll live.
The T-shirts say so.
[Chuckles]
No, um, seriously.
I'll bet you anything if this guy didn't have a girlfriend that he'd be all over you.
- Would he now?
- Yeah.
He would.
It was nice to hear.
If Jake could see me in a positive light, maybe other people could too.
Thank you.
Don't stop on account of me.
She's acting out.
We gave her too much rope.
She's never had detention before.
There have to be consequences.
Isn't detention a consequence?
She needs parental punishing too.
But nothing too harsh.
What do you think?
Should we send her to bed without dessert?
So that she wakes up skinnier?
No, that's not a punishment, that's a reward.
We can't let her think we're taking this lightly.
How do we do this?
We start by presenting a unified front.
Your behavior at school today was unacceptable.
Getting physical with someone is never the answer.
We're... disappointed in you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to flip out.
I was just trying to stand up for myself.
I mean, mom told me to take more risks.
You told her to take more risks?
In the context of what she was wearing.
What does that even mean?
I told her to wear a shirt without a bra.
Why would you tell her that?
Our daughter is 15!
She doesn't need to skip the bra!
It was a backless shirt!
Do you guys want me to come back in ten minutes?
Both: 15!
Everything that once was simple was now complicated.
Matty's best friend had kissed me.
And Matty didn't want me to be his girlfriend.
'Cause he already had one.
And no matter how much I wanted her to disappear, she wouldn't.
She was real and she had a name.
Olivia.
As expected, it was prettier than mine.
[Cell phone tune]
So how was juvie?
Nothing like I thought it would be.
That's pretty much the theme of the day.
Brace yourself, J.
I CSI'd your barnacle.
Check out his page.
You're not the object of his affection.
See, his hand is on miss Burndahl's knee.
Um, hurl.
[Sighs]
He is an office aid.
I am such a jerk.
Kyle's not a stalker, Jenna plus is nice.
What'next?
So you attacked an innocent office aid.
We're all spun out on the crazy car.
It happens to the best of us.
I mean, I shame-spiral, like, weekly.
No bigs.
Call me if you want to ugly-cry.
[Sighs]
Turns out I had been smoking the emotional crack pipe and I needed to take a drastic 12 steps back to recovery.
I had already acknowledged I had a problem.
So I decided to skip the middle steps and go straight to number nine-- making amends.
I'm not wearing the shirt!
I know!
I'm sorry!
Listen, I made a huge mistake calling you out in front of everyone.
You're surprisingly strong.
I feel really bad about all of this, and I'd like to make it up to you.
Can I buy a shirt to support your band?
You can just have it.
No, let me pay for it, I insist.
This whole thing is just ridiculous.
I mean, I just kept seeing you everywhere.
And I thought you were a... creeper.
Turns out, I am.
Okay.
We cool?
Yeah.
You should hear my band play sometime.
We kill it.
Yeah, I'd love to.
[Hinges squeak]
[Comically ominous music]
♪ ♪
Come sit with me!
Cool specs.
They're not real or anything.
I like to wear them so that people take me seriously.
Funny, even Jenna plus was concerned with how people perceived her.
I didn't know you two knew each other.
Busted.
We're detention buddies.
I need ranch.
You don't seem like the type that would be in detention.
Maybe you don't know what type I am.
So, um...
How do you guys know each other?
Who, Liv?
She's kinda my girlfriend.
In-law.
She and my brother have been off and on for a while.
I don't really know what's going on.
Weird.
So you two kinda look alike.
[Laughs]
Yeah.
Nah, she's way prettier than me.
It was our first lunch together.
And I realized it wasn't my stigma or another girl keeping me from Matty.
It was how I saw myself.
Next on Awkward.
You know this is a charity league.
Not a charity, right?
We are gonna rock the knick knackers.
We are!
You have to be cruel to be kind.
Both:
Sadie wrote the letter!
Do you think Matty knows Jake kissed me?
No way.
Guys don't talk.
- I kissed Jenna Hamilton.
- What?

My guess is Tau Kappa Theta, the Jewish fraternity.

- No, of course not.
I just think it was this video that provoked the fight
- at the interfaith rally.
- And you want us to defend...?
Jimal Mifsud.
Scholarship student in Science.
His family is in Jiddah, and he can't afford a lawyer.
Do you know his family?
No, I am purely an interested bystander here who wants to see justice done.
Purely?
There's a campus fistfight between a dozen Palestinian and Jewish youths, and the State's Attorney only charges one Palestinian?
Well, he doesn't have a record, so it should be a simple misdemeanor battery.
Court supervision, at most.
No, the new State's Attorney wants to appear tough on his first day.
It was deemed a hate crime.
Seven years.
Alicia, meet Wasim Al-Said, an old friend who until recently retained our competitor Young, Bachman and Meyers
- for his legal interest.
- To my eternal regret.
- Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
- Alicia's fine.
Your husband was very good to the Muslim community in his first term.
My fear is, that's changed.
Of course, Alicia can't influence her husband in any way, but she is still one of our best lawyers.
Well, that's all Jimal needs.
This is a good kid they're painting as a suicide bomber.
Bond hearing's today.
I'll be there.
Good, that's one piece of business.
What else might we handle that Young, Bachman and Meyers can't?
I know that Eli Gold is working with you these days?
I'm in need of some crisis management.
- What's the crisis?
- Where's the management?
Will you get, uh, Eli for us?
And ask Will to step in.
Will?
Sure.
He's late.
Overslept.
Must be from celebrating yesterday's victory.
- Must be.
- Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Hey, Mom, pick up...
Hello, dearest daughter.
You sound happy.
I am happy.
I have my daughter on the phone.
What more could I desire?
Look, I don't think I need a tutor.
Grace, we discussed this.
It's just a month.
- Yeah, but it was one report card.
- And it's one month.
Dad just thinks I need to apply myself.
Oh, I agree, and a tutor will help you do that.
Eli?
The meeting.
Mom, Nisa's parents want you to come over for dinner.
- You and Dad.
Both of you.
- Why?
Just to be nice.
I didn't tell them anything.
I haven't let anyone know you guys are separated.
Hey!
Okay, I'll talk to your father about it.
I-I've got to go.
So, who is this guy again?
Wasim Al-Said.
He's a commodities trader.
Wasim?
Diane's been trying to sign him for two years.
He has ten million in charitable assets to spend.
On what?
A campaign against anti-Muslim bigotry.
Mr. Al-Said, you do know that I'm not a PR specialist.
I handle lobbying and crisis management.
Do you watch the evening news, Eli?
Religiously.
Then you know there was a murder of a Jewish poli sci major at Chicago Polytech last night.
Unsolved, but the police are questioning Muslim students.
Ten minutes later, a riot broke out at the other end of campus at a rally intended to encourage interfaith dialogue, and only one Muslim was arrested.
Now I'm used to reading the tea leaves in this country, and the best way to manage a crisis is before it becomes one.
Isn't that true?
It is.
So, are you hiring me because I'm good or because I'm Jewish?
Because I imagine it might look quite good having a Jew campaign for Muslims.
Can't it be both?
- I don't like being used.
- Really?
Since when?
He knows Jewish money is going to Peter for his next campaign
- and he wants to buy influence.
- And...?
Don't you get so knowing on me.
What's up with you, anyway?
You seem different.
Where you going?
- Court.
- Why?
I'm a lawyer.
Okay, glad we cleared that up.
This is a hate crime, Your Honor, and we ask that bail be set at $100,000.
Have you ever been in a fistfight, Counselor?
Have I, Your Honor?
Uh, no.
Well, let me educate you.
It's chaos, chaos in there.
No one can tell who hits who.
Fists are flying, you get hit in the head.
The next thing you know, you're on the ground and somebody's jumping...
- Jimal, I'm sorry to be late.
I was...
- Jimal assaulted someone because he was Jewish.
That is not chaos, Your Honor.
And Jimal was hit because he's Palestinian, Your Honor.
Alicia Florrick, Your Honor.
20 students were fighting.
Only one was charged.
One Muslim.
- His religion had nothing to...
- It had everything to do with it.
All right, okay, your passion is preserved for the record.
Bond is set at $5,000.
And I do suggest that the State reconsider its charge.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Jimal, I was just put in on this.
You have a benefactor who asked me to step in.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I know, a lot of this is posturing by the prosecution to get you to accept a higher plea.
The good news is, the judge is on your side.
Now, do you want me to call your parents or anything?
No, no they wouldn't...
Look, I'm ashamed.
I understand.
Hopefully, we can handle this
- by admitting simple battery.
- But I didn't.
I wasn't even there.
He wasn't at the rally, Cary.
He was at the library.
Oh, my God, really?
That's terrible.
This isn't about Jimal, and this isn't about some stupid fistfight.
This is about that Jewish kid stabbed to death, and you can't find the killer so Jimal is the scapegoat.
We have an eyewitness who saw Jimal throw the first punch.
- That's what this is about.
- Is the eyewitness Caucasian?
Oh, wow, how quickly we slip the bonds of political correctness.
- Why not ask if he's Jewish?
- Cross-racial identification.
Caucasians have difficulty discerning unique characteristics.
Six months in County, one year probation.
No.
Then I'll see you in court.
Tell Peter there has to be a better way to firm up his campaign contributions.
Using everything we can, are we?
It's a new day.
We're running a clean office.
Let me say that again, because we're all prone to the same cynicism.
We... are running a clean office.
Clean, ethical, honest, but not weak.
I know our budgets have been slashed.
I know we're the underdog here.
But our strategy will be this:
no plea bargains.
That's right.
Defense attorneys will be expecting the opposite.
So for the next two months,
I want you to hold the line on every single plea.
After that, you won't have to work as hard.
You get your enemy flinching, you'll never have to hit him hard again.
Your first complaint will be about investigator hours.
That's why I've hired an outside contractor until we can budget full time.
I want you to meet Sophia Russo.
She's good, and she's cheap.
Thanks!
Relatively.
Mr. Florrick, I offered the defense six months on the college hate crime.
Should I walk it back?
What's the law say?
Three to seven years.
There's your answer.
The lawyer's Alicia, and she might come after your campaign contributions.
Really?
Yeah.
What do you want?
Follow the law.
You can't go wrong if you follow the law.
All right.
Geez, what a pit.
- Thank you.
- You're working on the, uh, the Jewish-Muslim thing, right?
Yeah, the hate crime.
Why?
What do you need?
Oh, it's not what I need.
What is this?
You used to work with Kalinda Sharma, didn't you?
Yeah.
If I were you, I'd slip it to her.
♪ ♪
So, kind of odd not seeing you around much.
Yeah, I've been busy.
Yeah.
And here I thought you didn't need me anymore.
What's that?
It's a peace offering.
Peter Florrick wants to run a clean office, so... this is me being clean.
You're welcome.
You can't make Chicagoans feel good about Islam with pathos.
You need to go positive.
Link the Arab Spring to the American Revolution.
Who is the Islamic George Washington?
Who is the Islamic Paul Revere?
Morning in the Middle East...
Do you need something?
It's on your desk.
It's self-explanatory.
That's your car?
Good.
Now, I know you said you were at the library.
But the time code on that traffic light shows that the driver of your car was running a red light just outside the campus gates at the exact moment of the interfaith rally.
That means that the driver of your car, if that is you, couldn't have been involved in the rally fight.
Do you understand?
I do.
So, I want you to take your time before you answer.
Is that you driving your car?
It is.
Are you certain, young man?
It's a very roundabout way to come from the library.
I'm sure.
We ask that Mr. Mifsud state under oath that he was the driver in this photo which we will mark as People's Exhibit #1.
Your Honor, is that really necessary?
It's the only way we'll drop the hate charge.
Very well.
Mr. Mifsud, you are under oath.
Do you swear that that's you in the photo?
Yes.
Good.
Well, I think that just about, uh, wraps it up, doesn't it, Mr. Agos?
I'm late for the gym.
It does, Your Honor, and the State has made a terrible mistake in charging Mr. Mifsud with this battery, But this car with this license plate was seen racing away from the scene
- of the frat murder of Simon Greenberg...
- Objection, Your Honor!
- That is why he ran the red light.
- Oh, this is outrageous.
- He had just killed Simon Greenberg.
- This is prosecutorial misconduct!
He swore to it.
His alibi means he committed this murder.
Because you overcharged him with a hate crime so he would grab at any alibi.
So you're saying your client perjured himself?
No, I am saying he took my advice, that's all.
Well, then congratulations, Alicia.
You just advised your client to admit to murder.
Your Honor, the People charge Jimal Mifsud with first-degree murder.
The Good Wife S03E01 "A New Day" Original Air Date September 25, 2011
Alicia dropped by for you.
Why?
I don't know.
You want me to get her?
No.
Later.
So this isn't you?
It's your car, but you're not driving it?
I'm sorry, I, uh, I thought it was the easiest way out.
So who is it?
Who's driving it?
I don't know.
Jimal, they have a witness who swears that that car-- your car-- was driven away by Simon Greenberg's killer.
So don't cover for anyone.
I'm not covering.
My-my two roommates don't have a car,
I let Amir and Tariq use mine.
I just leave my keys in the room.
So which is driving it, Amir or Tariq?
I don't know.
But he swore that was him driving away from the murder?
He didn't know it would implicate him in a murder.
It's my fault.
I encouraged him to place himself in the car to give him an alibi from the hate crime.
Yes.
And now I have a multimillion-dollar client thinking that we're amateurs.
I got the pictures from the ASA's office.
- I should've checked.
- Great.
It's everybody's fault.
Now let's make it right.
I'm questioning Jimal's roommates.
One of them is the real driver.
And I'm filing a motion to dismiss
Jimal's alibi statement during preliminary.
I don't know what's going on with you two, but make it better.
Whatever you have to do.
Make it better.
So are we supposed to do something?
Sure.
- What subject?
- I don't know.
You're the tutor.
What does your mom want?
She wants me to get better grades, so that I'll get into Briarcrest.
You don't like public school?
No, I do.
It's just that there was a mugging on the field, and all the parents got really scared.
Is this your first job tutoring?
Yeah.
How am I doing?
Not so good.
Darn.
Can we go outside?
Yeah, I think it's up to you.
Cary the man!
Throwing down that opposition.
Nicely played.
Thanks.
So this is the new Cary?
No, just a new day.
So can I see the crime scene photos, Cary?
Well, come on.
You're in the big leagues now.
What can it hurt?
I'll think about it.
Oh.
Well, looky who's here.
Sophia?
In the flesh.
Strange bedfellows, huh?
The strangest.
Well... you two have a nice time.
What'd she want?
Oh.
Crime scene photos.
Damn it.
Okay, uh, Simon Greenberg, 22, found in his dorm room gagged, hands bound, stabbed 45 times.
- Little overkill?
- Yep.
Police think it was an execution.
No sign of a struggle.
Any witnesses?
Neighbor heard a scream, looked out his window and saw a dark, possibly black Middle Eastern man running to his car.
They got a number plate-
- ET27.
Damn.
That's not a partial plate.
Yeah, I know.
Jimal's plate.
Um, one other thing.
Something that wasn't released to the press.
What?
Killer drew a swastika with the victim's blood.
Ugh.
Yep.
I know this is not looking good, is it?
Okay, um, let me know what you get from the roommates.
Got it.
Oh, by the way, the swastika-- the police don't know why, but it was drawn backwards.
Okay.
Hi.
Am I interrupting?
Nope.
How are you?
Good.
Do you have a moment to talk?
About last night?
Yeah.
Don't act like this is nothing, Eli.
You're running a pro-Palestinian campaign.
It's an anti-
Muslim-bigotry campaign, and I am a crisis man...
You are a Jew.
- We are both...
- Oh, come on, Michael!
What is this?
Ultimate Frisbee?
We only win by making them lose?
Yes.
You act like you're not paying attention, but I know you're paying attention.
This is a PR war.
And I'm a traitor?
In February, Israeli soldiers helped a Palestinian woman give birth.
You didn't read about it unless you subscribed to the Israel National News.
Two days later, an Israeli woman gave birth in a Palestinian hospital.
Where did you read it?
AP, CBS News, every major paper.
Google it.
Go ahead.
This is a PR war and they are winning.
Michael.
I do not go to your house and tell you what novels to write.
I do not go to your committee and tell you what lobbyists to hire.
Oh.
That's it.
Now I get it.
I didn't hire you.
There it is.
I hired Tarkovsky Associates.
With a $20 million Jewish League Fund to fight intolerance.
Yes, you did.
So this isn't Israel/Palestine to you.
It's Gold versus Tarkovsky.
You're paying a competitor, Michael.
And as moved as I am by your plea for
Jewish brotherhood,
I'm not that moved.
4,000 years and we are always our own worst enemy.
So you were driving Jimal's car that night, right?
This is just like the cops.
Racist.
They think an Arab had to do it.
Yeah, but this is you, isn't it, Amir?
You were driving your roommate's car that night, right?
No.
And you know why it's not me?
Look at your time code, lady.
I was in my living room for salah.
Evening prayers.
Anybody else see you there?
- Yes.
- Who?
The Prophet Muhammad.
Peace be upon him.
Yeah, Amir's in the living room five times a day praying.
Okay, Tariq.
Did you see him praying on the night of the murder?
- No.
- So you were home?
You were home to be able to not see him there?
No, I was out.
In Jimal's car?
No, I wanted to take it, but the keys were gone already.
So where were you?
I was here.
In the quad at the interfaith rally.
Sophia.
Kalinda.
Hi.
I didn't see you over there.
This is how you investigate these days?
- By just following me?
- Yep.
Makes things a lot easier.
So you and Cary, huh?
That's why you've been ignoring me, right?
It's not because I'm married.
Yep.
You got me.
Listen, I'm gonna go and question eyewitnesses at the Jewish frat.
Do you want the address?
Where's the fun in that?
Your Honor, this is...
- This is prosecutorial misconduct.
- Okay, okay, okay.
This is absolutely unethical.
All right, all right.
Each to your corners.
Mrs. Florrick, your client already swore that that was him in the car.
Is he now trying to say that he lied?
He's saying that he was misled by the prosecution.
How did I mislead?
Jimal was given an opportunity to avoid a hate crime prosecution and he took it, that's all.
This murder charge is based on nothing else.
There's no evidence that
Jimal and the victim even knew each other.
Where's the motive?
Mr. Greenberg was Jewish and Jimal was Muslim, and as you can see here, Your Honor, a swastika was drawn on the victim's...
Oh, come on.
Anti-Semitism isn't some cookie cutter motive you can apply
- to any dark-skinned...
- All right, counselors, listen.
Nobody likes a street fight better than me, but that's for in the street, not here.
Mr. Agos, do you have any further probable cause?
Because if it's just that statement,
I am prone to overturn.
We do, Your Honor.
Professor Noah Fineman.
I teach political science.
And did the accused show a particular interest in one of your lectures?
He did.
It's a lecture that I give on the anniversary of 9/11 about chickens who come home to roost for the United States and Zionist regime in Israel...
Objection.
Your Honor, is Mr. Agos really trying to find a motive in Jimal's classes?
Why not home ec?
- Maybe that's where the knife came from.
- Overruled.
I think we can stand a bit of rough and tumble here, Counselor.
So, Professor, you would argue that Israel's a criminal regime.
Oh, I-I don't argue it.
I think that's fairly self-evident.
Given this, what do you think of suicide bombings and the death of Jewish citizens?
If you're asking me if I approve of such a thing, no, never.
But I do understand them.
These are understandable movements against a Zionist oppression.
And how did your student Jimal take an added interest in this lecture?
Well, he was, uh, very engaged in class, yes.
And afterwards, he approached me to ask me questions about my newest book,
Zionist Occupation:
the Need for Realignment and New Thinking.
Bordinay Press.
Thank you, Professor.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Actually, Professor,
I have a few questions.
My client was very engaged in your lecture, you said?
How did you witness this?
Well, if you teach students long enough, you get a sense.
And for how long did you teach Jimal?
Well, it's been four weeks since the beginning of the semester.
So four weeks, that's, uh, 20 sessions.
And for how many of those sessions were you actually present?
I don't understand.
How many of those 20 sessions were you actually there teaching and not having one of your TA's do it?
- Uh...
- Didn't you only lecture the class twice, Professor?
Well, I would question your use of the word "only,"
but, uh... yes.
And yet you really focused with your laser-like perception on Jimal and his engagement.
You're being a bit rude.
Yes, and I'm just getting started.
So, after one of your lectures,
Jimal came to you to ask you about your book.
How do you know this?
Because I keep a record next to my attendance.
See?
That asterisk tells me that I must send them an e-mail about my book.
And, of course, you recognize Jimal, over there?
Oh, yes.
This record attendance, the students sign themselves in, yes?
Yes, it's a very efficient way to work.
I'm sure.
Do you see Jimal's name there?
It's him there.
- That's not his handwriting.
- Objection.
That's the handwriting of his roommate,
Tariq, also a student in your class who signed him in so that Jimal could cut class.
Well, I'd say things have been pretty easy for you up until now.
Really?
How's that?
In court, these people don't really know how you think.
But you do?
Hate to tell you this but we're going to beat you.
Good luck with that.
Battle M.E. Gaza Strip
It's one of my best MMOGs.
And what is an MMOG?
Massive Multiplayer Online Game.
Meaning people log onto their computers
- and battle each other.
- Yep.
What are we looking at now?
Uh, well, that's the recorded actions of Sampson5.
That's the avatar of the accused, Jimal...
Objection.
Your Honor, what does this have to do with the death of Simon Greenberg?
Goes to motive, Your Honor.
What is that assault weapon over there, is that an uzi?
No, it's a Galil 5.56.
What's the range of fire?
450 meters.
Cool.
Proceed.
Well, that's Jimal's avatar there.
The guy running.
And what is he wearing?
Oh, that?
That's a suicide vest.
He's wearing a suicide vest?
And what is he entering?
That's a civilian Israeli building.
That's a school, in fact...
Your Honor, this is a game.
Mr. Al-Said was just here.
He wants us to pull out of Jimal's defense.
He is afraid defending a youth who makes light of a suicide bombing will undercut Eli's pro-Muslim campaign.
He wasn't making light of it.
He was playing a video game.
In which he killed a schoolhouse full of kids.
Yes, but in a video game.
Have you seen video games lately?
We can't abandon Jimal.
He was looking at misdemeanor battery.
We helped him into a murder charge.
"We"?
I... helped him into a murder charge, which I did as a representative of this firm.
We made a commitment to him.
What do you think?
I think your friend will pull out of Eli's campaign and go right back to his old firm with his $10 million.
Yeah.
Still, retail rules.
We broke it, we own it?
Okay, we'll stick with Jimal.
Win this one.
No.
No, what?
No, Mr. Al-Said.
I'm coming here as a courtesy.
I don't need your campaign anymore.
I'm taking my business back to my old firm.
Oh, that's too bad because I already cashed your check.
You did not.
I did.
You know us Jews.
You'd do anything to piss me off.
You're right.
But I have still got a great pro-Muslim campaign for you.
Good doing business with you.
Did you hear the one about the Arab and the Jew?
No.
But I'm sure it's very funny.
An Arab and a Jew walk into a bar.
And then they kill each other.
Energy is radiated and absorbed in quanta, matched to...?
Patterns of black body radiation.
You know that's bad for you?
Uh-huh.
It's like the equivalent of three buckets of popcorn.
But I don't want three buckets of popcorn.
Oh, my God.
What?
Okay, I need your help.
Don't shake the camera.
Just keep it steady.
What are you doing?
Look at the color.
It's Bollywood.
You can't pass up Bollywood.
Do you know them?
No.
It's chance.
I do this all the time.

Good to have you back, Mr. Sartori.
Yeah.
So tell me, what is a power-up?
Sorry, this is the only place in the world where I have to explain a power-up.
Um, in a video game, it's something that you collect to give you extra power.
Like a gun, or, you know, ammunition.
So, would anyone ever pass up a power-up?
Huh?
No.
Not unless you're crazy.
You never know when you'll run out of ammunition.
So this suicide vest that Jimal's avatar is wearing, what is that?
It's a power-up.
And everybody who plays your game grabs one?
At one point or another.
In fact, according to your own logs, many ASAs in Mr. Agos's office...
- Objection.
- Overruled.
...many ASAs in Mr. Agos's office have collected such suicide packs?
Yeah, it's a part of the game.
It's not a thing.
But doesn't that mean these ASAs are more likely to have murdered Simon Greenberg?
- Your Honor.
- Psst.
Mrs. Florrick?
Mrs. Florrick, any further questions?
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Sartori,
Jimal's roommate, Amir Al-Fulan, he played your online game, too?
I have no idea.
This is a record of your subpoenaed logs.
Can you read that there?
Oh, yeah.
And you had to reduce his privileges because he fought with another player, didn't he?
Yeah, he, uh, he got in a fight online.
On the Battle M.E. board.
And who did he fight with?
Can you read that there?
You had to reduced both their privileges.
Simon Greenberg.
Thank you.
Jimal's roommate, Amir, is the most-likely suspect.
But he has an alibi-- praying.
Yes, but he was alone.
What about the other roommate-- Tariq?
We can't find any contact between Tariq and the victim.
And he doesn't have the political motive.
Amir is the Palestinian hard-liner.
Tariq could care less.
Okay.
Thank you, Alicia.
Keep us in touch.
What do you think?
I think... you're holding something against her.
I'm what?
Alicia.
Maybe it's unconscious, maybe it's not, but you're being hard on her.
No.
She's a third-year associate on a partner track and she's treating us like peers.
That's all you're seeing.
My God, am I the only adult left here?
Could everybody just put their emotions away?
I've got to get to a meeting, unless you have some other stray observations for me.
Are we overdoing it?
Diane thinks I'm going too hard on you.
Am I?
Going too hard?
All those late nights...
No time off.
Buried... in work.
Up to my knees.
He's doing it again, Mom!
He's doing it again!
It's just my neighbors.
Come on, let's go to the bedroom.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Leg is done, the chops are ready to go.
I'm just warming up the leg of lamb piece after it's been reposing for ten or 15 minutes...
We need to eat better.
I like what we eat.
No, I need to cook.
You're happier without Dad.
No, I'm happier with you.
Okay, that was such a mom thing to say.
No, it's about Dad.
Does that upset you?
No.
I don't know.
You know I love Dad.
I know.
I'm sorry.
No.
I found you a new tutor.
Dana.
I think you'll like her, she's social.
Actually, I think I like this one now.
You...
I thought you said she was too different.
She is.
But sometimes different isn't always bad.
She's coming over to help me set up my computer tomorrow.
What?
Mm, she's setting up your computer?
I asked her to.
Please tell me you're learning something, and that this isn't all pointless.
I'm learning something.
So how do you explain that, Amir?
I don't explain it.
You said you didn't know the victim, Simon Greenberg, and here you are on a video game fighting with him.
I don't need to talk to you.
You got no authority here.
Hey, you want to make yourself useful in here?
I just got the authority.
He claims it wasn't him.
It wasn't him, what, fighting against Greenberg?
On the video game.
Amir says it was Tariq.
He let him use his screen name.
These roommates-- they share everything.
So I'm checking Tariq, but we're back to square one.
Amir had a motive-- politics, fanaticism.
Tariq isn't political or religious.
I wonder if we're making a mistake thinking it's about Middle Eastern politics.
These kids-- they're just... college kids.
All rise.
Okay, I'll keep checking, but I'll need some time.
Judge Karpman presiding.
Thank you.
Please be seated.
So, this is where we stand.
There is sufficient evidence for a finding of probable cause.
Further, we set this case on my trial...
Your Honor, we ask that you recuse yourself.
Excuse me?
We believe you have shown bias against our client.
Believe?
Really?
In what way?
Your religion.
This is... outrageous.
I'm...
My Jewish background is completely irrelevant in this case.
Your Honor, you have given money to the Outlook for Israel, an organization that supports the settlements in Israel.
We believe you have shown bias against our client, and we ask that a new judge hear further proceedings.
I'll give you my answer in an hour.
He's not going to recuse himself.
He will.
Karpman always backs down when he's pushed.
He's afraid he'll be overturned on appeal.
So we start over with a new judge.
No.
I know what Alicia's doing.
Oh.
Hi, Michael.
How are you?
I was just sitting here going over this campaign.
Arab Spring.
Sort of like Irish Spring, but with Arabs.
- Do you want some coffee?
- How much?
For the coffee?
How much for six months if I brought the Jewish League Fund here?
How much are you paying Tarkovsky Associates?
You know how much I'm paying.
Well, of course, we would have to tell
Mr. Al-Said that we can't handle his account anymore, so if you'd help us defer those costs...
You're really a son of a bitch.
I am.
But now I'm your son of a bitch.
All rise.
Judge Karpman presiding.
Please be seated.
I've taken great deal of time with this motion because
I believe that part of being a tough judge is also being a fair judge.
Your Honor, may I quickly interrupt?
Can't imagine why, Counselor.
I'm ready to rule.
Yes, but...
I believe
Mrs. Florrick is attempting to manipulate this court.
Excuse me!
If you recuse yourself, Your Honor, the court will be forced to choose a new judge tomorrow?
Is that correct?
Yes, it is.
You were about to make your ruling, Your Honor?
That's what she's counting on.
Do you know what tomorrow is, Your Honor?
- What tomorrow is?
- The holiday.
That has nothing to do with my motion.
It's Rosh Hashanah.
There will be no Jewish judges in court, the case will be assigned to a non-Jewish judge.
That is why she's asking you
- to recuse yourself.
- Your Honor, this is offensive!
Mrs. Florrick,
I am... disappointed in you.
The motion is denied.
Case remains on my trial call!
Hi, Tariq.
How are you?
So, what, are you following me?
No.
I'm following her.
Hey, Tariq.
You know, if you're looking for a more discreet gay bar,
- I'd try Scarlet's on Halsted.
- No, no, no, no.
I'd try Sidetrack.
- It's too leathery.
- What do you need?
You used Amir's avatar on Battle M.E., the online video game.
So?
So, that's where you met Simon Greenberg.
- No.
- Yeah.
Actually... yeah.
Checked your alibi.
Didn't hold up, Tariq.
You weren't at the interfaith rally.
Why would I kill Greenberg?
It-It makes no sense.
We spoke to the bartender.
He said you met Greenberg here quite a few times.
My guess is, you two fell in love.
You argued.
He met someone else.
You got jealous.
You stabbed him.
Made it look like a hate crime.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't!
Why the reversed swastika?
- What?
- When you set it up as a hate crime, why did you draw the swastika backward?
What do you mean?
Isn't that how you draw it?
Hmm.
Is it good for the Jewish League Fund?
I don't know.
The Muslim was the killer, but he was also gay, and sleeping with our guy, so, uh,
I would call that a classic mixed message.
Crisis management.
If it helps our cause, I could find out if he's a top.
That was a joke.
Yeah.
Okay, I-I-I got to go.
Important work?
Fate of the world.
What do you think?
It's very flattering, Eli.
But I can't be thinking about the governorship when I'm doing this job.
So do this job.
Let me think about the governorship.
Just an observation from work.
If you're worried about Alicia and Will Gardner...
I'm not... worried.
I know, I know, but, um, if you were,
I think that whatever was there is no more.
They barely look at each other.
Eli.
You don't want a divorced candidate, do you?
No, I...
Forget it.
♪ Yes, good-bye ♪
You need a friend, K.
♪ I mean good-bye... ♪
Why do I need a friend?
Or a dog.
Maybe you need a dog.
Kalinda and Pooch.
Out investigating.
I'm fine, Will.
Really.
What's wrong with me?
We're not like normal people, are we?
What are normal people like?
Emotional.
- You're emotional.
- No.
Sometimes I'm in the middle of an emotion, and I just look at myself and realize...
I'm not feeling anything.
I just like acting like someone who feels something.
You want to stop acting and actually feel?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ow.
That's what it feels like.
Thanks.
I got to go.
I got to be somewhere at 8:45.
Really?
That's specific.
Yup.
Be good.
I'll get them to school on Monday.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Do we take our homework?
- Yes!
- Yes!
So, you've hired a tutor for Grace?
Yes, I did.
She's good, I think, and Grace likes her.
Or... she likes her now.
I'll keep an eye on that.
Oh, um, also,
Zach's girlfriend, Nisa-- her parents wanted us to come for dinner.
I'll tell her you're busy.
Yeah, yeah, tell her I'm...
I'm busy.
Love you.
Love you.
- Love you.
- I love you.
You call if you need anything.
I'll be here.

Do you know who sent it?
My guess is Tau Kappa Theta, the Jewish fraternity.
- I'm not saying anything bad.
- No, of course not.
I just think it was this video that provoked the fight
- at the interfaith rally.
- And you want us to defend...?
Jimal Mifsud.
Scholarship student in Science.
His family is in Jiddah, and he can't afford a lawyer.
Do you know his family?
No, I am purely an interested bystander here who wants to see justice done.
Purely?
There's a campus fistfight between a dozen Palestinian and Jewish youths, and the State's Attorney only charges one Palestinian?
Well, he doesn't have a record, so it should be a simple misdemeanor battery.
Court supervision, at most.
No, the new State's Attorney wants to appear tough on his first day.
It was deemed a hate crime.
Seven years.
Alicia, meet Wasim Al-Said, an old friend who until recently retained our competitor Young, Bachman and Meyers
- for his legal interest.
- To my eternal regret.
- Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
- Alicia's fine.
Your husband was very good to the Muslim community in his first term.
My fear is, that's changed.
Of course, Alicia can't influence her husband in any way, but she is still one of our best lawyers.
Well, that's all Jimal needs.
This is a good kid they're painting as a suicide bomber.
Bond hearing's today.
I'll be there.
Good, that's one piece of business.
What else might we handle that Young, Bachman and Meyers can't?
I know that Eli Gold is working with you these days?
I'm in need of some crisis management.
- What's the crisis?
- Where's the management?
Will you get, uh, Eli for us?
And ask Will to step in.
Will?
Sure.
He's late.
Overslept.
Must be from celebrating yesterday's victory.
- Must be.
- Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Hey, Mom, pick up...
Hello, dearest daughter.
You sound happy.
I am happy.
I have my daughter on the phone.
What more could I desire?
Look, I don't think I need a tutor.
Grace, we discussed this.
It's just a month.
- Yeah, but it was one report card.
- And it's one month.
Dad just thinks I need to apply myself.
Oh, I agree, and a tutor will help you do that.
Eli?
The meeting.
Mom, Nisa's parents want you to come over for dinner.
- You and Dad.
Both of you.
- Why?
Just to be nice.
I didn't tell them anything.
It was like you said:
I haven't let anyone know you guys are separated.
Hey!
Okay, I'll talk to your father about it.
I-I've got to go.
So, who is this guy again?
Wasim Al-Said.
He's a commodities trader.
Wasim?
Diane's been trying to sign him for two years.
He has ten million in charitable assets to spend.
On what?
A campaign against anti-Muslim bigotry.
Mr. Al-Said, you do know that I'm not a PR specialist.
I handle lobbying and crisis management.
Do you watch the evening news, Eli?
Religiously.
Then you know there was a murder of a Jewish poli sci major at Chicago Polytech last night.
Unsolved, but the police are questioning Muslim students.
Ten minutes later, a riot broke out at the other end of campus at a rally intended to encourage interfaith dialogue, and only one Muslim was arrested.
Now I'm used to reading the tea leaves in this country, and the best way to manage a crisis is before it becomes one.
Isn't that true?
It is.
So, are you hiring me because I'm good or because I'm Jewish?
Because I imagine it might look quite good having a Jew campaign for Muslims.
Can't it be both?
- I don't like being used.
- Really?
Since when?
He knows Jewish money is going to Peter for his next campaign
- and he wants to buy influence.
- And...?
Don't you get so knowing on me.
What's up with you, anyway?
You seem different.
Where you going?
- Court.
- Why?
I'm a lawyer.
Okay, glad we cleared that up.
This is a hate crime, Your Honor, and we ask that bail be set at $100,000.
Have you ever been in a fistfight, Counselor?
Have I, Your Honor?
Uh, no.
Well, let me educate you.
It's chaos, chaos in there.
No one can tell who hits who.
Fists are flying, you get hit in the head.
The next thing you know, you're on the ground and somebody's jumping...
- Jimal, I'm sorry to be late.
I was...
- Jimal assaulted someone because he was Jewish.
That is not chaos, Your Honor.
And Jimal was hit because he's Palestinian, Your Honor.
Alicia Florrick, Your Honor.
20 students were fighting.
Only one was charged.
One Muslim.
- His religion had nothing to...
- It had everything to do with it.
All right, okay, your passion is preserved for the record.
Bond is set at $5,000.
And I do suggest that the State reconsider its charge.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Jimal, I was just put in on this.
You have a benefactor who asked me to step in.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I know, a lot of this is posturing by the prosecution to get you to accept a higher plea.
The good news is, the judge is on your side.
Now, do you want me to call your parents or anything?
No, no they wouldn't...
Look, I'm ashamed.
I understand.
Hopefully, we can handle this
- by admitting simple battery.
- But I didn't.
I wasn't even there.
He wasn't at the rally, Cary.
He was at the library.
Oh, my God, really?
That's terrible.
This isn't about Jimal, and this isn't about some stupid fistfight.
This is about that Jewish kid stabbed to death, and you can't find the killer so Jimal is the scapegoat.
We have an eyewitness who saw Jimal throw the first punch.
- That's what this is about.
- Is the eyewitness Caucasian?
Oh, wow, how quickly we slip the bonds of political correctness.
- Why not ask if he's Jewish?
- Cross-racial identification.
Caucasians have difficulty discerning unique characteristics.
Six months in County, one year probation.
No.
Then I'll see you in court.
Tell Peter there has to be a better way to firm up his campaign contributions.
Using everything we can, are we?
It's a new day.
We're running a clean office.
Let me say that again, because we're all prone to the same cynicism.
We... are running a clean office.
Clean, ethical, honest, but not weak.
I know our budgets have been slashed.
I know we're the underdog here.
But our strategy will be this:
no plea bargains.
That's right.
Defense attorneys will be expecting the opposite.
So for the next two months,
I want you to hold the line on every single plea.
After that, you won't have to work as hard.
You get your enemy flinching, you'll never have to hit him hard again.
Your first complaint will be about investigator hours.
That's why I've hired an outside contractor until we can budget full time.
I want you to meet Sophia Russo.
She's good, and she's cheap.
Thanks!
Relatively.
Mr. Florrick, I offered the defense six months on the college hate crime.
Should I walk it back?
What's the law say?
Three to seven years.
There's your answer.
The lawyer's Alicia, and she might come after your campaign contributions.
Really?
Yeah.
What do you want?
Follow the law.
You can't go wrong if you follow the law.
All right.
Geez, what a pit.
- Thank you.
- You're working on the, uh, the Jewish-Muslim thing, right?
Yeah, the hate crime.
Why?
What do you need?
Oh, it's not what I need.
What is this?
You used to work with Kalinda Sharma, didn't you?
Yeah.
If I were you, I'd slip it to her.

So, kind of odd not seeing you around much.
Yeah, I've been busy.
Yeah.
And here I thought you didn't need me anymore.
What's that?
It's a peace offering.
Peter Florrick wants to run a clean office, so... this is me being clean.
You're welcome.

Morning in the Middle East...
Do you need something?
It's on your desk.
It's self-explanatory.
That's your car?
Good.
Now, I know you said you were at the library.
But the time code on that traffic light shows that the driver of your car was running a red light just outside the campus gates at the exact moment of the interfaith rally.
That means that the driver of your car, if that is you, couldn't have been involved in the rally fight.
Do you understand?
I do.
So, I want you to take your time before you answer.
Is that you driving your car?
It is.
Are you certain, young man?
It's a very roundabout way to come from the library.
I'm sure.
We ask that Mr. Mifsud state under oath that he was the driver in this photo which we will mark as People's Exhibit #1.
Your Honor, is that really necessary?
It's the only way we'll drop the hate charge.
Very well.
Mr. Mifsud, you are under oath.
Do you swear that that's you in the photo?
Yes.
Good.
Well, I think that just about, uh, wraps it up, doesn't it, Mr. Agos?
I'm late for the gym.
It does, Your Honor, and the State has made a terrible mistake in charging Mr. Mifsud with this battery, But this car with this license plate was seen racing away from the scene
- of the frat murder of Simon Greenberg...
- Objection, Your Honor!
- That is why he ran the red light.
- Oh, this is outrageous.
- He had just killed Simon Greenberg.
- This is prosecutorial misconduct!
He swore to it.
His alibi means he committed this murder.
Because you overcharged him with a hate crime so he would grab at any alibi.
So you're saying your client perjured himself?
No, I am saying he took my advice, that's all.
Well, then congratulations, Alicia.
You just advised your client to admit to murder.
Your Honor, the People charge Jimal Mifsud with first-degree murder.
The Good Wife Original air date September 25, 2011 S03E01 "A New Day"
Alicia dropped by for you.
Why?
I don't know.
You want me to get her?
No.
Later.
DA:
So this isn't you?
It's your car, but you're not driving it?
I'm sorry, I, uh, I thought it was the easiest way out.
So who is it?
Who's driving it?
I don't know.
Jimal, they have a witness who swears that that car-- your car-- was driven away by Simon Greenberg's killer.
So don't cover for anyone.
I'm not covering.
My-my two roommates don't have a car,
I let Amir and Tariq use mine.
I just leave my keys in the room.
So which is driving it, Amir or Tariq?
I don't know.
But he swore that was him driving away from the murder?
He didn't know it would implicate him in a murder.
It's my fault.
I encouraged him to place himself in the car to give him an alibi from the hate crime.
Yes.
And now I have a multimillion-dollar client thinking that we're amateurs.
I got the pictures from the ASA's office.
- I should've checked.
- Great.
It's everybody's fault.
Now let's make it right.
I'm questioning Jimal's roommates.
One of them is the real driver.
And I'm filing a motion to dismiss
Jimal's alibi statement during preliminary.
I don't know what's going on with you two, but make it better.
Whatever you have to do.
Make it better.
So are we supposed to do something?
Sure.
- What subject?
- I don't know.
You're the tutor.
What does your mom want?
She wants me to get better grades, so that I'll get into Briarcrest.
You don't like public school?
No, I do.
It's just that there was a mugging on the field, and all the parents got really scared.
Is this your first job tutoring?
Yeah.
How am I doing?
Not so good.
Darn.
Can we go outside?
Yeah, I think it's up to you.
Cary the man!
Throwing down that opposition.
Nicely played.
Thanks.
So this is the new Cary?
No, just a new day.
So can I see the crime scene photos, Cary?
Well, come on.
You're in the big leagues now.
What can it hurt?
I'll think about it.
Oh.
Well, looky who's here.
Sophia?
In the flesh.
Strange bedfellows, huh?
The strangest.
Well... you two have a nice time.
What'd she want?
Oh.
Crime scene photos.
Damn it.
Okay, uh, Simon Greenberg, 22, found in his dorm room gagged, hands bound, stabbed 45 times.
- Little overkill?
- Yep.
Police think it was an execution.
No sign of a struggle.
Any witnesses?
Neighbor heard a scream, looked out his window and saw a dark, possibly black Middle Eastern man running to his car.
They got a number plate-
- ET27.
Damn.
That's not a partial plate.
Yeah, I know.
Jimal's plate.
Um, one other thing.
Something that wasn't released to the press.
What?
Killer drew a swastika with the victim's blood.
Ugh.
Yep.
I know this is not looking good, is it?
Okay, um, let me know what you get from the roommates.
Got it.
Oh, by the way, the swastika-- the police don't know why, but it was drawn backwards.
Okay.
Hi.
Am I interrupting?
Nope.
How are you?
Good.
Do you have a moment to talk?
About last night?
Yeah.
Don't act like this is nothing, Eli.
You're running a pro-Palestinian campaign.
It's an anti-
Muslim-bigotry campaign, and I am a crisis man...
You are a Jew.
- We are both...
- Oh, come on, Michael!
What is this?
Ultimate Frisbee?
We only win by making them lose?
Yes.
You act like you're not paying attention, but I know you're paying attention.
This is a PR war.
And I'm a traitor?
In February, Israeli soldiers helped a Palestinian woman give birth.
You didn't read about it unless you subscribed to the Israel National News.
Two days later, an Israeli woman gave birth in a Palestinian hospital.
Where did you read it?
AP, CBS News, every major paper.
Google it.
Go ahead.
This is a PR war and they are winning.
Michael.
I do not go to your house and tell you what novels to write.
I do not go to your committee and tell you what lobbyists to hire.
Oh.
That's it.
Now I get it.
I didn't hire you.
There it is.
I hired Tarkovsky Associates.
With a $20 million Jewish League Fund to fight intolerance.
Yes, you did.
So this isn't Israel/Palestine to you.
It's Gold versus Tarkovsky.
You're paying a competitor, Michael.
And as moved as I am by your plea for
Jewish brotherhood,
I'm not that moved.
4,000 years and we are always our own worst enemy.
So you were driving Jimal's car that night, right?
This is just like the cops.
Racist.
They think an Arab had to do it.
Yeah, but this is you, isn't it, Amir?
You were driving your roommate's car that night, right?
No.
And you know why it's not me?
Look at your time code, lady.
I was in my living room for salah.
Evening prayers.
Anybody else see you there?
- Yes.
- Who?
The Prophet Muhammad.
Peace be upon him.
Yeah, Amir's in the living room five times a day praying.
Okay, Tariq.
Did you see him praying on the night of the murder?
- No.
- So you were home?
You were home to be able to not see him there?
No, I was out.
In Jimal's car?
No, I wanted to take it, but the keys were gone already.
So where were you?
I was here.
In the quad at the interfaith rally.
Sophia.
Kalinda.
Hi.
I didn't see you over there.
This is how you investigate these days?
- By just following me?
- Yep.
Makes things a lot easier.
So you and Cary, huh?
That's why you've been ignoring me, right?
It's not because I'm married.
Yep.
You got me.
Listen, I'm gonna go and question eyewitnesses at the Jewish frat.
Do you want the address?
Where's the fun in that?
IA:
Your Honor, this is...
- This is prosecutorial misconduct.
- Okay, okay, okay.
This is absolutely unethical.
All right, all right.
Each to your corners.
Mrs. Florrick, your client already swore that that was him in the car.
Is he now trying to say that he lied?
He's saying that he was misled by the prosecution.
How did I mislead?
Jimal was given an opportunity to avoid a hate crime prosecution and he took it, that's all.
This murder charge is based on nothing else.
There's no evidence that
Jimal and the victim even knew each other.
Where's the motive?
Mr. Greenberg was Jewish and Jimal was Muslim, and as you can see here, Your Honor, a swastika was drawn on the victim's...
Oh, come on.
Anti-Semitism isn't some cookie cutter motive you can apply
- to any dark-skinned...
- All right, counselors, listen.
Nobody likes a street fight better than me, but that's for in the street, not here.
Mr. Agos, do you have any further probable cause?
Because if it's just that statement,
I am prone to overturn.
We do, Your Honor.
AN:
Professor Noah Fineman.
I teach political science.
And did the accused show a particular interest in one of your lectures?
He did.
It's a lecture that I give on the anniversary of 9/11 about chickens who come home to roost for the United States and Zionist regime in Israel...
Objection.
Your Honor, is Mr. Agos really trying to find a motive in Jimal's classes?
Why not home ec?
- Maybe that's where the knife came from.
- Overruled.
I think we can stand a bit of rough and tumble here, Counselor.
So, Professor, you would argue that Israel's a criminal regime.
Oh, I-I don't argue it.
I think that's fairly self-evident.
Given this, what do you think of suicide bombings and the death of Jewish citizens?
If you're asking me if I approve of such a thing, no, never.
But I do understand them.
These are understandable movements against a Zionist oppression.
And how did your student Jimal take an added interest in this lecture?
Well, he was, uh, very engaged in class, yes.
And afterwards, he approached me to ask me questions about my newest book,
Zionist Occupation:
the Need for Realignment and New Thinking.
Bordinay Press.
Thank you, Professor.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Actually, Professor,
I have a few questions.
My client was very engaged in your lecture, you said?
How did you witness this?
Well, if you teach students long enough, you get a sense.
And for how long did you teach Jimal?
Well, it's been four weeks since the beginning of the semester.
So four weeks, that's, uh, 20 sessions.
And for how many of those sessions were you actually present?
I don't understand.
How many of those 20 sessions were you actually there teaching and not having one of your TA's do it?
- Uh...
- Didn't you only lecture the class twice, Professor?
Well, I would question your use of the word "only,"
but, uh... yes.
And yet you really focused with your laser-like perception on Jimal and his engagement.
You're being a bit rude.
Yes, and I'm just getting started.
So, after one of your lectures,
Jimal came to you to ask you about your book.
How do you know this?
Because I keep a record next to my attendance.
See?
That asterisk tells me that I must send them an e-mail about my book.
And, of course, you recognize Jimal, over there?
Oh, yes.
This record attendance, the students sign themselves in, yes?
Yes, it's a very efficient way to work.
I'm sure.
Do you see Jimal's name there?
It's him there.
- That's not his handwriting.
- Objection.
That's the handwriting of his roommate,
Tariq, also a student in your class who signed him in so that Jimal could cut class.
Well, I'd say things have been pretty easy for you up until now.
Really?
How's that?
In court, these people don't really know how you think.
But you do?
Hate to tell you this but we're going to beat you.
Good luck with that.
Battle M.E. Gaza Strip
It's one of my best MMOGs.
And what is an MMOG?
Massive Multiplayer Online Game.
Meaning people log onto their computers
- and battle each other.
- Yep.
What are we looking at now?
Uh, well, that's the recorded actions of Sampson5.
That's the avatar of the accused, Jimal...
Objection.
Your Honor, what does this have to do with the death of Simon Greenberg?
Goes to motive, Your Honor.
What is that assault weapon over there, is that an uzi?
No, it's a Galil 5.56.
What's the range of fire?
450 meters.
Cool.
Proceed.
Well, that's Jimal's avatar there.
The guy running.
And what is he wearing?
Oh, that?
That's a suicide vest.
He's wearing a suicide vest?
And what is he entering?
That's a civilian Israeli building.
That's a school, in fact...
Your Honor, this is a game.
Mr. Al-Said was just here.
He wants us to pull out of Jimal's defense.
He is afraid defending a youth who makes light of a suicide bombing will undercut Eli's pro-Muslim campaign.
He wasn't making light of it.
He was playing a video game.
In which he killed a schoolhouse full of kids.
Yes, but in a video game.
Have you seen video games lately?
We can't abandon Jimal.
He was looking at misdemeanor battery.
We helped him into a murder charge.
"We"?
I... helped him into a murder charge, which I did as a representative of this firm.
We made a commitment to him.
What do you think?
I think your friend will pull out of Eli's campaign and go right back to his old firm with his $10 million.
Yeah.
Still, retail rules.
We broke it, we own it?
Okay, we'll stick with Jimal.
Win this one.
No.
No, what?
No, Mr. Al-Said.
I'm coming here as a courtesy.
I don't need your campaign anymore.
I'm taking my business back to my old firm.
Oh, that's too bad because I already cashed your check.
You did not.
I did.
You know us Jews.
You'd do anything to piss me off.
You're right.
But I have still got a great pro-Muslim campaign for you.
Good doing business with you.
Did you hear the one about the Arab and the Jew?
No.
But I'm sure it's very funny.
An Arab and a Jew walk into a bar.
And then they kill each other.
Energy is radiated and absorbed in quanta, matched to...?
Patterns of black body radiation.
You know that's bad for you?
Uh-huh.
It's like the equivalent of three buckets of popcorn.
But I don't want three buckets of popcorn.
Oh, my God.
What?
Okay, I need your help.
Don't shake the camera.
Just keep it steady.
What are you doing?
Look at the color.
It's Bollywood.
You can't pass up Bollywood.
Do you know them?
No.
It's chance.
I do this all the time.
Grace, camera up.

What are you doing?
♪ I'm not a rocket scientist ♪
♪ I rock the house and sign the... ♪

♪ To make your ass throw fits, now sisters kick it ♪

Good to have you back, Mr. Sartori.
Yeah.
So tell me, what is a power-up?
Sorry, this is the only place in the world where I have to explain a power-up.
Um, in a video game, it's something that you collect to give you extra power.
Like a gun, or, you know, ammunition.
So, would anyone ever pass up a power-up?
Huh?
No.
Not unless you're crazy.
You never know when you'll run out of ammunition.
So this suicide vest that Jimal's avatar is wearing, what is that?
It's a power-up.
And everybody who plays your game grabs one?
At one point or another.
In fact, according to your own logs, many ASAs in Mr. Agos's office...
- Objection.
- Overruled.
...many ASAs in Mr. Agos's office have collected such suicide packs?
Yeah, it's a part of the game.
It's not a thing.
But doesn't that mean these ASAs are more likely to have murdered Simon Greenberg?
- Your Honor.
- Psst.
Mrs. Florrick?
Mrs. Florrick, any further questions?
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Sartori,
Jimal's roommate, Amir Al-Fulan, he played your online game, too?
I have no idea.
This is a record of your subpoenaed logs.
Can you read that there?
Oh, yeah.
And you had to reduce his privileges because he fought with another player, didn't he?
Yeah, he, uh, he got in a fight online.
On the Battle M.E. board.
And who did he fight with?
Can you read that there?
You had to reduced both their privileges.
Simon Greenberg.
Thank you.
Jimal's roommate, Amir, is the most-likely suspect.
But he has an alibi-- praying.
Yes, but he was alone.
What about the other roommate-- Tariq?
We can't find any contact between Tariq and the victim.
And he doesn't have the political motive.
Amir is the Palestinian hard-liner.
Tariq could care less.
Okay.
Thank you, Alicia.
Keep us in touch.
What do you think?
I think... you're holding something against her.
I'm what?
Alicia.
Maybe it's unconscious, maybe it's not, but you're being hard on her.
No.
She's a third-year associate on a partner track and she's treating us like peers.
That's all you're seeing.
My God, am I the only adult left here?
Could everybody just put their emotions away?
I've got to get to a meeting, unless you have some other stray observations for me.
Are we overdoing it?
Diane thinks I'm going too hard on you.
Am I?
Going too hard?
All those late nights...
No time off.
Buried... in work.
Up to my knees.
He's doing it again, Mom!
He's doing it again!
It's just my neighbors.
Come on, let's go to the bedroom.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Leg is done, the chops are ready to go.
I'm just warming up the leg of lamb piece after it's been reposing for ten or 15 minutes...
We need to eat better.
I like what we eat.
No, I need to cook.
You're happier without Dad.
No, I'm happier with you.
Okay, that was such a mom thing to say.
No, it's about Dad.
Does that upset you?
No.
I don't know.
You know I love Dad.
I know.
I'm sorry.
No.
I found you a new tutor.
Dana.
I think you'll like her, she's social.
Actually, I think I like this one now.
You...
I thought you said she was too different.
She is.
But sometimes different isn't always bad.
She's coming over to help me set up my computer tomorrow.
What?
Mm, she's setting up your computer?
I asked her to.
Please tell me you're learning something, and that this isn't all pointless.
I'm learning something.
So how do you explain that, Amir?
I don't explain it.
You said you didn't know the victim, Simon Greenberg, and here you are on a video game fighting with him.
I don't need to talk to you.
You got no authority here.
Hey, you want to make yourself useful in here?
I just got the authority.
DA:
He claims it wasn't him.
It wasn't him, what, fighting against Greenberg?
On the video game.
Amir says it was Tariq.
He let him use his screen name.
These roommates-- they share everything.
So I'm checking Tariq, but we're back to square one.
Amir had a motive-- politics, fanaticism.
Tariq isn't political or religious.
I wonder if we're making a mistake thinking it's about Middle Eastern politics.
These kids-- they're just... college kids.
All rise.
Okay, I'll keep checking, but I'll need some time.
Judge Karpman presiding.
Thank you.
Please be seated.
So, this is where we stand.
There is sufficient evidence for a finding of probable cause.
Further, we set this case on my trial...
Your Honor, we ask that you recuse yourself.
Excuse me?
We believe you have shown bias against our client.
Believe?
Really?
In what way?
Your religion.
This is... outrageous.
I'm...
My Jewish background is completely irrelevant in this case.
Your Honor, you have given money to the Outlook for Israel, an organization that supports the settlements in Israel.
We believe you have shown bias against our client, and we ask that a new judge hear further proceedings.
I'll give you my answer in an hour.
He's not going to recuse himself.
He will.
Karpman always backs down when he's pushed.
He's afraid he'll be overturned on appeal.
So we start over with a new judge.
No.
I know what Alicia's doing.
Oh.
Hi, Michael.
How are you?
I was just sitting here going over this campaign.
Arab Spring.
Sort of like Irish Spring, but with Arabs.
- Do you want some coffee?
- How much?
For the coffee?
How much for six months if I brought the Jewish League Fund here?
How much are you paying Tarkovsky Associates?
You know how much I'm paying.
Well, of course, we would have to tell
Mr. Al-Said that we can't handle his account anymore, so if you'd help us defer those costs...
You're really a son of a bitch.
I am.
But now I'm your son of a bitch.
AN:
All rise.
Judge Karpman presiding.
Please be seated.
I've taken great deal of time with this motion because
I believe that part of being a tough judge is also being a fair judge.
Your Honor, may I quickly interrupt?
Can't imagine why, Counselor.
I'm ready to rule.
Yes, but...
I believe
Mrs. Florrick is attempting to manipulate this court.
Excuse me!
If you recuse yourself, Your Honor, the court will be forced to choose a new judge tomorrow?
Is that correct?
Yes, it is.
You were about to make your ruling, Your Honor?
That's what she's counting on.
Do you know what tomorrow is, Your Honor?
- What tomorrow is?
- The holiday.
That has nothing to do with my motion.
It's Rosh Hashanah.
There will be no Jewish judges in court, the case will be assigned to a non-Jewish judge.
That is why she's asking you
- to recuse yourself.
- Your Honor, this is offensive!
Mrs. Florrick,
I am... disappointed in you.
The motion is denied.
Case remains on my trial call!
Hi, Tariq.
How are you?
So, what, are you following me?
No.
I'm following her.
Hey, Tariq.
You know, if you're looking for a more discreet gay bar,
- I'd try Scarlet's on Halsted.
- No, no, no, no.
I'd try Sidetrack.
- It's too leathery.
- What do you need?
You used Amir's avatar on Battle M.E., the online video game.
So?
So, that's where you met Simon Greenberg.
- No.
- Yeah.
Actually... yeah.
Checked your alibi.
Didn't hold up, Tariq.
You weren't at the interfaith rally.
Why would I kill Greenberg?
It-It makes no sense.
We spoke to the bartender.
He said you met Greenberg here quite a few times.
My guess is, you two fell in love.
You argued.
He met someone else.
You got jealous.
You stabbed him.
Made it look like a hate crime.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't!
Why the reversed swastika?
- What?
- When you set it up as a hate crime, why did you draw the swastika backward?
What do you mean?
Isn't that how you draw it?
Hmm.
Is it good for the Jewish League Fund?
I don't know.
The Muslim was the killer, but he was also gay, and sleeping with our guy, so, uh,
I would call that a classic mixed message.
Crisis management.
If it helps our cause, I could find out if he's a top.
That was a joke.
Yeah.
Okay, I-I-I got to go.
Important work?
Fate of the world.
What do you think?
It's very flattering, Eli.
But I can't be thinking about the governorship when I'm doing this job.
So do this job.
Let me think about the governorship.
Just an observation from work.
If you're worried about Alicia and Will Gardner...
I'm not... worried.
I know, I know, but, um, if you were,
I think that whatever was there is no more.
They barely look at each other.
Eli.
You don't want a divorced candidate, do you?
No, I...
Forget it.
♪ Yes, good-bye ♪
You need a friend, K.
♪ I mean good-bye... ♪
Why do I need a friend?
Or a dog.
Maybe you need a dog.
Kalinda and Pooch.
Out investigating.
I'm fine, Will.
Really.
What's wrong with me?
We're not like normal people, are we?
What are normal people like?
Emotional.
- You're emotional.
- No.
Sometimes I'm in the middle of an emotion, and I just look at myself and realize...
I'm not feeling anything.
I just like acting like someone who feels something.
You want to stop acting and actually feel?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ow.
That's what it feels like.
Thanks.
I got to go.
I got to be somewhere at 8:45.
Really?
That's specific.
Yup.
Be good.
ER:
I'll get them to school on Monday.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Do we take our homework?
- Yes!
- Yes!
So, you've hired a tutor for Grace?
Yes, I did.
She's good, I think, and Grace likes her.
Or... she likes her now.
I'll keep an eye on that.
Oh, um, also,
Zach's girlfriend, Nisa-- her parents wanted us to come for dinner.
I'll tell her you're busy.
Yeah, yeah, tell her I'm...
I'm busy.
Love you.
Love you.
- Love you.
- I love you.
You call if you need anything.
I'll be here.
It was e-mailed to campus in-boxes.
- Do you know who sent it?
- My guess is Tau Kappa Theta, the Jewish fraternity.
- I'm not saying anything bad.
- No, of course not.
It was this video that provoked the fight at the rally.
And you want us to defend?
Jimal Mifsud.
Scholarship student in Science.
His family is in Jidda, and he can't afford a lawyer.
Do you know his family?
No, I am purely an interested bystander here
- who wants to see justice done.
- Purely?
There's a campus fistfight between a dozen Palestinian and Jewish youths, and the state's attorney only charges one Palestinian?
He doesn't have a record, so it should be a simple misdemeanor battery.
- Court supervision.
No.
The new state's attorney wants to appear tough on his first day.
It was deemed a hate crime.
Seven years.
Alicia, meet Wasim Al-Said, an old friend who, until recently, retained our competitor, Young, Bachman and Meyers
- for his legal interest.
- To my eternal regret.
- Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
- Alicia's fine.
Your husband was good to the Muslim community his first term.
My fear is that's changed.
Of course, Alicia can't influence her husband in any way, but she is still one of our best lawyers.
Well, that's all Jimal needs.
This is a good kid they're painting as, uh, a suicide bomber.
Bond hearing's today.
I'll be there.
Good.
That's one piece of business.
What else might we handle that Young, Bachman and Meyers can't?
I know that Eli Gold is working with you these days.
I'm in need of some crisis management.
- What's the crisis?
- Where's the management?
Will you get, uh, Eli for us?
And ask Will to step in.
Will?
Sure.
He's late.
Overslept.
Must be from
- celebrating yesterday's victory.
- Must be.
Mom, pick up the phone.
Mom, pick up...
Hello, dearest daughter.
You sound happy.
I am happy.
I have my daughter on the phone.
What more could I desire?
Look, I don't think I need a tutor.
Grace, we discussed this.
It's just a month.
It was one report card.
- And it's one month.
Dad just thinks I need to apply myself.
Oh, I agree, and a tutor will help you do that.
Eli.
The meeting.
Mom, Nisa's parents want you to come over for dinner.
You and Dad.
Both of you.
- Why?
Just to be nice.
I didn't tell them anything.
Like you said, I haven't let anyone know you are separated.
Okay, I'll talk to your father about it.
I've gotta go.
- So who is this guy again?
- Wasim Al-Said.
- He's a commodities trader.
- Wasim?
Diane's been trying to sign him for two years.
He has 10 million in charitable assets to spend.
On what?
A campaign against anti-Muslim bigotry.
Mr. Al-Said, you do know that I'm not a PR specialist?
I handle lobbying and crisis management.
Do you watch the evening news, Eli?
Religiously.
Then you know there was a murder of a Jewish Poli-Sci major at Chicago Polytech last night.
Unsolved, but the police are questioning Muslim students.
Ten minutes later, uh, a riot broke out at the other end of campus at a rally intended to encourage interfaith dialogue, and only one Muslim was arrested.
Now, I'm used to reading the tea leaves in this country, and the best way to manage a crisis is before it becomes one.
Isn't that true?
It is.
So are you hiring me because I'm good or because I'm Jewish?
Because I imagine it might look quite good having a Jew campaign for Muslims.
Can't it be both?
- I don't like being used.
- Really?
Since when?
He knows Jewish money is going to Peter for his next campaign
- and he wants to buy influence.
- And?
Don't you get so knowing on me.
What's up with you anyway?
- You seem different.
- Heh.
- Where you going?
- Court.
- Why?
- I'm a lawyer.
Okay, glad we cleared that up.
This is a hate crime, Your Honor, and we ask that bail be set at $100,000.
Have you ever been in a fistfight, counselor?
Have I, Your Honor?
Um, no.
Well, let me educate you.
It's chaos, chaos in there.
No one can tell who hits who.
Fists are flying, you get hit in the head.
Next thing you know, you're on the ground...
- I'm sorry to be late.
Jimal assaulted someone because he was Jewish.
That is not chaos.
And Jimal was hit because he's Palestinian, Your Honor.
Alicia Florrick, Your Honor.
Twenty students were fighting.
Only one was charged.
One Muslim.
- Religion had nothing...
- Everything to do with it.
All right, okay.
Your passion is preserved for the record.
Bond is set at $5,000.
And I do suggest that the state reconsider its charge.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Jimal, I was just put in on this.
You have a benefactor who asked me to step in.
- You all right?
- Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I know.
A lot of this is posturing by the prosecution to get you to accept a higher plea.
The good news is the judge is on your side.
Want me to call your parents or...?
No.
No, they wouldn't...
Look, I'm ashamed.
I understand.
Hopefully, we can handle this by admitting simple battery.
But I didn't.
I wasn't even there.
He wasn't at the rally, Cary.
He was at the library.
Oh, my God, really?
That's terrible.
This isn't about Jimal, and this isn't about some stupid fistfight.
This is about that Jewish kid stabbed to death, and you can't find the killer so Jimal is the scapegoat.
We have an eyewitness who saw Jimal throw the first punch.
Is the eyewitness Caucasian?
Oh, wow, how quickly we slip the bonds of political correctness.
- Why not ask if he's Jewish?
- Cross-racial identification.
Caucasians have difficulty discerning unique characteristics.
Six months in county, one year probation.
- No.
- Then I'll see you in court.
Tell Peter there has to be a better way to firm up his campaign contributions.
Using everything we can, are we?
PETER:
It's a new day.
We're running a clean office.
Let me say that again because we're all prone to the same cynicism.
We are running a clean office.
Clean, ethical, honest, but not weak.
I know our budgets have been slashed.
I know we're the underdog here.
But our strategy will be this:
No plea bargains.
That's right.
Defense attorneys will be expecting the opposite.
So for the next two months,
I want you to hold the line on every single plea.
After that, you won't have to work as hard.
Get your enemy flinching, you'll never have to hit him hard again.
Your first complaint will be about investigator hours.
That's why I've hired an outside contractor until we can budget full-time.
I want you to meet Sophia Russo.
- She's good, and she's cheap.
- Thanks.
Relatively.
Mr. Florrick.
I offered the defense six months on the college hate crime.
Should I walk it back?
What's the law say?
- Three to seven years.
- There's your answer.
The lawyer's Alicia, and she might come after your campaign contributions.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What do you want?
Follow the law.
You can't go wrong if you follow the law.
All right.
- Jeez, what a pit.
- Thank you.
You're working on the, uh...
The Jewish-Muslim thing, right?
Yeah.
The hate crime.
Why?
What do you need?
Oh, it's not what I need.
What is this?
You used to work with Kalinda Sharma, didn't you?
- Yeah.
- If I were you, I'd slip it to her.
So kind of odd not seeing you around much.
Yeah.
I've been busy.
Yeah.
And here I thought you didn't need me anymore.
What's that?
It's a peace offering.
Peter Florrick wants to run a clean office, so...
This is me being clean.
You're welcome.
You know, you can't make Chicagoans feel good about Islam with pathos.
You need to go positive.
Link the Arab Spring to the American Revolution.
Who is the Islamic George Washington?
Who is the Islamic Paul Revere?
Morning in the Middle East.
Islam turns...
- Do you need something?
- It's on your desk.
It's self-explanatory.
That's your car?
Good.
Now, I know you said you were at the library.
But the time code on that traffic light shows that the driver of your car was running a red light just outside the campus gates at the exact moment of the interfaith rally.
That means that the driver of your car, if that is you, couldn't have been involved in the rally fight.
- Do you understand?
- I do.
So I want you to take your time before you answer.
Is that you driving your car?
It is.
Are you certain, young man?
It's a very roundabout way to come from the library.
I'm sure.
We ask Mr. Mifsud state under oath that he was the driver in this photo which we will mark as People's Exhibit Number 1.
Your Honor, is that really necessary?
Only way we'll drop the hate charge.
Very well.
Mr. Mifsud, you are under oath.
Do you swear that that's you in the photo?
- Yes.
Good.
Well, I think that just about, uh, wraps it up.
Doesn't it, Mr. Agos?
I'm late for the gym.
It does, Your Honor, and the state has made a terrible mistake in charging Mr. Mifsud with this battery.
But this car with this license plate was seen racing away from the scene
- of the murder of Simon Greenberg.
- Objection!
That is why he ran the red light.
- Outrageous.
- He killed Simon Greenberg.
Prosecutorial misconduct!
His alibi means he committed this murder.
You overcharged him with a hate crime so he would grab at any alibi.
Your client perjured himself?
No, I am saying he took my advice, that's all.
Then congratulations, Alicia.
You just advised your client to admit to murder.
Your Honor, the people charge Jimal Mifsud with first degree murder.
Alicia dropped by for you.
- Why?
- I don't know.
You want me to get her?
No.
Later.
So this isn't you?
It's your car, but you're not driving it?
I'm sorry, I, uh...
I thought it was the easiest way out.
- So who is it?
Who's driving it?
I don't know.
Jimal, they have a witness who swears that that car, your car, was driven away by Simon Greenberg's killer.
- So don't cover for anyone.
I'm not covering.
My two roommates don't have a car,
I let Amir and Tariq use mine.
I just leave my keys in the room.
So which is driving it, Amir or Tariq?
I don't know.
But he swore that was him driving away?
He didn't know it would implicate him in a murder.
It's my fault.
I encouraged him to place himself in the car to give him alibi from the hate crime.
Yes.
Now, I have a multimillion-dollar client thinking that we're amateurs.
I got the pictures from the ASA's office.
- I should've checked.
- Great.
It's everybody's fault.
Now let's make it right.
I'm questioning Jimal's roommates.
One of them is the real driver.
And I'm filing a motion to dismiss Jimal's alibi statement during preliminary.
I don't know what's going on with you two, but make it better.
Whatever you have to do.
Make it better.
So are we supposed to do something?
- Sure.
What subject?
I don't know.
You're the tutor.
What does your mom want?
She wants me to get better grades, so that I'll get into Briarcrest.
- You don't like public school?
- No, I do.
It's just that there was a mugging on the field, and all the parents got really scared.
Is this your first job tutoring?
Yeah, heh.
- How am I doing?
- Not so good.
Darn.
Can we go outside?
Yeah, I think it's up to you.
Cary, the man!
Throwing down that opposition.
Nicely played.
Thanks.
So this is the new Cary?
No, just a new day.
So can I see the crime-scene photos, Cary?
Well, come on, you're in the big leagues now.
What can it hurt?
- I'll think about it.
Oh.
- Well, lookie who's here.
Sophia?
In the flesh.
Strange bedfellows, huh?
The strangest.
Well...
You two have a nice time.
What'd she want?
Crime-scene photos.
Damn it.
Okay, uh, Simon Greenberg, 22, found in his dorm room gagged, hands bound, stabbed 45 times.
- Little overkill?
Yep.
Police think it was an execution.
No sign of a struggle.
- Witnesses?
Neighbor heard a scream, looked out his window and saw a dark, possibly black Middle Eastern man running to his car.
They got a number plate, ET27.
Damn.
That's not a partial plate.
Yeah, I know.
Jimal's plate.
Um, one other thing.
Something that wasn't released to the press.
- What?
- Killer drew a swastika
- with the victim's blood.
- Ugh.
Yep.
I know this is not looking good, is it?
Okay.
Um, let me know what you get from the roommates.
Got it.
Oh, by the way, the swastika, the police don't know why, but it was drawn backwards.
Okay.
Hi.
Am I interrupting?
Nope.
How are you?
Good.
Do you have a moment to talk?
About last night?
Yeah.
Don't act like this is nothing, Eli.
You're running a pro-Palestinian campaign.
It's an anti-Muslim bigotry campaign, and I am a crisis...
You are a Jew.
- We are both...
- Oh, come on, Michael.
What is this?
Ultimate Frisbee?
We only win by making them lose?
Yes.
You act like you're not paying attention, but I know you're paying attention.
This is a PR war.
And I'm a traitor?
In February, Israeli soldiers helped a Palestinian woman give birth.
You didn't read about it unless you subscribed to the Israel National News.
Two days later, an Israeli woman gave birth in a Palestinian hospital.
Where did you read it?
AP, CBS News, every major paper.
Google it, go ahead.
This is a PR war and they are winning.
Michael.
I do not go to your house and tell you what novels to write.
I do not go to your committee and tell you what lobbyists to hire.
Oh.
That's it.
Now I get it.
I didn't hire you.
There it is.
I hired Tarkovsky and Associates.
With a $20-million Jewish League Fund to fight intolerance?
Yes, you did.
So this isn't Israel-Palestine to you.
It's Gold versus Tarkovsky.
You're paying a competitor, Michael.
And as moved as I am by your plea for Jewish brotherhood,
I'm not that moved.
Four thousand years and we are always our own worst enemy.
So you were driving Jimal's car that night, right?
This is just like the cops.
Racist.
They think an Arab had to do it.
Yeah, but this is you, isn't it, Amir?
Driving your roommate's car that night, right?
No.
And do you know why it's not me?
Look at your time code, lady.
I was in my living room.
For salah.
- Evening prayers.
- Anybody else see you there?
Yes.
- Who?
The prophet Muhammad.
Peace be upon him.
Yeah, Amir's in the living room five times a day praying.
Okay, Tariq.
Did you see him praying on the night of the murder?
- No.
- So you were home?
You were home to be able to not see him there?
No, I was out.
In Jimal's car?
No, I wanted to take it, but the keys were gone already.
- So where were you?
- I was here.
- In the quad at the interfaith rally.
- Hmm.
Sophia.
Kalinda.
Hi.
I didn't see you over there.
This is how you investigate these days?
By just following me?
Yep.
Makes things a lot easier.
So you and Cary, huh?
That's why you've been ignoring me, right?
It's not because I'm married.
Yep.
You got me.
Listen, I'm gonna go and question eyewitnesses at the Jewish frat.
Do you want the address?
Where's the fun in that?
Your Honor, this is...
- This is prosecutorial misconduct.
Okay, okay.
This is absolutely unethical.
All right.
To your corners.
Mrs. Florrick, your client already swore that that was him in the car.
Is he now trying to say he lied?
He's saying he was misled by the prosecution.
- How did I mislead?
Jimal was given an opportunity to avoid a hate-crime prosecution and he took it, that's all.
This murder charge is based on nothing else.
There's no evidence that Jimal and the victim even knew each other.
Where's the motive?
Mr. Greenberg was Jewish and Jimal was Muslim.
As you can see, a swastika was drawn on the victim's...
Oh, come on.
Anti-Semitism isn't some cookie-cutter motive
- you can apply to any dark-skinned...
- Counselors, listen.
Nobody likes a street fight better than me, but that's for in the street, not here.
Mr. Agos, do you have any further probable cause?
Because if it's just that statement, I am prone to overturn.
We do, Your Honor.
Professor Noah Fineman.
I teach Political Science.
And did the accused show a particular interest
- in one of your lectures?
- He did.
Uh, it's a lecture that I give on the anniversary of 9/11 about chickens who come home to roost for the United States and Zionist regime in Israel.
Objection.
Your Honor, is Mr. Agos really trying to find a motive in Jimal's classes?
Why not Home Ec?
Maybe that's where
- Heh.
- The knife came from.
Overruled.
I think we can stand a bit of rough-and-tumble here, counselor.
So, professor, you would argue that Israel's a criminal regime?
Oh, I don't argue it.
I think that's fairly self-evident.
Given this, what do you think of suicide bombings and the death of Jewish citizens?
If you're asking me if I approve of such a thing?
No, never.
But I do understand them.
These are understandable movements against a Zionist oppression.
And how did your student Jimal take an added interest in this lecture?
Well, he was, uh, very engaged in class, yes.
And afterwards, he approached me to ask me questions about my newest book:
Zionist Occupation
- The Need for Realignment and New Thinking.
Borderday Press.
Thank you, professor.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Actually, professor, I have a few questions.
My client was very engaged in your lecture, you said?
How did you witness this?
Well, if you teach students long enough, you get a sense.
And for how long did you teach Jimal?
Well, it's been four weeks since the beginning of the semester.
So, uh, four weeks, that's, uh, 20 sessions.
And for how many of those sessions were you actually present?
I don't understand.
How many of those 20 sessions were you actually there teaching and not having one of your TAs do it?
Uh...
Didn't you only lecture the class twice, professor?
Well, I would question your use of the word "only."
But, uh...
Yes.
And yet you really focused with your laser-like perception on Jimal and his engagement.
- You're being a bit rude.
Yes.
And I'm just getting started.
So after one of your lectures,
Jimal came to you to ask you about your book.
How do you know this?
Because I keep a record next to my attendance.
See?
That asterisk tells me that I must send them an e-mail
- about my book.
- And, of course, you recognize Jimal,
- over there?
Oh, yes.
This record attendance, the students sign themselves in, yes?
- Yes, it's a very efficient way to work.
I'm sure.
- Do you see Jimal's name there?
- It's in here.
- That's not his handwriting.
Objection.
That's the handwriting of his roommate, Tariq, also a student in your class who signed him in so that Jimal could cut class.
Well, I'd say things have been pretty easy for you up until now.
Really?
How's that?
In court, these people don't really know how you think.
But you do?
Hate to tell you this, but we're gonna beat you.
Good luck with that.
"Battle M. E:
Gaza Strip" It's one of my best MMOGs.
And what is an MMOG?
Massive multiplayer online game.
Meaning people log onto their computers
- and battle each other.
Yep.
What are we looking at now?
Uh, well, that's the recorded actions of Samson 5.
That's the avatar of the accused, Jimal...
Objection.
Your Honor, what does this have to do with the death of Simon Greenberg?
- Goes to motive.
- What is that assault weapon there?
- Is that an Uzi?
- No.
It's a Galil 5.56.
What's the range?
Four hundred and fifty meters.
Cool.
Proceed.
Well, that's Jimal's avatar there.
The guy running.
And what is he wearing?
Oh, that?
That's a suicide vest.
He's wearing a suicide vest?
And what is he entering?
That's a civilian Israeli building.
That's a school, in fact...
Your Honor, this is a game.
Mr. Al-Said was just here.
He wants us to pull out of Jimal's defense.
He is afraid defending a youth who makes light of a suicide bombing will undercut Eli's pro-Muslim campaign.
He wasn't making light of it.
He was playing a video game.
In which he killed a schoolhouse full of kids.
Yes, but in a video game.
Have you seen video games lately?
We can't abandon Jimal.
He was looking at misdemeanor battery.
We helped him into a murder charge.
We?
I helped him into a murder charge, which I did as a representative of this firm.
- We made a commitment to him.
- What do you think?
I think your friend will pull out of Eli's campaign and go right back to his old firm with his $10 million.
Yeah.
Still, retail rules.
We broke it, we own it?
Okay.
We'll stick with Jimal.
Win this one.
- No.
- No what?
No, Mr. Al-Said?
I'm coming here as a courtesy.
I don't need your campaign anymore.
I'm taking my business back to my old firm.
Oh, that's too bad because I already cashed your check.
You did not.
I did.
You know us Jews.
- Heh, you'd do anything to piss me off.
You're right.
But I still have a great pro-Muslim campaign for you.
Good doing business with you.
Did you hear the one about the Arab and the Jew?
No.
But I'm sure it's very funny.
An Arab and a Jew walk into a bar.
And then they kill each other.
"Energy is radiated and absorbed in quanta, matched to?"
Patterns of black body radiation.
You know that's bad for you?
Uh-huh.
It's like the equivalent of three buckets of popcorn.
But I don't want three buckets of popcorn.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
Okay, I need your help.
Don't shake the camera.
Just keep it steady.
- What are you doing?
- Look at the color.
It's Bollywood.
You can't pass up Bollywood.
Do you know them?
No.
It's chance.
I do this all the time.
Grace, camera up.
What are you doing?
Good to have you back, Mr. Sartori.
Yeah.
So tell me, what is a power-up?
Sorry, this is the only place in the world where I have to explain a power-up.
Um, in a video game, it's something that you collect to give you extra power.
Like a gun.
Or, you know, ammunition.
So would anyone ever pass up a power-up?
No.
Not unless you're crazy.
You never know when you'll run out of ammunition.
So this suicide vest that Jimal's avatar is wearing, what is that?
It's a power-up.
And everybody who plays your game grabs one?
At one point or another.
In fact, according to your own logs, many ASAs in Mr. Agos' office...
- Objection.
Overruled.
Many ASAs in Mr. Agos' office have collected such suicide packs?
Yeah.
It's a part of the game.
It's not a thing.
But doesn't that mean these ASAs are more likely to have murdered Simon Greenberg?
- Heh, Your Honor.
- Psst.
Mrs. Florrick?
Mrs. Florrick, any further questions?
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Sartori, Jimal's roommate, Amir Al-Fulan,
- he played your online game too?
- I have no idea.
This is a record of your subpoenaed logs.
- Can you read that there?
Oh, yeah.
And you had to reduce his privileges because he fought with another player, didn't he?
Yeah, he, uh, got in a fight online.
Uh, on the "Battle M.E." board.
And who did he fight with?
Can you read that there?
You had to reduce both their privileges.
Simon Greenberg.
Thank you.
Jimal's roommate, Amir, is the most likely suspect.
But he has an alibi.
Praying.
Yes, but he was alone.
What about the other roommate?
Tariq.
We can't find any contact between Tariq and the victim.
And he doesn't have the political motive.
Amir is the Palestinian hardliner.
Tariq could care less.
Okay.
Thank you, Alicia.
Uh, keep us in touch.
What do you think?
I think you're holding something against her.
- I'm what?
- Alicia.
Maybe it's unconscious, maybe it's not, but you're being hard on her.
No.
She's a third-year associate on a partner track, and she's treating us like peers.
That's all you're seeing.
My God, am I the only adult left here?
Could everybody just put their emotions away?
I gotta get to a meeting unless you have some other stray observations for me.
Are we overdoing it?
Diane thinks I'm going too hard on you.
Am I?
Going too hard?
All those late nights.
No time off.
Buried in work.
- Up to my knees.
Mm-hm.
He's doing it again, Mom!
He's doing it again!
It's just my neighbors.
Just give it to me already.
- Come on, let's go to the bedroom.
- No, no, no.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Mom!
Tell him to give it to me.
Mom!
Leg is done, the chops are ready to go.
I'm just warming up the leg of lamb piece after it's been reposing for ten or 15 minutes just to...
We need to eat better.
I like what we eat.
No, I need to cook.
You're happier without Dad.
No, I'm happier with you.
Okay, that was such a mom thing to say.
No, it's about Dad.
Does that upset you?
No.
I don't know.
You know I love Dad.
I know.
I'm sorry.
No.
I found you a new tutor.
Dana.
I think you'll like her, she's social.
Actually, I think I like this one now.
You...
I thought you said she was too different.
She is, heh.
But sometimes different isn't always bad.
She's coming over to help me set up my computer tomorrow.
- What?
- She's setting up your computer?
I asked her to.
Please tell me you're learning something, that this isn't all pointless.
I'm learning something.
So how do you explain that, Amir?
I don't explain it.
You said you didn't know the victim, Simon Greenberg, and here you are on a video game fighting with him.
I don't need to talk to you.
You got no authority here.
Hey, you wanna make yourself useful in here?
I just got the authority.
He claims it wasn't him.
It wasn't him what?
Fighting against Greenberg?
On the video game.
Amir says it was Tariq.
He let him use his screen name.
These roommates, they share everything.
So I'm checking Tariq, but we're back to square one.
Amir had a motive:
Politics, fanaticism.
Tariq isn't political or religious.
I wonder if we're making a mistake thinking it's about Middle Eastern politics.
These kids, they're just college kids.
All rise.
Okay, I'll keep checking, but I'll need some time.
Judge Karpman presiding.
Thank you.
Please be seated.
So this is where we stand.
There is sufficient evidence for a finding of probable cause.
Further, we set this case on my trial...
Your Honor, we ask that you recuse yourself.
- Excuse me?
We believe you have shown bias against our client.
Believe?
Really?
In what way?
Your religion.
This is outrageous.
I'm...
My Jewish background is completely irrelevant in this case.
Your Honor, you have given money to the Outlook for Israel, an organization that supports the settlements in Israel.
We believe you have shown bias against our client, and we ask that a new judge hear further proceedings.
I'll give you my answer in an hour.
- He's not gonna recuse himself.
- He will.
Karpman always backs down when he's pushed.
He's afraid he'll be overturned on appeal.
- So we start over with a new judge.
- No.
I know what Alicia's doing.
Oh, hi, Michael.
How are you?
I was just sitting here going over this campaign.
Arab Spring.
Sort of like Irish Spring.
But with Arabs.
- Do you want some coffee?
- How much?
For the coffee?
How much for six months if I brought the Jewish League Fund here?
How much are you paying Tarkovsky and Associates?
You know how much.
Well, of course, we would have to tell Mr. Al-Said we can't handle his account anymore, so if you'd help us defer those costs...
You're really a son of a bitch.
I am.
But now I'm your son of a bitch.
All rise.
Judge Karpman presiding.
Please be seated.
I've taken a great deal of time with this motion because I believe that part of being a tough judge is also being a fair judge.
Your Honor, may I quickly interrupt?
Can't imagine why, counselor.
I'm ready to rule.
Yes, but, I believe Mrs. Florrick is attempting to manipulate this court.
Excuse me!
If you recuse yourself, the court will choose a new judge tomorrow?
- Is that correct?
- Yes, it is.
- You were about to make your ruling?
- That's what she's counting on.
You know what tomorrow is, Your Honor?
- What tomorrow is?
The holiday.
That has nothing to do with my motion.
It's Rosh Hashanah.
There will be no Jewish judges in court, the case will be assigned to a non-Jewish judge.
Why she's asking you to recuse yourself.
Your Honor, this is offensive!
Mrs. Florrick,
I am disappointed in you.
The motion is denied.
Case remains on my trial call.
Hi, Tariq.
How are you?
So, what, are you following me?
No.
I'm following her.
Hey, Tariq.
You know, if you're looking for a more discreet gay bar,
- I'd try Scarlet's on Halsted.
No.
I'd try Sidetrack.
- It's too leathery.
- What do you need?
You used Amir's avatar on "Battle M.E.,"
- the online video game.
- So?
So that's where you met Simon Greenberg.
- No.
- Yeah.
Actually, yeah.
Checked your alibi.
Didn't hold up, Tariq.
You weren't at the interfaith rally.
Why would I kill Greenberg?
It makes no sense.
We spoke to the bartender.
He said you met Greenberg here quite a few times.
My guess is you two fell in love.
You argued, he met someone else.
You got jealous.
You stabbed him.
Made it look like a hate crime.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't!
Why the reversed swastika?
What?
- When you set it up as a hate crime, why draw the swastika backward?
What do you mean?
Isn't that how you draw it?
Is it good for the Jewish League Fund?
I don't know.
The Muslim was the killer, but he was also gay, and sleeping with our guy, so, uh...
I would call that a classic mixed message.
Crisis management.
If it helps, I could find out if he's a top.
That was a joke.
Yeah.
Okay, I gotta go.
Important work?
ELl:
Fate of the world.
- What do you think?
- It's very flattering, Eli.
But I can't be thinking about the governorship when I'm doing this job.
So do this job.
Let me think about the governorship.
Just an observation from work:
If you're worried about Alicia and Will Gardner...
I'm not worried.
I know.
I know, but, uh, if you were,
I think that whatever was there is no more.
They barely look at each other.
Eli.
You don't want a divorced candidate, do you?
No, I...
Forget it.
You need a friend, K.
Why do I need a friend?
Or a dog.
Maybe you need a dog.
Kalinda and pooch.
- Out investigating.
- Heh.
I'm fine, Will.
Really.
I mean, what's wrong with me?
We're not like normal people, are we?
What are normal people like?
Emotional.
- You're emotional.
- No.
Sometimes I'm in the middle of an emotion, and I just look at myself and realize
I'm not feeling anything.
I just like acting like someone who feels something.
You wanna stop acting and actually feel?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ow.
That's what it feels like.
- Thanks.
- Heh.
All right, I gotta go.
I gotta be somewhere at 8:45.
Really?
That specific.
Yup.
Be good.
I'll get them to school on Monday.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Do we take our homework?
Yes.
- So you've hired a tutor for Grace?
Yes, I did.
She's good, I think, and Grace likes her.
Or she likes her now.
I'll keep an eye on that.
Oh, um, also, Zach's girlfriend, Nisa, her parents wanted us to come for dinner.
I'll tell her you're busy.
Yeah, yeah.
Tell her I'm busy.
- Love you.
- Love you.
- Love you.
- I love you.
You call if you need anything.
I'll be here.

It was e-mailed to campus inboxes.
Do you know who sent it?
My guess is Tau Kappa Theta, the Jewish fraternity.

- No, of course not.
MAN:
I just think it was this video that provoked the fight
- at the interfaith rally.
- And you want us to defend...?
Jimal Mifsud.
Scholarship student in Science.
His family is in Jiddah, and he can't afford a lawyer.
Do you know his family?
No, I am purely an interested bystander here who wants to see justice done.
Purely?
There's a campus fistfight between a dozen Palestinian and Jewish youths, and the State's Attorney only charges one Palestinian?
Well, he doesn't have a record, so it should be a simple misdemeanor battery.
Court supervision, at most.
No, the new State's Attorney wants to appear tough on his first day.
It was deemed a hate crime.
Seven years.
Alicia, meet Wasim Al-Said, an old friend who until recently retained our competitor Young, Bachman and Meyers
- for his legal interest.
- To my eternal regret.
- Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
- Alicia's fine.
Your husband was very good to the Muslim community in his first term.
My fear is, that's changed.
Of course, Alicia can't influence her husband in any way, but she is still one of our best lawyers.
Well, that's all Jimal needs.
This is a good kid they're painting as a suicide bomber.
Bond hearing's today.
I'll be there.
Good, that's one piece of business.
What else might we handle that Young, Bachman and Meyers can't?
I know that Eli Gold is working with you these days?
I'm in need of some crisis management.
- What's the crisis?
- Where's the management?
Will you get, uh, Eli for us?
And ask Will to step in.
Will?
Sure.
ASSISTANT:
He's late.
Overslept.
Must be from celebrating yesterday's victory.
- Must be.
GRACE:
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Hey, Mom, pick up...
Hello, dearest daughter.
You sound happy.
I am happy.
I have my daughter on the phone.
What more could I desire?
Look, I don't think I need a tutor.
Grace, we discussed this.
It's just a month.
- Yeah, but it was one report card.
- And it's one month.
Dad just thinks I need to apply myself.
Oh, I agree, and a tutor will help you do that.
Eli?
The meeting.
Mom, Nisa's parents want you to come over for dinner.
- You and Dad.
Both of you.
- Why?
Just to be nice.
I didn't tell them anything.
It was like you said:
I haven't let anyone know you guys are separated.
Hey!
Okay, I'll talk to your father about it.
I-I've got to go.
So, who is this guy again?
Wasim Al-Said.
He's a commodities trader.
Wasim?
Diane's been trying to sign him for two years.
He has ten million in charitable assets to spend.
On what?
A campaign against anti-Muslim bigotry.
Mr. Al-Said, you do know that I'm not a PR specialist.
I handle lobbying and crisis management.
Do you watch the evening news, Eli?
Religiously.
Then you know there was a murder of a Jewish poli sci major at Chicago Polytech last night.
Unsolved, but the police are questioning Muslim students.
Ten minutes later, a riot broke out at the other end of campus at a rally intended to encourage interfaith dialogue, and only one Muslim was arrested.
Now I'm used to reading the tea leaves in this country, and the best way to manage a crisis is before it becomes one.
Isn't that true?
It is.
So, are you hiring me because I'm good or because I'm Jewish?
Because I imagine it might look quite good having a Jew campaign for Muslims.
Can't it be both?
- I don't like being used.
- Really?
Since when?
He knows Jewish money is going to Peter for his next campaign
- and he wants to buy influence.
- And...?
Don't you get so knowing on me.
What's up with you, anyway?
You seem different.
(scoffs)
Where you going?
- Court.
- Why?
I'm a lawyer.
Okay, glad we cleared that up.
This is a hate crime, Your Honor, and we ask that bail be set at $100,000.
Have you ever been in a fistfight, Counselor?
Have I, Your Honor?
Uh, no.
Well, let me educate you.
It's chaos, chaos in there.
No one can tell who hits who.
Fists are flying, you get hit in the head.
The next thing you know, you're on the ground and somebody's jumping...
- Jimal, I'm sorry to be late.
I was...
CARY:
Jimal assaulted someone because he was Jewish.
That is not chaos, Your Honor.
And Jimal was hit because he's Palestinian, Your Honor.
Alicia Florrick, Your Honor.
20 students were fighting.
Only one was charged.
One Muslim.
- His religion had nothing to...
- It had everything to do with it.
JUDGE:
All right, okay, your passion is preserved for the record.
Bond is set at $5,000.
And I do suggest that the State reconsider its charge.
Thank you, Your Honor.
(gavel pounds)
Jimal, I was just put in on this.
You have a benefactor who asked me to step in.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I know, a lot of this is posturing by the prosecution to get you to accept a higher plea.
The good news is, the judge is on your side.
Now, do you want me to call your parents or anything?
No, no they wouldn't...
Look, I'm ashamed.
I understand.
Hopefully, we can handle this
- by admitting simple battery.
- But I didn't.
I wasn't even there.
He wasn't at the rally, Cary.
He was at the library.
Oh, my God, really?
That's terrible.
This isn't about Jimal, and this isn't about some stupid fistfight.
This is about that Jewish kid stabbed to death, and you can't find the killer so Jimal is the scapegoat.
We have an eyewitness who saw Jimal throw the first punch.
- That's what this is about.
- Is the eyewitness Caucasian?
(laughs)
Oh, wow, how quickly we slip the bonds of political correctness.
- Why not ask if he's Jewish?
- Cross-racial identification.
Caucasians have difficulty discerning unique characteristics.
Six months in County, one year probation.
No.
Then I'll see you in court.
Tell Peter there has to be a better way to firm up his campaign contributions.
Using everything we can, are we?
PETER:
It's a new day.
We're running a clean office.
Let me say that again, because we're all prone to the same cynicism.
We... are running a clean office.
Clean, ethical, honest, but not weak.
I know our budgets have been slashed.
I know we're the underdog here.
But our strategy will be this:
no plea bargains.
That's right.
Defense attorneys will be expecting the opposite.
So for the next two months,
I want you to hold the line on every single plea.
After that, you won't have to work as hard.
You get your enemy flinching, you'll never have to hit him hard again.
Your first complaint will be about investigator hours.
That's why I've hired an outside contractor until we can budget full time.
I want you to meet Sophia Russo.
She's good, and she's cheap.
Thanks!
Relatively.
Mr. Florrick, I offered the defense six months on the college hate crime.
Should I walk it back?
What's the law say?
Three to seven years.
There's your answer.
The lawyer's Alicia, and she might come after your campaign contributions.
Really?
Yeah.
What do you want?
Follow the law.
You can't go wrong if you follow the law.
All right.
Geez, what a pit.
- Thank you.
- You're working on the, uh, the Jewish-Muslim thing, right?
Yeah, the hate crime.
Why?
What do you need?
Oh, it's not what I need.
What is this?
You used to work with Kalinda Sharma, didn't you?
Yeah.
If I were you, I'd slip it to her.
♪ ♪
So, kind of odd not seeing you around much.
Yeah, I've been busy.
Yeah.
And here I thought you didn't need me anymore.
(chuckles)
What's that?
It's a peace offering.
Peter Florrick wants to run a clean office, so... this is me being clean.
You're welcome.

But the time code on that traffic light shows that the driver of your car was running a red light just outside the campus gates at the exact moment of the interfaith rally.
That means that the driver of your car, if that is you, couldn't have been involved in the rally fight.
Do you understand?
I do.
So, I want you to take your time before you answer.
Is that you driving your car?
It is.
Are you certain, young man?
It's a very roundabout way to come from the library.
I'm sure.
CARY:
We ask that Mr. Mifsud state under oath that he was the driver in this photo which we will mark as People's Exhibit #1.
Your Honor, is that really necessary?
CARY:
It's the only way we'll drop the hate charge.
Very well.
Mr. Mifsud, you are under oath.
Do you swear that that's you in the photo?
Yes.
JUDGE:
Good.
Well, I think that just about, uh, wraps it up, doesn't it, Mr. Agos?
I'm late for the gym.
It does, Your Honor, and the State has made a terrible mistake in charging Mr. Mifsud with this battery, But this car with this license plate was seen racing away from the scene
- of the frat murder of Simon Greenberg...
- Objection, Your Honor!
- That is why he ran the red light.
- Oh, this is outrageous.
- He had just killed Simon Greenberg.
- This is prosecutorial misconduct!
He swore to it.
His alibi means he committed this murder.
Because you overcharged him with a hate crime so he would grab at any alibi.
So you're saying your client perjured himself?
No, I am saying he took my advice, that's all.
Well, then congratulations, Alicia.
You just advised your client to admit to murder.
Your Honor, the People charge Jimal Mifsud with first-degree murder.
The Good Wife S03E01 "A New Day" Original Air Date September 25, 2011
(elevator bell dings)
Alicia dropped by for you.
Why?
I don't know.
You want me to get her?
No.
Later.
KALINDA:
So this isn't you?
It's your car, but you're not driving it?
I'm sorry, I, uh, I thought it was the easiest way out.
So who is it?
Who's driving it?
I don't know.
Jimal, they have a witness who swears that that car-- your car-- was driven away by Simon Greenberg's killer.
So don't cover for anyone.
I'm not covering.
My-my two roommates don't have a car,
I let Amir and Tariq use mine.
I just leave my keys in the room.
So which is driving it, Amir or Tariq?
I don't know.
But he swore that was him driving away from the murder?
He didn't know it would implicate him in a murder.
It's my fault.
I encouraged him to place himself in the car to give him an alibi from the hate crime.
Yes.
And now I have a multimillion-dollar client thinking that we're amateurs.
I got the pictures from the ASA's office.
- I should've checked.
- Great.
It's everybody's fault.
Now let's make it right.
I'm questioning Jimal's roommates.
One of them is the real driver.
And I'm filing a motion to dismiss
Jimal's alibi statement during preliminary.
I don't know what's going on with you two, but make it better.
Whatever you have to do.
Make it better.
So are we supposed to do something?
Sure.
- What subject?
- I don't know.
You're the tutor.
What does your mom want?
She wants me to get better grades, so that I'll get into Briarcrest.
You don't like public school?
No, I do.
It's just that there was a mugging on the field, and all the parents got really scared.
Is this your first job tutoring?
Yeah.
(chuckles)
How am I doing?
Not so good.
Darn.
Can we go outside?
Yeah, I think it's up to you.
MAN:
Cary the man!
Throwing down that opposition.
(chuckles)
Nicely played.
Thanks.
So this is the new Cary?
No, just a new day.
So can I see the crime scene photos, Cary?
Well, come on.
You're in the big leagues now.
What can it hurt?
I'll think about it.
SOPHIA:
Oh.
Well, looky who's here.
Sophia?
In the flesh.
Strange bedfellows, huh?
The strangest.
Well... you two have a nice time.
(chuckles)
What'd she want?
(sighs):
Oh.
Crime scene photos.
Damn it.
Okay, uh, Simon Greenberg, 22, found in his dorm room gagged, hands bound, stabbed 45 times.
- Little overkill?
- Yep.
Police think it was an execution.
No sign of a struggle.
Any witnesses?
Neighbor heard a scream, looked out his window and saw a dark, possibly black Middle Eastern man running to his car.
They got a number plate-
- ET27.
Damn.
That's not a partial plate.
Yeah, I know.
Jimal's plate.
Um, one other thing.
Something that wasn't released to the press.
What?
Killer drew a swastika with the victim's blood.
Ugh.
Yep.
I know this is not looking good, is it?
Okay, um, let me know what you get from the roommates.
Got it.
Oh, by the way, the swastika-- the police don't know why, but it was drawn backwards.
Okay.
Hi.
Am I interrupting?
Nope.
How are you?
Good.
Do you have a moment to talk?
About last night?
Yeah.
Don't act like this is nothing, Eli.
You're running a pro-Palestinian campaign.
It's an anti-
Muslim-bigotry campaign, and I am a crisis man...
You are a Jew.
- We are both...
- Oh, come on, Michael!
What is this?
Ultimate Frisbee?
We only win by making them lose?
Yes.
You act like you're not paying attention, but I know you're paying attention.
This is a PR war.
And I'm a traitor?
In February, Israeli soldiers helped a Palestinian woman give birth.
You didn't read about it unless you subscribed to the Israel National News.
Two days later, an Israeli woman gave birth in a Palestinian hospital.
Where did you read it?
AP, CBS News, every major paper.
Google it.
Go ahead.
This is a PR war and they are winning.
Michael.
I do not go to your house and tell you what novels to write.
I do not go to your committee and tell you what lobbyists to hire.
(gasps)
Oh.
That's it.
(chuckles):
Now I get it.
I didn't hire you.
There it is.
I hired Tarkovsky Associates.
With a $20 million Jewish League Fund to fight intolerance.
Yes, you did.
So this isn't Israel/Palestine to you.
It's Gold versus Tarkovsky.
You're paying a competitor, Michael.
And as moved as I am by your plea for
Jewish brotherhood,
I'm not that moved.
4,000 years and we are always our own worst enemy.
So you were driving Jimal's car that night, right?
This is just like the cops.
Racist.
They think an Arab had to do it.
Yeah, but this is you, isn't it, Amir?
You were driving your roommate's car that night, right?
No.
And you know why it's not me?
Look at your time code, lady.
I was in my living room for salah.
Evening prayers.
Anybody else see you there?
- Yes.
- Who?
The Prophet Muhammad.
Peace be upon him.
Yeah, Amir's in the living room five times a day praying.
Okay, Tariq.
Did you see him praying on the night of the murder?
- No.
- So you were home?
You were home to be able to not see him there?
No, I was out.
In Jimal's car?
No, I wanted to take it, but the keys were gone already.
So where were you?
I was here.
In the quad at the interfaith rally.
Sophia.
Kalinda.
Hi.
I didn't see you over there.
This is how you investigate these days?
- By just following me?
- Yep.
Makes things a lot easier.
So you and Cary, huh?
That's why you've been ignoring me, right?
It's not because I'm married.
Yep.
You got me.
Listen, I'm gonna go and question eyewitnesses at the Jewish frat.
Do you want the address?
Where's the fun in that?
ALICIA:
Your Honor, this is... (lawyers shouting)
- This is prosecutorial misconduct.
- Okay, okay, okay.
This is absolutely unethical.
All right, all right.
Each to your corners.
Mrs. Florrick, your client already swore that that was him in the car.
Is he now trying to say that he lied?
He's saying that he was misled by the prosecution.
How did I mislead?
Jimal was given an opportunity to avoid a hate crime prosecution and he took it, that's all.
This murder charge is based on nothing else.
There's no evidence that
Jimal and the victim even knew each other.
Where's the motive?
Mr. Greenberg was Jewish and Jimal was Muslim, and as you can see here, Your Honor, a swastika was drawn on the victim's...
ALICIA:
Oh, come on.
Anti-Semitism isn't some cookie cutter motive you can apply
- to any dark-skinned...
- All right, counselors, listen.
Nobody likes a street fight better than me, but that's for in the street, not here.
Mr. Agos, do you have any further probable cause?
Because if it's just that statement,
I am prone to overturn.
We do, Your Honor.
FINEMAN:
Professor Noah Fineman.
I teach political science.
And did the accused show a particular interest in one of your lectures?
He did.
It's a lecture that I give on the anniversary of 9/11 about chickens who come home to roost for the United States and Zionist regime in Israel...
Objection.
Your Honor, is Mr. Agos really trying to find a motive in Jimal's classes?
Why not home ec?
- Maybe that's where the knife came from.
JUDGE:
Overruled.
I think we can stand a bit of rough and tumble here, Counselor.
So, Professor, you would argue that Israel's a criminal regime.
Oh, I-I don't argue it.
I think that's fairly self-evident.
Given this, what do you think of suicide bombings and the death of Jewish citizens?
FINEMAN:
If you're asking me if I approve of such a thing, no, never.
But I do understand them.
These are understandable movements against a Zionist oppression.
And how did your student Jimal take an added interest in this lecture?
Well, he was, uh, very engaged in class, yes.
And afterwards, he approached me to ask me questions about my newest book,
Zionist Occupation:
the Need for Realignment and New Thinking.
Bordinay Press.
Thank you, Professor.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Actually, Professor,
I have a few questions.
My client was very engaged in your lecture, you said?
How did you witness this?
Well, if you teach students long enough, you get a sense.
And for how long did you teach Jimal?
Well, it's been four weeks since the beginning of the semester.
So four weeks, that's, uh, 20 sessions.
And for how many of those sessions were you actually present?
I don't understand.
How many of those 20 sessions were you actually there teaching and not having one of your TA's do it?
- Uh...
- Didn't you only lecture the class twice, Professor?
Well, I would question your use of the word "only,"
but, uh... yes.
And yet you really focused with your laser-like perception on Jimal and his engagement.
You're being a bit rude.
Yes, and I'm just getting started.
So, after one of your lectures,
Jimal came to you to ask you about your book.
How do you know this?
Because I keep a record next to my attendance.
See?
That asterisk tells me that I must send them an e-mail about my book.
And, of course, you recognize Jimal, over there?
Oh, yes.
This record attendance, the students sign themselves in, yes?
Yes, it's a very efficient way to work.
I'm sure.
Do you see Jimal's name there?
It's him there.
- That's not his handwriting.
CARY:
Objection.
That's the handwriting of his roommate,
Tariq, also a student in your class who signed him in so that Jimal could cut class.
Well, I'd say things have been pretty easy for you up until now.
Really?
How's that?
In court, these people don't really know how you think.
But you do?
Hate to tell you this but we're going to beat you.
(chuckles softly)
Good luck with that.

- Yep.
What are we looking at now?
Uh, well, that's the recorded actions of Sampson5.
That's the avatar of the accused, Jimal...
ALICIA:
Objection.
Your Honor, what does this have to do with the death of Simon Greenberg?
Goes to motive, Your Honor.
What is that assault weapon over there, is that an uzi?
No, it's a Galil 5.56.
JUDGE:
What's the range of fire?
450 meters.
Cool.
Proceed.
Well, that's Jimal's avatar there.
The guy running.
And what is he wearing?
Oh, that?
That's a suicide vest.
(man shouting in foreign language on video game)
(gunfire and explosions continue)
He's wearing a suicide vest?
And what is he entering?
That's a civilian Israeli building.
That's a school, in fact...
Your Honor, this is a game.
(explosion)
(gunfire and explosions continue)
Mr. Al-Said was just here.
He wants us to pull out of Jimal's defense.
He is afraid defending a youth who makes light of a suicide bombing will undercut Eli's pro-Muslim campaign.
He wasn't making light of it.
He was playing a video game.
In which he killed a schoolhouse full of kids.
Yes, but in a video game.
Have you seen video games lately?
We can't abandon Jimal.
He was looking at misdemeanor battery.
We helped him into a murder charge.
"We"?
I... helped him into a murder charge, which I did as a representative of this firm.
We made a commitment to him.
What do you think?
I think your friend will pull out of Eli's campaign and go right back to his old firm with his $10 million.
Yeah.
Still, retail rules.
We broke it, we own it?
Okay, we'll stick with Jimal.
Win this one.
No.
No, what?
No, Mr. Al-Said.
(chuckles)
I'm coming here as a courtesy.
I don't need your campaign anymore.
I'm taking my business back to my old firm.
Oh, that's too bad because I already cashed your check.
You did not.
I did.
You know us Jews.
You'd do anything to piss me off.
You're right.
But I have still got a great pro-Muslim campaign for you.
(laughs softly)
Good doing business with you.
Did you hear the one about the Arab and the Jew?
No.
But I'm sure it's very funny.
An Arab and a Jew walk into a bar.
And then they kill each other.
Energy is radiated and absorbed in quanta, matched to...?
Patterns of black body radiation.
You know that's bad for you?
Uh-huh.
It's like the equivalent of three buckets of popcorn.
But I don't want three buckets of popcorn.
(door hisses open)
Oh, my God.
What?
(low, indistinct chatter)
Okay, I need your help.
(music playing)
Don't shake the camera.
Just keep it steady.
What are you doing?
Look at the color.
It's Bollywood.
You can't pass up Bollywood.

No.
It's chance.

Good to have you back, Mr. Sartori.
Yeah.
So tell me, what is a power-up?
(chuckles)
Sorry, this is the only place in the world where I have to explain a power-up.
Um, in a video game, it's something that you collect to give you extra power.
Like a gun, or, you know, ammunition.
So, would anyone ever pass up a power-up?
Huh?
No.
Not unless you're crazy.
You never know when you'll run out of ammunition.
So this suicide vest that Jimal's avatar is wearing, what is that?
It's a power-up.
And everybody who plays your game grabs one?
At one point or another.
In fact, according to your own logs, many ASAs in Mr. Agos's office...
- Objection.
- Overruled.
...many ASAs in Mr. Agos's office have collected such suicide packs?
Yeah, it's a part of the game.
It's not a thing.
But doesn't that mean these ASAs are more likely to have murdered Simon Greenberg?
- Your Honor.
- Psst.
JUDGE:
Mrs. Florrick?
Mrs. Florrick, any further questions?
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Sartori,
Jimal's roommate, Amir Al-Fulan, he played your online game, too?
I have no idea.
This is a record of your subpoenaed logs.
Can you read that there?
SARTORI:
Oh, yeah.
And you had to reduce his privileges because he fought with another player, didn't he?
Yeah, he, uh, he got in a fight online.
On the Battle M.E. board.
And who did he fight with?
Can you read that there?
You had to reduced both their privileges.
Simon Greenberg.
ALICIA:
Thank you.
Jimal's roommate, Amir, is the most-likely suspect.
But he has an alibi-- praying.
Yes, but he was alone.
What about the other roommate-- Tariq?
We can't find any contact between Tariq and the victim.
And he doesn't have the political motive.
Amir is the Palestinian hard-liner.
Tariq could care less.
Okay.
Thank you, Alicia.
Keep us in touch.
What do you think?
I think... you're holding something against her.
I'm what?
Alicia.
Maybe it's unconscious, maybe it's not, but you're being hard on her.
No.
She's a third-year associate on a partner track and she's treating us like peers.
That's all you're seeing.
My God, am I the only adult left here?
Could everybody just put their emotions away?
I've got to get to a meeting, unless you have some other stray observations for me.
Are we overdoing it?
Diane thinks I'm going too hard on you.
Am I?
Going too hard?
(laughs)
All those late nights...
No time off.
Buried... in work.
(moans softly)
Up to my knees.

He's doing it again!
It's just my neighbors.

Come on, let's go to the bedroom.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't move.
Don't move.
(arguing continues indistinctly)
Leg is done, the chops are ready to go.
I'm just warming up the leg of lamb piece after it's been reposing for ten or 15 minutes...
We need to eat better.
I like what we eat.
No, I need to cook.
(laughing)
(chuckles)
You're happier without Dad.
No, I'm happier with you.
Okay, that was such a mom thing to say.
(both laughing)
No, it's about Dad.
Does that upset you?
No.
I don't know.
You know I love Dad.
I know.
I'm sorry.
No.
(man continues speaking indistinctly on TV)
I found you a new tutor.
Dana.
I think you'll like her, she's social.
Actually, I think I like this one now.
You...
I thought you said she was too different.
She is.
But sometimes different isn't always bad.
She's coming over to help me set up my computer tomorrow.
What?
Mm, she's setting up your computer?
I asked her to.
Please tell me you're learning something, and that this isn't all pointless.
I'm learning something.
So how do you explain that, Amir?
I don't explain it.
You said you didn't know the victim, Simon Greenberg, and here you are on a video game fighting with him.
I don't need to talk to you.
You got no authority here.
Hey, you want to make yourself useful in here?
(door creaking)
I just got the authority.
KALINDA:
He claims it wasn't him.
It wasn't him, what, fighting against Greenberg?
On the video game.
Amir says it was Tariq.
He let him use his screen name.
These roommates-- they share everything.
So I'm checking Tariq, but we're back to square one.
Amir had a motive-- politics, fanaticism.
Tariq isn't political or religious.
I wonder if we're making a mistake thinking it's about Middle Eastern politics.
These kids-- they're just... college kids.
WOMAN:
All rise.
Okay, I'll keep checking, but I'll need some time.
WOMAN:
Judge Karpman presiding.
Thank you.
Please be seated.
JUDGE:
So, this is where we stand.
There is sufficient evidence for a finding of probable cause.
Further, we set this case on my trial...
Your Honor, we ask that you recuse yourself.
Excuse me?
ALICIA:
We believe you have shown bias against our client.
Believe?
Really?
In what way?
Your religion.
This is... outrageous.
I'm...
My Jewish background is completely irrelevant in this case.
Your Honor, you have given money to the Outlook for Israel, an organization that supports the settlements in Israel.
We believe you have shown bias against our client, and we ask that a new judge hear further proceedings.
I'll give you my answer in an hour.
(bangs gavel)
He's not going to recuse himself.
He will.
Karpman always backs down when he's pushed.
He's afraid he'll be overturned on appeal.
So we start over with a new judge.
No.
I know what Alicia's doing.
Oh.
Hi, Michael.
How are you?
I was just sitting here going over this campaign.
Arab Spring.
Sort of like Irish Spring, but with Arabs.
- Do you want some coffee?
- How much?
For the coffee?
How much for six months if I brought the Jewish League Fund here?
How much are you paying Tarkovsky Associates?
You know how much I'm paying.
Well, of course, we would have to tell
Mr. Al-Said that we can't handle his account anymore, so if you'd help us defer those costs...
You're really a son of a bitch.
I am.
But now I'm your son of a bitch.
WOMAN:
All rise.
Judge Karpman presiding.
Please be seated.
I've taken great deal of time with this motion because
I believe that part of being a tough judge is also being a fair judge.
Your Honor, may I quickly interrupt?
Can't imagine why, Counselor.
I'm ready to rule.
Yes, but...
I believe
Mrs. Florrick is attempting to manipulate this court.
Excuse me!
If you recuse yourself, Your Honor, the court will be forced to choose a new judge tomorrow?
Is that correct?
Yes, it is.
You were about to make your ruling, Your Honor?
That's what she's counting on.
Do you know what tomorrow is, Your Honor?
- What tomorrow is?
- The holiday.
That has nothing to do with my motion.
It's Rosh Hashanah.
There will be no Jewish judges in court, the case will be assigned to a non-Jewish judge.
That is why she's asking you
- to recuse yourself.
- Your Honor, this is offensive!
Mrs. Florrick,
I am... disappointed in you.
The motion is denied.
Case remains on my trial call!
(dance music playing, crowd chatter)
Hi, Tariq.
How are you?
So, what, are you following me?
No.
I'm following her.
Hey, Tariq.
You know, if you're looking for a more discreet gay bar,
- I'd try Scarlet's on Halsted.
- No, no, no, no.
I'd try Sidetrack.
- It's too leathery.
- What do you need?
You used Amir's avatar on Battle M.E., the online video game.
So?
So, that's where you met Simon Greenberg.
- No.
- Yeah.
Actually... yeah.
Checked your alibi.
Didn't hold up, Tariq.
You weren't at the interfaith rally.
Why would I kill Greenberg?
It-It makes no sense.
We spoke to the bartender.
He said you met Greenberg here quite a few times.
My guess is, you two fell in love.
You argued.
He met someone else.
You got jealous.
You stabbed him.
Made it look like a hate crime.
(loud crowd chatter)
(grunting)
(gasping)
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't!
Why the reversed swastika?
- What?
- When you set it up as a hate crime, why did you draw the swastika backward?
What do you mean?
Isn't that how you draw it?
Hmm.
Is it good for the Jewish League Fund?
I don't know.
The Muslim was the killer, but he was also gay, and sleeping with our guy, so, uh,
I would call that a classic mixed message.
(whispers):
Crisis management.
If it helps our cause, I could find out if he's a top.
(laughs)
That was a joke.
Yeah.
Okay, I-I-I got to go.
Important work?
Fate of the world.
What do you think?
It's very flattering, Eli.
But I can't be thinking about the governorship when I'm doing this job.
So do this job.
Let me think about the governorship.
Just an observation from work.
If you're worried about Alicia and Will Gardner...
I'm not... worried.
I know, I know, but, um, if you were,
I think that whatever was there is no more.
They barely look at each other.
Eli.
You don't want a divorced candidate, do you?
No, I...
Forget it.

MAN:
I just think it was this video that provoked the fight
- at the interfaith rally.
- And you want us to defend...?
Jimal Mifsud.
Scholarship student in Science.
His family is in Jiddah, and he can't afford a lawyer.
Do you know his family?
No, I am purely an interested bystander here who wants to see justice done.
Purely?
There's a campus fistfight between a dozen Palestinian and Jewish youths, and the State's Attorney only charges one Palestinian?
Well, he doesn't have a record, so it should be a simple misdemeanor battery.
Court supervision, at most.
No, the new State's Attorney wants to appear tough on his first day.
It was deemed a hate crime.
Seven years.
Alicia, meet Wasim Al-Said, an old friend who until recently retained our competitor Young, Bachman and Meyers
- for his legal interest.
- To my eternal regret.
- Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
- Alicia's fine.
Your husband was very good to the Muslim community in his first term.
My fear is, that's changed.
Of course, Alicia can't influence her husband in any way, but she is still one of our best lawyers.
Well, that's all Jimal needs.
This is a good kid they're painting as a suicide bomber.
Bond hearing's today.
I'll be there.
Good, that's one piece of business.
What else might we handle that Young, Bachman and Meyers can't?
I know that Eli Gold is working with you these days?
I'm in need of some crisis management.
- What's the crisis?
- Where's the management?
Will you get, uh, Eli for us?
And ask Will to step in.
Will?
Sure.
ASSISTANT:
He's late.
Overslept.
Must be from celebrating yesterday's victory.
- Must be.
GRACE:
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Hey, Mom, pick up...
Hello, dearest daughter.
You sound happy.
I am happy.
I have my daughter on the phone.
What more could I desire?
Look, I don't think I need a tutor.
Grace, we discussed this.
It's just a month.
- Yeah, but it was one report card.
- And it's one month.
Dad just thinks I need to apply myself.
Oh, I agree, and a tutor will help you do that.
Eli?
The meeting.
Mom, Nisa's parents want you to come over for dinner.
- You and Dad.
Both of you.
- Why?
Just to be nice.
I didn't tell them anything.
It was like you said:
I haven't let anyone know you guys are separated.
Hey!
Okay, I'll talk to your father about it.
I-I've got to go.
So, who is this guy again?
Wasim Al-Said.
He's a commodities trader.
Wasim?
Diane's been trying to sign him for two years.
He has ten million in charitable assets to spend.
On what?
A campaign against anti-Muslim bigotry.
Mr. Al-Said, you do know that I'm not a PR specialist.
I handle lobbying and crisis management.
Do you watch the evening news, Eli?
Religiously.
Then you know there was a murder of a Jewish poli sci major at Chicago Polytech last night.
Unsolved, but the police are questioning Muslim students.
Ten minutes later, a riot broke out at the other end of campus at a rally intended to encourage interfaith dialogue, and only one Muslim was arrested.
Now I'm used to reading the tea leaves in this country, and the best way to manage a crisis is before it becomes one.
Isn't that true?
It is.
So, are you hiring me because I'm good or because I'm Jewish?
Because I imagine it might look quite good having a Jew campaign for Muslims.
Can't it be both?
- I don't like being used.
- Really?
Since when?
He knows Jewish money is going to Peter for his next campaign
- and he wants to buy influence.
- And...?
Don't you get so knowing on me.
What's up with you, anyway?
You seem different.
(scoffs)
Where you going?
- Court.
- Why?
I'm a lawyer.
Okay, glad we cleared that up.
This is a hate crime, Your Honor, and we ask that bail be set at $100,000.
Have you ever been in a fistfight, Counselor?
Have I, Your Honor?
Uh, no.
Well, let me educate you.
It's chaos, chaos in there.
No one can tell who hits who.
Fists are flying, you get hit in the head.
The next thing you know, you're on the ground and somebody's jumping...
- Jimal, I'm sorry to be late.
I was...
CARY:
Jimal assaulted someone because he was Jewish.
That is not chaos, Your Honor.
And Jimal was hit because he's Palestinian, Your Honor.
Alicia Florrick, Your Honor.
20 students were fighting.
Only one was charged.
One Muslim.
- His religion had nothing to...
- It had everything to do with it.
JUDGE:
All right, okay, your passion is preserved for the record.
Bond is set at $5,000.
And I do suggest that the State reconsider its charge.
Thank you, Your Honor.
(gavel pounds)
Jimal, I was just put in on this.
You have a benefactor who asked me to step in.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I know, a lot of this is posturing by the prosecution to get you to accept a higher plea.
The good news is, the judge is on your side.
Now, do you want me to call your parents or anything?
No, no they wouldn't...
Look, I'm ashamed.
I understand.
Hopefully, we can handle this
- by admitting simple battery.
- But I didn't.
I wasn't even there.
He wasn't at the rally, Cary.
He was at the library.
Oh, my God, really?
That's terrible.
This isn't about Jimal, and this isn't about some stupid fistfight.
This is about that Jewish kid stabbed to death, and you can't find the killer so Jimal is the scapegoat.
We have an eyewitness who saw Jimal throw the first punch.
- That's what this is about.
- Is the eyewitness Caucasian?
(laughs)
Oh, wow, how quickly we slip the bonds of political correctness.
- Why not ask if he's Jewish?
- Cross-racial identification.
Caucasians have difficulty discerning unique characteristics.
Six months in County, one year probation.
No.
Then I'll see you in court.
Tell Peter there has to be a better way to firm up his campaign contributions.
Using everything we can, are we?
PETER:
It's a new day.
We're running a clean office.
Let me say that again, because we're all prone to the same cynicism.
We... are running a clean office.
Clean, ethical, honest, but not weak.
I know our budgets have been slashed.
I know we're the underdog here.
But our strategy will be this:
no plea bargains.
That's right.
Defense attorneys will be expecting the opposite.
So for the next two months,
I want you to hold the line on every single plea.
After that, you won't have to work as hard.
You get your enemy flinching, you'll never have to hit him hard again.
Your first complaint will be about investigator hours.
That's why I've hired an outside contractor until we can budget full time.
I want you to meet Sophia Russo.
She's good, and she's cheap.
Thanks!
Relatively.
Mr. Florrick, I offered the defense six months on the college hate crime.
Should I walk it back?
What's the law say?
Three to seven years.
There's your answer.
The lawyer's Alicia, and she might come after your campaign contributions.
Really?
Yeah.
What do you want?
Follow the law.
You can't go wrong if you follow the law.
All right.
Geez, what a pit.
- Thank you.
- You're working on the, uh, the Jewish-Muslim thing, right?
Yeah, the hate crime.
Why?
What do you need?
Oh, it's not what I need.
What is this?
You used to work with Kalinda Sharma, didn't you?
Yeah.
If I were you, I'd slip it to her.
♪ ♪
So, kind of odd not seeing you around much.
Yeah, I've been busy.
Yeah.
And here I thought you didn't need me anymore.
(chuckles)
What's that?
It's a peace offering.
Peter Florrick wants to run a clean office, so... this is me being clean.
You're welcome.
ELI:
You can't make Chicagoans feel good about Islam with pathos.
You need to go positive.
Link the Arab Spring to the American Revolution.
Who is the Islamic George Washington?
Who is the Islamic Paul Revere?
Morning in the Middle East...
Do you need something?
It's on your desk.
It's self-explanatory.
ALICIA:
That's your car?
Good.
Now, I know you said you were at the library.
But the time code on that traffic light shows that the driver of your car was running a red light just outside the campus gates at the exact moment of the interfaith rally.
That means that the driver of your car, if that is you, couldn't have been involved in the rally fight.
Do you understand?
I do.
So, I want you to take your time before you answer.
Is that you driving your car?
It is.
Are you certain, young man?
It's a very roundabout way to come from the library.
I'm sure.
CARY:
We ask that Mr. Mifsud state under oath that he was the driver in this photo which we will mark as People's Exhibit #1.
Your Honor, is that really necessary?
CARY:
It's the only way we'll drop the hate charge.
Very well.
Mr. Mifsud, you are under oath.
Do you swear that that's you in the photo?
Yes.
JUDGE:
Good.
Well, I think that just about, uh, wraps it up, doesn't it, Mr. Agos?
I'm late for the gym.
It does, Your Honor, and the State has made a terrible mistake in charging Mr. Mifsud with this battery, But this car with this license plate was seen racing away from the scene
- of the frat murder of Simon Greenberg...
- Objection, Your Honor!
- That is why he ran the red light.
- Oh, this is outrageous.
- He had just killed Simon Greenberg.
- This is prosecutorial misconduct!
He swore to it.
His alibi means he committed this murder.
Because you overcharged him with a hate crime so he would grab at any alibi.
So you're saying your client perjured himself?
No, I am saying he took my advice, that's all.
Well, then congratulations, Alicia.
You just advised your client to admit to murder.
Your Honor, the People charge Jimal Mifsud with first-degree murder.
The Good Wife Original air date September 25, 2011 S03E01 "A New Day"
(elevator bell dings)
Alicia dropped by for you.
Why?
I don't know.
You want me to get her?
No.
Later.
KALINDA:
So this isn't you?
It's your car, but you're not driving it?
I'm sorry, I, uh, I thought it was the easiest way out.
So who is it?
Who's driving it?
I don't know.
Jimal, they have a witness who swears that that car-- your car-- was driven away by Simon Greenberg's killer.
So don't cover for anyone.
I'm not covering.
My-my two roommates don't have a car,
I let Amir and Tariq use mine.
I just leave my keys in the room.
So which is driving it, Amir or Tariq?
I don't know.
But he swore that was him driving away from the murder?
He didn't know it would implicate him in a murder.
It's my fault.
I encouraged him to place himself in the car to give him an alibi from the hate crime.
Yes.
And now I have a multimillion-dollar client thinking that we're amateurs.
I got the pictures from the ASA's office.
- I should've checked.
- Great.
It's everybody's fault.
Now let's make it right.
I'm questioning Jimal's roommates.
One of them is the real driver.
And I'm filing a motion to dismiss
Jimal's alibi statement during preliminary.
I don't know what's going on with you two, but make it better.
Whatever you have to do.
Make it better.
So are we supposed to do something?
Sure.
- What subject?
- I don't know.
You're the tutor.
What does your mom want?
She wants me to get better grades, so that I'll get into Briarcrest.
You don't like public school?
No, I do.
It's just that there was a mugging on the field, and all the parents got really scared.
Is this your first job tutoring?
Yeah.
(chuckles)
How am I doing?
Not so good.
Darn.
Can we go outside?
Yeah, I think it's up to you.
MAN:
Cary the man!
Throwing down that opposition.
(chuckles)
Nicely played.
Thanks.
So this is the new Cary?
No, just a new day.
So can I see the crime scene photos, Cary?
Well, come on.
You're in the big leagues now.
What can it hurt?
I'll think about it.
SOPHIA:
Oh.
Well, looky who's here.
Sophia?
In the flesh.
Strange bedfellows, huh?
The strangest.
Well... you two have a nice time.
(chuckles)
What'd she want?
(sighs):
Oh.
Crime scene photos.
Damn it.
Okay, uh, Simon Greenberg, 22, found in his dorm room gagged, hands bound, stabbed 45 times.
- Little overkill?
- Yep.
Police think it was an execution.
No sign of a struggle.
Any witnesses?
Neighbor heard a scream, looked out his window and saw a dark, possibly black Middle Eastern man running to his car.
They got a number plate-
- ET27.
Damn.
That's not a partial plate.
Yeah, I know.
Jimal's plate.
Um, one other thing.
Something that wasn't released to the press.
What?
Killer drew a swastika with the victim's blood.
Ugh.
Yep.
I know this is not looking good, is it?
Okay, um, let me know what you get from the roommates.
Got it.
Oh, by the way, the swastika-- the police don't know why, but it was drawn backwards.
Okay.
Hi.
Am I interrupting?
Nope.
How are you?
Good.
Do you have a moment to talk?
About last night?
Yeah.
Don't act like this is nothing, Eli.
You're running a pro-Palestinian campaign.
It's an anti-
Muslim-bigotry campaign, and I am a crisis man...
You are a Jew.
- We are both...
- Oh, come on, Michael!
What is this?
Ultimate Frisbee?
We only win by making them lose?
Yes.
You act like you're not paying attention, but I know you're paying attention.
This is a PR war.
And I'm a traitor?
In February, Israeli soldiers helped a Palestinian woman give birth.
You didn't read about it unless you subscribed to the Israel National News.
Two days later, an Israeli woman gave birth in a Palestinian hospital.
Where did you read it?
AP, CBS News, every major paper.
Google it.
Go ahead.
This is a PR war and they are winning.
Michael.
I do not go to your house and tell you what novels to write.
I do not go to your committee and tell you what lobbyists to hire.
(gasps)
Oh.
That's it.
(chuckles):
Now I get it.
I didn't hire you.
There it is.
I hired Tarkovsky Associates.
With a $20 million Jewish League Fund to fight intolerance.
Yes, you did.
So this isn't Israel/Palestine to you.
It's Gold versus Tarkovsky.
You're paying a competitor, Michael.
And as moved as I am by your plea for
Jewish brotherhood,
I'm not that moved.
4,000 years and we are always our own worst enemy.
So you were driving Jimal's car that night, right?
This is just like the cops.
Racist.
They think an Arab had to do it.
Yeah, but this is you, isn't it, Amir?
You were driving your roommate's car that night, right?
No.
And you know why it's not me?
Look at your time code, lady.
I was in my living room for salah.
Evening prayers.
Anybody else see you there?
- Yes.
- Who?
The Prophet Muhammad.
Peace be upon him.
Yeah, Amir's in the living room five times a day praying.
Okay, Tariq.
Did you see him praying on the night of the murder?
- No.
- So you were home?
You were home to be able to not see him there?
No, I was out.
In Jimal's car?
No, I wanted to take it, but the keys were gone already.
So where were you?
I was here.
In the quad at the interfaith rally.
Sophia.
Kalinda.
Hi.
I didn't see you over there.
This is how you investigate these days?
- By just following me?
- Yep.
Makes things a lot easier.
So you and Cary, huh?
That's why you've been ignoring me, right?
It's not because I'm married.
Yep.
You got me.
Listen, I'm gonna go and question eyewitnesses at the Jewish frat.
Do you want the address?
Where's the fun in that?
ALICIA:
Your Honor, this is... (lawyers shouting)
- This is prosecutorial misconduct.
- Okay, okay, okay.
This is absolutely unethical.
All right, all right.
Each to your corners.
Mrs. Florrick, your client already swore that that was him in the car.
Is he now trying to say that he lied?
He's saying that he was misled by the prosecution.
How did I mislead?
Jimal was given an opportunity to avoid a hate crime prosecution and he took it, that's all.
This murder charge is based on nothing else.
There's no evidence that
Jimal and the victim even knew each other.
Where's the motive?
Mr. Greenberg was Jewish and Jimal was Muslim, and as you can see here, Your Honor, a swastika was drawn on the victim's...
ALICIA:
Oh, come on.
Anti-Semitism isn't some cookie cutter motive you can apply
- to any dark-skinned...
- All right, counselors, listen.
Nobody likes a street fight better than me, but that's for in the street, not here.
Mr. Agos, do you have any further probable cause?
Because if it's just that statement,
I am prone to overturn.
We do, Your Honor.
FINEMAN:
Professor Noah Fineman.
I teach political science.
And did the accused show a particular interest in one of your lectures?
He did.
It's a lecture that I give on the anniversary of 9/11 about chickens who come home to roost for the United States and Zionist regime in Israel...
Objection.
Your Honor, is Mr. Agos really trying to find a motive in Jimal's classes?
Why not home ec?
- Maybe that's where the knife came from.
JUDGE:
Overruled.
I think we can stand a bit of rough and tumble here, Counselor.
So, Professor, you would argue that Israel's a criminal regime.
Oh, I-I don't argue it.
I think that's fairly self-evident.
Given this, what do you think of suicide bombings and the death of Jewish citizens?
FINEMAN:
If you're asking me if I approve of such a thing, no, never.
But I do understand them.
These are understandable movements against a Zionist oppression.
And how did your student Jimal take an added interest in this lecture?
Well, he was, uh, very engaged in class, yes.
And afterwards, he approached me to ask me questions about my newest book,
Zionist Occupation:
the Need for Realignment and New Thinking.
Bordinay Press.
Thank you, Professor.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Actually, Professor,
I have a few questions.
My client was very engaged in your lecture, you said?
How did you witness this?
Well, if you teach students long enough, you get a sense.
And for how long did you teach Jimal?
Well, it's been four weeks since the beginning of the semester.
So four weeks, that's, uh, 20 sessions.
And for how many of those sessions were you actually present?
I don't understand.
How many of those 20 sessions were you actually there teaching and not having one of your TA's do it?
- Uh...
- Didn't you only lecture the class twice, Professor?
Well, I would question your use of the word "only,"
but, uh... yes.
And yet you really focused with your laser-like perception on Jimal and his engagement.
You're being a bit rude.
Yes, and I'm just getting started.
So, after one of your lectures,
Jimal came to you to ask you about your book.
How do you know this?
Because I keep a record next to my attendance.
See?
That asterisk tells me that I must send them an e-mail about my book.
And, of course, you recognize Jimal, over there?
Oh, yes.
This record attendance, the students sign themselves in, yes?
Yes, it's a very efficient way to work.
I'm sure.
Do you see Jimal's name there?
It's him there.
- That's not his handwriting.
CARY:
Objection.
That's the handwriting of his roommate,
Tariq, also a student in your class who signed him in so that Jimal could cut class.
Well, I'd say things have been pretty easy for you up until now.
Really?
How's that?
In court, these people don't really know how you think.
But you do?
Hate to tell you this but we're going to beat you.
(chuckles softly)
Good luck with that.

Meaning people log onto their computers

- Yep.
What are we looking at now?
Uh, well, that's the recorded actions of Sampson5.
That's the avatar of the accused, Jimal...
ALICIA:
Objection.
Your Honor, what does this have to do with the death of Simon Greenberg?
Goes to motive, Your Honor.
What is that assault weapon over there, is that an uzi?
No, it's a Galil 5.56.
JUDGE:
What's the range of fire?
450 meters.
Cool.
Proceed.
Well, that's Jimal's avatar there.
The guy running.
And what is he wearing?
Oh, that?
That's a suicide vest.
(man shouting in foreign language on video game)
(gunfire and explosions continue)
He's wearing a suicide vest?
And what is he entering?
That's a civilian Israeli building.
That's a school, in fact...
Your Honor, this is a game.
(explosion)
(gunfire and explosions continue)
Mr. Al-Said was just here.
He wants us to pull out of Jimal's defense.
He is afraid defending a youth who makes light of a suicide bombing will undercut Eli's pro-Muslim campaign.
He wasn't making light of it.
He was playing a video game.
In which he killed a schoolhouse full of kids.
Yes, but in a video game.
Have you seen video games lately?
We can't abandon Jimal.
He was looking at misdemeanor battery.
We helped him into a murder charge.
"We"?
I... helped him into a murder charge, which I did as a representative of this firm.
We made a commitment to him.
What do you think?
I think your friend will pull out of Eli's campaign and go right back to his old firm with his $10 million.
Yeah.
Still, retail rules.
We broke it, we own it?
Okay, we'll stick with Jimal.
Win this one.
No.
No, what?
No, Mr. Al-Said.
(chuckles)
I'm coming here as a courtesy.
I don't need your campaign anymore.
I'm taking my business back to my old firm.
Oh, that's too bad because I already cashed your check.
You did not.
I did.
You know us Jews.
You'd do anything to piss me off.
You're right.
But I have still got a great pro-Muslim campaign for you.
(laughs softly)
Good doing business with you.
Did you hear the one about the Arab and the Jew?
No.
But I'm sure it's very funny.
An Arab and a Jew walk into a bar.
And then they kill each other.
Energy is radiated and absorbed in quanta, matched to...?
Patterns of black body radiation.
You know that's bad for you?
Uh-huh.
It's like the equivalent of three buckets of popcorn.
But I don't want three buckets of popcorn.
(door hisses open)
Oh, my God.
What?
(low, indistinct chatter)
Okay, I need your help.
(music playing)
Don't shake the camera.
Just keep it steady.
What are you doing?
Look at the color.
It's Bollywood.
You can't pass up Bollywood.
Do you know them?
No.
It's chance.
I do this all the time.

Good to have you back, Mr. Sartori.
Yeah.
So tell me, what is a power-up?
(chuckles)
Sorry, this is the only place in the world where I have to explain a power-up.
Um, in a video game, it's something that you collect to give you extra power.
Like a gun, or, you know, ammunition.
So, would anyone ever pass up a power-up?
Huh?
No.
Not unless you're crazy.
You never know when you'll run out of ammunition.
So this suicide vest that Jimal's avatar is wearing, what is that?
It's a power-up.
And everybody who plays your game grabs one?
At one point or another.
In fact, according to your own logs, many ASAs in Mr. Agos's office...
- Objection.
- Overruled.
...many ASAs in Mr. Agos's office have collected such suicide packs?
Yeah, it's a part of the game.
It's not a thing.
But doesn't that mean these ASAs are more likely to have murdered Simon Greenberg?
- Your Honor.
- Psst.
JUDGE:
Mrs. Florrick?
Mrs. Florrick, any further questions?
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Sartori,
Jimal's roommate, Amir Al-Fulan, he played your online game, too?
I have no idea.
This is a record of your subpoenaed logs.
Can you read that there?
SARTORI:
Oh, yeah.
And you had to reduce his privileges because he fought with another player, didn't he?
Yeah, he, uh, he got in a fight online.
On the Battle M.E. board.
And who did he fight with?
Can you read that there?
You had to reduced both their privileges.
Simon Greenberg.
ALICIA:
Thank you.
Jimal's roommate, Amir, is the most-likely suspect.
But he has an alibi-- praying.
Yes, but he was alone.
What about the other roommate-- Tariq?
We can't find any contact between Tariq and the victim.
And he doesn't have the political motive.
Amir is the Palestinian hard-liner.
Tariq could care less.
Okay.
Thank you, Alicia.
Keep us in touch.
What do you think?
I think... you're holding something against her.
I'm what?
Alicia.
Maybe it's unconscious, maybe it's not, but you're being hard on her.
No.
She's a third-year associate on a partner track and she's treating us like peers.
That's all you're seeing.
My God, am I the only adult left here?
Could everybody just put their emotions away?
I've got to get to a meeting, unless you have some other stray observations for me.
Are we overdoing it?
Diane thinks I'm going too hard on you.
Am I?
Going too hard?
(laughs)
All those late nights...
No time off.
Buried... in work.
(moans softly)
Up to my knees.
(door slams shut)
GIRL:
He's doing it again, Mom!
He's doing it again!
It's just my neighbors.
(arguing continues indistinctly)
Come on, let's go to the bedroom.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't move.
Don't move.
(arguing continues indistinctly)
Leg is done, the chops are ready to go.
I'm just warming up the leg of lamb piece after it's been reposing for ten or 15 minutes...
We need to eat better.
I like what we eat.
No, I need to cook.
(laughing)
(chuckles)
You're happier without Dad.
No, I'm happier with you.
Okay, that was such a mom thing to say.
(both laughing)
No, it's about Dad.
Does that upset you?
No.
I don't know.
You know I love Dad.
I know.
I'm sorry.
No.
(man continues speaking indistinctly on TV)
I found you a new tutor.
Dana.
I think you'll like her, she's social.
Actually, I think I like this one now.
You...
I thought you said she was too different.
She is.
But sometimes different isn't always bad.
She's coming over to help me set up my computer tomorrow.
What?
Mm, she's setting up your computer?
I asked her to.
Please tell me you're learning something, and that this isn't all pointless.
I'm learning something.
So how do you explain that, Amir?
I don't explain it.
You said you didn't know the victim, Simon Greenberg, and here you are on a video game fighting with him.
I don't need to talk to you.
You got no authority here.
Hey, you want to make yourself useful in here?
(door creaking)
I just got the authority.
KALINDA:
He claims it wasn't him.
It wasn't him, what, fighting against Greenberg?
On the video game.
Amir says it was Tariq.
He let him use his screen name.
These roommates-- they share everything.
So I'm checking Tariq, but we're back to square one.
Amir had a motive-- politics, fanaticism.
Tariq isn't political or religious.
I wonder if we're making a mistake thinking it's about Middle Eastern politics.
These kids-- they're just... college kids.
WOMAN:
All rise.
Okay, I'll keep checking, but I'll need some time.
WOMAN:
Judge Karpman presiding.
Thank you.
Please be seated.
JUDGE:
So, this is where we stand.
There is sufficient evidence for a finding of probable cause.
Further, we set this case on my trial...
Your Honor, we ask that you recuse yourself.
Excuse me?
ALICIA:
We believe you have shown bias against our client.
Believe?
Really?
In what way?
Your religion.
This is... outrageous.
I'm...
My Jewish background is completely irrelevant in this case.
Your Honor, you have given money to the Outlook for Israel, an organization that supports the settlements in Israel.
We believe you have shown bias against our client, and we ask that a new judge hear further proceedings.
I'll give you my answer in an hour.
(bangs gavel)
He's not going to recuse himself.
He will.
Karpman always backs down when he's pushed.
He's afraid he'll be overturned on appeal.
So we start over with a new judge.
No.
I know what Alicia's doing.
Oh.
Hi, Michael.
How are you?
I was just sitting here going over this campaign.
Arab Spring.
Sort of like Irish Spring, but with Arabs.
- Do you want some coffee?
- How much?
For the coffee?
How much for six months if I brought the Jewish League Fund here?
How much are you paying Tarkovsky Associates?
You know how much I'm paying.
Well, of course, we would have to tell
Mr. Al-Said that we can't handle his account anymore, so if you'd help us defer those costs...
You're really a son of a bitch.
I am.
But now I'm your son of a bitch.
WOMAN:
All rise.
Judge Karpman presiding.
Please be seated.
I've taken great deal of time with this motion because
I believe that part of being a tough judge is also being a fair judge.
Your Honor, may I quickly interrupt?
Can't imagine why, Counselor.
I'm ready to rule.
Yes, but...
I believe
Mrs. Florrick is attempting to manipulate this court.
Excuse me!
If you recuse yourself, Your Honor, the court will be forced to choose a new judge tomorrow?
Is that correct?
Yes, it is.
You were about to make your ruling, Your Honor?
That's what she's counting on.
Do you know what tomorrow is, Your Honor?
- What tomorrow is?
- The holiday.
That has nothing to do with my motion.
It's Rosh Hashanah.
There will be no Jewish judges in court, the case will be assigned to a non-Jewish judge.
That is why she's asking you
- to recuse yourself.
- Your Honor, this is offensive!
Mrs. Florrick,
I am... disappointed in you.
The motion is denied.
Case remains on my trial call!
(dance music playing, crowd chatter)
Hi, Tariq.
How are you?
So, what, are you following me?
No.
I'm following her.
Hey, Tariq.
You know, if you're looking for a more discreet gay bar,
- I'd try Scarlet's on Halsted.
- No, no, no, no.
I'd try Sidetrack.
- It's too leathery.
- What do you need?
You used Amir's avatar on Battle M.E., the online video game.
So?
So, that's where you met Simon Greenberg.
- No.
- Yeah.
Actually... yeah.
Checked your alibi.
Didn't hold up, Tariq.
You weren't at the interfaith rally.
Why would I kill Greenberg?
It-It makes no sense.
We spoke to the bartender.
He said you met Greenberg here quite a few times.
My guess is, you two fell in love.
You argued.
He met someone else.
You got jealous.
You stabbed him.
Made it look like a hate crime.
(loud crowd chatter)
(grunting)
(gasping)
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't!
Why the reversed swastika?
- What?
- When you set it up as a hate crime, why did you draw the swastika backward?
What do you mean?
Isn't that how you draw it?
Hmm.
Is it good for the Jewish League Fund?
I don't know.
The Muslim was the killer, but he was also gay, and sleeping with our guy, so, uh,
I would call that a classic mixed message.
(whispers):
Crisis management.
If it helps our cause, I could find out if he's a top.
(laughs)
That was a joke.
Yeah.
Okay, I-I-I got to go.
Important work?
Fate of the world.
What do you think?
It's very flattering, Eli.
But I can't be thinking about the governorship when I'm doing this job.
So do this job.
Let me think about the governorship.
Just an observation from work.
If you're worried about Alicia and Will Gardner...
I'm not... worried.
I know, I know, but, um, if you were,
I think that whatever was there is no more.
They barely look at each other.
Eli.
You don't want a divorced candidate, do you?
No, I...
Forget it.
(laughs)
(blues playing)
♪ Yes, good-bye ♪
You need a friend, K.
♪ I mean good-bye... ♪
Why do I need a friend?
Or a dog.
Maybe you need a dog.
Kalinda and Pooch.
Out investigating.
(laughs)
I'm fine, Will.
Really.
WOMAN:
What's wrong with me?
(crying)
We're not like normal people, are we?
What are normal people like?
Emotional.
- You're emotional.
- No.
Sometimes I'm in the middle of an emotion, and I just look at myself and realize...
I'm not feeling anything.
I just like acting like someone who feels something.
You want to stop acting and actually feel?
Yeah.
Yeah.
(blow strikes Will)
Ow.
That's what it feels like.
Thanks.
(laughs)
I got to go.
I got to be somewhere at 8:45.
Really?
That's specific.
Yup.
Be good.
PETER:
I'll get them to school on Monday.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
(heavy sigh)
ZACH:
Do we take our homework?
- Yes!
PETER:
Yes!
So, you've hired a tutor for Grace?
Yes, I did.
She's good, I think, and Grace likes her.
Or... she likes her now.
I'll keep an eye on that.
Oh, um, also,
Zach's girlfriend, Nisa-- her parents wanted us to come for dinner.
I'll tell her you're busy.
Yeah, yeah, tell her I'm...
I'm busy.
ZACH:
Love you.
Love you.
- Love you.
- I love you.
You call if you need anything.
I'll be here.
(clock ticking)
(clock ticking)
(knocking on door)
WASIM AL-SAID:
It was e-mailed to campus in-boxes.
- Do you know who sent it?
- My guess is Tau Kappa Theta, the Jewish fraternity.
- I'm not saying anything bad.
- No, of course not.
WASIM AL-SAID:
It was this video that provoked the fight at the rally.
DIANE:
And you want us to defend?
Jimal Mifsud.
Scholarship student in Science.
His family is in Jidda, and he can't afford a lawyer.
Do you know his family?
No, I am purely an interested bystander here
- who wants to see justice done.
- Purely?
There's a campus fistfight between a dozen Palestinian and Jewish youths, and the state's attorney only charges one Palestinian?
DIANE:
He doesn't have a record, so it should be a simple misdemeanor battery.
- Court supervision.
WASIM AL-SAID:
No.
The new state's attorney wants to appear tough on his first day.
It was deemed a hate crime.
Seven years.
Alicia, meet Wasim Al-Said, an old friend who, until recently, retained our competitor, Young, Bachman and Meyers
- for his legal interest.
- To my eternal regret.
- Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
- Alicia's fine.
WASIM AL-SAID:
Your husband was good to the Muslim community his first term.
My fear is that's changed.
Of course, Alicia can't influence her husband in any way, but she is still one of our best lawyers.
Well, that's all Jimal needs.
This is a good kid they're painting as, uh, a suicide bomber.
Bond hearing's today.
I'll be there.
Good.
That's one piece of business.
What else might we handle that Young, Bachman and Meyers can't?
I know that Eli Gold is working with you these days.
I'm in need of some crisis management.
- What's the crisis?
- Where's the management?
Will you get, uh, Eli for us?
And ask Will to step in.
Will?
Sure.
GRACE [ON RECORDING]:
Mom, pick up the phone.
Mom, pick up...
Hello, dearest daughter.
GRACE:
You sound happy.
I am happy.
I have my daughter on the phone.
What more could I desire?
Look, I don't think I need a tutor.
Grace, we discussed this.
It's just a month.
GRACE:
It was one report card.
- And it's one month.
Dad just thinks I need to apply myself.
Oh, I agree, and a tutor will help you do that.
Eli.
The meeting.
Mom, Nisa's parents want you to come over for dinner.
ZACH:
You and Dad.
Both of you.
- Why?
Just to be nice.
I didn't tell them anything.
Like you said, I haven't let anyone know you are separated.
Okay, I'll talk to your father about it.
I've gotta go.
- So who is this guy again?
- Wasim Al-Said.
- He's a commodities trader.
- Wasim?
Diane's been trying to sign him for two years.
He has 10 million in charitable assets to spend.
On what?
A campaign against anti-Muslim bigotry.
Mr. Al-Said, you do know that I'm not a PR specialist?
I handle lobbying and crisis management.
Do you watch the evening news, Eli?
Religiously.
Then you know there was a murder of a Jewish Poli-Sci major at Chicago Polytech last night.
Unsolved, but the police are questioning Muslim students.
Ten minutes later, uh, a riot broke out at the other end of campus at a rally intended to encourage interfaith dialogue, and only one Muslim was arrested.
Now, I'm used to reading the tea leaves in this country, and the best way to manage a crisis is before it becomes one.
Isn't that true?
It is.
So are you hiring me because I'm good or because I'm Jewish?
Because I imagine it might look quite good having a Jew campaign for Muslims.
Can't it be both?
- I don't like being used.
- Really?
Since when?
He knows Jewish money is going to Peter for his next campaign
- and he wants to buy influence.
- And?
Don't you get so knowing on me.
What's up with you anyway?
- You seem different.
- Heh.
- Where you going?
- Court.
- Why?
- I'm a lawyer.
Okay, glad we cleared that up.
This is a hate crime, Your Honor, and we ask that bail be set at $100,000.
Have you ever been in a fistfight, counselor?
Have I, Your Honor?
Um, no.
Well, let me educate you.
It's chaos, chaos in there.
No one can tell who hits who.
Fists are flying, you get hit in the head.
Next thing you know, you're on the ground...
- I'm sorry to be late.
CARY:
Jimal assaulted someone because he was Jewish.
That is not chaos.
And Jimal was hit because he's Palestinian, Your Honor.
Alicia Florrick, Your Honor.
Twenty students were fighting.
Only one was charged.
One Muslim.
- Religion had nothing...
- Everything to do with it.
KARPMAN:
All right, okay.
Your passion is preserved for the record.
Bond is set at $5,000.
And I do suggest that the state reconsider its charge.
Thank you, Your Honor.
[GAVEL BANGS]
ALICIA:
Jimal, I was just put in on this.
You have a benefactor who asked me to step in.
- You all right?
- Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I know.
A lot of this is posturing by the prosecution to get you to accept a higher plea.
The good news is the judge is on your side.
Want me to call your parents or...?
No.
No, they wouldn't...
Look, I'm ashamed.
I understand.
Hopefully, we can handle this by admitting simple battery.
But I didn't.
I wasn't even there.
ALICIA:
He wasn't at the rally, Cary.
He was at the library.
Oh, my God, really?
That's terrible.
This isn't about Jimal, and this isn't about some stupid fistfight.
This is about that Jewish kid stabbed to death, and you can't find the killer so Jimal is the scapegoat.
We have an eyewitness who saw Jimal throw the first punch.
Is the eyewitness Caucasian?
[CHUCKLES]
Oh, wow, how quickly we slip the bonds of political correctness.
- Why not ask if he's Jewish?
- Cross-racial identification.
Caucasians have difficulty discerning unique characteristics.
Six months in county, one year probation.
- No.
- Then I'll see you in court.
Tell Peter there has to be a better way to firm up his campaign contributions.
Using everything we can, are we?
PETER:
It's a new day.
We're running a clean office.
Let me say that again because we're all prone to the same cynicism.
We are running a clean office.
Clean, ethical, honest, but not weak.
I know our budgets have been slashed.
I know we're the underdog here.
But our strategy will be this:
No plea bargains.
That's right.
Defense attorneys will be expecting the opposite.
So for the next two months,
I want you to hold the line on every single plea.
After that, you won't have to work as hard.
Get your enemy flinching, you'll never have to hit him hard again.
Your first complaint will be about investigator hours.
That's why I've hired an outside contractor until we can budget full-time.
I want you to meet Sophia Russo.
- She's good, and she's cheap.
- Thanks.
PETER:
Relatively.
CARY:
Mr. Florrick.
I offered the defense six months on the college hate crime.
Should I walk it back?
What's the law say?
- Three to seven years.
- There's your answer.
The lawyer's Alicia, and she might come after your campaign contributions.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What do you want?
Follow the law.
You can't go wrong if you follow the law.
All right.
- Jeez, what a pit.
- Thank you.
You're working on the, uh...
The Jewish-Muslim thing, right?
Yeah.
The hate crime.
Why?
What do you need?
Oh, it's not what I need.
What is this?
You used to work with Kalinda Sharma, didn't you?
- Yeah.
- If I were you, I'd slip it to her.
[BLUES MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
So kind of odd not seeing you around much.
Yeah.
I've been busy.
Yeah.
And here I thought you didn't need me anymore.
[CHUCKLES]
What's that?
It's a peace offering.
Peter Florrick wants to run a clean office, so...
This is me being clean.
You're welcome.
You know, you can't make Chicagoans feel good about Islam with pathos.
You need to go positive.
Link the Arab Spring to the American Revolution.
Who is the Islamic George Washington?
Who is the Islamic Paul Revere?
Morning in the Middle East.
Islam turns...
- Do you need something?
- It's on your desk.
It's self-explanatory.
ALICIA:
That's your car?
Good.
Now, I know you said you were at the library.
But the time code on that traffic light shows that the driver of your car was running a red light just outside the campus gates at the exact moment of the interfaith rally.
That means that the driver of your car, if that is you, couldn't have been involved in the rally fight.
- Do you understand?
- I do.
So I want you to take your time before you answer.
Is that you driving your car?
It is.
Are you certain, young man?
It's a very roundabout way to come from the library.
I'm sure.
We ask Mr. Mifsud state under oath that he was the driver in this photo which we will mark as People's Exhibit Number 1.
Your Honor, is that really necessary?
CARY:
Only way we'll drop the hate charge.
KARPMAN:
Very well.
Mr. Mifsud, you are under oath.
Do you swear that that's you in the photo?
- Yes.
KARPMAN:
Good.
Well, I think that just about, uh, wraps it up.
Doesn't it, Mr. Agos?
I'm late for the gym.
It does, Your Honor, and the state has made a terrible mistake in charging Mr. Mifsud with this battery.
But this car with this license plate was seen racing away from the scene
- of the murder of Simon Greenberg.
- Objection!
CARY:
That is why he ran the red light.
- Outrageous.
- He killed Simon Greenberg.
Prosecutorial misconduct!
His alibi means he committed this murder.
You overcharged him with a hate crime so he would grab at any alibi.
Your client perjured himself?
No, I am saying he took my advice, that's all.
Then congratulations, Alicia.
You just advised your client to admit to murder.
Your Honor, the people charge Jimal Mifsud with first degree murder.
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]
Alicia dropped by for you.
- Why?
- I don't know.
You want me to get her?
No.
Later.
So this isn't you?
It's your car, but you're not driving it?
JIMAL:
I'm sorry, I, uh...
I thought it was the easiest way out.
- So who is it?
Who's driving it?
JIMAL:
I don't know.
Jimal, they have a witness who swears that that car, your car, was driven away by Simon Greenberg's killer.
- So don't cover for anyone.
JIMAL:
I'm not covering.
My two roommates don't have a car,
I let Amir and Tariq use mine.
I just leave my keys in the room.
So which is driving it, Amir or Tariq?
I don't know.
But he swore that was him driving away?
He didn't know it would implicate him in a murder.
It's my fault.
I encouraged him to place himself in the car to give him alibi from the hate crime.
Yes.
Now, I have a multimillion-dollar client thinking that we're amateurs.
KALINDA:
I got the pictures from the ASA's office.
- I should've checked.
- Great.
It's everybody's fault.
Now let's make it right.
I'm questioning Jimal's roommates.
One of them is the real driver.
And I'm filing a motion to dismiss Jimal's alibi statement during preliminary.
DIANE:
I don't know what's going on with you two, but make it better.
Whatever you have to do.
Make it better.
So are we supposed to do something?
- Sure.
What subject?
GRACE:
I don't know.
You're the tutor.
What does your mom want?
She wants me to get better grades, so that I'll get into Briarcrest.
- You don't like public school?
- No, I do.
It's just that there was a mugging on the field, and all the parents got really scared.
Is this your first job tutoring?
Yeah, heh.
- How am I doing?
- Not so good.
Darn.
Can we go outside?
Yeah, I think it's up to you.
MAN:
Cary, the man!
Throwing down that opposition.
[CHUCKLES]
Nicely played.
Thanks.
So this is the new Cary?
No, just a new day.
So can I see the crime-scene photos, Cary?
Well, come on, you're in the big leagues now.
What can it hurt?
- I'll think about it.
SOPHIA:
Oh.
- Well, lookie who's here.
KALINDA:
Sophia?
In the flesh.
Strange bedfellows, huh?
The strangest.
Well...
You two have a nice time.
[SOPHIA CHUCKLES]
What'd she want?
[GROANS]
Crime-scene photos.
Damn it.
Okay, uh, Simon Greenberg, 22, found in his dorm room gagged, hands bound, stabbed 45 times.
- Little overkill?
KALINDA:
Yep.
Police think it was an execution.
No sign of a struggle.
- Witnesses?
KALINDA:
Neighbor heard a scream, looked out his window and saw a dark, possibly black Middle Eastern man running to his car.
They got a number plate, ET27.
Damn.
That's not a partial plate.
Yeah, I know.
Jimal's plate.
Um, one other thing.
Something that wasn't released to the press.
- What?
- Killer drew a swastika
- with the victim's blood.
- Ugh.
KALINDA:
Yep.
I know this is not looking good, is it?
Okay.
Um, let me know what you get from the roommates.
Got it.
Oh, by the way, the swastika, the police don't know why, but it was drawn backwards.
Okay.
Hi.
Am I interrupting?
Nope.
How are you?
Good.
Do you have a moment to talk?
About last night?
Yeah.
[DOOR SLAMS]
Don't act like this is nothing, Eli.
You're running a pro-Palestinian campaign.
It's an anti-Muslim bigotry campaign, and I am a crisis...
You are a Jew.
- We are both...
- Oh, come on, Michael.
What is this?
Ultimate Frisbee?
We only win by making them lose?
Yes.
You act like you're not paying attention, but I know you're paying attention.
This is a PR war.
And I'm a traitor?
In February, Israeli soldiers helped a Palestinian woman give birth.
You didn't read about it unless you subscribed to the Israel National News.
Two days later, an Israeli woman gave birth in a Palestinian hospital.
Where did you read it?
AP, CBS News, every major paper.
Google it, go ahead.
This is a PR war and they are winning.
Michael.
I do not go to your house and tell you what novels to write.
I do not go to your committee and tell you what lobbyists to hire.
Oh.
That's it.
Now I get it.
I didn't hire you.
There it is.
I hired Tarkovsky and Associates.
With a $20-million Jewish League Fund to fight intolerance?
Yes, you did.
So this isn't Israel-Palestine to you.
It's Gold versus Tarkovsky.
You're paying a competitor, Michael.
And as moved as I am by your plea for Jewish brotherhood,
I'm not that moved.
Four thousand years and we are always our own worst enemy.
So you were driving Jimal's car that night, right?
This is just like the cops.
Racist.
They think an Arab had to do it.
Yeah, but this is you, isn't it, Amir?
Driving your roommate's car that night, right?
No.
And do you know why it's not me?
Look at your time code, lady.
I was in my living room.
For salah.
- Evening prayers.
- Anybody else see you there?
AMIR:
Yes.
- Who?
The prophet Muhammad.
Peace be upon him.
Yeah, Amir's in the living room five times a day praying.
Okay, Tariq.
Did you see him praying on the night of the murder?
- No.
- So you were home?
You were home to be able to not see him there?
No, I was out.
In Jimal's car?
No, I wanted to take it, but the keys were gone already.
- So where were you?
- I was here.
- In the quad at the interfaith rally.
- Hmm.
Sophia.
Kalinda.
Hi.
I didn't see you over there.
This is how you investigate these days?
By just following me?
Yep.
Makes things a lot easier.
So you and Cary, huh?
That's why you've been ignoring me, right?
It's not because I'm married.
Yep.
You got me.
Listen, I'm gonna go and question eyewitnesses at the Jewish frat.
Do you want the address?
Where's the fun in that?
ALICIA:
Your Honor, this is...
- This is prosecutorial misconduct.
KARPMAN:
Okay, okay.
ALICIA:
This is absolutely unethical.
KARPMAN:
All right.
To your corners.
Mrs. Florrick, your client already swore that that was him in the car.
Is he now trying to say he lied?
He's saying he was misled by the prosecution.
- How did I mislead?
ALICIA:
Jimal was given an opportunity to avoid a hate-crime prosecution and he took it, that's all.
This murder charge is based on nothing else.
There's no evidence that Jimal and the victim even knew each other.
Where's the motive?
Mr. Greenberg was Jewish and Jimal was Muslim.
As you can see, a swastika was drawn on the victim's...
ALICIA:
Oh, come on.
Anti-Semitism isn't some cookie-cutter motive
- you can apply to any dark-skinned...
- Counselors, listen.
Nobody likes a street fight better than me, but that's for in the street, not here.
Mr. Agos, do you have any further probable cause?
Because if it's just that statement, I am prone to overturn.
We do, Your Honor.
FINEMAN:
Professor Noah Fineman.
I teach Political Science.
And did the accused show a particular interest
- in one of your lectures?
- He did.
Uh, it's a lecture that I give on the anniversary of 9/11 about chickens who come home to roost for the United States and Zionist regime in Israel.
Objection.
Your Honor, is Mr. Agos really trying to find a motive in Jimal's classes?
Why not Home Ec?
Maybe that's where
- Heh.
- The knife came from.
KARPMAN:
Overruled.
I think we can stand a bit of rough-and-tumble here, counselor.
So, professor, you would argue that Israel's a criminal regime?
FINEMAN:
Oh, I don't argue it.
I think that's fairly self-evident.
CARY:
Given this, what do you think of suicide bombings and the death of Jewish citizens?
FINEMAN:
If you're asking me if I approve of such a thing?
No, never.
But I do understand them.
These are understandable movements against a Zionist oppression.
And how did your student Jimal take an added interest in this lecture?
Well, he was, uh, very engaged in class, yes.
And afterwards, he approached me to ask me questions about my newest book:
Zionist Occupation
- The Need for Realignment and New Thinking.
Borderday Press.
Thank you, professor.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Actually, professor, I have a few questions.
My client was very engaged in your lecture, you said?
How did you witness this?
Well, if you teach students long enough, you get a sense.
And for how long did you teach Jimal?
Well, it's been four weeks since the beginning of the semester.
So, uh, four weeks, that's, uh, 20 sessions.
And for how many of those sessions were you actually present?
I don't understand.
How many of those 20 sessions were you actually there teaching and not having one of your TAs do it?
Uh...
Didn't you only lecture the class twice, professor?
Well, I would question your use of the word "only."
But, uh...
Yes.
And yet you really focused with your laser-like perception on Jimal and his engagement.
- You're being a bit rude.
ALICIA:
Yes.
And I'm just getting started.
So after one of your lectures,
Jimal came to you to ask you about your book.
How do you know this?
Because I keep a record next to my attendance.
See?
That asterisk tells me that I must send them an e-mail
- about my book.
- And, of course, you recognize Jimal,
- over there?
FINEMAN:
Oh, yes.
This record attendance, the students sign themselves in, yes?
- Yes, it's a very efficient way to work.
ALICIA:
I'm sure.
- Do you see Jimal's name there?
- It's in here.
- That's not his handwriting.
CARY:
Objection.
That's the handwriting of his roommate, Tariq, also a student in your class who signed him in so that Jimal could cut class.
Well, I'd say things have been pretty easy for you up until now.
Really?
How's that?
In court, these people don't really know how you think.
But you do?
Hate to tell you this, but we're gonna beat you.
[CHUCKLES]
Good luck with that.
[PETER LAUGHS]

[MAN GROANS]
"Battle M. E:
Gaza Strip" It's one of my best MMOGs.
And what is an MMOG?
Massive multiplayer online game.
CARY:
Meaning people log onto their computers
- and battle each other.
STEVE:
Yep.
What are we looking at now?
Uh, well, that's the recorded actions of Samson 5.
That's the avatar of the accused, Jimal...
ALICIA:
Objection.
Your Honor, what does this have to do with the death of Simon Greenberg?
- Goes to motive.
- What is that assault weapon there?
- Is that an Uzi?
- No.
It's a Galil 5.56.
KARPMAN:
What's the range?
STEVE:
Four hundred and fifty meters.
Cool.
Proceed.
Well, that's Jimal's avatar there.
The guy running.
And what is he wearing?
Oh, that?
That's a suicide vest.
[MAN SPEAKING ARABIC ON TV]
[GUNFIRE ON TV]
He's wearing a suicide vest?
And what is he entering?
STEVE:
That's a civilian Israeli building.
That's a school, in fact...
Your Honor, this is a game.
Mr. Al-Said was just here.
He wants us to pull out of Jimal's defense.
He is afraid defending a youth who makes light of a suicide bombing will undercut Eli's pro-Muslim campaign.
He wasn't making light of it.
He was playing a video game.
In which he killed a schoolhouse full of kids.
Yes, but in a video game.
Have you seen video games lately?
We can't abandon Jimal.
He was looking at misdemeanor battery.
We helped him into a murder charge.
We?
I helped him into a murder charge, which I did as a representative of this firm.
- We made a commitment to him.
- What do you think?
I think your friend will pull out of Eli's campaign and go right back to his old firm with his $10 million.
Yeah.
Still, retail rules.
We broke it, we own it?
Okay.
We'll stick with Jimal.
Win this one.
- No.
- No what?
No, Mr. Al-Said?
[CHUCKLES]
I'm coming here as a courtesy.
I don't need your campaign anymore.
I'm taking my business back to my old firm.
Oh, that's too bad because I already cashed your check.
You did not.
I did.
You know us Jews.
- Heh, you'd do anything to piss me off.
You're right.
But I still have a great pro-Muslim campaign for you.
[SCOFFS]
Good doing business with you.
Did you hear the one about the Arab and the Jew?
No.
But I'm sure it's very funny.
An Arab and a Jew walk into a bar.
And then they kill each other.
JENNIFER: "Energy is radiated and absorbed in quanta, matched to?"
Patterns of black body radiation.
You know that's bad for you?
Uh-huh.
GRACE:
It's like the equivalent of three buckets of popcorn.
But I don't want three buckets of popcorn.
[TRAIN DOOR CHIMES]
- Oh, my God.
- What?
Okay, I need your help.
[TEDDYBEARS' "ROCKET SCIENTIST" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
Don't shake the camera.
Just keep it steady.
- What are you doing?
- Look at the color.
It's Bollywood.
You can't pass up Bollywood.
Do you know them?
No.
It's chance.
I do this all the time.
Grace, camera up.
What are you doing?
Good to have you back, Mr. Sartori.
Yeah.
So tell me, what is a power-up?
[CHUCKLES]
Sorry, this is the only place in the world where I have to explain a power-up.
Um, in a video game, it's something that you collect to give you extra power.
Like a gun.
Or, you know, ammunition.
So would anyone ever pass up a power-up?
[SCOFFS]
No.
Not unless you're crazy.
You never know when you'll run out of ammunition.
So this suicide vest that Jimal's avatar is wearing, what is that?
It's a power-up.
And everybody who plays your game grabs one?
At one point or another.
ALICIA:
In fact, according to your own logs, many ASAs in Mr. Agos' office...
- Objection.
KARPMAN:
Overruled.
Many ASAs in Mr. Agos' office have collected such suicide packs?
Yeah.
It's a part of the game.
It's not a thing.
But doesn't that mean these ASAs are more likely to have murdered Simon Greenberg?
- Heh, Your Honor.
- Psst.
KARPMAN:
Mrs. Florrick?
Mrs. Florrick, any further questions?
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Sartori, Jimal's roommate, Amir Al-Fulan,
- he played your online game too?
- I have no idea.
ALICIA:
This is a record of your subpoenaed logs.
- Can you read that there?
STEVE:
Oh, yeah.
And you had to reduce his privileges because he fought with another player, didn't he?
Yeah, he, uh, got in a fight online.
Uh, on the "Battle M.E." board.
And who did he fight with?
Can you read that there?
You had to reduce both their privileges.
Simon Greenberg.
ALICIA:
Thank you.
Jimal's roommate, Amir, is the most likely suspect.
But he has an alibi.
Praying.
Yes, but he was alone.
What about the other roommate?
Tariq.
We can't find any contact between Tariq and the victim.
And he doesn't have the political motive.
Amir is the Palestinian hardliner.
Tariq could care less.
Okay.
Thank you, Alicia.
Uh, keep us in touch.
What do you think?
I think you're holding something against her.
- I'm what?
- Alicia.
Maybe it's unconscious, maybe it's not, but you're being hard on her.
No.
She's a third-year associate on a partner track, and she's treating us like peers.
That's all you're seeing.
My God, am I the only adult left here?
Could everybody just put their emotions away?
I gotta get to a meeting unless you have some other stray observations for me.
[SCOFFS]
Are we overdoing it?
Diane thinks I'm going too hard on you.
Am I?
Going too hard?
[ALICIA CHUCKLING]
All those late nights.
No time off.
Buried in work.
[ALICIA MOANS THEN GASPS]
- Up to my knees.
WILL:
Mm-hm.
[DOOR OPENS]
GIRL:
He's doing it again, Mom!
He's doing it again!
It's just my neighbors.
GIRL:
Just give it to me already.
- Come on, let's go to the bedroom.
- No, no, no.
Don't move.
Don't move.
GIRL:
Mom!
Tell him to give it to me.
Mom!
Leg is done, the chops are ready to go.
I'm just warming up the leg of lamb piece after it's been reposing for ten or 15 minutes just to...
We need to eat better.
I like what we eat.
No, I need to cook.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
You're happier without Dad.
No, I'm happier with you.
Okay, that was such a mom thing to say.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
No, it's about Dad.
Does that upset you?
No.
I don't know.
You know I love Dad.
I know.
I'm sorry.
No.
I found you a new tutor.
Dana.
I think you'll like her, she's social.
Actually, I think I like this one now.
You...
I thought you said she was too different.
She is, heh.
But sometimes different isn't always bad.
She's coming over to help me set up my computer tomorrow.
- What?
- She's setting up your computer?
I asked her to.
Please tell me you're learning something, that this isn't all pointless.
I'm learning something.
So how do you explain that, Amir?
I don't explain it.
You said you didn't know the victim, Simon Greenberg, and here you are on a video game fighting with him.
I don't need to talk to you.
You got no authority here.
Hey, you wanna make yourself useful in here?
I just got the authority.
He claims it wasn't him.
It wasn't him what?
Fighting against Greenberg?
On the video game.
Amir says it was Tariq.
He let him use his screen name.
These roommates, they share everything.
So I'm checking Tariq, but we're back to square one.
Amir had a motive:
Politics, fanaticism.
Tariq isn't political or religious.
I wonder if we're making a mistake thinking it's about Middle Eastern politics.
These kids, they're just college kids.
BAILIFF:
All rise.
Okay, I'll keep checking, but I'll need some time.
BAILIFF:
Judge Karpman presiding.
Thank you.
Please be seated.
So this is where we stand.
There is sufficient evidence for a finding of probable cause.
Further, we set this case on my trial...
Your Honor, we ask that you recuse yourself.
- Excuse me?
ALICIA:
We believe you have shown bias against our client.
Believe?
Really?
In what way?
Your religion.
This is outrageous.
I'm...
My Jewish background is completely irrelevant in this case.
Your Honor, you have given money to the Outlook for Israel, an organization that supports the settlements in Israel.
We believe you have shown bias against our client, and we ask that a new judge hear further proceedings.
I'll give you my answer in an hour.
[GAVEL BANGS]
- He's not gonna recuse himself.
- He will.
Karpman always backs down when he's pushed.
He's afraid he'll be overturned on appeal.
- So we start over with a new judge.
- No.
I know what Alicia's doing.
Oh, hi, Michael.
How are you?
I was just sitting here going over this campaign.
Arab Spring.
Sort of like Irish Spring.
But with Arabs.
- Do you want some coffee?
- How much?
For the coffee?
How much for six months if I brought the Jewish League Fund here?
How much are you paying Tarkovsky and Associates?
You know how much.
Well, of course, we would have to tell Mr. Al-Said we can't handle his account anymore, so if you'd help us defer those costs...
You're really a son of a bitch.
I am.
But now I'm your son of a bitch.
BAILIFF:
All rise.
Judge Karpman presiding.
Please be seated.
I've taken a great deal of time with this motion because I believe that part of being a tough judge is also being a fair judge.
Your Honor, may I quickly interrupt?
Can't imagine why, counselor.
I'm ready to rule.
Yes, but, I believe Mrs. Florrick is attempting to manipulate this court.
Excuse me!
If you recuse yourself, the court will choose a new judge tomorrow?
- Is that correct?
- Yes, it is.
- You were about to make your ruling?
- That's what she's counting on.
You know what tomorrow is, Your Honor?
- What tomorrow is?
CARY:
The holiday.
That has nothing to do with my motion.
It's Rosh Hashanah.
There will be no Jewish judges in court, the case will be assigned to a non-Jewish judge.
Why she's asking you to recuse yourself.
Your Honor, this is offensive!
KARPMAN:
Mrs. Florrick,
I am disappointed in you.
The motion is denied.
Case remains on my trial call.
[POP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
Hi, Tariq.
How are you?
So, what, are you following me?
No.
I'm following her.
Hey, Tariq.
You know, if you're looking for a more discreet gay bar,
- I'd try Scarlet's on Halsted.
KALINDA:
No.
I'd try Sidetrack.
- It's too leathery.
- What do you need?
You used Amir's avatar on "Battle M.E.,"
- the online video game.
- So?
So that's where you met Simon Greenberg.
- No.
- Yeah.
Actually, yeah.
Checked your alibi.
Didn't hold up, Tariq.
You weren't at the interfaith rally.
Why would I kill Greenberg?
It makes no sense.
We spoke to the bartender.
He said you met Greenberg here quite a few times.
My guess is you two fell in love.
You argued, he met someone else.
You got jealous.
You stabbed him.
Made it look like a hate crime.
[TARIQ GROANS]
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't!
Why the reversed swastika?
SOPHIA:
What?
- When you set it up as a hate crime, why draw the swastika backward?
What do you mean?
Isn't that how you draw it?
[SCOFFS]
Is it good for the Jewish League Fund?
I don't know.
The Muslim was the killer, but he was also gay, and sleeping with our guy, so, uh...
I would call that a classic mixed message.
[WHISPERS] Crisis management.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] If it helps, I could find out if he's a top.
[CHUCKLES]
That was a joke.
Yeah.
Okay, I gotta go.
Important work?
ELl:
Fate of the world.
- What do you think?
- It's very flattering, Eli.
But I can't be thinking about the governorship when I'm doing this job.
So do this job.
Let me think about the governorship.
Just an observation from work:
If you're worried about Alicia and Will Gardner...
I'm not worried.
I know.
I know, but, uh, if you were,
I think that whatever was there is no more.
They barely look at each other.
Eli.
You don't want a divorced candidate, do you?
No, I...
Forget it.
[LAUGHS]
[COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
You need a friend, K.
Why do I need a friend?
Or a dog.
Maybe you need a dog.
Kalinda and pooch.
- Out investigating.
- Heh.
I'm fine, Will.
Really.
WOMEN:
I mean, what's wrong with me?
We're not like normal people, are we?
What are normal people like?
Emotional.
- You're emotional.
- No.
Sometimes I'm in the middle of an emotion, and I just look at myself and realize
I'm not feeling anything.
I just like acting like someone who feels something.
You wanna stop acting and actually feel?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[BANGS TABLE]
Ow.
That's what it feels like.
- Thanks.
- Heh.
All right, I gotta go.
I gotta be somewhere at 8:45.
Really?
That specific.
Yup.
Be good.
PETER:
I'll get them to school on Monday.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
[SIGHS]
ZACH:
Do we take our homework?
ALICIA PETER [IN UNISON]:
Yes.
- So you've hired a tutor for Grace?
ALICIA:
Yes, I did.
She's good, I think, and Grace likes her.
Or she likes her now.
I'll keep an eye on that.
Oh, um, also, Zach's girlfriend, Nisa, her parents wanted us to come for dinner.
I'll tell her you're busy.
Yeah, yeah.
Tell her I'm busy.
ZACH:
Love you.
- Love you.
GRACE:
Love you.
- I love you.
You call if you need anything.
I'll be here.

* Baby did a bad, bad thing *
* Baby did a bad, bad thing *
It was e-mailed to campus inboxes.
Do you know who sent it?
My guess is Tau Kappa Theta, the Jewish fraternity.
- I'm not saying anything bad.
- No, of course not.
I just think it was this video that provoked the fight
- at the interfaith rally.
- And you want us to defend...?
Jimal Mifsud.
Scholarship student in Science.
His family is in Jiddah, and he can't afford a lawyer.
Do you know his family?
No, I am purely an interested bystander here who wants to see justice done.
Purely?
There's a campus fistfight between a dozen Palestinian and Jewish youths, and the State's Attorney only charges one Palestinian?
Well, he doesn't have a record, so it should be a simple misdemeanor battery.
Court supervision, at most.
No, the new State's Attorney wants to appear tough on his first day.
It was deemed a hate crime.
Seven years.
Alicia, meet Wasim Al-Said, an old friend who until recently retained our competitor Young, Bachman and Meyers
- for his legal interest.
- To my eternal regret.
- Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
- Alicia's fine.
Your husband was very good to the Muslim community in his first term.
My fear is, that's changed.
Of course, Alicia can't influence her husband in any way, but she is still one of our best lawyers.
Well, that's all Jimal needs.
This is a good kid they're painting as a suicide bomber.
Bond hearing's today.
I'll be there.
Good, that's one piece of business.
What else might we handle that Young, Bachman and Meyers can't?
I know that Eli Gold is working with you these days?
I'm in need of some crisis management.
- What's the crisis?
- Where's the management?
Will you get, uh, Eli for us?
And ask Will to step in.
Will?
Sure.
He's late.
Overslept.
Must be from celebrating yesterday's victory.
- Must be.
- Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Hey, Mom, pick up...
Hello, dearest daughter.
You sound happy.
I am happy.
I have my daughter on the phone.
What more could I desire?
Look, I don't think I need a tutor.
Grace, we discussed this.
It's just a month.
- Yeah, but it was one report card.
- And it's one month.
Dad just thinks I need to apply myself.
Oh, I agree, and a tutor will help you do that.
Eli?
The meeting.
Mom, Nisa's parents want you to come over for dinner.
- You and Dad.
Both of you.
- Why?
Just to be nice.
I didn't tell them anything.
I haven't let anyone know you guys are separated.
Hey!
Okay, I'll talk to your father about it.
I-I've got to go.
So, who is this guy again?
Wasim Al-Said.
He's a commodities trader.
Wasim?
Diane's been trying to sign him for two years.
He has ten million in charitable assets to spend.
On what?
A campaign against anti-Muslim bigotry.
Mr. Al-Said, you do know that I'm not a PR specialist.
I handle lobbying and crisis management.
Do you watch the evening news, Eli?
Religiously.
Then you know there was a murder of a Jewish poli sci major at Chicago Polytech last night.
Unsolved, but the police are questioning Muslim students.
Ten minutes later, a riot broke out at the other end of campus at a rally intended to encourage interfaith dialogue, and only one Muslim was arrested.
Now I'm used to reading the tea leaves in this country, and the best way to manage a crisis is before it becomes one.
Isn't that true?
It is.
So, are you hiring me because I'm good or because I'm Jewish?
Because I imagine it might look quite good having a Jew campaign for Muslims.
Can't it be both?
- I don't like being used.
- Really?
Since when?
He knows Jewish money is going to Peter for his next campaign
- and he wants to buy influence.
- And...?
Don't you get so knowing on me.
What's up with you, anyway?
You seem different.
Where you going?
- Court.
- Why?
I'm a lawyer.
Okay, glad we cleared that up.
This is a hate crime, Your Honor, and we ask that bail be set at $100,000.
Have you ever been in a fistfight, Counselor?
Have I, Your Honor?
Uh, no.
Well, let me educate you.
It's chaos, chaos in there.
No one can tell who hits who.
Fists are flying, you get hit in the head.
The next thing you know, you're on the ground and somebody's jumping...
- Jimal, I'm sorry to be late.
I was...
- Jimal assaulted someone because he was Jewish.
That is not chaos, Your Honor.
And Jimal was hit because he's Palestinian, Your Honor.
Alicia Florrick, Your Honor.
20 students were fighting.
Only one was charged.
One Muslim.
- His religion had nothing to...
- It had everything to do with it.
All right, okay, your passion is preserved for the record.
Bond is set at $5,000.
And I do suggest that the State reconsider its charge.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Jimal, I was just put in on this.
You have a benefactor who asked me to step in.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I know, a lot of this is posturing by the prosecution to get you to accept a higher plea.
The good news is, the judge is on your side.
Now, do you want me to call your parents or anything?
No, no they wouldn't...
Look, I'm ashamed.
I understand.
Hopefully, we can handle this
- by admitting simple battery.
- But I didn't.
I wasn't even there.
He wasn't at the rally, Cary.
He was at the library.
Oh, my God, really?
That's terrible.
This isn't about Jimal, and this isn't about some stupid fistfight.
This is about that Jewish kid stabbed to death, and you can't find the killer so Jimal is the scapegoat.
We have an eyewitness who saw Jimal throw the first punch.
- That's what this is about.
- Is the eyewitness Caucasian?
Oh, wow, how quickly we slip the bonds of political correctness.
- Why not ask if he's Jewish?
- Cross-racial identification.
Caucasians have difficulty discerning unique characteristics.
Six months in County, one year probation.
No.
Then I'll see you in court.
Tell Peter there has to be a better way to firm up his campaign contributions.
Using everything we can, are we?
It's a new day.
We're running a clean office.
Let me say that again, because we're all prone to the same cynicism.
We... are running a clean office.
Clean, ethical, honest, but not weak.
I know our budgets have been slashed.
I know we're the underdog here.
But our strategy will be this:
no plea bargains.
That's right.
Defense attorneys will be expecting the opposite.
So for the next two months,
I want you to hold the line on every single plea.
After that, you won't have to work as hard.
You get your enemy flinching, you'll never have to hit him hard again.
Your first complaint will be about investigator hours.
That's why I've hired an outside contractor until we can budget full time.
I want you to meet Sophia Russo.
She's good, and she's cheap.
Thanks!
Relatively.
Mr. Florrick, I offered the defense six months on the college hate crime.
Should I walk it back?
What's the law say?
Three to seven years.
There's your answer.
The lawyer's Alicia, and she might come after your campaign contributions.
Really?
Yeah.
What do you want?
Follow the law.
You can't go wrong if you follow the law.
All right.
Geez, what a pit.
- Thank you.
- You're working on the, uh, the Jewish-Muslim thing, right?
Yeah, the hate crime.
Why?
What do you need?
Oh, it's not what I need.
What is this?
You used to work with Kalinda Sharma, didn't you?
Yeah.
If I were you, I'd slip it to her.
* *
So, kind of odd not seeing you around much.
Yeah, I've been busy.
Yeah.
And here I thought you didn't need me anymore.
What's that?
It's a peace offering.
Peter Florrick wants to run a clean office, so... this is me being clean.
You're welcome.
You can't make Chicagoans feel good about Islam with pathos.
You need to go positive.
Link the Arab Spring to the American Revolution.
Who is the Islamic George Washington?
Who is the Islamic Paul Revere?
Morning in the Middle East...
Do you need something?
It's on your desk.
It's self-explanatory.
That's your car?
Good.
Now, I know you said you were at the library.
But the time code on that traffic light shows that the driver of your car was running a red light just outside the campus gates at the exact moment of the interfaith rally.
That means that the driver of your car, if that is you, couldn't have been involved in the rally fight.
Do you understand?
I do.
So, I want you to take your time before you answer.
Is that you driving your car?
It is.
Are you certain, young man?
It's a very roundabout way to come from the library.
I'm sure.
We ask that Mr. Mifsud state under oath that he was the driver in this photo which we will mark as People's Exhibit #1.
Your Honor, is that really necessary?
It's the only way we'll drop the hate charge.
Very well.
Mr. Mifsud, you are under oath.
Do you swear that that's you in the photo?
Yes.
Good.
Well, I think that just about, uh, wraps it up, doesn't it, Mr. Agos?
I'm late for the gym.
It does, Your Honor, and the State has made a terrible mistake in charging Mr. Mifsud with this battery, But this car with this license plate was seen racing away from the scene
- of the frat murder of Simon Greenberg...
- Objection, Your Honor!
- That is why he ran the red light.
- Oh, this is outrageous.
- He had just killed Simon Greenberg.
- This is prosecutorial misconduct!
He swore to it.
His alibi means he committed this murder.
Because you overcharged him with a hate crime so he would grab at any alibi.
So you're saying your client perjured himself?
No, I am saying he took my advice, that's all.
Well, then congratulations, Alicia.
You just advised your client to admit to murder.
Your Honor, the People charge Jimal Mifsud with first-degree murder.
The Good Wife S03E01 "A New Day" Original Air Date September 25, 2011
Alicia dropped by for you.
Why?
I don't know.
You want me to get her?
No.
Later.
So this isn't you?
It's your car, but you're not driving it?
I'm sorry, I, uh, I thought it was the easiest way out.
So who is it?
Who's driving it?
I don't know.
Jimal, they have a witness who swears that that car... your car... was driven away by Simon Greenberg's killer.
So don't cover for anyone.
I'm not covering.
My-my two roommates don't have a car,
I let Amir and Tariq use mine.
I just leave my keys in the room.
So which is driving it, Amir or Tariq?
I don't know.
But he swore that was him driving away from the murder?
He didn't know it would implicate him in a murder.
It's my fault.
I encouraged him to place himself in the car to give him an alibi from the hate crime.
Yes.
And now I have a multimillion-dollar client thinking that we're amateurs.
I got the pictures from the ASA's office.
- I should've checked.
- Great.
It's everybody's fault.
Now let's make it right.
I'm questioning Jimal's roommates.
One of them is the real driver.
And I'm filing a motion to dismiss
Jimal's alibi statement during preliminary.
I don't know what's going on with you two, but make it better.
Whatever you have to do.
Make it better.
So are we supposed to do something?
Sure.
- What subject?
- I don't know.
You're the tutor.
What does your mom want?
She wants me to get better grades, so that I'll get into Briarcrest.
You don't like public school?
No, I do.
It's just that there was a mugging on the field, and all the parents got really scared.
Is this your first job tutoring?
Yeah.
How am I doing?
Not so good.
Darn.
Can we go outside?
Yeah, I think it's up to you.
Cary the man!
Throwing down that opposition.
Nicely played.
Thanks.
So this is the new Cary?
No, just a new day.
So can I see the crime scene photos, Cary?
Well, come on.
You're in the big leagues now.
What can it hurt?
I'll think about it.
Oh.
Well, looky who's here.
Sophia?
In the flesh.
Strange bedfellows, huh?
The strangest.
Well... you two have a nice time.
What'd she want?
Oh.
Crime scene photos.
Damn it.
Okay, uh, Simon Greenberg, 22, found in his dorm room gagged, hands bound, stabbed 45 times.
- Little overkill?
- Yep.
Police think it was an execution.
No sign of a struggle.
Any witnesses?
Neighbor heard a scream, looked out his window and saw a dark, possibly black Middle Eastern man running to his car.
They got a number plate...
ET27.
Damn.
That's not a partial plate.
Yeah, I know.
Jimal's plate.
Um, one other thing.
Something that wasn't released to the press.
What?
Killer drew a swastika with the victim's blood.
Ugh.
Yep.
I know this is not looking good, is it?
Okay, um, let me know what you get from the roommates.
Got it.
Oh, by the way, the swastika...
the police don't know why, but it was drawn backwards.
Okay.
Hi.
Am I interrupting?
Nope.
How are you?
Good.
Do you have a moment to talk?
About last night?
Yeah.
Don't act like this is nothing, Eli.
You're running a pro-Palestinian campaign.
It's an anti-
Muslim-bigotry campaign, and I am a crisis man...
You are a Jew.
- We are both...
- Oh, come on, Michael!
What is this?
Ultimate Frisbee?
We only win by making them lose?
Yes.
You act like you're not paying attention, but I know you're paying attention.
This is a PR war.
And I'm a traitor?
In February, Israeli soldiers helped a Palestinian woman give birth.
You didn't read about it unless you subscribed to the Israel National News.
Two days later, an Israeli woman gave birth in a Palestinian hospital.
Where did you read it?
AP, CBS News, every major paper.
Google it.
Go ahead.
This is a PR war and they are winning.
Michael.
I do not go to your house and tell you what novels to write.
I do not go to your committee and tell you what lobbyists to hire.
Oh.
That's it.
Now I get it.
I didn't hire you.
There it is.
I hired Tarkovsky Associates.
With a $20 million Jewish League Fund to fight intolerance.
Yes, you did.
So this isn't Israel/Palestine to you.
It's Gold versus Tarkovsky.
You're paying a competitor, Michael.
And as moved as I am by your plea for
Jewish brotherhood,
I'm not that moved.
4,000 years and we are always our own worst enemy.
So you were driving Jimal's car that night, right?
This is just like the cops.
Racist.
They think an Arab had to do it.
Yeah, but this is you, isn't it, Amir?
You were driving your roommate's car that night, right?
No.
And you know why it's not me?
Look at your time code, lady.
I was in my living room for salah.
Evening prayers.
Anybody else see you there?
- Yes.
- Who?
The Prophet Muhammad.
Peace be upon him.
Yeah, Amir's in the living room five times a day praying.
Okay, Tariq.
Did you see him praying on the night of the murder?
- No.
- So you were home?
You were home to be able to not see him there?
No, I was out.
In Jimal's car?
No, I wanted to take it, but the keys were gone already.
So where were you?
I was here.
In the quad at the interfaith rally.
Sophia.
Kalinda.
Hi.
I didn't see you over there.
This is how you investigate these days?
- By just following me?
- Yep.
Makes things a lot easier.
So you and Cary, huh?
That's why you've been ignoring me, right?
It's not because I'm married.
Yep.
You got me.
Listen, I'm gonna go and question eyewitnesses at the Jewish frat.
Do you want the address?
Where's the fun in that?
Your Honor, this is...
- This is prosecutorial misconduct.
- Okay, okay, okay.
This is absolutely unethical.
All right, all right.
Each to your corners.
Mrs. Florrick, your client already swore that that was him in the car.
Is he now trying to say that he lied?
He's saying that he was misled by the prosecution.
How did I mislead?
Jimal was given an opportunity to avoid a hate crime prosecution and he took it, that's all.
This murder charge is based on nothing else.
There's no evidence that
Jimal and the victim even knew each other.
Where's the motive?
Mr. Greenberg was Jewish and Jimal was Muslim, and as you can see here, Your Honor, a swastika was drawn on the victim's...
Oh, come on.
Anti-Semitism isn't some cookie cutter motive you can apply
- to any dark-skinned...
- All right, counselors, listen.
Nobody likes a street fight better than me, but that's for in the street, not here.
Mr. Agos, do you have any further probable cause?
Because if it's just that statement,
I am prone to overturn.
We do, Your Honor.
Professor Noah Fineman.
I teach political science.
And did the accused show a particular interest in one of your lectures?
He did.
It's a lecture that I give on the anniversary of 9/11 about chickens who come home to roost for the United States and Zionist regime in Israel...
Objection.
Your Honor, is Mr. Agos really trying to find a motive in Jimal's classes?
Why not home ec?
- Maybe that's where the knife came from.
- Overruled.
I think we can stand a bit of rough and tumble here, Counselor.
So, Professor, you would argue that Israel's a criminal regime.
Oh, I-I don't argue it.
I think that's fairly self-evident.
Given this, what do you think of suicide bombings and the death of Jewish citizens?
If you're asking me if I approve of such a thing, no, never.
But I do understand them.
These are understandable movements against a Zionist oppression.
And how did your student Jimal take an added interest in this lecture?
Well, he was, uh, very engaged in class, yes.
And afterwards, he approached me to ask me questions about my newest book,
Zionist Occupation:
the Need for Realignment and New Thinking.
Bordinay Press.
Thank you, Professor.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Actually, Professor,
I have a few questions.
My client was very engaged in your lecture, you said?
How did you witness this?
Well, if you teach students long enough, you get a sense.
And for how long did you teach Jimal?
Well, it's been four weeks since the beginning of the semester.
So four weeks, that's, uh, 20 sessions.
And for how many of those sessions were you actually present?
I don't understand.
How many of those 20 sessions were you actually there teaching and not having one of your TA's do it?
- Uh...
- Didn't you only lecture the class twice, Professor?
Well, I would question your use of the word "only,"
but, uh... yes.
And yet you really focused with your laser-like perception on Jimal and his engagement.
You're being a bit rude.
Yes, and I'm just getting started.
So, after one of your lectures,
Jimal came to you to ask you about your book.
How do you know this?
Because I keep a record next to my attendance.
See?
That asterisk tells me that I must send them an e-mail about my book.
And, of course, you recognize Jimal, over there?
Oh, yes.
This record attendance, the students sign themselves in, yes?
Yes, it's a very efficient way to work.
I'm sure.
Do you see Jimal's name there?
It's him there.
- That's not his handwriting.
- Objection.
That's the handwriting of his roommate,
Tariq, also a student in your class who signed him in so that Jimal could cut class.
Well, I'd say things have been pretty easy for you up until now.
Really?
How's that?
In court, these people don't really know how you think.
But you do?
Hate to tell you this but we're going to beat you.
Good luck with that.
Battle M.E. Gaza Strip
It's one of my best MMOGs.
And what is an MMOG?
Massive Multiplayer Online Game.
Meaning people log onto their computers
- and battle each other.
- Yep.
What are we looking at now?
Uh, well, that's the recorded actions of Sampson5.
That's the avatar of the accused, Jimal...
Objection.
Your Honor, what does this have to do with the death of Simon Greenberg?
Goes to motive, Your Honor.
What is that assault weapon over there, is that an uzi?
No, it's a Galil 5.56.
What's the range of fire?
450 meters.
Cool.
Proceed.
Well, that's Jimal's avatar there.
The guy running.
And what is he wearing?
Oh, that?
That's a suicide vest.
He's wearing a suicide vest?
And what is he entering?
That's a civilian Israeli building.
That's a school, in fact...
Your Honor, this is a game.
Mr. Al-Said was just here.
He wants us to pull out of Jimal's defense.
He is afraid defending a youth who makes light of a suicide bombing will undercut Eli's pro-Muslim campaign.
He wasn't making light of it.
He was playing a video game.
In which he killed a schoolhouse full of kids.
Yes, but in a video game.
Have you seen video games lately?
We can't abandon Jimal.
He was looking at misdemeanor battery.
We helped him into a murder charge.
"We"?
I... helped him into a murder charge, which I did as a representative of this firm.
We made a commitment to him.
What do you think?
I think your friend will pull out of Eli's campaign and go right back to his old firm with his $10 million.
Yeah.
Still, retail rules.
We broke it, we own it?
Okay, we'll stick with Jimal.
Win this one.
No.
No, what?
No, Mr. Al-Said.
I'm coming here as a courtesy.
I don't need your campaign anymore.
I'm taking my business back to my old firm.
Oh, that's too bad because I already cashed your check.
You did not.
I did.
You know us Jews.
You'd do anything to piss me off.
You're right.
But I have still got a great pro-Muslim campaign for you.
Good doing business with you.
Did you hear the one about the Arab and the Jew?
No.
But I'm sure it's very funny.
An Arab and a Jew walk into a bar.
And then they kill each other.
Energy is radiated and absorbed in quanta, matched to...?
Patterns of black body radiation.
You know that's bad for you?
Uh-huh.
It's like the equivalent of three buckets of popcorn.
But I don't want three buckets of popcorn.
Oh, my God.
What?
Okay, I need your help.
Don't shake the camera.
Just keep it steady.
What are you doing?
Look at the color.
It's Bollywood.
You can't pass up Bollywood.
Do you know them?
No.
It's chance.
I do this all the time.
Grace, camera up.
* *
What are you doing?
* I'm not a rocket scientist *
* I rock the house and sign the... *
* Don't take no astrophysicist *
* To make your ass throw fits, now sisters kick it *
* I keep it cool like Eskimo chicks on Discovery Channel... *
Good to have you back, Mr. Sartori.
Yeah.
So tell me, what is a power-up?
Sorry, this is the only place in the world where I have to explain a power-up.
Um, in a video game, it's something that you collect to give you extra power.
Like a gun, or, you know, ammunition.
So, would anyone ever pass up a power-up?
Huh?
No.
Not unless you're crazy.
You never know when you'll run out of ammunition.
So this suicide vest that Jimal's avatar is wearing, what is that?
It's a power-up.
And everybody who plays your game grabs one?
At one point or another.
In fact, according to your own logs, many ASAs in Mr. Agos's office...
- Objection.
- Overruled.
...many ASAs in Mr. Agos's office have collected such suicide packs?
Yeah, it's a part of the game.
It's not a thing.
But doesn't that mean these ASAs are more likely to have murdered Simon Greenberg?
- Your Honor.
- Psst.
Mrs. Florrick?
Mrs. Florrick, any further questions?
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Sartori,
Jimal's roommate, Amir Al-Fulan, he played your online game, too?
I have no idea.
This is a record of your subpoenaed logs.
Can you read that there?
Oh, yeah.
And you had to reduce his privileges because he fought with another player, didn't he?
Yeah, he, uh, he got in a fight online.
On the Battle M.E. board.
And who did he fight with?
Can you read that there?
You had to reduced both their privileges.
Simon Greenberg.
Thank you.
Jimal's roommate, Amir, is the most-likely suspect.
But he has an alibi... praying.
Yes, but he was alone.
What about the other roommate...
Tariq?
We can't find any contact between Tariq and the victim.
And he doesn't have the political motive.
Amir is the Palestinian hard-liner.
Tariq could care less.
Okay.
Thank you, Alicia.
Keep us in touch.
What do you think?
I think... you're holding something against her.
I'm what?
Alicia.
Maybe it's unconscious, maybe it's not, but you're being hard on her.
No.
She's a third-year associate on a partner track and she's treating us like peers.
That's all you're seeing.
My God, am I the only adult left here?
Could everybody just put their emotions away?
I've got to get to a meeting, unless you have some other stray observations for me.
Are we overdoing it?
Diane thinks I'm going too hard on you.
Am I?
Going too hard?
All those late nights...
No time off.
Buried... in work.
Up to my knees.
He's doing it again, Mom!
He's doing it again!
It's just my neighbors.
Come on, let's go to the bedroom.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Leg is done, the chops are ready to go.
I'm just warming up the leg of lamb piece after it's been reposing for ten or 15 minutes...
We need to eat better.
I like what we eat.
No, I need to cook.
You're happier without Dad.
No, I'm happier with you.
Okay, that was such a mom thing to say.
No, it's about Dad.
Does that upset you?
No.
I don't know.
You know I love Dad.
I know.
I'm sorry.
No.
I found you a new tutor.
Dana.
I think you'll like her, she's social.
Actually, I think I like this one now.
You...
I thought you said she was too different.
She is.
But sometimes different isn't always bad.
She's coming over to help me set up my computer tomorrow.
What?
Mm, she's setting up your computer?
I asked her to.
Please tell me you're learning something, and that this isn't all pointless.
I'm learning something.
So how do you explain that, Amir?
I don't explain it.
You said you didn't know the victim, Simon Greenberg, and here you are on a video game fighting with him.
I don't need to talk to you.
You got no authority here.
Hey, you want to make yourself useful in here?
I just got the authority.
He claims it wasn't him.
It wasn't him, what, fighting against Greenberg?
On the video game.
Amir says it was Tariq.
He let him use his screen name.
These roommates...
they share everything.
So I'm checking Tariq, but we're back to square one.
Amir had a motive...
politics, fanaticism.
Tariq isn't political or religious.
I wonder if we're making a mistake thinking it's about Middle Eastern politics.
These kids...
they're just... college kids.
All rise.
Okay, I'll keep checking, but I'll need some time.
Judge Karpman presiding.
Thank you.
Please be seated.
So, this is where we stand.
There is sufficient evidence for a finding of probable cause.
Further, we set this case on my trial...
Your Honor, we ask that you recuse yourself.
Excuse me?
We believe you have shown bias against our client.
Believe?
Really?
In what way?
Your religion.
This is... outrageous.
I'm...
My Jewish background is completely irrelevant in this case.
Your Honor, you have given money to the Outlook for Israel, an organization that supports the settlements in Israel.
We believe you have shown bias against our client, and we ask that a new judge hear further proceedings.
I'll give you my answer in an hour.
He's not going to recuse himself.
He will.
Karpman always backs down when he's pushed.
He's afraid he'll be overturned on appeal.
So we start over with a new judge.
No.
I know what Alicia's doing.
Oh.
Hi, Michael.
How are you?
I was just sitting here going over this campaign.
Arab Spring.
Sort of like Irish Spring, but with Arabs.
- Do you want some coffee?
- How much?
For the coffee?
How much for six months if I brought the Jewish League Fund here?
How much are you paying Tarkovsky Associates?
You know how much I'm paying.
Well, of course, we would have to tell
Mr. Al-Said that we can't handle his account anymore, so if you'd help us defer those costs...
You're really a son of a bitch.
I am.
But now I'm your son of a bitch.
All rise.
Judge Karpman presiding.
Please be seated.
I've taken great deal of time with this motion because
I believe that part of being a tough judge is also being a fair judge.
Your Honor, may I quickly interrupt?
Can't imagine why, Counselor.
I'm ready to rule.
Yes, but...
I believe
Mrs. Florrick is attempting to manipulate this court.
Excuse me!
If you recuse yourself, Your Honor, the court will be forced to choose a new judge tomorrow?
Is that correct?
Yes, it is.
You were about to make your ruling, Your Honor?
That's what she's counting on.
Do you know what tomorrow is, Your Honor?
- What tomorrow is?
- The holiday.
That has nothing to do with my motion.
It's Rosh Hashanah.
There will be no Jewish judges in court, the case will be assigned to a non-Jewish judge.
That is why she's asking you
- to recuse yourself.
- Your Honor, this is offensive!
Mrs. Florrick,
I am... disappointed in you.
The motion is denied.
Case remains on my trial call!
Hi, Tariq.
How are you?
So, what, are you following me?
No.
I'm following her.
Hey, Tariq.
You know, if you're looking for a more discreet gay bar,
- I'd try Scarlet's on Halsted.
- No, no, no, no.
I'd try Sidetrack.
- It's too leathery.
- What do you need?
You used Amir's avatar on Battle M.E., the online video game.
So?
So, that's where you met Simon Greenberg.
- No.
- Yeah.
Actually... yeah.
Checked your alibi.
Didn't hold up, Tariq.
You weren't at the interfaith rally.
Why would I kill Greenberg?
It-It makes no sense.
We spoke to the bartender.
He said you met Greenberg here quite a few times.
My guess is, you two fell in love.
You argued.
He met someone else.
You got jealous.
You stabbed him.
Made it look like a hate crime.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't!
Why the reversed swastika?
- What?
- When you set it up as a hate crime, why did you draw the swastika backward?
What do you mean?
Isn't that how you draw it?
Hmm.
Is it good for the Jewish League Fund?
I don't know.
The Muslim was the killer, but he was also gay, and sleeping with our guy, so, uh,
I would call that a classic mixed message.
Crisis management.
If it helps our cause, I could find out if he's a top.
That was a joke.
Yeah.
Okay, I-I-I got to go.
Important work?
Fate of the world.
What do you think?
It's very flattering, Eli.
But I can't be thinking about the governorship when I'm doing this job.
So do this job.
Let me think about the governorship.
Just an observation from work.
If you're worried about Alicia and Will Gardner...
I'm not... worried.
I know, I know, but, um, if you were,
I think that whatever was there is no more.
They barely look at each other.
Eli.
You don't want a divorced candidate, do you?
No, I...
Forget it.
* Yes, good-bye *
You need a friend, K.
* I mean good-bye... *
Why do I need a friend?
Or a dog.
Maybe you need a dog.
Kalinda and Pooch.
Out investigating.
I'm fine, Will.
Really.
What's wrong with me?
We're not like normal people, are we?
What are normal people like?
Emotional.
- You're emotional.
- No.
Sometimes I'm in the middle of an emotion, and I just look at myself and realize...
I'm not feeling anything.
I just like acting like someone who feels something.
You want to stop acting and actually feel?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ow.
That's what it feels like.
Thanks.
I got to go.
I got to be somewhere at 8:45.
Really?
That's specific.
Yup.
Be good.
I'll get them to school on Monday.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Do we take our homework?
- Yes!
- Yes!
So, you've hired a tutor for Grace?
Yes, I did.
She's good, I think, and Grace likes her.
Or... she likes her now.
I'll keep an eye on that.
Oh, um, also,
Zach's girlfriend, Nisa... her parents wanted us to come for dinner.
I'll tell her you're busy.
Yeah, yeah, tell her I'm...
I'm busy.
Love you.
Love you.
- Love you.
- I love you.
You call if you need anything.
I'll be here.
Previously on The Secret Circle...
My sweet Cassie,
You finding this means I'm gone, and for that, I am so sorry.
I didn't want you to have this life.
But destiny's not easy to run from.
Hi, I'm Diana.
You seen her yet?
She got in yesterday.
We're different.
You're different.
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded, 100% witch.
You're here.
We have real power now.
A complete circle is 6.
You complete the circle.
She's got the gift.
You can get Cassie to do what we need?
Circle will take care of that without even knowing it.
- How did you discover...
- We're witches.
Diana found her mom's Book of Shadows.
She's the only one with the book?
That's the ferry that killed her parents.
Among the victims was Heather Barnes.
Heather Barnes was on the student council with Cassie's mom.
I'm sorry Heather died!
Heather didn't die.
What Amelia did to her was far worse.
♪ The cloud in the sky or nothin'... ♪

I got a better idea.
What could be better than school?

Guess we're on the same page.

Think we can do it again?

Zachary said my mother did something terrible to Heather Barnes.
He said it was worse than death.
So, what did you find out?
After the fire, she spent two years in a psychiatric hospital.
Then she was released and just dropped off the face of the Earth.
Did she have any family?
A brother in Finn Creek.
No phone listing, but he lives close to here.
Want to go with me after school, check it out?
Yes, of course...
Wait.
I can't go today.
Can't go where?
Hey, you!
Finn Creek.
Why do you wanna go to Finn Creek?
We're trying to find out what happened to Heather Barnes.
She has a brother there.
And you think he knows something?
It's worth checking out.
But I can go by myself, not a big deal.
You don't wanna do that.
Finn Creek is a sketchy area.
Adam, why don't you take her?
I can't reschedule my counselor eval.
No, it's fine.
Really.
I'm fine.
Heather was in that fire 16 years ago.
Maybe she can tell us what happened to our parents.
Sure.
I'll pick you up after school?
Ok...
It's ok.
Really.
We're friends.
We're in this together.
Come on.
I hate this binding stuff.
What's the point of being a damned witch if I can't do any magic by myself?
I might as well become a cheerleader.
Bite your tongue.
Why can't it be fun?
Like that movie, "The Craft"?
I mean the first half, not the stuff with the snakes.
The part where we put spells on boys and change our hair color and levitate.
We should practice later.
I'm kind of tied up...
With what?
Nick?
Look, I know you like this guy.
But we both know it's not going to last.
He's a dog.
That's not true.
He can be sweet.
When he wants to get into your pants.
He hits on every girl in school and you know it.
Don't be "that" pathetic girl who thinks he'll change "for me."
They never change.
Ok, I got it.
He's a loser.
I'm a loser.
You feel better?
Oh, this is looking more and more like a bad idea.
We'll be ok.
What is this place?
It used to be a little fishing village but most people moved away and this is what's left.
This is it.
Hi, we're looking for Wade Barnes.
Actually, we were looking for Heather Barnes.
But we know Wade lives here.
I'm Wade.
What do you want with my sister?
My mother, Amelia Blake, was friends with Heather when they were young.
You knew Amelia?
I knew her.
My mother died a few months ago.
I was hoping to ask Heather a few questions.
Do you know where she is?
She's right here.
Oh.
Would it be all right if we talked to her?
No.
It wouldn't.
Maybe that's something Heather should decide.
You think so?
Well, then come on in.
Stop.
Ask her anything you want.
Heather?
She hasn't moved in 16 years.
What's wrong with her?
Years back there was a fire at the boat yard.
We know.
Some died and some survived.
If you call this surviving.
Do the doctors know what caused it?
No one does.
She went there with your mother.
Why?
I don't know.
Of kids used to go down to that boat yard to party and have fun.
She was a different person back then.
I'm sorry.
Aah!
Cassie, let's go!
Aah!
Heather!

What just happened?
.
You said she hasn't moved in 16 years?
Not at all.
Not a muscle.
And then you come.
What did you do?
Nothing.
This didn't have anything to do with me.
Well, she grabbed your arm.
Not mine and not his.
Heather?
Are you there?
Hey.
Heather, it's me.
Can you hear me?
Heather?
It's ok.
We should go.
I'm sorry, Mr. Barnes.
I wish there was something I could do to help.
Ohh.
That scar on her arm.
It's witchcraft, isn't it?
It's a Sigil.
They're used for certain spells.
I've seen them before in our research.
Do you think that's what's wrong with her?
A spell?
Zachary said my mother did something to Heather that was worse than death.
Is that what he meant?
Cassie, I don't know.
Is that why she grabbed me?
Because somehow she knew I was related?
It doesn't make sense.
Heather was her friend.
Why would she do that to a friend?
We don't know your mother did this.
No...
I do know.
Where's your grandmother?
At the hospital.
Working the late shift.
She's a nurse.
I know.
When I was 10, she set my arm when I broke it.
I found this.
Is that what I think it is?
My family's Book of Shadows.
I found it when I first got here.
But how?
My mother left it for me.
She wanted me to find it.
I haven't told anyone.
Can I see it?
Each of the six families has their own book, but we've only found Diana's.
Everything we know about who we are, we got from her book.
But it's specific to her family.
Different spells, different histories.
This book is completely different.
We could learn so much from this.
The Sigil on Heather's arm...
I've seen it in here.
Here.
That's my mother's handwriting.
She had to be the one to put the spell on Heather.
I need to know why.
It's a suppression spell of some kind.
Why would my mother do that?
She would never hurt someone like this.
Not the mother I knew.
I'm sorry, Cassie.
Does it say how to undo it?
Um...
Right here, I think.
I want to.
If we can undo this spell, then she can tell us what happened.
If it even works.
We have to try.
You saw that woman.
If we can make her better, we have to.
♪ I can't begin to... ♪
Hey, what are you doing?
Waiting for Nick.
I'm early.
Listen, I wanted to apologize about before.
If you really like Nick, then I'll get on board with it.
I promise.
The last thing I'd want is for you to think I was jealous of him.
Thanks.
Sure.
And by the way...
I think Nick got here early, too.
You're a bitch.
No.
I'm you're friend.
The spell requires a poultice.
And that would be?
A magic potion.
And I'm being serious.
I have most of the ingredients here except the main one.
Which is blood.
The spell maker's.
Yours.
You're cool with that?
And, um...
My mom used her blood to begin with, right?
If it was her spell, she did.
Hey, can you do it?
Because I'm like petrified of needles.
Ok.
Are you going to do it, or are you just keep torturing me?
Ok.
How's that?
Hey!
You're here.
Adam told me what you want to do.
Yeah, you should have seen Heather Barnes.
- We have to help her.
- Are you sure you are?
We're going to undo the spell that was put on her.
I don't think it's a good idea.
What if we do it wrong?
What if it hurts her worse?
We'll be careful.
How do you even know what you're doing?
My book doesn't even tell you how to undo a spell like this.
My book does.
You have a book?
It was her mother's.
She left it for her.
It has the spell.
You're the one who always wanted to know what happened to our parents.
Maybe we can find out with the two books.
Not now, Adam.
Not for this.
It's too risky.
I'm sorry, Cassie.
You can't do the spell by yourself and we can't help you.
Adam?
We can help her.
You didn't see her.
What my mom did.
Please?
I'm sorry.
Maybe when we understand more.
But right now, we just don't know enough to do something like this.
Diana.
Let me talk to her.
Hey.
You having fun out there with your little chipee?
What are you talking about?
I saw you talking to that girl.
You mean Andrea?
Come on, Mel.
We were talking.
Didn't look like you were talking to me.
So now I can't talk to girls?
Is that the deal now?
You know, I was hoping maybe to get 5 minutes before you turned into a douche.
What's going on with you?
I thought things were good.
You know what?
Faye was right.
You're never going to change.
Go find another slut toy.
I'm done.
What are you doing here?
Adam and Diana just left.
Why so pouty?
You wouldn't understand.
Try me.
Fine.
I want to undo a spell that could answer a lot of questions about how our parents died 16 years ago and Diana and Adam won't help me.
Boy, did I miss a chapter.
Wait a minute, is that a Book of Shadows?
You have your own?
I have looked and looked for my family's book and I can't find it.
That's enough.
Oh, come on, don't be like that.
I thought you needed help.
You're going to help me?
Sure.
If you let me read your book, why not?
You need my help.
And to be honest, I have never understood why we're not better friends.
Let's go.
You conveniently left out the haunted house part.
Yes.
Come on.
This is really creepy.
Your mother did this?
Why?
I don't know.
That's what I'm hoping to find out.
I mean, seriously.
What could anyone do to deserve...
Your mother must have been one mean ass witch--
Faye.
Please.
Can we just try to help her?
I'm sorry.
Let's do this.
I'm going to apply the stuff that Adam and I made and then we'll do the chant together.
Will it work?
I have no idea.
I don't know what the spell is,
I don't know what the words mean,
I don't even know how to pronounce them.
Ok, we can do this.
You dragged me all the way out here, so let's get to the bottom of it.
"Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia."
"Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia."
Again?
Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia.
Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia.
I'm sorry.
I thought it would work.
Maybe we did it wrong?
Or I screwed up the potion?
Can we talk about this in the car?
Far away from here.
Thanks for trying.
I know I don't come across like I care about much...
But my dad died that night.
I don't think my mom's ever gotten over it.
And I want to know what happened just as much as anyone.
I guess we're all in the same boat.
Yep, a boat full of sad witches.
So how about we go back to your place and check out the book?
Another time.
I'd say I've earned a peek, wouldn't you?
Yes.
Heather?
Oh, my God.
Heather, what the hell's happening?
Aah!
Waiting to catch me cheating?
I came to apologize.
I overreacted.
You think?
I saw you with that other girl and I just went off.
I'm sorry.
Yeah?
Faye was saying some things and I made the mistake of listening.
Like what?
It doesn't matter.
Just stupid things.
It's not like you're my boyfriend or anything, so I don't have the right to be jealous.
Ok.
So...
We're good?
Yeah.
We're good.
I'm sorry for putting you in the middle of this thing with Cassie.
I understand why you don't want to do this.
I just know how badly Cassie wants to find answers.
You know.
Well, I'm glad she didn't.
Because I went back to my book.
I knew there was something about that symbol that bugged me.
Look at this.
These are all ubilaz markings.
Uh...really old, black magic.
Demons, evil entities...
Possession.
Heather was possessed?
The notes here are all about using snakes and insects as vessels for dark energy.
Forcing them inside someone.
I think the Sigils are meant to keep it from coming back out.
Like a suppression spell.
This is way beyond witchcraft.
It's seriously dark magic.
None of this was in Cassie's book.
If she'd known about this, she never would have tried the spell.
That's kinda the point I was making.
I've got to call her.
Why?
She didn't do the spell.
But she still needs to know.
Ok, that's enough for today.
Oh, calm down.
Or I can take it home with me and be out of your hair.
Mmm.
Will you bring me back some snacks?
No carbs.
Where is Amelia?
Can you help me find Amelia?
She's not here.
How did you...
Are you ok?
I need to see her.
Amelia passed away.
No.
I'm her daughter.
Cassie.
Cassie.
You were a baby.
I tried to help her take you away.
She did.
She took me far away from here.
She wanted you to be safe.
She tried to leave that night.
What night?
Do you mean the night of the fire?
Can you tell me what happened that night?
She was trying to stop it.
She wanted to protect us.
All of us.
But it went inside me.
What did?
Evil.
And I can still feel it.
It hurts.
Aah!
Your mother couldn't get it out.
But she made the pain go away.
And now it's come back.
Ohh!
Can you please help me?
How?
How can I?
Please...make it stop.
She's not picking up.
Ugh.
Voicemail.
Try again.
Ah.
Hi, sweetie.
What?
Who is this?
It's Cassie.
I miss you.
Come make magic with me.
Faye?
Why is she answering Cassie's phone?
Faye, just put Cassie on.
She's downstairs.
Faye, this is important.
Oh, you sound hot.
What are you wearing?
Does Diana know you're calling?
Faye, please.
What happened?
You fainted.
Is that what my mom did?
Is this how she stopped your pain?
Yes.
I went to the boat yard, but I couldn't find her.
Why was she there?
How did the fire start?
Wherever there are witches...
Evil follows.
What do you mean?
They'd been summoned.
They were trying to use your mother's power.
Her and her friends.
Who was?
Why?
She couldn't stop them all.
And one of them got inside me.
One what?
Heather, please, tell me who she was trying to stop.
Demons.
Heather!
Hey, Cassie, dream boat's on the phone...
Desperate for you.
Cassie?
Aah!
Aah!
Faye?
Help!
Oh, God.
Aah!
Aah!
Faye!
Faye?
Wait.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Come on!
Come on, run!
Back door.
Front door.
Run.
It's me.
What's going on?
Look behind you!
Aah!
Uh!
Aah!
Heather.
Heather!
Heather, it's me.
She came out of nowhere.
We have to take the body now, Mr. Barnes.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Barnes.
She's at peace now.
I'm glad you're ok.
I am pretty far from ok.
At least I'm alive.
Thanks.
Come on.
I'll give you a ride home.
No thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm sorry you had to go through this.
I still don't even get what happened really.
One minute she was talking to me and then...
I found the Sigil your mother used to suppress the demon in my Book of Shadows.
A demon?
That's what Heather said.
How can there be demons?
I just know we have to be careful.
There's too much we don't understand.
What was I thinking?
Taking any of this on without knowing anything?
You need answers.
We all do.
I understand.
But after this, we just have to be careful how we get them.
We should go, Adam.
My dad's going to worry.
You're ok?
Yeah.
♪ Oh, oh... ♪
You were pretty impressive back there.
Thanks.
So, are you staying over?
Yeah, if it's ok.
I'm never going to be the guy you want me to be.
Is that a warning or a threat?
I'm going to disappoint you.
You deserve better.
That's the sweetest thing you've ever said to me.
I'm not disappointed.
♪ I think I'm coming down ♪
♪ I think I'm comin' down... ♪
Hey.
Where's Diana?
I took her home.
She knows you're here?
No.
I wanted to be sure you're ok.
And I thought you might need some help cleaning up.
That's what friends do, right?
You got a broom?
Sure.
I'm a witch.
So, how many times did Diana say, "I told you so?"
Not once.
Until right when she was walking inside her house.
Hey, I'm glad you found out your mom was trying to do the right thing.
Me, too.
But Diana was right.
I was so determined to find out about her,
I put us all in danger.
No, you were right.
Maybe we didn't go about it the right way, but a maniac came after us at the dance.
And tonight, a demon.
A demon.
We need to know what happened 16 years ago.
Our lives depend on it.
I'm not sure Diana agrees.
Well, I agree.
You do?
After tonight?
Yeah.
What's out there is a lot bigger than any of us ever thought.
Thanks.

Previously on The Secret Circle...
My sweet Cassie,
You finding this means I'm gone, and for that, I am so sorry.
I didn't want you to have this life.
But destiny's not easy to run from.
Hi, I'm Diana.
You seen her yet?
She got in yesterday.
We're different.
You're different.
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded, 100% witch.
You're here.
We have real power now.
A complete circle is 6.
You complete the circle.
She's got the gift.
You can get Cassie to do what we need?
Circle will take care of that without even knowing it.
- How did you discover...
- We're witches.
Diana found her mom's Book of Shadows.
She's the only one with the book?
That's the ferry that killed her parents.
Among the victims was Heather Barnes.
[Beep]
Heather Barnes was on the student council with Cassie's mom.
I'm sorry Heather died!
Heather didn't die.
What Amelia did to her was far worse.

What could be better than school?

Can't do magic alone, right?
Think we can do it again?

Zachary said my mother did something terrible to Heather Barnes.
He said it was worse than death.
So, what did you find out?
After the fire, she spent two years in a psychiatric hospital.
Then she was released and just dropped off the face of the Earth.
Did she have any family?
A brother in Finn Creek.
No phone listing, but he lives close to here.
Want to go with me after school, check it out?
Yes, of course...
Wait.
I can't go today.
Can't go where?
Hey, you!
Finn Creek.
Why do you wanna go to Finn Creek?
We're trying to find out what happened to Heather Barnes.
She has a brother there.
And you think he knows something?
It's worth checking out.
But I can go by myself, not a big deal.
You don't wanna do that.
Finn Creek is a sketchy area.
Adam, why don't you take her?
I can't reschedule my counselor eval.
No, it's fine.
Really.
I'm fine.
Heather was in that fire 16 years ago.
Maybe she can tell us what happened to our parents.
Sure.
I'll pick you up after school?
Ok...
It's ok.
Really.
We're friends.
We're in this together.
Come on.
[Sighs]
I hate this binding stuff.
What's the point of being a damned witch if I can't do any magic by myself?
I might as well become a cheerleader.
Bite your tongue.
Why can't it be fun?
Like that movie, "The Craft"?
I mean the first half, not the stuff with the snakes.
The part where we put spells on boys and change our hair color and levitate.
We should practice later.
I'm kind of tied up...
With what?
Nick?
Look, I know you like this guy.
But we both know it's not going to last.
He's a dog.
That's not true.
He can be sweet.
When he wants to get into your pants.
He hits on every girl in school and you know it.
Don't be "that" pathetic girl who thinks he'll change "for me."
They never change.
Ok, I got it.
He's a loser.
I'm a loser.
You feel better?
Oh, this is looking more and more like a bad idea.
We'll be ok.
What is this place?
It used to be a little fishing village but most people moved away and this is what's left.
[Dog barking in background]
This is it.
Hi, we're looking for Wade Barnes.
Actually, we were looking for Heather Barnes.
But we know Wade lives here.
I'm Wade.
What do you want with my sister?
My mother, Amelia Blake, was friends with Heather when they were young.
[Sighs]
You knew Amelia?
I knew her.
My mother died a few months ago.
I was hoping to ask Heather a few questions.
Do you know where she is?
She's right here.
Oh.
Would it be all right if we talked to her?
No.
It wouldn't.
Maybe that's something Heather should decide.
You think so?
Well, then come on in.
Stop.
Ask her anything you want.
Heather?
She hasn't moved in 16 years.
What's wrong with her?
Years back there was a fire at the boat yard.
We know.
Some died and some survived.
If you call this surviving.
Do the doctors know what caused it?
No one does.
She went there with your mother.
Why?
I don't know.

I'm sorry.
[Grunting] Aah!

I don't think my mom's ever gotten over it.
And I want to know what happened just as much as anyone.
I guess we're all in the same boat.
Yep, a boat full of sad witches.
So how about we go back to your place and check out the book?
Another time.
I'd say I've earned a peek, wouldn't you?
Yes.
[Squishing]
[Gasps]
Heather?
Oh, my God.
[Heather breathing heavily]
[Grunting]
Heather, what the hell's happening?
Aah!
[Dog barking in background]
[Door opens]
Waiting to catch me cheating?
I came to apologize.
I overreacted.
You think?
I saw you with that other girl and I just went off.
I'm sorry.
Yeah?
Faye was saying some things and I made the mistake of listening.
Like what?
[Sighs] It doesn't matter.
Just stupid things.
It's not like you're my boyfriend or anything, so I don't have the right to be jealous.
Ok.
So...
We're good?
Yeah.
We're good.
I'm sorry for putting you in the middle of this thing with Cassie.
I understand why you don't want to do this.
I just know how badly Cassie wants to find answers.
You know.
Well, I'm glad she didn't.
Because I went back to my book.
I knew there was something about that symbol that bugged me.
Look at this.
These are all ubilaz markings.
Uh...really old, black magic.
Demons, evil entities...
Possession.
Heather was possessed?
[Inhales]
The notes here are all about using snakes and insects as vessels for dark energy.
Forcing them inside someone.
I think the Sigils are meant to keep it from coming back out.
Like a suppression spell.
This is way beyond witchcraft.
It's seriously dark magic.
None of this was in Cassie's book.
If she'd known about this, she never would have tried the spell.
That's kinda the point I was making.
I've got to call her.
Why?
She didn't do the spell.
But she still needs to know.
Ok, that's enough for today.
Oh, calm down.
Or I can take it home with me and be out of your hair.
[Sighs]
[Knock on door]
Mmm.
Will you bring me back some snacks?
No carbs.
[Gasps]
Where is Amelia?
Can you help me find Amelia?
She's not here.
How did you...
Are you ok?
I need to see her.
Amelia passed away.
No.
I'm her daughter.
Cassie.
Cassie.
You were a baby.
I tried to help her take you away.
She did.
She took me far away from here.
She wanted you to be safe.
She tried to leave that night.
What night?
Do you mean the night of the fire?
Can you tell me what happened that night?
She was trying to stop it.
She wanted to protect us.
All of us.
But it went inside me.
What did?
Evil.
And I can still feel it.
It hurts.
Aah!
Your mother couldn't get it out.
But she made the pain go away.
And now it's come back.
Ohh!
Can you please help me?
How?
How can I?
[Crying]
Please...make it stop.
[Screaming]
[Line ringing]
She's not picking up.
[Vibrating]
Ugh.
Voicemail.

[Vibrating]
Ah.
Hi, sweetie.
What?
Who is this?
It's Cassie.
I miss you.
Come make magic with me.
Faye?
Why is she answering Cassie's phone?
Faye, just put Cassie on.
She's downstairs.
Faye, this is important.
Oh, you sound hot.
What are you wearing?
Does Diana know you're calling?
Faye, please.
What happened?
You fainted.
Is that what my mom did?
Is this how she stopped your pain?
Yes.
I went to the boat yard, but I couldn't find her.
Why was she there?
How did the fire start?
Wherever there are witches...
Evil follows.
What do you mean?
They'd been summoned.
They were trying to use your mother's power.
Her and her friends.
Who was?
Why?
She couldn't stop them all.
And one of them got inside me.
One what?
Heather, please, tell me who she was trying to stop.
Demons.
[Breathing heavily]
Heather!
[Growling]
Hey, Cassie, dream boat's on the phone...
Desperate for you.
Cassie?

What's going on?
Look behind you!
Aah!
Uh!
Aah!
Heather.
Heather!
Heather, it's me.
[Tires screeching]
She came out of nowhere.
[Police radio chatter]
We have to take the body now, Mr. Barnes.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Barnes.
She's at peace now.
I'm glad you're ok.
I am pretty far from ok.
At least I'm alive.
Thanks.
Come on.
I'll give you a ride home.
No thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm sorry you had to go through this.
I still don't even get what happened really.
One minute she was talking to me and then...
I found the Sigil your mother used to suppress the demon in my Book of Shadows.
A demon?
That's what Heather said.
How can there be demons?
I just know we have to be careful.
There's too much we don't understand.
What was I thinking?
Taking any of this on without knowing anything?
You need answers.
We all do.
I understand.
But after this, we just have to be careful how we get them.
We should go, Adam.

And I thought you might need some help cleaning up.
That's what friends do, right?
You got a broom?
Sure.
I'm a witch.
So, how many times did Diana say, "I told you so?"
Not once.
Until right when she was walking inside her house.
Hey, I'm glad you found out your mom was trying to do the right thing.
Me, too.
But Diana was right.
I was so determined to find out about her,
I put us all in danger.
No, you were right.
Maybe we didn't go about it the right way, but a maniac came after us at the dance.
And tonight, a demon.
A demon.
We need to know what happened 16 years ago.

I'm not sure Diana agrees.
Well, I agree.

My sweet Cassie,
You finding this means I'm gone, and for that, I am so sorry.
I didn't want you to have this life.
But destiny's not easy to run from.
Hi, I'm Diana.
You seen her yet?
She got in yesterday.
We're different.
You're different.
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded, 100% witch.
You're here.
We have real power now.
A complete circle is 6.
You complete the circle.
She's got the gift.
You can get Cassie to do what we need?
Circle will take care of that without even knowing it.
- How did you discover...
- We're witches.
Diana found her mom's Book of Shadows.
She's the only one with the book?
That's the ferry that killed her parents.
Among the victims was Heather Barnes.
Heather Barnes was on the student council with Cassie's mom.
I'm sorry Heather died!
Heather didn't die.
What Amelia did to her was far worse.

Zachary said my mother did something terrible to Heather Barnes.
He said it was worse than death.
So, what did you find out?
After the fire, she spent two years in a psychiatric hospital.
Then she was released and just dropped off the face of the Earth.
Did she have any family?
A brother in Finn Creek.
No phone listing, but he lives close to here.
Want to go with me after school, check it out?
Yes, of course...
Wait.
I can't go today.
Can't go where?
Hey, you!
Finn Creek.
Why do you wanna go to Finn Creek?
We're trying to find out what happened to Heather Barnes.
She has a brother there.
And you think he knows something?
It's worth checking out.
But I can go by myself, not a big deal.
You don't wanna do that.
Finn Creek is a sketchy area.
Adam, why don't you take her?
I can't reschedule my counselor eval.
No, it's fine.
Really.
I'm fine.
Heather was in that fire 16 years ago.
Maybe she can tell us what happened to our parents.
Sure.
I'll pick you up after school?
Ok...
It's ok.
Really.
We're friends.
We're in this together.
Come on.
I hate this binding stuff.
What's the point of being a damned witch if I can't do any magic by myself?
I might as well become a cheerleader.
Bite your tongue.
Why can't it be fun?
Like that movie, "The Craft"?
I mean the first half, not the stuff with the snakes.
The part where we put spells on boys and change our hair color and levitate.
We should practice later.
I'm kind of tied up...
With what?
Nick?
Look, I know you like this guy.
But we both know it's not going to last.
He's a dog.
That's not true.
He can be sweet.
When he wants to get into your pants.
He hits on every girl in school and you know it.
Don't be "that" pathetic girl who thinks he'll change "for me."
They never change.
Ok, I got it.
He's a loser.
I'm a loser.
You feel better?
Oh, this is looking more and more like a bad idea.
We'll be ok.
What is this place?
It used to be a little fishing village but most people moved away and this is what's left.
This is it.
Hi, we're looking for Wade Barnes.
Actually, we were looking for Heather Barnes.
But we know Wade lives here.
I'm Wade.
What do you want with my sister?
My mother, Amelia Blake, was friends with Heather when they were young.
You knew Amelia?
I knew her.
My mother died a few months ago.
I was hoping to ask Heather a few questions.
Do you know where she is?
She's right here.
Oh.
Would it be all right if we talked to her?
No.
It wouldn't.
Maybe that's something Heather should decide.
You think so?
Well, then come on in.
Stop.
Ask her anything you want.
Heather?
She hasn't moved in 16 years.
What's wrong with her?
Years back there was a fire at the boat yard.
We know.
Some died and some survived.
If you call this surviving.
Do the doctors know what caused it?
No one does.
She went there with your mother.
Why?
I don't know.
Of kids used to go down to that boat yard to party and have fun.
She was a different person back then.
I'm sorry.
Aah!
Cassie, let's go!
Aah!
Heather!

What just happened?
.
You said she hasn't moved in 16 years?
Not at all.
Not a muscle.
And then you come.
What did you do?
Nothing.
This didn't have anything to do with me.
Well, she grabbed your arm.
Not mine and not his.
Heather?
Are you there?
Hey.
Heather, it's me.
Can you hear me?
Heather?
It's ok.
We should go.
I'm sorry, Mr. Barnes.
I wish there was something I could do to help.
Ohh.
That scar on her arm.
It's witchcraft, isn't it?
It's a Sigil.
They're used for certain spells.
I've seen them before in our research.
Do you think that's what's wrong with her?
A spell?
Zachary said my mother did something to Heather that was worse than death.
Is that what he meant?
Cassie, I don't know.
Is that why she grabbed me?
Because somehow she knew I was related?
It doesn't make sense.
Heather was her friend.
Why would she do that to a friend?
We don't know your mother did this.
No...
I do know.
Where's your grandmother?
At the hospital.
Working the late shift.
She's a nurse.
I know.
When I was 10, she set my arm when I broke it.
I found this.
Is that what I think it is?
My family's Book of Shadows.
I found it when I first got here.
But how?
My mother left it for me.
She wanted me to find it.
I haven't told anyone.
Can I see it?
Each of the six families has their own book, but we've only found Diana's.
Everything we know about who we are, we got from her book.
But it's specific to her family.
Different spells, different histories.
This book is completely different.
We could learn so much from this.
The Sigil on Heather's arm...
I've seen it in here.
Here.
That's my mother's handwriting.
She had to be the one to put the spell on Heather.
I need to know why.
It's a suppression spell of some kind.
Why would my mother do that?
She would never hurt someone like this.
Not the mother I knew.
I'm sorry, Cassie.
Does it say how to undo it?
Um...
Right here, I think.
I want to.
If we can undo this spell, then she can tell us what happened.
If it even works.
We have to try.
You saw that woman.
If we can make her better, we have to.
♪ I can't begin to... ♪
Hey, what are you doing?
Waiting for Nick.
I'm early.
Listen, I wanted to apologize about before.
If you really like Nick, then I'll get on board with it.
I promise.
The last thing I'd want is for you to think I was jealous of him.
Thanks.
Sure.
And by the way...
I think Nick got here early, too.
You're a bitch.
No.
I'm you're friend.
The spell requires a poultice.
And that would be?
A magic potion.
And I'm being serious.
I have most of the ingredients here except the main one.
Which is blood.
The spell maker's.
Yours.
You're cool with that?
And, um...
My mom used her blood to begin with, right?
If it was her spell, she did.
Hey, can you do it?
Because I'm like petrified of needles.
Ok.
Are you going to do it, or are you just keep torturing me?
Ok.
How's that?
Hey!
You're here.
Adam told me what you want to do.
Yeah, you should have seen Heather Barnes.
- We have to help her.
- Are you sure you are?
We're going to undo the spell that was put on her.
I don't think it's a good idea.
What if we do it wrong?
What if it hurts her worse?
We'll be careful.
How do you even know what you're doing?
My book doesn't even tell you how to undo a spell like this.
My book does.
You have a book?
It was her mother's.
She left it for her.
It has the spell.
You're the one who always wanted to know what happened to our parents.
Maybe we can find out with the two books.
Not now, Adam.
Not for this.
It's too risky.
I'm sorry, Cassie.
You can't do the spell by yourself and we can't help you.
Adam?
We can help her.
You didn't see her.
What my mom did.
Please?
I'm sorry.
Maybe when we understand more.
But right now, we just don't know enough to do something like this.
Diana.
Let me talk to her.
Hey.
You having fun out there with your little chipee?
What are you talking about?
I saw you talking to that girl.
You mean Andrea?
Come on, Mel.
We were talking.
Didn't look like you were talking to me.
So now I can't talk to girls?
Is that the deal now?
You know, I was hoping maybe to get 5 minutes before you turned into a douche.
What's going on with you?
I thought things were good.
You know what?
Faye was right.
You're never going to change.
Go find another slut toy.
I'm done.
What are you doing here?
Adam and Diana just left.
Why so pouty?
You wouldn't understand.
Try me.
Fine.
I want to undo a spell that could answer a lot of questions about how our parents died 16 years ago and Diana and Adam won't help me.
Boy, did I miss a chapter.
Wait a minute, is that a Book of Shadows?
You have your own?
I have looked and looked for my family's book and I can't find it.
That's enough.
Oh, come on, don't be like that.
I thought you needed help.
You're going to help me?
Sure.
If you let me read your book, why not?
You need my help.
And to be honest, I have never understood why we're not better friends.
Let's go.
You conveniently left out the haunted house part.
Yes.
Come on.
This is really creepy.
Your mother did this?
Why?
I don't know.
That's what I'm hoping to find out.
I mean, seriously.
What could anyone do to deserve...
Your mother must have been one mean ass witch--
Faye.
Please.
Can we just try to help her?
I'm sorry.
Let's do this.
I'm going to apply the stuff that Adam and I made and then we'll do the chant together.
Will it work?
I have no idea.
I don't know what the spell is,
I don't know what the words mean,
I don't even know how to pronounce them.
Ok, we can do this.
You dragged me all the way out here, so let's get to the bottom of it.
"Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia."
"Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia."
Again?
Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia.
Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia.
I'm sorry.
I thought it would work.
Maybe we did it wrong?
Or I screwed up the potion?
Can we talk about this in the car?
Far away from here.
Thanks for trying.

But destiny's not easy to run from.
Hi, I'm Diana.
You seen her yet?
She got in yesterday.
We're different.
You're different.
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded, 100% witch.
You're here.
We have real power now.
A complete circle is 6.
You complete the circle.
She's got the gift.
You can get Cassie to do what we need?
Circle will take care of that without even knowing it.
- How did you discover...
- We're witches.
Diana found her mom's Book of Shadows.
She's the only one with the book?
That's the ferry that killed her parents.
Among the victims was Heather Barnes.
[Beep]
Heather Barnes was on the student council with Cassie's mom.
I'm sorry Heather died!
Heather didn't die.
What Amelia did to her was far worse.

Zachary said my mother did something terrible to Heather Barnes.
He said it was worse than death.
So, what did you find out?
After the fire, she spent two years in a psychiatric hospital.
Then she was released and just dropped off the face of the Earth.
Did she have any family?
A brother in Finn Creek.
No phone listing, but he lives close to here.
Want to go with me after school, check it out?
Yes, of course...
Wait.
I can't go today.
Can't go where?
Hey, you!
Finn Creek.
Why do you wanna go to Finn Creek?
We're trying to find out what happened to Heather Barnes.
She has a brother there.
And you think he knows something?
It's worth checking out.
But I can go by myself, not a big deal.
You don't wanna do that.
Finn Creek is a sketchy area.
Adam, why don't you take her?
I can't reschedule my counselor eval.
No, it's fine.
Really.
I'm fine.
Heather was in that fire 16 years ago.
Maybe she can tell us what happened to our parents.
Sure.
I'll pick you up after school?
Ok...
It's ok.
Really.
We're friends.
We're in this together.
Come on.
[Sighs]
I hate this binding stuff.
What's the point of being a damned witch if I can't do any magic by myself?
I might as well become a cheerleader.
Bite your tongue.
Why can't it be fun?
Like that movie, "The Craft"?
I mean the first half, not the stuff with the snakes.
The part where we put spells on boys and change our hair color and levitate.
We should practice later.
I'm kind of tied up...
With what?
Nick?
Look, I know you like this guy.
But we both know it's not going to last.
He's a dog.
That's not true.
He can be sweet.
When he wants to get into your pants.
He hits on every girl in school and you know it.
Don't be "that" pathetic girl who thinks he'll change "for me."
They never change.
Ok, I got it.
He's a loser.
I'm a loser.
You feel better?
Oh, this is looking more and more like a bad idea.
We'll be ok.
What is this place?
It used to be a little fishing village but most people moved away and this is what's left.
[Dog barking in background]
This is it.
Hi, we're looking for Wade Barnes.
Actually, we were looking for Heather Barnes.
But we know Wade lives here.
I'm Wade.
What do you want with my sister?
My mother, Amelia Blake, was friends with Heather when they were young.
[Sighs]
You knew Amelia?
I knew her.
My mother died a few months ago.
I was hoping to ask Heather a few questions.
Do you know where she is?
She's right here.
Oh.
Would it be all right if we talked to her?
No.
It wouldn't.
Maybe that's something Heather should decide.
You think so?
Well, then come on in.
Stop.
Ask her anything you want.
Heather?
She hasn't moved in 16 years.
What's wrong with her?
Years back there was a fire at the boat yard.
We know.
Some died and some survived.
If you call this surviving.
Do the doctors know what caused it?
No one does.
She went there with your mother.
Why?
I don't know.
Of kids used to go down to that boat yard to party and have fun.
She was a different person back then.
I'm sorry.
[Grunting] Aah!
Cassie, let's go!
Aah!
[Grunting]
Heather!

What just happened?
.
You said she hasn't moved in 16 years?
Not at all.
Not a muscle.
And then you come.
What did you do?
Nothing.
This didn't have anything to do with me.
Well, she grabbed your arm.
Not mine and not his.
Heather?
Are you there?
Hey.
Heather, it's me.
Can you hear me?
Heather?
It's ok.
We should go.
I'm sorry, Mr. Barnes.
I wish there was something I could do to help.
Ohh.
That scar on her arm.
It's witchcraft, isn't it?
It's a Sigil.
They're used for certain spells.
I've seen them before in our research.
Do you think that's what's wrong with her?
A spell?
Zachary said my mother did something to Heather that was worse than death.
Is that what he meant?
Cassie, I don't know.
Is that why she grabbed me?
Because somehow she knew I was related?
It doesn't make sense.
Heather was her friend.
Why would she do that to a friend?
We don't know your mother did this.
No...
I do know.
Where's your grandmother?
At the hospital.
Working the late shift.
She's a nurse.
I know.
When I was 10, she set my arm when I broke it.
I found this.
Is that what I think it is?
My family's Book of Shadows.
I found it when I first got here.
But how?
My mother left it for me.
She wanted me to find it.
I haven't told anyone.
Can I see it?
Each of the six families has their own book, but we've only found Diana's.
Everything we know about who we are, we got from her book.
But it's specific to her family.
Different spells, different histories.
This book is completely different.
We could learn so much from this.
The Sigil on Heather's arm...
I've seen it in here.
Here.
That's my mother's handwriting.
She had to be the one to put the spell on Heather.
I need to know why.
It's a suppression spell of some kind.
Why would my mother do that?
She would never hurt someone like this.
Not the mother I knew.
I'm sorry, Cassie.
Does it say how to undo it?
Um...
Right here, I think.
I want to.
If we can undo this spell, then she can tell us what happened.
If it even works.
We have to try.
You saw that woman.
If we can make her better, we have to.
♪ I can't begin to... ♪
Hey, what are you doing?
Waiting for Nick.
I'm early.
Listen, I wanted to apologize about before.
If you really like Nick, then I'll get on board with it.
I promise.
The last thing I'd want is for you to think I was jealous of him.
Thanks.
Sure.
And by the way...
I think Nick got here early, too.
You're a bitch.
[Scoffs]
No.
I'm you're friend.
The spell requires a poultice.
And that would be?
A magic potion.
And I'm being serious.
I have most of the ingredients here except the main one.
Which is blood.
The spell maker's.
Yours.
You're cool with that?
And, um...
My mom used her blood to begin with, right?
If it was her spell, she did.
Hey, can you do it?
Because I'm like petrified of needles.
Ok.
Are you going to do it, or are you just keep torturing me?
Ok.
How's that?
Hey!
You're here.
Adam told me what you want to do.
Yeah, you should have seen Heather Barnes.
- We have to help her.
- Are you sure you are?
We're going to undo the spell that was put on her.
I don't think it's a good idea.
What if we do it wrong?
What if it hurts her worse?
We'll be careful.
How do you even know what you're doing?
My book doesn't even tell you how to undo a spell like this.
My book does.
You have a book?
It was her mother's.
She left it for her.
It has the spell.
You're the one who always wanted to know what happened to our parents.
Maybe we can find out with the two books.
Not now, Adam.
Not for this.
It's too risky.
I'm sorry, Cassie.
You can't do the spell by yourself and we can't help you.
Adam?
We can help her.
You didn't see her.
What my mom did.
Please?
I'm sorry.
Maybe when we understand more.
But right now, we just don't know enough to do something like this.
Diana.
Let me talk to her.
Hey.
You having fun out there with your little chipee?
What are you talking about?
I saw you talking to that girl.
You mean Andrea?
Come on, Mel.
We were talking.
Didn't look like you were talking to me.
So now I can't talk to girls?
Is that the deal now?
You know, I was hoping maybe to get 5 minutes before you turned into a douche.
What's going on with you?
I thought things were good.
You know what?
Faye was right.
You're never going to change.
Go find another slut toy.
I'm done.
What are you doing here?
Adam and Diana just left.
Why so pouty?
You wouldn't understand.
Try me.
Fine.
I want to undo a spell that could answer a lot of questions about how our parents died 16 years ago and Diana and Adam won't help me.
Boy, did I miss a chapter.
Wait a minute, is that a Book of Shadows?
You have your own?
[Gasps]
I have looked and looked for my family's book and I can't find it.
That's enough.
Oh, come on, don't be like that.
I thought you needed help.
You're going to help me?
Sure.
If you let me read your book, why not?
You need my help.
And to be honest, I have never understood why we're not better friends.
Let's go.
You conveniently left out the haunted house part.
Yes.
Come on.
This is really creepy.
Your mother did this?
Why?
I don't know.
That's what I'm hoping to find out.
I mean, seriously.
What could anyone do to deserve...
Your mother must have been one mean ass witch--
Faye.
Please.
Can we just try to help her?
I'm sorry.
Let's do this.
I'm going to apply the stuff that Adam and I made and then we'll do the chant together.
Will it work?
I have no idea.
I don't know what the spell is,
I don't know what the words mean,
I don't even know how to pronounce them.
Ok, we can do this.
You dragged me all the way out here, so let's get to the bottom of it.
"Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia."
"Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia."
Again?
Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia.
Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia.
[Sighs]
I'm sorry.
I thought it would work.
[Door opens]
[Rustling]
Maybe we did it wrong?
Or I screwed up the potion?
Can we talk about this in the car?
Far away from here.
Thanks for trying.
I know I don't come across like I care about much...
But my dad died that night.
I don't think my mom's ever gotten over it.
And I want to know what happened just as much as anyone.
I guess we're all in the same boat.
Yep, a boat full of sad witches.
So how about we go back to your place and check out the book?
Another time.
I'd say I've earned a peek, wouldn't you?
Yes.
[Squishing]
[Gasps]
Heather?
Oh, my God.
[Heather breathing heavily]
[Grunting]
Heather, what the hell's happening?
Aah!
[Dog barking in background]
[Door opens]
Waiting to catch me cheating?
I came to apologize.
I overreacted.
You think?
I saw you with that other girl and I just went off.
I'm sorry.
Yeah?
Faye was saying some things and I made the mistake of listening.
Like what?
[Sighs] It doesn't matter.
Just stupid things.
It's not like you're my boyfriend or anything, so I don't have the right to be jealous.
Ok.
So...
We're good?
Yeah.
We're good.
I'm sorry for putting you in the middle of this thing with Cassie.
I understand why you don't want to do this.
I just know how badly Cassie wants to find answers.
You know.
Well, I'm glad she didn't.
Because I went back to my book.
I knew there was something about that symbol that bugged me.
Look at this.
These are all ubilaz markings.
Uh...really old, black magic.
Demons, evil entities...
Possession.
Heather was possessed?
[Inhales]
The notes here are all about using snakes and insects as vessels for dark energy.
Forcing them inside someone.
I think the Sigils are meant to keep it from coming back out.
Like a suppression spell.
This is way beyond witchcraft.
It's seriously dark magic.
None of this was in Cassie's book.
If she'd known about this, she never would have tried the spell.
That's kinda the point I was making.
I've got to call her.
Why?
She didn't do the spell.
But she still needs to know.
Ok, that's enough for today.
Oh, calm down.
Or I can take it home with me and be out of your hair.
[Sighs]
[Knock on door]
Mmm.
Will you bring me back some snacks?
No carbs.
[Gasps]
Where is Amelia?
Can you help me find Amelia?
She's not here.
How did you...
Are you ok?
I need to see her.
Amelia passed away.
No.
I'm her daughter.
Cassie.
Cassie.
You were a baby.
I tried to help her take you away.
She did.
She took me far away from here.
She wanted you to be safe.
She tried to leave that night.
What night?
Do you mean the night of the fire?
Can you tell me what happened that night?
She was trying to stop it.
She wanted to protect us.
All of us.
But it went inside me.
What did?
Evil.
And I can still feel it.
It hurts.
Aah!
Your mother couldn't get it out.
But she made the pain go away.
And now it's come back.
Ohh!
Can you please help me?
How?
How can I?
[Crying]
Please...make it stop.
[Screaming]
[Line ringing]
She's not picking up.
[Vibrating]
Ugh.
Voicemail.
Try again.
[Vibrating]
Ah.
Hi, sweetie.
What?
Who is this?
It's Cassie.
I miss you.
Come make magic with me.
Faye?
Why is she answering Cassie's phone?
Faye, just put Cassie on.
She's downstairs.
Faye, this is important.
Oh, you sound hot.
What are you wearing?
Does Diana know you're calling?
Faye, please.
What happened?
You fainted.
Is that what my mom did?
Is this how she stopped your pain?
Yes.
I went to the boat yard, but I couldn't find her.
Why was she there?
How did the fire start?
Wherever there are witches...
Evil follows.
What do you mean?
They'd been summoned.
They were trying to use your mother's power.
Her and her friends.
Who was?
Why?
She couldn't stop them all.
And one of them got inside me.
One what?
Heather, please, tell me who she was trying to stop.
Demons.
[Breathing heavily]
Heather!
[Growling]
Hey, Cassie, dream boat's on the phone...
Desperate for you.
Cassie?
Aah!
Aah!
Faye?
Help!
Oh, God.
Aah!
[Screaming]
[Grunting]
Aah!
Faye!
Faye?
Wait.
Aah!

Aah!

Cassie:
Come on!
Come on, run!

Back door.
Front door.
Run.
[Screaming]
It's me.
What's going on?
Look behind you!
Aah!
Uh!
Aah!
Heather.
Heather!
Heather, it's me.
[Tires screeching]
She came out of nowhere.
[Police radio chatter]
We have to take the body now, Mr. Barnes.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Barnes.
She's at peace now.
I'm glad you're ok.
I am pretty far from ok.
At least I'm alive.
Thanks.
Come on.
I'll give you a ride home.
No thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm sorry you had to go through this.
I still don't even get what happened really.
One minute she was talking to me and then...
I found the Sigil your mother used to suppress the demon in my Book of Shadows.
A demon?
That's what Heather said.
How can there be demons?
I just know we have to be careful.
There's too much we don't understand.
What was I thinking?
Taking any of this on without knowing anything?
You need answers.
We all do.
I understand.
But after this, we just have to be careful how we get them.
We should go, Adam.
My dad's going to worry.
You're ok?
Yeah.
♪ Oh, oh... ♪
You were pretty impressive back there.
Thanks.
So, are you staying over?
Yeah, if it's ok.
I'm never going to be the guy you want me to be.
Is that a warning or a threat?
I'm going to disappoint you.
You deserve better.
That's the sweetest thing you've ever said to me.
I'm not disappointed.

Hey.
Where's Diana?
I took her home.
She knows you're here?
No.
I wanted to be sure you're ok.
And I thought you might need some help cleaning up.
That's what friends do, right?
You got a broom?
Sure.
I'm a witch.
So, how many times did Diana say, "I told you so?"
Not once.
Until right when she was walking inside her house.
Hey, I'm glad you found out your mom was trying to do the right thing.
Me, too.
But Diana was right.
I was so determined to find out about her,
I put us all in danger.
No, you were right.
Maybe we didn't go about it the right way, but a maniac came after us at the dance.
And tonight, a demon.
A demon.
We need to know what happened 16 years ago.
Our lives depend on it.
I'm not sure Diana agrees.
Well, I agree.
You do?
After tonight?
Yeah.
What's out there is a lot bigger than any of us ever thought.
Thanks.

I've seen it in here.
Here.
That's my mother's handwriting.
She had to be the one to put the spell on Heather.
I need to know why.
It's a suppression spell of some kind.
Why would my mother do that?
She would never hurt someone like this.
Not the mother I knew.
I'm sorry, Cassie.
Does it say how to undo it?
Um...
Right here, I think.
I want to.
If we can undo this spell, then she can tell us what happened.
If it even works.
We have to try.
You saw that woman.
If we can make her better, we have to.
♪ I can't begin to... ♪
Hey, what are you doing?
Waiting for Nick.
I'm early.
Listen, I wanted to apologize about before.
If you really like Nick, then I'll get on board with it.
I promise.
The last thing I'd want is for you to think I was jealous of him.
Thanks.
Sure.
And by the way...
I think Nick got here early, too.
You're a bitch.
No.
I'm you're friend.
The spell requires a poultice.
And that would be?
A magic potion.
And I'm being serious.
I have most of the ingredients here except the main one.
Which is blood.
The spell maker's.
Yours.
You're cool with that?
And, um...
My mom used her blood to begin with, right?
If it was her spell, she did.
Hey, can you do it?
Because I'm like petrified of needles.
Ok.
Are you going to do it, or are you just keep torturing me?
Ok.
How's that?
Hey!
You're here.
Adam told me what you want to do.
Yeah, you should have seen Heather Barnes.
- We have to help her.
- Are you sure you are?
We're going to undo the spell that was put on her.
I don't think it's a good idea.
What if we do it wrong?
What if it hurts her worse?
We'll be careful.
How do you even know what you're doing?
My book doesn't even tell you how to undo a spell like this.
My book does.
You have a book?
It was her mother's.
She left it for her.
It has the spell.
You're the one who always wanted to know what happened to our parents.
Maybe we can find out with the two books.
Not now, Adam.
Not for this.
It's too risky.
I'm sorry, Cassie.
You can't do the spell by yourself and we can't help you.
Adam?
We can help her.
You didn't see her.
What my mom did.
Please?
I'm sorry.
Maybe when we understand more.
But right now, we just don't know enough to do something like this.
Diana.
Let me talk to her.
Hey.
You having fun out there with your little chipee?
What are you talking about?
I saw you talking to that girl.
You mean Andrea?
Come on, Mel.
We were talking.
Didn't look like you were talking to me.
So now I can't talk to girls?
Is that the deal now?
You know, I was hoping maybe to get 5 minutes before you turned into a douche.
What's going on with you?
I thought things were good.
You know what?
Faye was right.
You're never going to change.
Go find another slut toy.
I'm done.
What are you doing here?
Adam and Diana just left.
Why so pouty?
You wouldn't understand.
Try me.
Fine.
I want to undo a spell that could answer a lot of questions about how our parents died 16 years ago and Diana and Adam won't help me.
Boy, did I miss a chapter.
Wait a minute, is that a Book of Shadows?
You have your own?
I have looked and looked for my family's book and I can't find it.
That's enough.
Oh, come on, don't be like that.
I thought you needed help.
You're going to help me?
Sure.
If you let me read your book, why not?
You need my help.
And to be honest, I have never understood why we're not better friends.
Let's go.
You conveniently left out the haunted house part.
Yes.
Come on.
This is really creepy.
Your mother did this?
Why?
I don't know.
That's what I'm hoping to find out.
I mean, seriously.
What could anyone do to deserve...
Your mother must have been one mean ass witch--
Faye.
Please.
Can we just try to help her?
I'm sorry.
Let's do this.
I'm going to apply the stuff that Adam and I made and then we'll do the chant together.
Will it work?
I have no idea.
I don't know what the spell is,
I don't know what the words mean,
I don't even know how to pronounce them.
Ok, we can do this.
You dragged me all the way out here, so let's get to the bottom of it.
"Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia."
"Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia."
Again?
Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia.
Rongaire balorum eunarach vicit romnia.
I'm sorry.
I thought it would work.
Maybe we did it wrong?
Or I screwed up the potion?
Can we talk about this in the car?
Far away from here.
Thanks for trying.
I know I don't come across like I care about much...
But my dad died that night.
I don't think my mom's ever gotten over it.
And I want to know what happened just as much as anyone.
I guess we're all in the same boat.
Yep, a boat full of sad witches.
So how about we go back to your place and check out the book?
Another time.
I'd say I've earned a peek, wouldn't you?
Yes.
Heather?
Oh, my God.
Heather, what the hell's happening?
Aah!
Waiting to catch me cheating?
I came to apologize.
I overreacted.
You think?
I saw you with that other girl and I just went off.
I'm sorry.
Yeah?
Faye was saying some things and I made the mistake of listening.
Like what?
It doesn't matter.
Just stupid things.
It's not like you're my boyfriend or anything, so I don't have the right to be jealous.
Ok.
So...
We're good?
Yeah.
We're good.
I'm sorry for putting you in the middle of this thing with Cassie.
I understand why you don't want to do this.
I just know how badly Cassie wants to find answers.
You know.
Well, I'm glad she didn't.
Because I went back to my book.
I knew there was something about that symbol that bugged me.
Look at this.
These are all ubilaz markings.
Uh...really old, black magic.
Demons, evil entities...
Possession.
Heather was possessed?
The notes here are all about using snakes and insects as vessels for dark energy.
Forcing them inside someone.
I think the Sigils are meant to keep it from coming back out.
Like a suppression spell.
This is way beyond witchcraft.
It's seriously dark magic.
None of this was in Cassie's book.
If she'd known about this, she never would have tried the spell.
That's kinda the point I was making.
I've got to call her.
Why?
She didn't do the spell.
But she still needs to know.
Ok, that's enough for today.
Oh, calm down.
Or I can take it home with me and be out of your hair.
Mmm.
Will you bring me back some snacks?
No carbs.
Where is Amelia?
Can you help me find Amelia?
She's not here.
How did you...
Are you ok?
I need to see her.
Amelia passed away.
No.
I'm her daughter.
Cassie.
Cassie.
You were a baby.
I tried to help her take you away.
She did.
She took me far away from here.
She wanted you to be safe.
She tried to leave that night.
What night?
Do you mean the night of the fire?
Can you tell me what happened that night?
She was trying to stop it.
She wanted to protect us.
All of us.
But it went inside me.
What did?
Evil.
And I can still feel it.
It hurts.
Aah!
Your mother couldn't get it out.
But she made the pain go away.
And now it's come back.
Ohh!
Can you please help me?
How?
How can I?
Please...make it stop.
She's not picking up.
Ugh.
Voicemail.
Try again.
Ah.
Hi, sweetie.
What?
Who is this?
It's Cassie.
I miss you.
Come make magic with me.
Faye?
Why is she answering Cassie's phone?
Faye, just put Cassie on.
She's downstairs.
Faye, this is important.
Oh, you sound hot.
What are you wearing?
Does Diana know you're calling?
Faye, please.
What happened?
You fainted.
Is that what my mom did?
Is this how she stopped your pain?
Yes.
I went to the boat yard, but I couldn't find her.
Why was she there?
How did the fire start?
Wherever there are witches...
Evil follows.
What do you mean?
They'd been summoned.
They were trying to use your mother's power.
Her and her friends.
Who was?
Why?
She couldn't stop them all.
And one of them got inside me.
One what?
Heather, please, tell me who she was trying to stop.
Demons.
Heather!
Hey, Cassie, dream boat's on the phone...
Desperate for you.
Cassie?
Aah!
Aah!
Faye?
Help!
Oh, God.
Aah!
Aah!
Faye!
Faye?
Wait.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Come on!
Come on, run!
Back door.
Front door.
Run.
It's me.
What's going on?
Look behind you!
Aah!
Uh!
Aah!
Heather.
Heather!
Heather, it's me.
She came out of nowhere.
We have to take the body now, Mr. Barnes.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Barnes.
She's at peace now.
I'm glad you're ok.
I am pretty far from ok.
At least I'm alive.
Thanks.
Come on.
I'll give you a ride home.
No thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm sorry you had to go through this.
I still don't even get what happened really.
One minute she was talking to me and then...
I found the Sigil your mother used to suppress the demon in my Book of Shadows.
A demon?
That's what Heather said.
How can there be demons?
I just know we have to be careful.
There's too much we don't understand.
What was I thinking?
Taking any of this on without knowing anything?
You need answers.
We all do.
I understand.
But after this, we just have to be careful how we get them.
We should go, Adam.
My dad's going to worry.
You're ok?
Yeah.
♪ Oh, oh... ♪
You were pretty impressive back there.
Thanks.
So, are you staying over?
Yeah, if it's ok.
I'm never going to be the guy you want me to be.
Is that a warning or a threat?
I'm going to disappoint you.
You deserve better.
That's the sweetest thing you've ever said to me.
I'm not disappointed.

Hey.
Where's Diana?
I took her home.
She knows you're here?
No.
I wanted to be sure you're ok.
And I thought you might need some help cleaning up.
That's what friends do, right?
You got a broom?
Sure.
I'm a witch.
So, how many times did Diana say, "I told you so?"
Not once.
Until right when she was walking inside her house.
Hey, I'm glad you found out your mom was trying to do the right thing.
Me, too.
But Diana was right.
I was so determined to find out about her,
I put us all in danger.
No, you were right.
Maybe we didn't go about it the right way, but a maniac came after us at the dance.
And tonight, a demon.
A demon.
We need to know what happened 16 years ago.
Our lives depend on it.
I'm not sure Diana agrees.
Well, I agree.
You do?
After tonight?
Yeah.
What's out there is a lot bigger than any of us ever thought.
Thanks.

My sweet Cassie,
You finding this means I'm gone, and for that, I am so sorry.
I didn't want you to have this life.
But destiny's not easy to run from.
Hi, I'm Diana.
You seen her yet?
She got in yesterday.
We're different.
You're different.
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded, 100% witch.
You're here.

You can get Cassie to do what we need?

- We're witches.
Diana found her mom's Book of Shadows.
She's the only one with the book?
That's the ferry that killed her parents.
Among the victims was Heather Barnes.
[Beep]
Heather Barnes was on the student council with Cassie's mom.
I'm sorry Heather died!
Heather didn't die.
What Amelia did to her was far worse.

Zachary said my mother did something terrible to Heather Barnes.
He said it was worse than death.
So, what did you find out?
After the fire, she spent two years in a psychiatric hospital.
Then she was released and just dropped off the face of the Earth.
Did she have any family?
A brother in Finn Creek.
No phone listing, but he lives close to here.
Want to go with me after school, check it out?
Yes, of course...
Wait.
I can't go today.
Can't go where?
Hey, you!
Finn Creek.
Why do you wanna go to Finn Creek?
We're trying to find out what happened to Heather Barnes.
She has a brother there.
And you think he knows something?
It's worth checking out.
But I can go by myself, not a big deal.
You don't wanna do that.
Finn Creek is a sketchy area.
Adam, why don't you take her?
I can't reschedule my counselor eval.
No, it's fine.
Really.
I'm fine.
Heather was in that fire 16 years ago.
Maybe she can tell us what happened to our parents.
Sure.
I'll pick you up after school?
Ok...
It's ok.
Really.
We're friends.
We're in this together.
Come on.
[Sighs]
I hate this binding stuff.
What's the point of being a damned witch if I can't do any magic by myself?
I might as well become a cheerleader.
Bite your tongue.
Why can't it be fun?
Like that movie, "The Craft"?
I mean the first half, not the stuff with the snakes.
The part where we put spells on boys and change our hair color and levitate.
We should practice later.
I'm kind of tied up...
With what?
Nick?
Look, I know you like this guy.
But we both know it's not going to last.
He's a dog.
That's not true.
He can be sweet.
When he wants to get into your pants.
He hits on every girl in school and you know it.
Don't be "that" pathetic girl who thinks he'll change "for me."
They never change.
Ok, I got it.
He's a loser.
I'm a loser.
You feel better?
Oh, this is looking more and more like a bad idea.
We'll be ok.
What is this place?
It used to be a little fishing village but most people moved away and this is what's left.
[Dog barking in background]
This is it.
Hi, we're looking for Wade Barnes.
Actually, we were looking for Heather Barnes.
But we know Wade lives here.
I'm Wade.
What do you want with my sister?
My mother, Amelia Blake, was friends with Heather when they were young.
[Sighs]
You knew Amelia?
I knew her.
My mother died a few months ago.
I was hoping to ask Heather a few questions.
Do you know where she is?
She's right here.
Oh.
Would it be all right if we talked to her?
No.
It wouldn't.
Maybe that's something Heather should decide.
You think so?
Well, then come on in.
Stop.
Ask her anything you want.
Heather?
She hasn't moved in 16 years.
What's wrong with her?
Years back there was a fire at the boat yard.
We know.
Some died and some survived.
If you call this surviving.
Do the doctors know what caused it?
No one does.
She went there with your mother.
Why?
I don't know.
Of kids used to go down to that boat yard to party and have fun.
She was a different person back then.
I'm sorry.
[Grunting] Aah!
Cassie, let's go!
Aah!

What just happened?

You said she hasn't moved in 16 years?
Not at all.
Not a muscle.
And then you come.
What did you do?
Nothing.
This didn't have anything to do with me.
Well, she grabbed your arm.
Not mine and not his.
Heather?
Are you there?
Hey.
Heather, it's me.
Can you hear me?
Heather?
It's ok.
We should go.
I'm sorry, Mr. Barnes.
I wish there was something I could do to help.
Ohh.
That scar on her arm.
It's witchcraft, isn't it?
It's a Sigil.
They're used for certain spells.
I've seen them before in our research.
Do you think that's what's wrong with her?
A spell?
Zachary said my mother did something to Heather that was worse than death.
Is that what he meant?
Cassie, I don't know.
Is that why she grabbed me?
Because somehow she knew I was related?
It doesn't make sense.
Heather was her friend.
Why would she do that to a friend?
We don't know your mother did this.
No...
I do know.
Where's your grandmother?
At the hospital.
Working the late shift.
She's a nurse.
I know.
When I was 10, she set my arm when I broke it.
I found this.
Is that what I think it is?
My family's Book of Shadows.
I found it when I first got here.
But how?
My mother left it for me.
She wanted me to find it.
I haven't told anyone.
Can I see it?
Each of the six families has their own book, but we've only found Diana's.
Everything we know about who we are, we got from her book.
But it's specific to her family.
Different spells, different histories.
This book is completely different.
We could learn so much from this.
The Sigil on Heather's arm...

I tried to help her take you away.
She did.
She took me far away from here.
She wanted you to be safe.
She tried to leave that night.
What night?
Do you mean the night of the fire?
Can you tell me what happened that night?
She was trying to stop it.
She wanted to protect us.
All of us.
But it went inside me.
What did?
Evil.
And I can still feel it.
It hurts.
Aah!
Your mother couldn't get it out.
But she made the pain go away.
And now it's come back.
Ohh!
Can you please help me?
How?
How can I?
[Crying]
Please...make it stop.
[Screaming]
[Line ringing]
She's not picking up.
[Vibrating]
Ugh.
Voicemail.
Try again.
[Vibrating]
Ah.
Hi, sweetie.
What?
Who is this?
It's Cassie.
I miss you.
Come make magic with me.
Faye?
Why is she answering Cassie's phone?
Faye, just put Cassie on.
She's downstairs.
Faye, this is important.
Oh, you sound hot.
What are you wearing?
Does Diana know you're calling?
Faye, please.
What happened?
You fainted.
Is that what my mom did?
Is this how she stopped your pain?
Yes.
I went to the boat yard, but I couldn't find her.
Why was she there?
How did the fire start?
Wherever there are witches...
Evil follows.
What do you mean?
They'd been summoned.
They were trying to use your mother's power.
Her and her friends.
Who was?
Why?
She couldn't stop them all.
And one of them got inside me.
One what?
Heather, please, tell me who she was trying to stop.
Demons.
[Breathing heavily]
Heather!
[Growling]
Hey, Cassie, dream boat's on the phone...
Desperate for you.
Cassie?
Aah!
Aah!
Faye?
Help!
Oh, God.
Aah!
[Screaming]
[Grunting]
Aah!
Faye!
Faye?
Wait.
Aah!
[Grunting]
Aah!
Aah!
[Screaming]
Cassie:
Come on!
Come on, run!
[Screaming]
Back door.
Front door.
Run.
[Screaming]
It's me.
What's going on?
Look behind you!
Aah!
Uh!
Aah!
Heather.
Heather!
Heather, it's me.
[Tires screeching]
She came out of nowhere.
[Police radio chatter]
We have to take the body now, Mr. Barnes.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Barnes.
She's at peace now.
I'm glad you're ok.
I am pretty far from ok.
At least I'm alive.
Thanks.
Come on.
I'll give you a ride home.
No thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm sorry you had to go through this.
I still don't even get what happened really.
One minute she was talking to me and then...
I found the Sigil your mother used to suppress the demon in my Book of Shadows.
A demon?
That's what Heather said.
How can there be demons?
I just know we have to be careful.
There's too much we don't understand.
What was I thinking?
Taking any of this on without knowing anything?
You need answers.
We all do.
I understand.
But after this, we just have to be careful how we get them.
We should go, Adam.
My dad's going to worry.
You're ok?
Yeah.
♪ Oh, oh... ♪
You were pretty impressive back there.
Thanks.
So, are you staying over?
Yeah, if it's ok.
I'm never going to be the guy you want me to be.
Is that a warning or a threat?
I'm going to disappoint you.
You deserve better.
That's the sweetest thing you've ever said to me.
I'm not disappointed.
♪ I think I'm coming down ♪
♪ I think I'm comin' down... ♪
[Knock on door]
Hey.
Where's Diana?
I took her home.
She knows you're here?
No.
I wanted to be sure you're ok.
And I thought you might need some help cleaning up.
That's what friends do, right?
You got a broom?
Sure.
I'm a witch.
So, how many times did Diana say, "I told you so?"
Not once.
Until right when she was walking inside her house.
Hey, I'm glad you found out your mom was trying to do the right thing.
Me, too.
But Diana was right.
I was so determined to find out about her,
I put us all in danger.
No, you were right.
Maybe we didn't go about it the right way, but a maniac came after us at the dance.
And tonight, a demon.
A demon.
We need to know what happened 16 years ago.
Our lives depend on it.
I'm not sure Diana agrees.
Well, I agree.
You do?
After tonight?
Yeah.
What's out there is a lot bigger than any of us ever thought.
Thanks.

Snitch.
Snitch.
Wards 1033 - 1034, open the doors!
Voitto Fjäder is a snitch, lives in Kakskerta.
Kill him.
VARES:
THE GARTER SNAKE
Here we go.
A pair of sixes.
Once again, I drew a blank.
The Lord gave, the Lord took away.
The winner sweeps the board.
Jussi, was that a comment - on your lack of success with women, or with work?
Both.
A hot summer will fix the latter.
People will become hormonal.
Is that what your work is?
Following adulterers.
90 percent of it is tailing, yeah.
When I started studying theology, monogamy was considered a virtue.
When I went to law school, helping your friends was more important.
We have a lot in common.
We're drop-outs, always thirsty - and we passionately hate women's knee socks.
Your business isn't going well.
You're late on your payments.
Your order will be delivered this week.
Monday is payday.
I want it all, with interest.
Bench pressing is hard with broken arms.
You hear me?
Korsio.
Keep emptying that shit bucket, Rapp.
There's a lot of shit in here, and you're doing a lot of time.
Did you know that your manger is on a historical site?
This used to be the gallows hill.
Turku is a cruel city.
We have a prison in the center.
When you get out, you immediately blend in with the population.
Where have you swiped this treasure trove of books?
You're not a thief, are you?
- No.
I had this client whose wife was cheating on him.
I found out about it.
The client went to the other man's home and told his wife:
"Since your husband is using my book, I'm using your books."
Then he picked the best ones and paid my fee.
How about finding a book of your own?
No, I intend to stay single.
A loyal library user.
Or who knows what happens after this?
The caller was Pauli KKontio, a lawyer who looked- like I could've looked, had my life turned out differently.
A very successful lawyer.
The first impression was clear.
Small talk was foreign to Kontio
Vares?
My wife, Annika.
This is about her infidelity.
Can I get you something?
- No, thank you.
We don't have children.
We're both focused on our careers.
I bought her an art gallery.
So you want me to find evidence for a divorce.
- No.
I want that man out of Finland.
He's working as a pianist here.
Find the evidence for deportation.
That kind of guy must have more on his conscience.
What if this toy boy is clean as a whistle?
That's unlikely, but I have a plan B.
A traveling grant will make him homesick.
But you'll find evidence.
As a businessman, I appreciate the cheaper option.
You have two weeks.
I'll pay you well.
If the result meets my wishes, I'll take that into account.
I expect to hear from you by noon tomorrow.
Get acquainted with the material and call me.
It's time for another reminder.
The payment was due yesterday.
Korsio!
The fucking punk just won't learn.
What is it now?
Goddammit!
Korsio!
Come here, now!
What are you doing here?
- Working.
Didn't we agree you wouldn't come to these places?
Check one out.
You know the guy?
Lobo?
There's plenty to investigate in that operator.
You know him well?
- No.
It's his third summer playing here.
He lives as a subtenant with this dentist.
He's determined to fuck everything on two legs.
Sounds like you have experience.
I believe that isn't part of your assignment.
Kontio's assignment was quite off-putting - but the man had become what I'd dreamed of becoming.
It's Vares.
I accept the assignment, and I'll be in touch.
Kontio had been a liquidator during the previous recession - and taken over the estate of an investment company, Arctos.
He'd made it very profitable in a short time.
He seemed so criminal that he would surely pay my fee.
Maybe we should amputate it.
- A fucking comedian.
Fuck!
- How did you fall down so badly?
Why don't you keep your mouth shut and mind your own business?
Lobo, Jesus Marla.
Born in Algeciras, Spain, July 6th, 1979.
Place of residence:
Stockholm.
Occupation:
Postman.
The two previous summers, he'd stayed at a student dorm.
Now he was a subtenant with dentist Seija Kaunispää.
Unmarried, no children
Unmarried but not lonely, judging by what Anna told me.
He was a good pianist, who sometimes played on cruise ships to Sweden.
Besides women, Lobo seemed to understand art better than I did.
I began to see why Kontio was so worried about his wife.
I'll pick you up tomorrow at MM. Ciao!
Goddammit!
What the fuck's going on again?
Get off!
What's up, cripple?
Must be hard to take care of business with one leg.
I have regular customers.
A little disability won't hurt.
It'll hurt the payments.
Kunkku told me to remind you about the payday.
The cock will have to lay eggs.
Tell Kunkku to stop stressing.
The package is ready.
There may be something extra in it for him.
- There must be.
You've maxed out your credit.
What's this about?
Reverend Alanen knows half the people In Turku - but what does he have to do with this recession-time playboy?
Who should I suspect now, and of what?
And where have I seen this guy?
Maybe at a hockey match.
UFV-210.
Owned by Aarno's Car Agency.
Owned by Aarno Wasenius, who also has a firm called Magnifying Glass.
A detective agency.
I don't believe In coincidences, but that's what it was.
The deceitful Annika Kontio gave me a lead in her own case.
MM, where she promised to pick up Lobo, was an upscale gym.
It looked suitable for Lobo, even without Annika.
Can I help you?
Well, yeah.
I need to get in shape.
I don't know anything about this gym thing.
I see you have other beginners too.
The owner, Voitto Fjäder, or Leevi Rönkkö, is always here.
They both have years of experience as personal trainers.
Leevi came third in the Nordic Championships' senior category - and Voitto bench presses three times his own weight.
Really?
So do I. I'll have to think about it.
Don't change your perfume.
It drives a man crazy.
I almost bumped Into Voitto Fjäder, who ran this sweaty business
He was so modest in size - that his bench pressing result was almost believable.
And the car looked more religious than the little man himself.
This Lobo was a colorful guy in many ways.
But there was no indication of more than just high hormone levels.
This woman looked like a dentist.
I guessed she was the landlady.
The rent payment seemed to be in order.
Here's a little bonus.
- And the old debt is settled?
Exactly, if all goes smoothly on Sunday.
How was your leave?
- Fun and games.
Pissing will start to sting next week.
That's a cheap price for the fun.
- How's our project coming along?
The project reached its destination.
Didn't they check?
- They're not interested in an old man's ass.
When are we making the switch?
- Now, if you like.
Okay, Rapp is the last one.
Sign off those blades then.
How do you want it?
- Just a little from the back.
This gentleman needs a transformation.
You've been very active lately.
I have to take care of business, goddammit.
A barber's chair is like a confessional, a place to talk.
You wouldn't have anything you'd like to tell Kunkku?
How about a joke?
What did the leper say to a hooker?
Why does Rapp look so red?
- He's allergic to eau de cologne.
Hey, what did the leper say?
- "Keep the tip."
Anna didn't like that I hung out watching - how a taxi driver made her extra Income.
But she had to work with Lobo, and my work was tailing Lobo.
She had to put up with it.
But the strange situation had its perks.
Anna was much better looking - than I'd imagined, looking at her drivers uniform.
Waiter!
Bring me a bottle of Chivas.
And a Wasp for the girl.
I don't know if I can bring the whole bottle.
This is for you.
For your personal use.
My man of the world.
Leevi, let's make requests.
Take this to the musician.
The next song's for you.
- Vode...
Shut up and ask for the check.
I'll go and...
This seems to be a supernatural morning.
This is amazing...
Preparing for going out.
Alright.
Goodbye.
See you.
Vares.
- It's Kontio.
Greetings from Helsinki Report?
The case is starting to take shape.
His fingers are busy on more than piano keys.
Good, that was fast.
Keep It discreet.
- Of course.
I don't want anyone to be traumatized by this.
Bye.
So you don't know what was in the briefcase?
It may have been from a bank.
God only knows what's inside.
God knows, the police investigate.
There could be many people who were at odds with the victim.
Angry husbands.
I think Lobo was running some sort of drug trade.
That's for the narcotics division.
Let's focus on the homicide.
A crime of jealousy comes to mind.
- Is that right?
I'd look into the people at the gym.
Don't you start teaching your dad how to fuck.
I don't have to.
Your mom taught us both.
Calm down.
We have a dangerous escaped prisoner and a homicide.
Let's get back to business, so we can get out of here.
I'll get out, but you'll stick around.
Let's go over it again.
Annika Kontio, the dentist Kaunispää -
Voitto Fjäder, Inga Näs, and power-lifter Rönkkö.
That's your idea of Lobo's friends.
You forget the guy in a vest, and the private eye Wasenius.
He's even weirder than you.
A former forensics investigator - who sold something from the depot and pocketed the money.
He was discharged, with a record.
What do your records say about the gym trio?
Fjäder and Inga have dabbled with hormone dealing.
The guy sure hasn't taken his growth hormone pills.
I think this is enough for now.
Jussi.
If you were planning a trip, you'd better put it on hold.
I have watchdogs at the port.
You won't leave Turku.
Do you understand?
I felt that Hautavainio hadn't told me everything - while that gorilla was sitting there listening
Excuse me.
And what Hautavainio didn't tell me almost cost me my life.
Antidote, what are you doing here?
What does it look like?
Keeping my nose clean.
Torsten Rapp.
You know him?
Antidote hears everything and knows everything - but doesn't say anything.
And hey...
You didn't see me here.
Cheer up, Jussi.
It'll be alright.
A man is happy for one night after drinking a bottle - for a week after finding a woman, but for life tending his garden.
Are you saying happiness is a disposable consumer product - except if you're a drunken, polygamous gardener?
Tell me, what was your relationship with that Lobo guy?
Our relationship was purely financial.
Selling old books isn't exactly a goldmine.
Lobo helped me to expand my product range.
Can you rustle up another drink?
- Just a moment.
Porn is sold everywhere these days, and the Internet is full of fun.
There are certain subcultures with special preferences.
Certain taxpayers have a taste for the extreme.
Do you want to see?
- Absolutely not.
You have a negative attitude to sexuality, Jussi.
I see.
Did Lobo import that stuff for you?
I don't know if he did it himself, but he had contacts in Sweden - and he was a reliable subcontractor.
Did you socialize with him in any of those extreme circles?
I haven't come out of the closet yet.
Neither have you.
I'm off to the gallows hill now.
- Be careful.
Someone out there doesn't put much weight on human life.
It doesn't weigh much anyway.
Vares.
- Are you sober?
That's hardly your problem.
The way I see it, our working relationship is over.
The pianist is pushing daisies, and your nuclear family is safe.
That's the wrong tone.
Your assignment continues.
The police took my passport.
I'm not allowed to leave the city
Aren't you in Helsinki?
You have an alibi, don't you?
I want you to clear me of all suspicion.
You violated professional ethics by telling them about me.
In homicide cases, my ethics take a back seat.
Vares!
Open your mouth, please.
I can't handle this without a cognac.
That's alright.
I'm not on top form myself.
You're my last patient today.
I'm really sorry.
Can I make it up to you?
I can't charge you for anything, but I could use a ride.
My car is being... serviced.
- I can arrange that.
Kaunispää's car must've been at the crime lab.
At least the environment felt safe.
She lived right across from the Pharmacy bar.
Thanks.
Come in and have a glass of wine.
Thanks, but I'm not a wine guy.
Coffee would be nice.
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll take a quick shower.
It was so easy, as if It had been scripted
I didn't think I'd find anything after the police in Lobo's room - but it's always Interesting to peek into your target's world.
Are you sure you don't want any?
- I'm fine.
I'll drink by myself then.
To a lost friend.
- Jesus Maria Lobo.
How do you know that?
- I'm a private detective.
I was hired to investigate him, but now he's dead.
I thought private detectives existed only in old movies.
- New ones too.
Your client is a secret, I presume.
- You have a good view.
Are you sure you don't want any, or are you on duty?
Can I speak frankly?
- Go ahead.
Did you have a relationship with Lobo?
- Not exactly.
If you don't count fucking twice a month.
You don't call that a relationship?
- It was more like a deal.
Lobo got a great apartment, and I got an able man in my bed.
Sounds like a satisfying arrangement.
Can you tell me more?
He had many acquaintances, and he received calls all the time - but never brought anyone here.
I don't know about his playing, but he was a great lover.
Finnish boys have a lot to learn.
- We're trying to keep up.
What was his lifestyle?
- He woke up at noon.
He hung around town, like restaurant workers do.
Went to the gym.
I don't think he worked out.
There was a woman, I presume.
Do you think he did anything illegal?
- No.
Lobo was a scoundrel, an honest scoundrel.
I love scoundrels.
You know what?
I just remembered I have laundry in the machine.
Did you tell the police about your relationship?
Find out yourself, little faggot.
Hi.
- If it isn't Turku's own Mike Hammer.
Hi.
- If it isn't Turku's own Mike Hammer.
Where did you crawl from?
- The dentist, believe it or not.
I thought you have a chronic fear of doctors.
- It's worse now.
First I interrupted her, and then she tried to get under my belt.
I wouldn't fill her cavity.
Jussi, Jussi.
Claustrophobia is a terrible disorder.
She was no virgin.
She talked about fucking the way Luusalmi does.
Now I'm interested.
Where's her practice?
...a prisoner called Torsten Rapp, considered armed and dangerous.
Are you going to work?
Do you have a new musician, or are you using recordings?
Drunk as a skunk again.
You could talk nicely to me, you know.
Right.
Like the late Lobo.
With silent whispers of love.
Fuck off.
- Anna, hey...
My investigations into women didn't go very smoothly.
I decided to meet a male for a change.
Turku Is a small town.
It was strange that I'd never run Into the other private eye.
I had no leads left.
My only option was to turn to a colleague.
Hello.
- Hello.
How long have you been standing there?
- I just arrived.
Vares.
Jussi Vares.
- Oh, right.
The police mentioned you in connection with the Spaniard.
We've been after the same guy.
What's wrong with the car?
- Rust.
I have half a mind to blow it to kingdom come.
But a little welding and some paint, and it'll be good as new.
Do you have time to chat, one professional to another?
I always have time for a colleague.
Would you like some coffee?
- Sure.
You followed that Lobo guy longer than I did.
Why do you think he was murdered?
It's crystal clear.
He fooled around with women.
Some guy had enough of it, or one of the women went crazy.
Of course.
Did you ever see him carrying a plastic briefcase?
No.
Coffee?
- Thanks.
Did he do anything else that caught your attention?
He had more women than I have clean shirts.
- We know that.
This is a little impolite, but no thanks.
Could you tell me your client's name?
As a professional, you should know it's a bit hairy.
I have an expense account for cash payments.
Tell me yours, and I'll tell you mine.
We'll trade.
Pauli Kontio, a lawyer in Turku.
You know the name?
I don't know any lawyers.
Pelli, Matti.
Chief petty officer from Pansio.
Long stretches on a ship, the wife pines away ashore.
A soldier knows how to use a gun.
- He has an alibi.
He was at the officers' club - so drunk he couldn't have shot a barn wall.
But the mission is accomplished.
He's filing for divorce.
Everything happens so fast these days.
Have a nice day then, colleague.
Oh yeah, a couple more things.
First:
If you lie, don't get caught out.
Second:
There are no cash payments in a fair trade.
The coffee was good.
Thanks.
Hey.
Can I help you with something?
Are you interested?
These are by Riikka Puronen.
I have a few questions, yeah.
Jussi Vares, private detective.
About the death of Jesus Maria Lobo.
Why ask me?
- I saw you together.
Where?
Did you follow him?
Why are you asking me...
The important thing is to solve this case somehow.
You're right.
Ask away.
I'll try to answer the best I can.
What was your relationship like?
We were lovers.
I loved him very much, and I still do.
Sounds quite serious.
- Love is always serious.
Did you have plans for the future?
Let's not go there.
A little respect for the deceased.
True.
What about your marriage?
- What's that have to do with it?
My marriage is just self-deception and delusion.
I'm a trophy wife, that's all.
- What about your husband?
He's a manipulative, self-centered jerk-off.
He's never had time for me.
- That's what we men are like.
What about now?
I have to consider the financial realities.
Was Lobo different somehow?
We all have our past, but Lobo told me everything.
We trusted each other completely.
- Did he bring you drugs?
Mr. Vares, please.
Keeping track of Lobo wasn't easy after all.
Sex with and without money, drugs, porn, and jealous husbands - who hired snoops to follow the imported prick.
Fuck.
Hi.
I'm not good at apologizing...
but shall we reconcile with a drink?
From which bottle?
Whichever you like.
Are you going to let me in, or do I have to find someone else?
Come in.
Thanks again.
Are you sure you're not tired of running a spa?
It's not a big deal.
I try to do one good deed a week.
Thanks.
It compensates for my frustrations, as they say in women's magazines.
You don't read women's magazines, or anything else.
Is there more room in your good deed quota?
I always have room for you.
But can you do me a favor in return?
Besides driving you around south-western Finland?
Well?
- You knew Lobo.
Can you tell me something about him?
About his businesses - that might have something to do with his murder.
Okay, but this has to stay between us.
We had a fling.
But more importantly for you, he sold pot.
That doesn't surprise me at all.
Why don't we ever get high?
Let's have some cognac.
Let's drink to life.
Life that happens to be dangerous, by the way.
I've noticed.
What's most dangerous in life?
Besides lounging on my sofa.
Driving a taxi.
- Calling adult phone lines.
Organ transplants.
- Therapy groups.
Sliding down the Himalayas on a sled.
A publishing launch for Luusalmi's short stories.
Daylight saving time.
Sunbathing.
Blow-jobs.
Wild sex.
- Fucking.
Are you sure you won't spend the night?
Yes, I am.
And this never happened.
You won't have any news to tell at your regular table.
You know what?
As far as this goes, my news agency is closed.
Let's find some more information to hide.
Escaped prisoner Torsten Rapp is still on the loose.
There have been sightings of him all over the country - but he's suspected to be hiding in south-eastern Finland
Rapp is likely to be armed and...
Hello.
I'm Mutikainen from realty company Arctos.
Does that house belong to Voitto Fjäder?
- Yes.
Rumor has it that it's on sale.
- I haven't seen him for a long time.
Can you even see such a small man?
I mean, he probably works a lot.
How come?
- He has a big boat and a villa too, I hear.
I guess running a gym pays off.
- Okay.
Have a nice day, and thanks.
Snitch.
My next short story is about the most sacred thing of all.
The great mystery that has puzzled mankind from the beginning of time.
All Luusalmi's short stories are about one and the same thing.
What is this subject that you always come back to?
Pussy, of course.
- Love.
Anna prefers the art of dance.
I've often become aware - that Miss Taxi Driver here has quite a divine body.
Would you allow me to dedicate my next short story to it?
I'm taking my body to work now.
And you two gentlemen, have a great evening.
I apologize for interrupting your night out with friends.
Not accepted.
Do you know MM Gym?
- Of course.
I go there three, four times a week.
Oh.
What about Voitto Fjäder?
Everyone knows him, but we see Leevi Rönkkö more often.
Rönkkö?
What kind of man is he?
His background is with the Laestadian Church.
He's some sort of power-lifter.
There are all kinds of people at the gym who never work out.
Thanks!
Damn...
This doesn't belong to the homicide division - but when I heard who it was, I decided to take a look.
The bomb was detonated with a radio transmitter.
It would've killed you.
A good thing you were outside.
You wouldn't happen to know a reliable Volvo dealer?
I used to know one, but he went bankrupt.
Stop by the station and give a statement.
Have I ever told you...
Bloody hell.
...that I moved here in a funeral car?
You could've gone back in the same.
Jussi, be careful.
I got off pretty easy.
The blast felt nasty, but although I don't believe In luck - it was luck that spared me from serious Injuries
Could Voitto Fjäder be a murderer?
Had he found out that I went snooping at his house?
Having come to a dead end, I decided to try an old tactic:
Attack is the best form of attack.
Hey, is that...
Hey!
Who are you?
Did you kill Lobo?
Did you kill Lobo?
You can't come here...
Leevi!
- This is not a work-out space.
I'm a mock trainer.
Jussi Vares.
You know Jesus Maria Lobo.
I know hundreds of people.
- Where did you get to know him?
He came to buy a season ticket.
- No wonder, such a fancy gym.
What do you want?
- Who do you rent this from?
None of your business, but it's not a secret.
From a realty investment firm.
Arctos or something.
Business is good.
- That's between me and the authorities.
Such an honest taxpayer.
How about pill dealing?
I've paid my fine for that.
- Did Lobo deliver you the pills?
This man needs some fresh air.
- Stay away from me.
You have a nice boat, car, and house - and judging by the gym attendance, it's kind of strange.
Is either of you an electrician?
- You're a lunatic!
Get some help.
The next morning, I felt even stranger.
The case seemed better suited to an astrologer than a detective.
I became convinced that Fjäder wasn't behind the murder attempt.
Who else wanted to get rid of me?
I hadn't hurt even the flies that had moved into my apartment.
Maybe I need to find a cheap cleaner.
Antidote!
How's the wind in the willows?
Do you like this music?
- Give me a break.
Do you know Voitto Fjäder?
- Yeah.
What about him?
Just asking.
Have a beer with me.
- I can't.
My quota is full.
Another time then.
- Jussi...
Take it easy tonight.
There are bad boys at large.
And beware of that midget.
Thanks.
Meronen!
What's up?
Long time no see.
That name is on my tax deduction card.
I'm known as Nero.
I didn't know you used a tax deduction card.
You're looking well.
- And getting better.
You have a lot of gigs?
Let's just say that life has been good to me lately.
Yeah, I noticed that at the gym.
How's your memory?
Can you answer some questions?
Sure, if the price is right.
Go ahead.
Shoot.
Inga Näs, the honey bunny.
- Who doesn't know her?
The merry widow.
You're not horny, are you?
- Always.
She wasn't first in line, when smarts were handed out.
Her boyfriend is serving a long sentence.
I thought her boyfriend's name was Voitto Fjäder.
You know him?
You know his friend?
Jesus Maria Lobo?
Are these difficult questions?
- They don't ring a bell.
An interesting gallery of people.
What's this all about?
There isn't drug trade going on at Fjäder's gym, is there?
I'll get a refill.
You want something?
Sure, that's a rare offer.
These ladies will have drinks too.
Now you have a good reason to use my services.
Be careful, okay?
A.
There's a reliable guy.
Let's drink to your unfinished law studies.
Hi!
Jesus, the state you're in.
Hi...
I came looking for you.
Jussi!
Do you think it was the same guy who killed Jesu?
How should I know?
I didn't see who drove that car.
Jussi, this was the second time.
I know.
I'm really sorry that I've dragged you into this.
Don't forget that I dealt with Jesu long before you did.
If I was in a better state, we could...
We agreed that we...
- Yeah, yeah.
I'm sorry.
I went to Fjäder's gym, by the way.
I looked around a bit.
- How did the place look like?
I had a talk with Leevi, on the spur of the moment.
Can that knuckle-head speak?
I played an innocent little girl who's interested in hormones.
At first, he was convincingly dumb.
Then he slipped out a name, a guy called Nero.
What are you doing here?
Fuck!
Fuck you too, and I don't mean those drinks you brought...
- I'm dying!
A young snitch doesn't die that easily.
I don't appreciate it when someone I know sends killers after me.
What the fuck?
- I can prove that you're dealing for Fjäder.
In the same chain that includes Jesus Maria Lobo - who's growing poppies in happier fields now.
Nod if I'm right.
- You're not!
I still don't know to whom you texted at night.
I'm guessing it was Voitto Fjäder.
Okay, okay, okay!
I texted Vode.
Did you want me to get killed?
- No.
I just told him that we met, and asked for advice.
Is Voitto responsible for my murder attempt?
- I don't know.
I don't know!
- Are you as ignorant about Lobo's murder too?
What's this stuff?
It stings like hell!
Let me see.
Look, morning urine.
Hey, hey, hey...
I'm just a seller.
Vode panicked when Lobo died and the cops were everywhere.
What interested them the most?
- Money.
Lobo was a small player.
He just arranged some traffic, and he knew all the mules.
The big boys are in Sweden.
- Denmark and Amsterdam.
There's a middleman here, whom no one knows.
He has a supply of hard stuff that he distributes through the gym.
But only to sellers, never to users.
Rule number one.
One more question.
Think hard about this.
Do you have coffee?
- Huh?
Want one?
- Is this pure tobacco?
I guess I can smoke this anyway.
- Shut up.
Sorry.
Your willingness to co-operate works in your favor.
Have you told me everything?
- Yes, I have.
You're studying the infrastructure of your new hometown.
I know that Rapp dude.
He used to hang out with Vode.
- Tell me more.
Rapp was caught with a drug stash.
A big pile of money disappeared.
One cop was paralyzed in the process.
You can imagine that the sentence was long.
They say that someone snitched on Rapp.
I hear he's a maniac.
Funny.
At the same time when Rapp gets caught -
Fjäder's revenue increases significantly.
Vode isn't happy about the escape.
I don't know about Inga.
What do you mean?
- Inga was Rapp's girlfriend.
You're wrong about one thing.
Leevi and Vode may pump iron - but they're not the least bit violent.
Who the fuck is it now?
What if he told this loony everything?
- He said he didn't.
Nero and I agreed that he needs a one-way ticket far away.
He should go back to Kauhava.
- He went even further.
Check how our guest is doing.
Where are we going now?
To what do I owe this honor?
You'll find out soon enough.
It all started - when you sent that chick to the gym and went to bother Nero.
Rather amateurish.
- Your bomb was amateurish.
Last time we met, I had some doubts about your sanity.
They keep getting stronger.
- I can't help with your emotional state.
I just want to know why Lobo had to be killed.
We're interested in that too.
We had nothing to do with it.
We could exchange information.
You're going to sing for us.
I'm not much of a singer.
If you need entertainment, can't your monkey dance for you?
I tried to come and warn you...
- I know.
I believe you.
Watch it.
It won't break.
How are you?
- Not bad.
Leevi took a swing at me.
We're going to be fine.
They killed Jesu.
- I can't prove it, and I don't care anymore.
Leevi, take the little boat and go to the store.
Buy a week's worth of food.
Inga will write you a list.
Make sure you're not followed, and buy the evening papers.
Was it the Boss?
- I checked the weather.
It'll rain tonight.
What took you so long?
- I ran out of gas.
"According to eyewitnesses, Rapp has been seen in Virolahti -
Nummela, Hailuoto, and the Torne River Valley."
How's that possible?
"A gun store robbed in Raisio." Bloody hell.
What if he tries to come here?
Leevi, get the shotgun and start keeping watch.
Can I have a cigarette?
My nerves are shattered.
Bite your nails.
He can't find us here.
He doesn't know about this place.
- Don't be so sure.
At least give me a beer.
The most wanted criminal can't really walk just anywhere.
Three days, and he's caught.
- Torsten isn't that easy.
Easy...
Coming from your mouth, that sounds fucking absurd.
We need to take a leak.
- Piss in your pants.
What shall we do with them?
- We need to know whom they've talked to.
Do you have better ideas?
What did the Boss say?
- That it's all the same to him.
Let's kill them.
- Kill?
And then?
- We'll wait until the cops catch Torsten.
Then we'll empty the stash and drive the boat to Copenhagen.
I have money invested in the house, gym, and this place.
What should we do then?
Wait for the cops at the gym?
Those two have talked too much.
How much do you know?
- I'm not talking until this lady gets out.
Nero told me everything, and I called the cops.
They'll be here.
Did you hear that, Vode?
Let's get out of here.
A guy who looks like me can't travel incognito.
Put a pacifier in your mouth, and Inga can push you in a stroller.
Fucking clown.
The jokes will stop, once your brains are on your chest.
Don't!
We've never killed anyone.
Killing is always bad.
Little do you know, dimwit.
Leevi, get the storm lantern.
Put it on the table.
Torsten...
Torsten, honey...
- Put the gun down, monkey!
Now!
How are you, Inga?
You look like you've missed me terribly.
Sit down in the wicker chair, fatso.
Hands under your ass!
Hands under your ass!
Hey, don't move.
Don't move, I said.
Did the cat catch your tongue?
It was wagging just now.
About a killing plan, if I heard correctly.
You'll get what's coming to a snitch.
Or a snake.
That's what you are.
A fucking garter snake.
I love you.
I read about your sentence in the paper.
It was awful.
I've never loved anyone else.
I had to make a living...
You have a funny way of loving.
Three years and one letter.
I was warned about you back then, but I was too stupid.
Who finances you these days?
I doubt that midget told you.
You can't keep your mouth shut.
Inga, roll me a joint.
You have dexterous fingers.
I'll kill you after that.
Leevi...
I killed him.
- Inga...
You killed him.
Now we have to clean up.
The place is a mess.
Let's clean up.
Those two...
We have to do something about them.
Let's burn this place down.
- I've never killed anyone, and I won't.
We'll get rid of them, and ransack Vode's stash in Turku.
Do you know the safe combination?
- He never told me anything.
Leevi, don't do it.
Fucking coward.
Do women always have to do everything?
Shut up!
- That woman has nothing to lose.
She's already a murderer.
Whose side are you on?
- Give me the gun.
You don't know what you're doing.
- It's empty!
It's not empty!
- Give me the gun!
I think there's an organization in Turku, which was run by Fjäder.
Lobo was the link between Turku and Stockholm.
He knew all the mules.
- This is a common pattern.
Fjäder probably received financing from outside.
That's also common in this business.
If Fjäder was the only link to the financier - he'll be hard to find.
Money men cover their tracks.
Let's move upward from the bottom.
Of the street-level guys, you knew Rolf Meronen aka Nero, and Rönkkö.
For the record...
Oh, thanks.
They were both willing to co-operate.
It won't help Nero, but Rönkkö acted like a man in the villa.
On the face of it, the case looks clear - but we still have an unsolved homicide on our books.
It's hard to believe that the gang was behind it.
Lobo was essential for the organization.
We'll have to question Inga Näs.
Maybe Fjäder had a bout of jealousy.
I have a feeling that the woman will be declared unaccountable.
So...
Do you need a ride?
The Pharmacy or the gallows hill?
Lucky coincidence that you found me.
I'm on summer vacation.
I won't take much of your time.
I gather you've had a rough day.
- Comes with the career choice.
It's good to hear some first-hand information.
I have no stories to tell.
I came here to quit.
I wasn't able to solve Lobo's murder.
I believe we have some unfinished financial business.
I'll charge you my daily expenses, and nothing extra.
Write down your account number.
I'd rather send you a bill, for bookkeeping.
I'll pay you some extra for the pain.
How's marital life?
- Very good, thanks.
I just booked us a Caribbean cruise.
Will you get your passports back?
- I think so.
One question.
What's your role in this Arctos firm?
I'm just an investor.
It's a realty investment firm.
All the information is in the Register of Enterprises.
Did you know that Arctos's property was used for drug dealing?
Arctos rented the space to a gym entrepreneur.
Yeah, Voitto Fjäder.
Did you know him personally?
I never met him.
That was three questions, by the way.
Math isn't my strong suit.
I suspect you're involved in financing a drug business - but you're so clever that you haven't been caught.
That's absurd.
If I was involved in anything illegal - why would I hire a screw-up like you to look into my business?
That's what I've been wondering.
I'll send you that bill.
To life, Jussi.
To life.
I'm not so sure if life is worth toasting.
It's often pretty unfair.
This case has upset detective Vares quite a bit.
You don't have to be a priest to notice that.
A murderer is running free, and I barely made it alive.
It's not very funny.
Are you going to voice your suspicions to Hautavainio?
I don't have the slightest chance to prove anything.
Well, let's drink to vocations.
We make our living our own way.
It could be worse.
You could be an unemployed welder from Pansio.
Have you had absinthe for breakfast?
I can't hold a welding torch.
Right.
You're an honest "gun for hire" - the crème de la crème of private detectives
I have half a mind to blow it to kingdom come.
That's right.
Hey, where are you off to?
Hey.
- Hey.
UFV-210 seen at the port.
Aarno, long time no see.
Are you going on vacation?
Wouldn't it be better to confess?
- I won't confess to anything.
We have enough cause to arrest you for the murder of Jesus Maria Lobo.
But no evidence.
How did you become like that?
- How about yourself?
Give it to me.
Show it to Wasenius.
What does this contain?
Tell me, goddammit!
What does it contain?
Fuck!
Opportunity makes the thief Wasenius sang about everything.
He'd been following Lobo and found out he was a drug dealer.
Since sending Lobo to jail would've been no use to Aarne - he sent him to happier poppy fields.
The discharged policeman made a bundle on drugs.
The case was neatly wrapped up.
The only thing that bothered me was that the big boys were free.
But on the other hand...
The big boys always stay free.
Subtitles:

Snitch.
Snitch.
Wards 1033 - 1034, open the doors!
Voitto Fjäder is a snitch, lives in Kakskerta.
Kill him.
VARES:
THE GARTER SNAKE
Here we go.
A pair of sixes.
Once again, I drew a blank.
The Lord gave, the Lord took away.
The winner sweeps the board.
Jussi, was that a comment - on your lack of success with women, or with work?
Both.
A hot summer will fix the latter.
People will become hormonal.
Is that what your work is?
Following adulterers.
90 percent of it is tailing, yeah.
When I started studying theology, monogamy was considered a virtue.
When I went to law school, helping your friends was more important.
We have a lot in common.
We're drop-outs, always thirsty - and we passionately hate women's knee socks.
Your business isn't going well.
You're late on your payments.
Your order will be delivered this week.
Monday is payday.
I want it all, with interest.
Bench pressing is hard with broken arms.
You hear me?
Korsio.
Keep emptying that shit bucket, Rapp.
There's a lot of shit in here, and you're doing a lot of time.
Did you know that your manger is on a historical site?
This used to be the gallows hill.
Turku is a cruel city.
We have a prison in the center.
When you get out, you immediately blend in with the population.
Where have you swiped this treasure trove of books?
You're not a thief, are you?
- No.
I had this client whose wife was cheating on him.
I found out about it.
The client went to the other man's home and told his wife:
"Since your husband is using my book, I'm using your books."
Then he picked the best ones and paid my fee.
How about finding a book of your own?
No, I intend to stay single.
A loyal library user.
Or who knows what happens after this?
The caller was Pauli KKontio, a lawyer who looked- like I could've looked, had my life turned out differently.
A very successful lawyer.
The first impression was clear.
Small talk was foreign to Kontio
Vares?
My wife, Annika.
This is about her infidelity.
Can I get you something?
- No, thank you.
We don't have children.
We're both focused on our careers.
I bought her an art gallery.
So you want me to find evidence for a divorce.
- No.
I want that man out of Finland.
He's working as a pianist here.
Find the evidence for deportation.
That kind of guy must have more on his conscience.
What if this toy boy is clean as a whistle?
That's unlikely, but I have a plan B.
A traveling grant will make him homesick.
But you'll find evidence.
As a businessman, I appreciate the cheaper option.
You have two weeks.
I'll pay you well.
If the result meets my wishes, I'll take that into account.
I expect to hear from you by noon tomorrow.
Get acquainted with the material and call me.
It's time for another reminder.
The payment was due yesterday.
Korsio!
The fucking punk just won't learn.
What is it now?
Goddammit!
Korsio!
Come here, now!
What are you doing here?
- Working.
Didn't we agree you wouldn't come to these places?
Check one out.
You know the guy?
Lobo?
There's plenty to investigate in that operator.
You know him well?
- No.
It's his third summer playing here.
He lives as a subtenant with this dentist.
He's determined to fuck everything on two legs.
Sounds like you have experience.
I believe that isn't part of your assignment.
Kontio's assignment was quite off-putting - but the man had become what I'd dreamed of becoming.
It's Vares.
I accept the assignment, and I'll be in touch.
Kontio had been a liquidator during the previous recession - and taken over the estate of an investment company, Arctos.
He'd made it very profitable in a short time.
He seemed so criminal that he would surely pay my fee.
Maybe we should amputate it.
- A fucking comedian.
Fuck!
- How did you fall down so badly?
Why don't you keep your mouth shut and mind your own business?
Lobo, Jesus Marla.
Born in Algeciras, Spain, July 6th, 1979.
Place of residence:
Stockholm.
Occupation:
Postman.
The two previous summers, he'd stayed at a student dorm.
Now he was a subtenant with dentist Seija Kaunispää.
Unmarried, no children
Unmarried but not lonely, judging by what Anna told me.
He was a good pianist, who sometimes played on cruise ships to Sweden.
Besides women, Lobo seemed to understand art better than I did.
I began to see why Kontio was so worried about his wife.
I'll pick you up tomorrow at MM. Ciao!
Goddammit!
What the fuck's going on again?
Get off!
What's up, cripple?
Must be hard to take care of business with one leg.
I have regular customers.
A little disability won't hurt.
It'll hurt the payments.
Kunkku told me to remind you about the payday.
The cock will have to lay eggs.
Tell Kunkku to stop stressing.
The package is ready.
There may be something extra in it for him.
- There must be.
You've maxed out your credit.
What's this about?
Reverend Alanen knows half the people In Turku - but what does he have to do with this recession-time playboy?
Who should I suspect now, and of what?
And where have I seen this guy?
Maybe at a hockey match.
UFV-210.
Owned by Aarno's Car Agency.
Owned by Aarno Wasenius, who also has a firm called Magnifying Glass.
A detective agency.
I don't believe In coincidences, but that's what it was.
The deceitful Annika Kontio gave me a lead in her own case.
MM, where she promised to pick up Lobo, was an upscale gym.
It looked suitable for Lobo, even without Annika.
Can I help you?
Well, yeah.
I need to get in shape.
I don't know anything about this gym thing.
I see you have other beginners too.
The owner, Voitto Fjäder, or Leevi Rönkkö, is always here.
They both have years of experience as personal trainers.
Leevi came third in the Nordic Championships' senior category - and Voitto bench presses three times his own weight.
Really?
So do I. I'll have to think about it.
Don't change your perfume.
It drives a man crazy.
I almost bumped Into Voitto Fjäder, who ran this sweaty business
He was so modest in size - that his bench pressing result was almost believable.
And the car looked more religious than the little man himself.
This Lobo was a colorful guy in many ways.
But there was no indication of more than just high hormone levels.
This woman looked like a dentist.
I guessed she was the landlady.
The rent payment seemed to be in order.
Here's a little bonus.
- And the old debt is settled?
Exactly, if all goes smoothly on Sunday.
How was your leave?
- Fun and games.
Pissing will start to sting next week.
That's a cheap price for the fun.
- How's our project coming along?
The project reached its destination.
Didn't they check?
- They're not interested in an old man's ass.
When are we making the switch?
- Now, if you like.
Okay, Rapp is the last one.
Sign off those blades then.
How do you want it?
- Just a little from the back.
This gentleman needs a transformation.
You've been very active lately.
I have to take care of business, goddammit.
A barber's chair is like a confessional, a place to talk.
You wouldn't have anything you'd like to tell Kunkku?
How about a joke?
What did the leper say to a hooker?
Why does Rapp look so red?
- He's allergic to eau de cologne.
Hey, what did the leper say?
- "Keep the tip."
Anna didn't like that I hung out watching - how a taxi driver made her extra Income.
But she had to work with Lobo, and my work was tailing Lobo.
She had to put up with it.
But the strange situation had its perks.
Anna was much better looking - than I'd imagined, looking at her drivers uniform.
Waiter!
Bring me a bottle of Chivas.
And a Wasp for the girl.
I don't know if I can bring the whole bottle.
This is for you.
For your personal use.
My man of the world.
Leevi, let's make requests.
Take this to the musician.
The next song's for you.
- Vode...
Shut up and ask for the check.
I'll go and...
This seems to be a supernatural morning.
This is amazing...
Preparing for going out.
Alright.
Goodbye.
See you.
Vares.
- It's Kontio.
Greetings from Helsinki Report?
The case is starting to take shape.
His fingers are busy on more than piano keys.
Good, that was fast.
Keep It discreet.
- Of course.
I don't want anyone to be traumatized by this.
Bye.
So you don't know what was in the briefcase?
It may have been from a bank.
God only knows what's inside.
God knows, the police investigate.
There could be many people who were at odds with the victim.
Angry husbands.
I think Lobo was running some sort of drug trade.
That's for the narcotics division.
Let's focus on the homicide.
A crime of jealousy comes to mind.
- Is that right?
I'd look into the people at the gym.
Don't you start teaching your dad how to fuck.
I don't have to.
Your mom taught us both.
Calm down.
We have a dangerous escaped prisoner and a homicide.
Let's get back to business, so we can get out of here.
I'll get out, but you'll stick around.
Let's go over it again.
Annika Kontio, the dentist Kaunispää -
Voitto Fjäder, Inga Näs, and power-lifter Rönkkö.
That's your idea of Lobo's friends.
You forget the guy in a vest, and the private eye Wasenius.
He's even weirder than you.
A former forensics investigator - who sold something from the depot and pocketed the money.
He was discharged, with a record.
What do your records say about the gym trio?
Fjäder and Inga have dabbled with hormone dealing.
The guy sure hasn't taken his growth hormone pills.
I think this is enough for now.
Jussi.
If you were planning a trip, you'd better put it on hold.
I have watchdogs at the port.
You won't leave Turku.
Do you understand?
I felt that Hautavainio hadn't told me everything - while that gorilla was sitting there listening
Excuse me.
And what Hautavainio didn't tell me almost cost me my life.
Antidote, what are you doing here?
What does it look like?
Keeping my nose clean.
Torsten Rapp.
You know him?
Antidote hears everything and knows everything - but doesn't say anything.
And hey...
You didn't see me here.
Cheer up, Jussi.
It'll be alright.
A man is happy for one night after drinking a bottle - for a week after finding a woman, but for life tending his garden.
Are you saying happiness is a disposable consumer product - except if you're a drunken, polygamous gardener?
Tell me, what was your relationship with that Lobo guy?
Our relationship was purely financial.
Selling old books isn't exactly a goldmine.
Lobo helped me to expand my product range.
Can you rustle up another drink?
- Just a moment.
Porn is sold everywhere these days, and the Internet is full of fun.
There are certain subcultures with special preferences.
Certain taxpayers have a taste for the extreme.
Do you want to see?
- Absolutely not.
You have a negative attitude to sexuality, Jussi.
I see.
Did Lobo import that stuff for you?
I don't know if he did it himself, but he had contacts in Sweden - and he was a reliable subcontractor.
Did you socialize with him in any of those extreme circles?
I haven't come out of the closet yet.
Neither have you.
I'm off to the gallows hill now.
- Be careful.
Someone out there doesn't put much weight on human life.
It doesn't weigh much anyway.
Vares.
- Are you sober?
That's hardly your problem.
The way I see it, our working relationship is over.
The pianist is pushing daisies, and your nuclear family is safe.
That's the wrong tone.
Your assignment continues.
The police took my passport.
I'm not allowed to leave the city
Aren't you in Helsinki?
You have an alibi, don't you?
I want you to clear me of all suspicion.
You violated professional ethics by telling them about me.
In homicide cases, my ethics take a back seat.
Vares!
Open your mouth, please.
I can't handle this without a cognac.
That's alright.
I'm not on top form myself.
You're my last patient today.
I'm really sorry.
Can I make it up to you?
I can't charge you for anything, but I could use a ride.
My car is being... serviced.
- I can arrange that.
Kaunispää's car must've been at the crime lab.
At least the environment felt safe.
She lived right across from the Pharmacy bar.
Thanks.
Come in and have a glass of wine.
Thanks, but I'm not a wine guy.
Coffee would be nice.
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll take a quick shower.
It was so easy, as if It had been scripted
I didn't think I'd find anything after the police in Lobo's room - but it's always Interesting to peek into your target's world.
Are you sure you don't want any?
- I'm fine.
I'll drink by myself then.
To a lost friend.
- Jesus Maria Lobo.
How do you know that?
- I'm a private detective.
I was hired to investigate him, but now he's dead.
I thought private detectives existed only in old movies.
- New ones too.
Your client is a secret, I presume.
- You have a good view.
Are you sure you don't want any, or are you on duty?
Can I speak frankly?
- Go ahead.
Did you have a relationship with Lobo?
- Not exactly.
If you don't count fucking twice a month.
You don't call that a relationship?
- It was more like a deal.
Lobo got a great apartment, and I got an able man in my bed.
Sounds like a satisfying arrangement.
Can you tell me more?
He had many acquaintances, and he received calls all the time - but never brought anyone here.
I don't know about his playing, but he was a great lover.
Finnish boys have a lot to learn.
- We're trying to keep up.
What was his lifestyle?
- He woke up at noon.
He hung around town, like restaurant workers do.
Went to the gym.
I don't think he worked out.
There was a woman, I presume.
Do you think he did anything illegal?
- No.
Lobo was a scoundrel, an honest scoundrel.
I love scoundrels.
You know what?
I just remembered I have laundry in the machine.
Did you tell the police about your relationship?
Find out yourself, little faggot.
Hi.
- If it isn't Turku's own Mike Hammer.
Hi.
- If it isn't Turku's own Mike Hammer.
Where did you crawl from?
- The dentist, believe it or not.
I thought you have a chronic fear of doctors.
- It's worse now.
First I interrupted her, and then she tried to get under my belt.
I wouldn't fill her cavity.
Jussi, Jussi.
Claustrophobia is a terrible disorder.
She was no virgin.
She talked about fucking the way Luusalmi does.
Now I'm interested.
Where's her practice?
...a prisoner called Torsten Rapp, considered armed and dangerous.
Are you going to work?
Do you have a new musician, or are you using recordings?
Drunk as a skunk again.
You could talk nicely to me, you know.
Right.
Like the late Lobo.
With silent whispers of love.
Fuck off.
- Anna, hey...
My investigations into women didn't go very smoothly.
I decided to meet a male for a change.
Turku Is a small town.
It was strange that I'd never run Into the other private eye.
I had no leads left.
My only option was to turn to a colleague.
Hello.
- Hello.
How long have you been standing there?
- I just arrived.
Vares.
Jussi Vares.
- Oh, right.
The police mentioned you in connection with the Spaniard.
We've been after the same guy.
What's wrong with the car?
- Rust.
I have half a mind to blow it to kingdom come.
But a little welding and some paint, and it'll be good as new.
Do you have time to chat, one professional to another?
I always have time for a colleague.
Would you like some coffee?
- Sure.
You followed that Lobo guy longer than I did.
Why do you think he was murdered?
It's crystal clear.
He fooled around with women.
Some guy had enough of it, or one of the women went crazy.
Of course.
Did you ever see him carrying a plastic briefcase?
No.
Coffee?
- Thanks.
Did he do anything else that caught your attention?
He had more women than I have clean shirts.
- We know that.
This is a little impolite, but no thanks.
Could you tell me your client's name?
As a professional, you should know it's a bit hairy.
I have an expense account for cash payments.
Tell me yours, and I'll tell you mine.
We'll trade.
Pauli Kontio, a lawyer in Turku.
You know the name?
I don't know any lawyers.
Pelli, Matti.
Chief petty officer from Pansio.
Long stretches on a ship, the wife pines away ashore.
A soldier knows how to use a gun.
- He has an alibi.
He was at the officers' club - so drunk he couldn't have shot a barn wall.
But the mission is accomplished.
He's filing for divorce.
Everything happens so fast these days.
Have a nice day then, colleague.
Oh yeah, a couple more things.
First:
If you lie, don't get caught out.
Second:
There are no cash payments in a fair trade.
The coffee was good.
Thanks.
Hey.
Can I help you with something?
Are you interested?
These are by Riikka Puronen.
I have a few questions, yeah.
Jussi Vares, private detective.
About the death of Jesus Maria Lobo.
Why ask me?
- I saw you together.
Where?
Did you follow him?
Why are you asking me...
The important thing is to solve this case somehow.
You're right.
Ask away.
I'll try to answer the best I can.
What was your relationship like?
We were lovers.
I loved him very much, and I still do.
Sounds quite serious.
- Love is always serious.
Did you have plans for the future?
Let's not go there.
A little respect for the deceased.
True.
What about your marriage?
- What's that have to do with it?
My marriage is just self-deception and delusion.
I'm a trophy wife, that's all.
- What about your husband?
He's a manipulative, self-centered jerk-off.
He's never had time for me.
- That's what we men are like.
What about now?
I have to consider the financial realities.
Was Lobo different somehow?
We all have our past, but Lobo told me everything.
We trusted each other completely.
- Did he bring you drugs?
Mr. Vares, please.
Keeping track of Lobo wasn't easy after all.
Sex with and without money, drugs, porn, and jealous husbands - who hired snoops to follow the imported prick.
Fuck.
Hi.
I'm not good at apologizing...
but shall we reconcile with a drink?
From which bottle?
Whichever you like.
Are you going to let me in, or do I have to find someone else?
Come in.
Thanks again.
Are you sure you're not tired of running a spa?
It's not a big deal.
I try to do one good deed a week.
Thanks.
It compensates for my frustrations, as they say in women's magazines.
You don't read women's magazines, or anything else.
Is there more room in your good deed quota?
I always have room for you.
But can you do me a favor in return?
Besides driving you around south-western Finland?
Well?
- You knew Lobo.
Can you tell me something about him?
About his businesses - that might have something to do with his murder.
Okay, but this has to stay between us.
We had a fling.
But more importantly for you, he sold pot.
That doesn't surprise me at all.
Why don't we ever get high?
Let's have some cognac.
Let's drink to life.
Life that happens to be dangerous, by the way.
I've noticed.
What's most dangerous in life?
Besides lounging on my sofa.
Driving a taxi.
- Calling adult phone lines.
Organ transplants.
- Therapy groups.
Sliding down the Himalayas on a sled.
A publishing launch for Luusalmi's short stories.
Daylight saving time.
Sunbathing.
Blow-jobs.
Wild sex.
- Fucking.
Are you sure you won't spend the night?
Yes, I am.
And this never happened.
You won't have any news to tell at your regular table.
You know what?
As far as this goes, my news agency is closed.
Let's find some more information to hide.
Escaped prisoner Torsten Rapp is still on the loose.
There have been sightings of him all over the country - but he's suspected to be hiding in south-eastern Finland
Rapp is likely to be armed and...
Hello.
I'm Mutikainen from realty company Arctos.
Does that house belong to Voitto Fjäder?
- Yes.
Rumor has it that it's on sale.
- I haven't seen him for a long time.
Can you even see such a small man?
I mean, he probably works a lot.
How come?
- He has a big boat and a villa too, I hear.
I guess running a gym pays off.
- Okay.
Have a nice day, and thanks.
Snitch.
My next short story is about the most sacred thing of all.
The great mystery that has puzzled mankind from the beginning of time.
All Luusalmi's short stories are about one and the same thing.
What is this subject that you always come back to?
Pussy, of course.
- Love.
Anna prefers the art of dance.
I've often become aware - that Miss Taxi Driver here has quite a divine body.
Would you allow me to dedicate my next short story to it?
I'm taking my body to work now.
And you two gentlemen, have a great evening.
I apologize for interrupting your night out with friends.
Not accepted.
Do you know MM Gym?
- Of course.
I go there three, four times a week.
Oh.
What about Voitto Fjäder?
Everyone knows him, but we see Leevi Rönkkö more often.
Rönkkö?
What kind of man is he?
His background is with the Laestadian Church.
He's some sort of power-lifter.
There are all kinds of people at the gym who never work out.
Thanks!
Damn...
This doesn't belong to the homicide division - but when I heard who it was, I decided to take a look.
The bomb was detonated with a radio transmitter.
It would've killed you.
A good thing you were outside.
You wouldn't happen to know a reliable Volvo dealer?
I used to know one, but he went bankrupt.
Stop by the station and give a statement.
Have I ever told you...
Bloody hell.
...that I moved here in a funeral car?
You could've gone back in the same.
Jussi, be careful.
I got off pretty easy.
The blast felt nasty, but although I don't believe In luck - it was luck that spared me from serious Injuries
Could Voitto Fjäder be a murderer?
Had he found out that I went snooping at his house?
Having come to a dead end, I decided to try an old tactic:
Attack is the best form of attack.
Hey, is that...
Hey!
Who are you?
Did you kill Lobo?
Did you kill Lobo?
You can't come here...
Leevi!
- This is not a work-out space.
I'm a mock trainer.
Jussi Vares.
You know Jesus Maria Lobo.
I know hundreds of people.
- Where did you get to know him?
He came to buy a season ticket.
- No wonder, such a fancy gym.
What do you want?
- Who do you rent this from?
None of your business, but it's not a secret.
From a realty investment firm.
Arctos or something.
Business is good.
- That's between me and the authorities.
Such an honest taxpayer.
How about pill dealing?
I've paid my fine for that.
- Did Lobo deliver you the pills?
This man needs some fresh air.
- Stay away from me.
You have a nice boat, car, and house - and judging by the gym attendance, it's kind of strange.
Is either of you an electrician?
- You're a lunatic!
Get some help.
The next morning, I felt even stranger.
The case seemed better suited to an astrologer than a detective.
I became convinced that Fjäder wasn't behind the murder attempt.
Who else wanted to get rid of me?
I hadn't hurt even the flies that had moved into my apartment.
Maybe I need to find a cheap cleaner.
Antidote!
How's the wind in the willows?
Do you like this music?
- Give me a break.
Do you know Voitto Fjäder?
- Yeah.
What about him?
Just asking.
Have a beer with me.
- I can't.
My quota is full.
Another time then.
- Jussi...
Take it easy tonight.
There are bad boys at large.
And beware of that midget.
Thanks.
Meronen!
What's up?
Long time no see.
That name is on my tax deduction card.
I'm known as Nero.
I didn't know you used a tax deduction card.
You're looking well.
- And getting better.
You have a lot of gigs?
Let's just say that life has been good to me lately.
Yeah, I noticed that at the gym.
How's your memory?
Can you answer some questions?
Sure, if the price is right.
Go ahead.
Shoot.
Inga Näs, the honey bunny.
- Who doesn't know her?
The merry widow.
You're not horny, are you?
- Always.
She wasn't first in line, when smarts were handed out.
Her boyfriend is serving a long sentence.
I thought her boyfriend's name was Voitto Fjäder.
You know him?
You know his friend?
Jesus Maria Lobo?
Are these difficult questions?
- They don't ring a bell.
An interesting gallery of people.
What's this all about?
There isn't drug trade going on at Fjäder's gym, is there?
I'll get a refill.
You want something?
Sure, that's a rare offer.
These ladies will have drinks too.
Now you have a good reason to use my services.
Be careful, okay?
A.
There's a reliable guy.
Let's drink to your unfinished law studies.
Hi!
Jesus, the state you're in.
Hi...
I came looking for you.
Jussi!
Do you think it was the same guy who killed Jesu?
How should I know?
I didn't see who drove that car.
Jussi, this was the second time.
I know.
I'm really sorry that I've dragged you into this.
Don't forget that I dealt with Jesu long before you did.
If I was in a better state, we could...
We agreed that we...
- Yeah, yeah.
I'm sorry.
I went to Fjäder's gym, by the way.
I looked around a bit.
- How did the place look like?
I had a talk with Leevi, on the spur of the moment.
Can that knuckle-head speak?
I played an innocent little girl who's interested in hormones.
At first, he was convincingly dumb.
Then he slipped out a name, a guy called Nero.
What are you doing here?
Fuck!
Fuck you too, and I don't mean those drinks you brought...
- I'm dying!
A young snitch doesn't die that easily.
I don't appreciate it when someone I know sends killers after me.
What the fuck?
- I can prove that you're dealing for Fjäder.
In the same chain that includes Jesus Maria Lobo - who's growing poppies in happier fields now.
Nod if I'm right.
- You're not!
I still don't know to whom you texted at night.
I'm guessing it was Voitto Fjäder.
Okay, okay, okay!
I texted Vode.
Did you want me to get killed?
- No.
I just told him that we met, and asked for advice.
Is Voitto responsible for my murder attempt?
- I don't know.
I don't know!
- Are you as ignorant about Lobo's murder too?
What's this stuff?
It stings like hell!
Let me see.
Look, morning urine.
Hey, hey, hey...
I'm just a seller.
Vode panicked when Lobo died and the cops were everywhere.
What interested them the most?
- Money.
Lobo was a small player.
He just arranged some traffic, and he knew all the mules.
The big boys are in Sweden.
- Denmark and Amsterdam.
There's a middleman here, whom no one knows.
He has a supply of hard stuff that he distributes through the gym.
But only to sellers, never to users.
Rule number one.
One more question.
Think hard about this.
Do you have coffee?
- Huh?
Want one?
- Is this pure tobacco?
I guess I can smoke this anyway.
- Shut up.
Sorry.
Your willingness to co-operate works in your favor.
Have you told me everything?
- Yes, I have.
You're studying the infrastructure of your new hometown.
I know that Rapp dude.
He used to hang out with Vode.
- Tell me more.
Rapp was caught with a drug stash.
A big pile of money disappeared.
One cop was paralyzed in the process.
You can imagine that the sentence was long.
They say that someone snitched on Rapp.
I hear he's a maniac.
Funny.
At the same time when Rapp gets caught -
Fjäder's revenue increases significantly.
Vode isn't happy about the escape.
I don't know about Inga.
What do you mean?
- Inga was Rapp's girlfriend.
You're wrong about one thing.
Leevi and Vode may pump iron - but they're not the least bit violent.
Who the fuck is it now?
What if he told this loony everything?
- He said he didn't.
Nero and I agreed that he needs a one-way ticket far away.
He should go back to Kauhava.
- He went even further.
Check how our guest is doing.
Where are we going now?
To what do I owe this honor?
You'll find out soon enough.
It all started - when you sent that chick to the gym and went to bother Nero.
Rather amateurish.
- Your bomb was amateurish.
Last time we met, I had some doubts about your sanity.
They keep getting stronger.
- I can't help with your emotional state.
I just want to know why Lobo had to be killed.
We're interested in that too.
We had nothing to do with it.
We could exchange information.
You're going to sing for us.
I'm not much of a singer.
If you need entertainment, can't your monkey dance for you?
I tried to come and warn you...
- I know.
I believe you.
Watch it.
It won't break.
How are you?
- Not bad.
Leevi took a swing at me.
We're going to be fine.
They killed Jesu.
- I can't prove it, and I don't care anymore.
Leevi, take the little boat and go to the store.
Buy a week's worth of food.
Inga will write you a list.
Make sure you're not followed, and buy the evening papers.
Was it the Boss?
- I checked the weather.
It'll rain tonight.
What took you so long?
- I ran out of gas.
"According to eyewitnesses, Rapp has been seen in Virolahti -
Nummela, Hailuoto, and the Torne River Valley."
How's that possible?
"A gun store robbed in Raisio." Bloody hell.
What if he tries to come here?
Leevi, get the shotgun and start keeping watch.
Can I have a cigarette?
My nerves are shattered.
Bite your nails.
He can't find us here.
He doesn't know about this place.
- Don't be so sure.
At least give me a beer.
The most wanted criminal can't really walk just anywhere.
Three days, and he's caught.
- Torsten isn't that easy.
Easy...
Coming from your mouth, that sounds fucking absurd.
We need to take a leak.
- Piss in your pants.
What shall we do with them?
- We need to know whom they've talked to.
Do you have better ideas?
What did the Boss say?
- That it's all the same to him.
Let's kill them.
- Kill?
And then?
- We'll wait until the cops catch Torsten.
Then we'll empty the stash and drive the boat to Copenhagen.
I have money invested in the house, gym, and this place.
What should we do then?
Wait for the cops at the gym?
Those two have talked too much.
How much do you know?
- I'm not talking until this lady gets out.
Nero told me everything, and I called the cops.
They'll be here.
Did you hear that, Vode?
Let's get out of here.
A guy who looks like me can't travel incognito.
Put a pacifier in your mouth, and Inga can push you in a stroller.
Fucking clown.
The jokes will stop, once your brains are on your chest.
Don't!
We've never killed anyone.
Killing is always bad.
Little do you know, dimwit.
Leevi, get the storm lantern.
Put it on the table.
Torsten...
Torsten, honey...
- Put the gun down, monkey!
Now!
How are you, Inga?
You look like you've missed me terribly.
Sit down in the wicker chair, fatso.
Hands under your ass!
Hands under your ass!
Hey, don't move.
Don't move, I said.
Did the cat catch your tongue?
It was wagging just now.
About a killing plan, if I heard correctly.
You'll get what's coming to a snitch.
Or a snake.
That's what you are.
A fucking garter snake.
I love you.
I read about your sentence in the paper.
It was awful.
I've never loved anyone else.
I had to make a living...
You have a funny way of loving.
Three years and one letter.
I was warned about you back then, but I was too stupid.
Who finances you these days?
I doubt that midget told you.
You can't keep your mouth shut.
Inga, roll me a joint.
You have dexterous fingers.
I'll kill you after that.
Leevi...
I killed him.
- Inga...
You killed him.
Now we have to clean up.
The place is a mess.
Let's clean up.
Those two...
We have to do something about them.
Let's burn this place down.
- I've never killed anyone, and I won't.
We'll get rid of them, and ransack Vode's stash in Turku.
Do you know the safe combination?
- He never told me anything.
Leevi, don't do it.
Fucking coward.
Do women always have to do everything?
Shut up!
- That woman has nothing to lose.
She's already a murderer.
Whose side are you on?
- Give me the gun.
You don't know what you're doing.
- It's empty!
It's not empty!
- Give me the gun!
I think there's an organization in Turku, which was run by Fjäder.
Lobo was the link between Turku and Stockholm.
He knew all the mules.
- This is a common pattern.
Fjäder probably received financing from outside.
That's also common in this business.
If Fjäder was the only link to the financier - he'll be hard to find.
Money men cover their tracks.
Let's move upward from the bottom.
Of the street-level guys, you knew Rolf Meronen aka Nero, and Rönkkö.
For the record...
Oh, thanks.
They were both willing to co-operate.
It won't help Nero, but Rönkkö acted like a man in the villa.
On the face of it, the case looks clear - but we still have an unsolved homicide on our books.
It's hard to believe that the gang was behind it.
Lobo was essential for the organization.
We'll have to question Inga Näs.
Maybe Fjäder had a bout of jealousy.
I have a feeling that the woman will be declared unaccountable.
So...
Do you need a ride?
The Pharmacy or the gallows hill?
Lucky coincidence that you found me.
I'm on summer vacation.
I won't take much of your time.
I gather you've had a rough day.
- Comes with the career choice.
It's good to hear some first-hand information.
I have no stories to tell.
I came here to quit.
I wasn't able to solve Lobo's murder.
I believe we have some unfinished financial business.
I'll charge you my daily expenses, and nothing extra.
Write down your account number.
I'd rather send you a bill, for bookkeeping.
I'll pay you some extra for the pain.
How's marital life?
- Very good, thanks.
I just booked us a Caribbean cruise.
Will you get your passports back?
- I think so.
One question.
What's your role in this Arctos firm?
I'm just an investor.
It's a realty investment firm.
All the information is in the Register of Enterprises.
Did you know that Arctos's property was used for drug dealing?
Arctos rented the space to a gym entrepreneur.
Yeah, Voitto Fjäder.
Did you know him personally?
I never met him.
That was three questions, by the way.
Math isn't my strong suit.
I suspect you're involved in financing a drug business - but you're so clever that you haven't been caught.
That's absurd.
If I was involved in anything illegal - why would I hire a screw-up like you to look into my business?
That's what I've been wondering.
I'll send you that bill.
To life, Jussi.
To life.
I'm not so sure if life is worth toasting.
It's often pretty unfair.
This case has upset detective Vares quite a bit.
You don't have to be a priest to notice that.
A murderer is running free, and I barely made it alive.
It's not very funny.
Are you going to voice your suspicions to Hautavainio?
I don't have the slightest chance to prove anything.
Well, let's drink to vocations.
We make our living our own way.
It could be worse.
You could be an unemployed welder from Pansio.
Have you had absinthe for breakfast?
I can't hold a welding torch.
Right.
You're an honest "gun for hire" - the crème de la crème of private detectives
I have half a mind to blow it to kingdom come.
That's right.
Hey, where are you off to?
Hey.
- Hey.
UFV-210 seen at the port.
Aarno, long time no see.
Are you going on vacation?
Wouldn't it be better to confess?
- I won't confess to anything.
We have enough cause to arrest you for the murder of Jesus Maria Lobo.
But no evidence.
How did you become like that?
- How about yourself?
Give it to me.
Show it to Wasenius.
What does this contain?
Tell me, goddammit!
What does it contain?
Fuck!
Opportunity makes the thief Wasenius sang about everything.
He'd been following Lobo and found out he was a drug dealer.
Since sending Lobo to jail would've been no use to Aarne - he sent him to happier poppy fields.
The discharged policeman made a bundle on drugs.
The case was neatly wrapped up.
The only thing that bothered me was that the big boys were free.
But on the other hand...
The big boys always stay free.

Mumbai.
Electric energy.
And the charm of frenzy.
Monsoon swept streets.
Neon lights.
And impossible dreams.
Hearts carelessly crushed under stilettos.
Career escalators moving at break-neck speed.
Mumbai!
Buzzing by day.
Pulsating by night.
Where every young woman can live the quintessential free independent life.
The city I adopted.
And the city that adopted me.
The city where l struggled to find my feet.
The city where l discovered who I was... and began to dream about where l wanted my life to go.
Brick by brick I built my life here.
And now with two weeks to go for my 30th birthday I finally feel like I've arrived.
Naina I'm cooking for you tonight.
Not again, Rishabh!
Every girl fancies a boyfriend, who could cook her a meal... but you on the other hand... I am happy to order in!
I'm a low maintenance girl.
That we'll know post marriage.
Let's figure out what babies eat.
Aren't we jumping the gun, Mr. Puri?
Can't wait...
So if you ask me... don't let Jamie get the better of you.
Your campaign's going to rock!
Stop trusting people so easily.
Just see people for what they truly are.
Pass me the olive oil please.
That's the wrong recipe.
You can't heat olive oil.
Trust me... when it comes to cooking food, and managing money.
The only two things you can do right.
Really, and writing poetry?
Correction.
Writing bad poetry.
And singing terribly.
Obviously, you're not going to marry a boring banker boy now, are you?
It's also because I'm also a chef, a poet and a singer that works in my favour.
It does... doesn't it?
Hey, Cheers Naina!
Hey Rachna!
Hey!
Come here...
let me pour you a glass.
What's the excitement all about?
Aha... the Bru campaign!
We've won the silver lion at Cannes for it.
Wow!
Jamie is going to France ...
to accept the award.
-Hey where's your glass?
-My glass?
Cheers is never enough.
Hey!
- Cheers.
-Aren't you happy?
-Of course!
Looks like they didn't enter your name as the copywriter.
You know that Jamie and I both worked on this campaign.
It's his baby...
And he was making no headway... till I was roped in.
And I cracked the idea.
You know Jamie's stand on this issue!
Anyway, it was Rathore who sent in the entry.
So it's his call.
We all know why Rats would do that.
Naina please...
Don't Naina me.
Now...
Naina calm down...
leave all the bitching to old Jamie.
F*** O**Jamie!
You should take the award for the most ethical copywriter.
Let's face it. I do have an edge...
Bull shit!
What you have is a tool... that you give out on hire.
Well who says it doesn't help to swing both ways, honey?
The old man Ogilvy himself said,
"There are very few men of genius in advertising agencies.
But we need all we can find.
Almost without exception they are disagreeable.
But don't destroy them.
They lay golden eggs." Eggs of gold Naina...
Eggs ofgold ".
But Mr. Golden Goose, Ogilvy also says,
"Our business is infested with idiots who try and impress using pretentious jargon."
Hey Naina, saw your U'va hoarding campaign in the morning... amazing, really eye-catching stuff!
So Jamie, do you want to take credit for that as well?
No honey, U'va is all yours.
You can have all the Golden Lions and their cubs and brouhaha with it.
We've lost the contract, again.
Because we haven't upgraded our machinery.
Why is it so difficult to upgrade the machinery?
.
I mean, you're losing so much business because of outdated infrastructure right?
You need a lot of capital... I'm telling dad to take a loan but... with the recession and returns to the investment being so low its not feasible
But I'm sure there's something else that we can do. I mean... three big factories...
a sheer waste.
Are things really that bad?
Worse!
And I feel so helpless, you know.
I'm busy making money for the bank.
And doing nothing for my family.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You have a right to do what you enjoy doing.
Isn't your car due for servicing?
Yes baby...take it next week.
Are you coming upstairs?
No honey, early morning meeting tomorrow.
Okay... goodnight.
Goodnight baby.
-Bye.
-Bye!
Couldn't resist.
Turned back halfway.
And the morning meeting?
Get up... otherwise you'll miss your meeting.
Rishabh... getup!
Hurry up!
Am I seeing you tonight?
No honey, I have to meet Maya aunty's daughter, Yamini tonight.
She's just back from the States.
Do you want me to come along?
No you chill...
Punjwani uncle wants his daughter to get to know everyone.
It's going to be boring as hell but I can't give it a miss.
And you know how mom and dad are about these things.
Cool... anyway I have to plan the peace concert.
-Shot through the heart, and you're to blame...
-Rishabh!
darling you give love a bad name...
Aren't you getting late...
go... go!
is there any chance I could perform at the concert?
No!
You're unbearable!
Now c'mon you're going to get late!
Bye sweety have a nice day.
You too... bye.
Okay guys what about this?
Listen black is not a day colour...
you can't wear that!
But Ruks I look really nice and thin in it...
Who cares Ruksana... as long as you look good in it, just go with it.
-Malini...
-Yes?
She has to look stunning.
This day comes once in a lifetime.
At least tell me you'll at least pretend to be surprised when he gives you the ring?
Oh yeah... guess what?
Oh my God you're so well prepared...
Better safe than sorry.
Okay listen can we...
Naina?
-Listen can we please focus on my clothes...
-These are yours?
Yes... okay what about this blue dress?
It's a nice wrap dress.
Okay listen we have to have a proper engagement celebration, okay?
.
Why don't we just combine it with your birthday party?
That's a very good idea.
Well actually Rishabh and I may be having a private celebration.
If you dare to get married without us there...
Don't worry Mal.
She won't be able to,we'll gatecrash!
Hey Yamini... come sit!
Something to drink?
Yeah, a glass of white wine would be great.
-White wine please.
-Sure sir.
So... you're all grown up.
Well considering the last time you saw me, I was like 14 or something...
You're quite a fuddy-duddy yourself!
Did you just call me a fuddy-duddy?
Well, you're not a style icon!
Neither am I a fashion disaster.
But you've got this boring-serious-corporate-type look.
You've got to loosen up...
Cheers!
Cheers. I think I'm fine though.
That's a first by the way.
Give me one day, I'll transform how you look.
I'm not going to be your guinea-pig!
C'mon it'll be fun!
A complete makeover.
Why don't you spare me and just become a... you know... stylist or something.
Hey, I enjoy fashion.
But I don't want to do it professionally.
A lot of my friends are designers or opening stores...
So what do you want to do?
Some serious, hardcore business.
Dad's told me to figure it out, he's willing to invest once I've decided.
Interesting!
You know...
I didn't want to come back.
I wanted to chill in New York for a few years.
Why didn't you?
My parents wanted me back.
And family matters to me more than anything else.
I'd do anything to see mom and dad happy.
That's pretty surprising...
I mean, look at me, I'm just doing my own thing, I'm least bothered about what my family expects from me.
So in your mind, what you want and what your family wants, are two different things...
Aren't they?
Maybe not...
Your girlfriend?
Yeah...
Take the call... lt's okay. I'll call back.
You're being a bad boy!
Am I?
And are you a good girl?
I wouldn't be the best judge of that...
What does your boyfriend feel?
If I was dating somebody... I wouldn't be here, right?
So you're giving me lessons in moral science?
No. I am just announcing that I'm single...
You're not thinking ahead, Rishabh!
Business, family...
You need to start taking responsibility.
But you will only do as you please... as always...
Hi... how was your day... lsn't it hot today?
Excuse me.
Somewine?
-Yes.
Chenin Blanc please.
-Okay ma'am... and sir?
Sorry, I'm late.
The meeting took forever.
No problem. lt's totally okay.
So, your campaign is all over town.
Yes well verdict's not in yet.
But work is not so hectic and... I was just thinking... if we could go to your Lonavla cottage,to celebrate my birthday... if you can take out time that is... I mean, you don't have to.
I just thought it will be a nice way to bring in my birthday.
We can always have a party here... I'm getting married.
Maya aunty's daughter, Yamini. I told you about her.
You are hilarious!
And it's a damn funny way to propose...
-l'm not...
I'm not...-l accept.
Look I'm serious. I am getting married to Yamini.
This is what I came here to tell you ...
Look I...
I know this must come as a real shock to you.
Shock?
Have you gone mad?
I mean do you even know what you're saying?
You met her two days ago... I know Naina. I'm sorry... but...
And what about us?
You...
You'll be fine.
You're...
You're wonderful and lovely and smart.
You'll be with a guy who deserves it.
Cut out the crappy speech Rishabh.
It's not a speech okay, it's true...
The truth is that we were supposed to get married... the truth is, we love each other, the truth is that you were going to ask me to marry you today...
Look I'm not denying any of that...
but things have changed.
So how long have you been seeing her?
I've not been seeing her Naina.
Yeah... right!
Look...
I know this is the worst thing I can do to you.
Bu tl don't have a choice Naina.
My... my parents want to... I thought they liked me...
They do like you Naina but...
This isn't about them anyway.
You don't f****** love me enough to marry me.
You don't have the balls to stand up for what you ******** want Rishabh... that's the problem.
I want different things Naina.
Different?
is she better in bed?
Look Naina...
I'm... I'm sorry...
You know I...
I still love you and I...
I always will love you.
Stop it Rishabh...
Naina let me drop you back...
Okay... you're in no condition to drive... I'll manage.
I don't know what I'm doing for my birthday... I know its high time I thought about getting married... but Rishabh and I are through.
Mom, I just told you everything.
I know you thought he is a great guy.
So did I.
Yeah but its over. I don'tknow...
we will sort it out.
I don't know.
No, obviously it doesn't mean you have to look for a new guy.
No... I know mom it'll become more difficult once I turn 30... but I'm turning 30 in a week!
Yes, I know that the astrologer said it could happen anytime now... but he's been saying that for years!
Okay mom, I have to go...
I am getting late for work.
Yes... and I'm absolutely fine.
There is no need for you to fly to Bombay.
Yes!
I am absolutely fine.
Yes...okay mom bye, love you!
What does a guy really mean when he breaks up with you... but says, that he still loves you and always will?
If he means what he's saying why would he break up with you in the first place?
is it just a way of making you feel better about being dumped?
Or is there a faint possibility that he may come back...?
The Sales of U'va have actually fallen.
I mean this campaign is a total disaster.
We're the laughing stock of the entire magazine industry.
We need to withdraw all our ads, immediately!
And we have to cancel our contract with ADZ.
No!
See we understand... and we take full responsibility for the loss.
And I'll put a new creative team on U'va.
Give us a chance to come up with an alternative.
I'm sorry, but we're taking this brand to another agency.
Naina, would you stay back for a minute?
You're fired!
What?
I'm fired because the campaign has bombed?
It was an important campaign.
It's an insult.
We've lost face in the industry.
Oh and for the record... this is the first time in history of our agency that... we've lost such a high profile campaign!
I still stand by the fact that it's a great idea.
And it can happen to the best of us.
Sometimes ideas work and sometimes they don't.
And you know that the idea was pre-tested and everybody approved... including you.
I agree.
But as...
the creative head... it is your responsibility.
It is my responsibility.
But you can't fire me forthis!
It hasn't worked, we'll try again.
There's no again, Naina.
You know, you haven't a clue of what works for the youth.
You don't have a pulse on the segment.
And your thinking is... too out-of-the-box.
And it is exactly my 'out-of-the-box thinking that got us the award at Cannes... for which of course, I'm getting no credit!
You've got a month... find yourself a new job.
Of course I'm fine...
I know logically why he wants to marry her.
She's rich as hell, heiress to a gold mine... and then she's young and it helps that she's so hot.
His family gets the money his parents are happy and he gets himself a trophy wife.
It's the whole package that works!
God knows how long he's been planning this.
I don't think he was seeing her before this but we can check if you like.
-That's not the point...
-What's the point?
The solution to one man is another man.
With God's grace, we'll soon find another guy for Naina.
Ruksana... there's more to life than men!
What do you want us to do for your birthday?
.
I don't know... whatever, anything!
30 is not just any age you know, it's special!
You're not a genius if you haven't proved it by 30.
-l think 35 is the new 30...-40, I think.
It's killing me...
I can't believe Rishabh would do this to me.
And I keep thinking of Rishabh and Yamini together.
And to top it up I'm turning 30, f****** hell!
Jobless and man-less!
Naina, I'm 30, I'm not married...
it's no big deal, seriously.
Not everyone's as crazy as you.
I would have died if I was turning 30 and I wasn't married yet.
Thankfully Sahil and I got married at the right time.
Check.
To cheer me up..
..Ruksana's husband Sahil took the three of us out to dinner.
Sahil is a sweetheart.
And Ruksana is onelucky girl.
Some college romances last a lifetime.
As the evening progressed I felt better.
At least for sometime. ln this city friends are family.
Back home, it's lonely.
And I'm scared.
But I'm going to put on a brave front.
And hopefully the rain will ease...
Should I get you a drink?
No thanks.
I haven't been able to organize your stuff... lt's okay.
-Should I help?
-l'll manage.
-How far have you gone with her?
-lt's none of your business Naina.
Stop it Naina...what are you doing?
So... when did you first sleep with her?
Rishabh...
Naina...
Yeah baby...
Oh yeah...
Stop!
I'm leaving!
She'll help out for the birthday party. lt's too much work!
Oh, you remember...
but there's no party.
You'll be 30, right?
Don't cook me any dinner!
Rats can't be serious about firing me. lt's probably illegal.
He's pretty serious.
Check your contract.
And in case you've forgotten, there is a recession... and we are planning to downsize.
I'm going to talk to Alfred.
Getting the New York office involved might not be the best thing to do.
After all you don't want to be labeled as a trouble maker.
I don't think I care.
Well start looking for your next job.
If you can find one, that is.
Sagging huh?
Even mine started to hang when I hit 30.
All the firmness was gone.
But now I am saving for the boob job.
I want to surprise my husband...
for our wedding anniversary!
Wow!
Yours aren't that bad.
They'll last another 2-3 years.
And then, you'll also have to get it done... to keep your husband happy.
You must be what now... 30?
Turning 30 in five days.
Tension-tension, is it?
Well not really. I'm actually quite okay about turning 30!
What's the big deal?
It's just another year gone by.
But you do need to settle down.
Very handsome guy, tall, great body... I could get you registered.
Just tell me... your type.
I was just trying to help.
Every agency is laying off people.
No one is hiring.
But you can always try at...
But I'll still only be hired as an Associate Creative Director...
To be the National Creative Director i'll have to prove myself.
It's not going to be easy here either.
After Anirban, Jamie will be sitting on that chair...
But I can't let them just fire me!
Hey, Sahil!
How're you doing?
Hi...
This is Shalini.
We work together.
This is Sahil, my friend Ruksana's husband.
Why don't you join us?
You guys carry on...
I will catch up with you later.
Okay.
Hi this is Rishabh Puri. I'm sorry I can't take your call right now.
But do leave me amessage.
I'll get back to you.
Thanks...
So that's it...
Rishabh never called me back and I just kept waiting and waiting.
Talking to me is not going to kill him right?
I don't know...
like why he's being so weird.
Focus on shopping.
No more talk of Rishabh or your job.
What the f*** is this?
You're turning 30... you need new lingerie!
Quickly now...
Wonder Bra!
I'm impressed.
Okay now... for the second part of your birthday present!
I don't know... it's really short.
Hey it's looking lovely.
Anyway the solution to a breakup is a haircut.
Yeah right.
Nails... second coat!
We've got some great vibrators and p**** pamperers..
..if you're interested...
Does it look like I'm not getting any action?
is it written on my face?
!
Just felt like you needed it..
..normally I know when someone's deprived.
Middle-aged housewives, 30 plus working ladies...
Just one look, and I can tell.
What on earth is a p**** pamperer?
What on earth is a p**** pamperer?
Wouldn't know honey...
Sahil is my p**** pamperer!
Guess it's a device for the lesser privileged..
..celibate spinsters like me.
Shut up!
That reminds me, I saw him at Prithvi.
Didn't he tell you?
Really?
Who was he with?
Some chick.
Are you okay Ruks?
What happened?
It's been on for eight months.
She was a... part of his work thing.
She was first an intern and then, she is apart of his team now... I've just been ignoring it.
You know how it is!
I keep pretending it's not happening.
You should talk to him Ruks.
Have you tried?
You know seeing the two of you together... I would never have believed it.
You guys are like the perfect couple.
Are all dreams just illusions?
is marriage really so fragile a relationship?
Then why do we covet it so much?
Sahil or Rishabh.
The story is the same.
Younger women just seem to be more desirable.
Have soul and substance, depth and commitment ceased to matter?
Maybe real women like us need real men... and that is a rare species.
96.1 Fun FM.
Hi,this is Rahul!
Good morning...
This show is especially for you youngsters, may you be forever young, make the most of your youth!
So calling out to all those who are still in their twenties...
Do you wake up alone every morning?
Are you looking for your soul mate?
It's an account we've got without pitching.
We've to launch the Celebrate Women Spa chain .
It's specifically aimed at middle-aged women.
So that means you've decided not to fire me.
It also means that you don't get the New York office involved.
If that's the case, let me choose the accounts I want to work on.
You don't have a choice Naina.
If you're willing to work on this brand... you stay.
If not, you leave.
Let's face it.
You're not really up to handling a big youth brand.
And this, is a small-budget campaign.
It's not very complicated.
Maybe it's better to be fired.
The ball's in your court.
Hey by the way nice hair-cut!
So got a new hair cut?
Didn't expect to see you here.
Where's Yamini?
Well she was busy.
So how... how's work?
I've been great...work's great!
So when are you coming to pick up the rest of your stuff?
.
No, that's not necessary... just discard it.
Just discard the stuff, he says.
Just as he has discarded me, and our relationship.
But I can't discard my feelings.
I want Rishabh back... desperately!
Everything's a burning crisis...
my love life, work, and even Ruksana's marriage.
I'm pregnant.
Have you told Sahil?
It'll help us start afresh.
And suddenly all my problems with Sahil don't seem that important anymore.
I also want to havea child.
My career is heading nowhere.
Maybe motherhood is my true calling!
Then you better do it fast honey.
Your biological clock is ticking away.
He is from Wharton business school.
Settled in Mumbai.
Seems quite good looking...
family lives in Delhi!
He likes art, literature, music...
your type baby!
Mom, get a life!
Your friends are having children Naina... and your boyfriends are flaky.
Do you want to spend the rest of your life alone?
You need to get serious about marriage.
I'll think about it when I'm ready.
Your papa and I are not getting any younger.
Who will look after you?
God forbid, if something were to happen to us...
My friends!
Not if they're busy with their babies!
This one is nice.
Naina I've already told you, I'm not interested in the stuff.
Listen I think it's best if we stay out of each other's lives.
And there is nothing to talk about Naina.
B******... doesn't even want to talk to me.
Three years... three years of my life I've invested in this relationship.
Some women make great girlfriends.
But they're just not good enough for marriage.
I am one of them.
No, please don't cry baby.
Mothers and daughters have intriguing relationships.
Arvind is a lawyer, just back from New York.
And mom has got her way... again!
-Bye.
-Bye aunty.
Arvind, honestly...
I'm not ready to get married.
I'm doing this just to give mom some peace of mind.
She's been insisting.
-Hey, I'm so glad to hear that!
-Really?
You know what?
I'm already dating somebody.
The thing is, she's African-American, so mum's not ready to accept her.
And I want to settle down with her.
So, I'm here just to please mum and aunt Rita.
So, you better tell your mum you thought I wasn't suitable and "reject" me.
She's not going to buy that.
You have to do something!
Just say "Arvind isn't good enough."
Still better "Arvind is a loose character!"
So that's how I rejected Arvind and mom's gone back to Delhi.
You and your mother are both crazy.
You should have hit on him... even if he was half decent.
Please Ruksana, where are your ethics?
Anyway, I'm still hung up on Rishabh.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Miss Ramona Faiza Shah... on the opening of her new exhibition, it's titled 'Me'.
I request Miss Shah to now please light the lamp.
Please.
Miss Shah, when did you start working on this exhibition?
Well I've been working on this exhibition for..
..about 2 1/2 years and...
Since when did Malini become such a leech to Ramona, man?
I don't know man...
this is like new!
Isn't that Jai?
Jai, who?
How many Jais do we know?
The one and only, college sweetheart!
Crazy or what?
Last I heard he was in London or something...
-Hi...
-How're you?
-Hi...
-l am well.
-Hi.-Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, my exhibition's on next hall.
Your work has become even better.
I'll believe it, if you buy one Ruksana!
Gift me one!
-Take...take your pick.
-All!
This is stunning... it's beautiful.
So you're back in our city for good?
If your city wants me.
I have a few exhibitions here, so let's see how it goes.
And I think I'm done with London.
They're so perfect together, aren't they?
.
-You say that about every man Naina has been with...
-Shut up.
So that's it!
My career is in the doldrums... and Rishabh has left me to have an arranged marriage...
That pretty much sums up my life.
I still haven't quite "made it."
So that's your idea of making it?
Marrying a rich, smart, eligible guy and... creating waves in the ad world...
Pretty clear cut and simple I'd say.
Pretty conventional and boring I'd say.
So you think I'm unconventional and interesting?
You'll have to let me find out.
And why would I do that?
Because, you could do with some...
More beer!
Cheers!
So you think it's okay that I haven't made it?
Well I think it's great that you haven't made it!
And what about you?
Have you made it?
The avant garde photographer, the restless traveller.
Have you found what you're looking for?
Well I've always said it's about the journey...
So are you traveling with someone?
As a matter of fact, yes I am... with my beer!
Cheers to that!
Bottoms Up!
Good morning...
Tea is ready.
Naina... wake up!
Whatever your reasons are for marrying Yamini... frankly I don't care. I still love you and I want you back.
Call off your engagement.
I've made a decision.
And I'm sticking by it.
We're through.
Don't make this harder than it is.
You know... it's tough for me as well.
I'm living with the guilt of, having let you down... but what else could I do?
Please be strong and mature and understand.
We never really had a future.
We do... you just don't want to give it a chance.
Hi, listen tomorrow's the 28th, remember?
So you have to tell us whether you're doing..
..the spa campaign or quitting.
I will let you know.
Everyone grows up with fairy tales.
Imagining magic wands and happy endings.
I'm turning 30.
Alone and out of work.
This is never how it was meant to be.
I guess it's time to stop believing in fairy tales.
My 30th birthday is going to be the worst ever!
Surprise!
Happy Birthday to you...
Happy Birthday to you...
Happy Birthday dear Naina...
Happy birthday...
Happy birthday to you...
Thank you!
Happy birthday to you...!
Thank you!
Thank you so much...
thank you... thanks...
Keep the food on the kitchen counter... I mean, we were just into each other.
- Who?
- Now I don't remember his name.
is he hot?
One sec...
-Hi!
-Hi.
What a surprise!
Happy Birthday!
Come on in.
-This is for you.
-Thanks.
Come on in.
-Hello hello.
-Hi...
-Thanks for inviting me.
-You're welcome.
Hello... hello...
-How're you?
-What is he doing here?
I'm well...
I'm well.
Ah...where's ...
where's your husband... I'm dying to see him...
Oh...
I'll just be back.
-How are you man?
-Super!
How are you...
To the hottest 30 year old I know.
Cheers!
No no, not yet!
Half an hour to go!
I'm still in my twenties... sorry!
Alright guys, here's to Naina.
Love, happiness, freedom... and loads of sex.
I'll need that...
I'll need that.
-How long have you been living here?
-Two years.
Two years!
You've done up the place really well... quite quaint.
Thank you, old is charming...
don't you think?
Isn't that a photo I have taken?
-lt is.
-Guys it's 12 o'clock.
Come here.
-Okay!
-Make a wish, make a wish!
Happy Birthday to you...
-Such a small piece?
-No no small, not big.
Picture... picture!
Happy birthday!
Thanks for being here.
Excuse me!
Getting very cosy?
.
It's the magic of the baby.
He's called off his affair.
Wow!
There's something different about you.
My red dress?
I don't know, I can't put my finger on it...
Stop fooling around.
I'm serious now.
Good one... good one...
Truth!
The Lion King!
Tell us how did you feel when Ruksana kissed Zahid?
Yes, tell us.
Very jealous man.
I almost killed you Zahid.
On a more serious note, I'd like to say that... I haven't been the best husband.
Far from it, but...
Ruksana, I... I love you to death.
And while we are at it... we have a small announcement to make... we are on our way to becoming parents!
-Good one...
-Congratulations!
Truth, it shall be.
What's the big secret that you're dying to tell...
-but haven't revealed till now.
-There's none.
Oh man... c'mon!
This is serious confession time...
it's my birthday.
Open up... you owe me!
Okay Ramona, you're gonna hold my hand for this one.
I'm bisexual.
Actually... I'm lesbian.
I'm not joking Sahil.
I'm seeing Ramona.
I was planning on telling you guys... and I thought this was the... you know... the right time.
There goes,that wasn't so hard.
Right?
!
Oh c'mon Malini...
here's to new beginnings!
-Yeah man!
-Bottoms up!
-Cheers!
-Cheers.
So what's it gonna be...
truth or dare?
Dare!
Pole Dancing with your clothes off...
He just did that.
I think I'll change it to truth.
Okay, in that case... tell us your true feelings for Naina.
You guys are mad!
Jai... choose a dare...
No, no, no...
it's too late for that now.
Come on...
C'mon...
c'mon... tell all.
Well...
Don't be shy Jai.
well let's just say that... I can still sink into her dimples!
Guys, guys!
Game over, game over!
Let's go to the dance floor.
Game over, game over!
What about your turn?
Hang on... hang on... you have to do one truth and one dare.
That is unfair!
Hello... hello... lt's my birthday.
I should be exempt.
Okay, truth first or dare...
Truth.
Okay who is better in bed
- Rishabh orJai?
And if there were others, who's been the best?
I'm not answering this question!
No no. I want to know this one.
Oh c'mon Jai is a man he'll take it.
Of all the guys I've been with, including Rishabh...
Jai's been the best in bed.
To our champion humper!
Thank you...thank you!
-Happy birthday to you...
-Blow the candles!
happy birthday to you.
These two!
-Guys stop it.
-How long... c'mon just smile and get over with it.
Cheese!
-Our beer drinking competition.
-Oh my God... I can't believe this...
How could you do this to me?
How could I do this to you?
Excuse me!
I mean look at us.
Oh god!
I had no idea Ranvir had this footage!
I meant what I said earlier.
What?
.
About sinking into your dimples.
How much have you had to drink, Jai?
Naina I know I walked out of your life.
But I also know that I was immature.
I didn't know where l was headed, didn't know what to do with you.
Financially insecure.
I mean for a guy at 26 spending the rest of your life with one woman can be scary.
I was afraid of commitment.
You're very high... very high Jai.
Will you just listen to me.
It was four years ago... so much has happened since then.
It doesn't really matter.
It matters to me.
I realized what an idiot I had been.
But you were already with Rishabh by then.
And I thought I had no right.
And now you do?
Well I thought I lost my chance... but life throws you a second chance when you least expect it.
That doesn't answer my question.
Well Naina I never stopped loving you.
And when I saw you yesterday...
-it just took me back to...
-Jai.
Will you marry me?
M'am the door is locked inside.
Lalita, come back later...
No problem...
Give 'em...
What's with all this hot lingerie?
What to do?
One has to do all this to trick men into bed now...
Check out my wonder bra!
What are the advantages of this one, mademoiselle?
So I'm assuming it's a yes.
I'm still waiting for you to say yes.
Just because I slept with you, doesn't mean I want to marry you.
That used to be my line.
I'm not trying to get back at you or anything.
But it's just that all of this is so sudden... you know.
And Rishabh... and... maybe I'm just on the rebound.
And I don't want to lead you on...
Well I'm ready to take my chances.
I don't know Jai... I don't think I can deal with more than one day at a time.
Juice?
Sure.
Sometimes, we wake up Knowing just what it is that we have to do.
And a decision is made.
I've decided I'll do it.
Smart girl!
No tattling to the New York office then...
When would I have to meet the client?
Do your homework first... lt's a small brand, let's keep it conventional.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday dear Naina...
-Happy birthday to you...
-Thank you!
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday Naina!
-Thanks.
Naina darling... I'm so glad you're not leaving... otherwise life here would be so dull, right Rats?
Have some cake Janampreet... cake!
Well I was hoping for that whole bakery but,this will do!
So,what're you doing tonight?
It's okay.
-Lets go?
-ln a short while...
We will leave... in ten minutes... promise!
You look like you're having a great time... but I'm bored.
No...we'll go home after this to your place.
-My place?
-Or mine!
Listen, you're having a horrible time.
Let's take you home.
No... we are going to go in two minutes...two minutes...
-Two minutes.-Two minutes.
Rishabh!
-Hi.-Hi.
Happy birthday.
Thank you. I'm sure you know Jai.
Rishabh
- Jai...
Jai
- Rishabh...
Rishabh
- Jai.
Congratulations!
-Thank you.
So where's the young, gorgeous bride to be?
Yamini!
Yes?
-Hi!
-Hi.
-Yamini that's Naina and Jai.
-Hello.
-Congratulations.
-Oh thank you so much... I'm really happy... I'm really happy for you.
Oh!
Let's see this...
no that's the hand...
But I must say that Rishabh is quite a pain in the ass...
literally!
Sorry, lets go get another drink...
Come on.
Why did you do that?
I don't know.
Drop me home.
I'm sorry... and thank you for being there today.
I'll see you tomorrow... I just need some time alone...
Good night.
Why do we always want the men who don't want us?
And never want the men who want us?
How can I still want Rishabh?
Why am I still trying?
And what on earth was I thinking taking Jai for Rishabh's engagement?
.
Maybe I just believe in miracles.
And I think I can turn back the clock and rewrite the ending.
I don't know what I'm doing.
And I can hardly tell the difference between right and wrong.
Targetted at middle aged women... the aim of the Celebrate Women spa chain... is to revitalize and rejuvenate women... I think we've got the picture here.
So any ideas?
Not yet.
Okay... so Naina will present the campaign idea at the next meeting.
Okay.
Great!
I have a theory that the best ads come from personal experience.
Some of the good ones I have done, have really...
And somehow this has come over, as true and valid and persuasive.
But real life is confusing and nothing is black or white.
Ex-boyfriends are irresistible.
Rishabh is engaged to somebody else.
I'm 30.
And a one night stand on the rebound seems to be turning into many more.
Basically the idea is to shoot them going about their daily lives...
We want a peep into what their normal everyday life is like.
As for the questions and interviews... just get them to open up with you and be honest.
There is no hard and fast rule about the guidelines.
Just use your own judgement and ask the questions that you feel are right... and most importantly remember... that we are looking only at the SEC A... ideally the SEC A - 30 plus women...
So come on out there...
go and have fun!
Hi... sorry I'm late.
I've had like the craziest day in office, today.
This spa campaign presentation is driving me up the wall.
And to top it all I just started chumming.
Poor baby.
Thanks for coming.
The things women go through to produce babies!
Wait till you have yours.
It's all worth it.
Where's Sahil?
Not coming, busy with work.
Don't worry. I'll manage.
I'm tired of trying... if I'm not pregnant this time, then I'm not going to take anymore bloody injections.
At the rate at which my life is going I'll also have to go in for ivf...
Any progress with Jai?
I'm okay with just letting things be the way they are but...
But?
I can't believe Jai actually wants to marry me. I feel he's not serious... he'll run out on me, again.
Of course he's serious.
You're the one who's not making up her mind.
I can't marry him just because I'm 30 and it's time to get married.
And I'm scared of test-tube babies...
You're not still holding a candle for Rishabh, are you?
Ruksana...?
The ifs and buts of life.
Are all men essentially mama's boys?
How well do we really know the men in our lives?
So how many women have you been with since we broke up?
Hardly any...
What's hardly any?
Three... if you insist.
One had some potential, but the other two were just timepass...
Basically things didn't work out with any of them... so you turned up at my doorstep now that your parents also want you to settle down.
Not like your parents don'twant you to settle down.
I found two more grey strands today...
Listen, I hope this evening isn't too tiring for you...
Chill. I am just two months pregnant.
I'm fine.
Where's Malini, are we picking her up?
She's coming by herself.
And Ramona?
She's not coming... I just don't get this Malini and Ramona thing... I don't know what to think.
I'm just amazd she didn't tell us all this while.
And like fools we're trying to set her up with one guy after another.
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
No... actually you do!
No, just kidding!
Hello everybody!
Hi!
Well tonight is dedicated to Reenu..
..my dearest sister and the bride to be.
Reenu, I am going to miss you once you get married!
But girl... live it up while you can!
And for all the girls in the house... have a great time!
I'm drinking on your behalf!
Mal... are you sure about this?
I am.
Maybe it's just a passing phase... lt's not.
Maybe Ramona is like influencing you.
It's not like you've had any experience in the past...
Or have you?
Of course not!
Otherwise I would have known before...
What the...!
Besides I'm not the one living a sham, Ruksana.
What?
.
-What is that supposed to mean?
-Ok guys chill... enjoy the show!
Cheers!
We should have a club for women over 50... to celebrate womanhood.
Yes.
Or a club for old girls who need new lays...
We're young at heart, you see!
Grey hair, wrinkles, sagging breasts... they are all signs of a life well lived.
We're maturing like wine...
Now better marry this second boy.
I am happy that Jai has proposed to me mom. I do like him... I don't know about spending the rest of my life with him.
It's not that simple... I know I should forget Rishabh.
I've reached office.
Bye.
I am still single, and a 30 year old single girl is a big deal for my family.
Everyone wanted me to get married.
But nothing worked out.
I felt terrible for 2-3 years after I turned 30.
But life goes on and you have to accept yourself.
My husband also lost interest in me... after I turned 35.
Now I am trying to focus on my career.
I am multi tasking all the time.
I need at least 48 working hours in a day.
And I've lost my sex drive.
I wanted to learn music, but where's the time?
I am divorced and now in a new relationship.
I have never been happier.
I just think women need to let their hair down and start having fun.
We should have a club for all women over 50... to celebrate womanhood.
Oh my god!
I haven't done this in ages.
The last bike I rode was yours in college.
-Really?
-Oh my god!
Okay try not killing us.
C'mon.
Actually you're not doing badly at all.
Thank you... hold me!
Vietnam was just fantastic.
Here... check this candid one out...
Nice!
Have you totally stopped doing colour?
I don't know...
I am enjoying black and white.
Maybe it's just a phase...
This series will make you a fortune...
You're mad!
Come on, you don'thave to be modest.
Remember 4-5 years ago I couldn't sell a single picture!
Yeah I know.
And you didn't want to do commercial photography.
Thank God I went off to London, at least my work got appreciated there.
It was nice to have you out of my hair though.
Naina, I'm not struggling anymore... I know.
What I mean is, I can afford the wedding ceremony and... the wedding band.
Are you advertising in the matrimonials?
"No family business, no ancestral wealth... just earning well so can afford good life."
Okay how about...
"Errant photographer son of Civil Services' family... seeking homely match..." Ask your parents to place that.
I think it's a great idea.
What say Ranjeet?
Okay Naina.
Go ahead and make the presentation.
The Post- 30 Club will position the Celebrate Women's Spa chain... as the SEC A 30 plus woman's best friend...
A place where she can connect with other women...
A place which is beyond massages and aromatherapy.
A place where while sipping juice and getting acupressure... she can also have an art class, or get investment advice.
We're not just talking copy idea here.
We're talking about great brand equity!
I think we have a seed of an idea here...
It might just work!
Thank you Mr. Desai.
That's fine.
My only concern is the budget, you know...
Let me get back to you with a more detailed presentation.
Copy, hoardings, TVC samples... the exact campaign plan, a tentative media plan with costing.
And you take a decision after that.
Sounds good.
And another thing...
don't worry about the cost.
We came with a small budget but now, we are going to do this in a big way.
So we're looking at the inaugural budget of 100 crores... and an annual budget of 35.
Wow!
-That's great... lt's just that... I wish we had known about this earlier, you know.
Jamiel didn't know. I really didn't know. I swear to God.
I didn't know it was such a big campaign.
-You didn't know?
-Yeah.
And I had my constraints.
You know the New York office would have raised hell... had I fired her for the U'va campaign.
You know that...
Boo f****** hoo.
That's when I realized a side campaign would be the best solution.
-l need this brand. -l know!
Listen, put her on something else... I can't.
- This is your love?
Oh pumpkin please understand.
- This is how you show me.
Yeah!
I sent you to Cannes...
didn't I?
So what?
-Oh c'mon!
-What the hell!
It is tempting to give up.
But I must believe in myself...
And I must believe in my product...
To my darling... who will one day make Ogilvy very proud!
Love Rishabh.
Some gifts are invaluable and timeless...
Ogilvy has never failed me.
Miss you Rishabh.
What were you doing?
Nothing really...
What happened?
Nothing.
Tell me...
How do you feel about me?
Naina you can't keep evading this issue.
I mean it's not like we are just sleeping together.
I can understand you not wanting to get married.
But I think, I deserve to know how you feel about me.
I really care about you Jai... I really do...
But it's hard because I have all this stuff in my head..
..that I need to sort out... I just need some time.
You're leading a double life...
You're not being fair to Jai.
I'm not committed to Jai.
Anyway, I'm not cheating on him...
Maybe not physically...
but you are emotionally.
I am messed up. I am on the rebound.
And Jai knows that.
I told him right at the beginning...
And he walked into this with his eyes wide open.
But you can't expect him to hang around... while you wait for Rishabh to miraculously get back with you.
He's engaged to Yamini.
He's not getting back with you.
You just need to move on...
Do you think it's so easy to move on?
Am I supposed to just, switch on and off?
.
is it so technical?
If not Rishabh...
then just replace the guy?
In my head I was married to Rishabh...
Do you know how that feels?
No...
But it's over...
You just have to let go...
Let go...?
Why should I let go of what's mine?
At work I'm expected to let go.
Put in all the hard work and the effort... and when it's time for awards and promotions... I'm supposed to let go?
I've put in years of my time and effort into this relationship.
and when the time comes to actually get married... the guy leaves me... and I'm supposed to let go?
I'm 30... not 22.
The time to let go is over.
Forget it... you guys are not going to understand.
Nobody does.
I was sleeping with Jai, but I was still in love with Rishabh.
So what?
But then...
Jai was getting hurt in the process.
And I couldn't help it.
I realized I had reached a point in my life, where nobody in the world understood me... not my friends, not my mother, not Jai, not Rishabh.
But then who has ever really understood..
..a woman's wounded and broken heart?
And who has ever known, how long it will take to heal?
I was truly alone.
And it didn't matter anymore.
Lights... roll camera... action!
Hi, I am Rajni Sharma, I'm 38. I am a housewife...
So this is little Naina working hard to crack the big fish!
Shouldn't I?
I wouldn't if I were you...
You'd just get somebody else to do it and take the credit.
Touchy!
I don't know about touchy.
The "touch" is definitely your forte.
And he never recovered from that insult...
Listen, this is an auspicious time to get married.
You need to decide now.
Or it'll be another four years.
Anyway, the girl is unlucky.
You came from Delhi to Mumbai... just to convinceme to marryJai... lt's been over a month... since he asked you.
And you still haven't given him an answer!
You can't be so busy with your new campaign... that you don't have time to make such..
..an important decision in your life.
I am busy.
This is Malini's dream come true.
Wow!
Our Mal's a star!
I just don't want her to drift away from us.
Yeah she is really caught up with that Ramona.
Or maybe we're creating the distance...
I don't know...
Don't worry...we'll be fine, we've been together since college!
-Look who's on Page 3?
-Who?
She's just... she's just too thin .
Too thin... who is this thin?
Okay no more lusting after that jerk.
That's great ma'am... spotlight's on you, good show!
Congratulations!
I'll get you something to eat..
-Yeah sure!
-l'll just come.
Mumbai Times, today?
-She saw it.-Saw what?
A photo of Rishabh and Yamini at some party.
Sheetal is just a friend...
It's no big deal.
I'm seeing you.
It's a big deal.
Why can't you tell me the truth...?
I don't think you can handle the truth.
You know I think your friends just want us...
This is not about my friends...
They think that somehow I've turned you into a lesbian...
Shut up...
Ramona...
They think that if you break up with me, you'll become straight...
-Just shut up and leave!
-Come on.
Just shut up and leave, Ramona!
No... no... no
Women!
From different walks of life.
Different aspirations, different concerns, different dreams.
One common factor,they are all over 30 and ready to rediscover life.
Welcome to the Post-30 Club.
Celebrate womanhood!
The Celebrate woman is special.
She laughs, she cries and she is ready to dream again.
She hasn't lost the spark in her eyes.
She is ready to start afresh.
Ready to take her chances.
Let's find her.
Let's reach out to her.
Let's connect with her.
Dream your dream..
its never too late.
It's wonderful to be a little older... a little wiser... a little more fun and definitely more beautiful.
There's still time, live out your dreams.
Join the Post 30 Club.
Celebrate Womanhood.
I'll be happy to answer any questions!
This is brilliant!
-Thank you.-But... the other idea... recommended by your agency head, that's more viable.
I think a better way of communicating..
..our entry into the spa market.
I guess there was no need for me to makethis presentation.
The decision was already made.
Rats obviously got Jamie to present an alternative to Celebrate.
This time to the CEO, who he had already wined and dined... and I'm sure Shalini would have known.
I am tired of your manipulative games...
Sit down.
You're actually saying something!
You spineless b******!
All you can do is lick their combined a****, while trying to keep your position secure.
We'll accept your resignation, okay!
You mean you'll welcome it.
Whatever you think.
Jamie is just using you to get ahead while you've lost your marbles... trying to appease your love interest.
Can't you see that?
Listen, lets get on with the formalities... because we can do without your ranting and raving.
F*** you all.
You're just missing a tool honey!
Yeah that's the one!
Being impulsive is underrated.
I think the best decisions are often the ones..
..we take on the spur of the moment.
But then sometimes the biggest mistakes of ..
..our lives are made on impulse.
Have I just made the biggest mistake of my life?
Thrown away my chances at success?
Impulse.
is that why I'm with Jai...?
is that why Rishabh is marrying Yamini?
Aunty, don't you think what you did to me is unfair?
Unfair...?
C'mon aunty, stop pretending.
Till two months ago, Rishabh was going to marry me.
Then suddenly he dumps me to marry Yamini.
The decision was Rishabh's.
We don't interfere in his life.
Of course you did.
He was so upset because of your business problems.
Marrying Yamini will fix everything, right?
Her millions will revitalize your company.
I think you should mind your own business.
It is my business!
If Rishabh wanted to marry you... he would have.
And... you know he's engaged already.
I don't care. I know he loved me and wanted to marry me.
He was under pressure to please you.
If he was under pressure, wouldn't he have joined the business?
At the rate at which he's going, I'm sure he will.
Naina...what are you doing here?
Trying to sort out my life.
She says we pressurizd you into marrying Yamini.
What is wrong with you, Naina?
We've been over this a million times.
Then one last time won't hurt!
Then lets you and I talk...
Don't drag mom and dad into this.
Aren't they responsible?
Responsible for what?
For what?
For getting you to marry that filthy rich bimbette... only for her money.
Take it easy Naina.
She's beautiful and young, that's a bonus for you.
Have you killed your conscience?
Naina stop it. I am warning you.
Your greed masquerading as obligation makes me sick Rishabh.
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
The truth f****** hurts.
That's your problem.
You... all of you are f****** hypocrites, with not an ounce of integrity.
Naina stop it.
You know what..
-Get the hell out ofhere.
God will punish you!
It'll all come back to you... you have no idea.
You will rot in...
You will rot in f****** hell.
F*** you all.
You'll be miserable for the rest of your lives.
Mark my words!
Your idea was rejected.
You felt desperate, you quit your job.
That's no excuse.
Life is full of ups and downs.
You need to grow up and deal with them.
What's the matter with you?
You still want him back... I don't know... lt's high time you know Naina.
I can't be your rebound sex toy forever.
Even I want the real thing!
I know you keep trying to get in touch with him... I don't say anything because you said you wanted more time.
I'm trying my best, Naina, but you're...
Jai... you've also suddenly appeared in my life, wanting to start off from exactly where you left off four years ago.
It's not so simple.
I was on the verge of marrying Rishabh.
We were...we were together in a way that I have never been with you.
I got used to the idea of having him around.
Of... of him being there for me.
Naina I don't want to know how good it was with him.
You need to start living in the present,.
and stop running away from what is real in your life
Jai you walked out on me when it suited you... and walked right back in when it suited you.
It can't always be about your convenience, Jai!
And it's very easy for you to accuse me of being commitment phobic, what was the strength of your commitment four years ago..
..when I wanted to settle down?
You just ran away... disappeared!
I said I made a mistake.
But I'm here now.
And I want you now.
Naina I am ready to start afresh.
But you're obviously not.
I just needed closure. I needed to confront them one last time.
You don't need to confront them.
You need to confront yourself.
And figure out what you want... I can't do this anymore.
Call me... when you sort your life out.
Ah... so listen, Shalini will be taking over... so you can, you know, hand over to her.
Okay?
I had to think about my career Naina... lt's all over.
The dream is shattered.
Of love and ambition...
nothing remains.
Naina!
Open the door, Naina!
Naina...
You've got everyone so worried.
Not taking anyone's calls.
Cutting yourself off like that!
Ruksana was going to cancel her doctor's appointment..
..to come see you.
Pull yourself together.
Look at me...
I'm not dying, am I?
Put your slipper down!
Go wash your face.
And please make me a cup of tea.
You can have some too!
Okay.
-Naina?
-Yeah.
I'm going to check my mail okay.
Just minimize the files that are on.
Okay.
Hi mom.
Sorry, I was just going to call you.
I've been very busy.
No I'm not being irresponsible mom.
I told you the other day, my decision is final.
I've already quit.
Anyway, Shalini has replaced me.
-Do you want honey?
-No.
No...
Jai has not tried to contact me.
I love you too... bye mom.
Hello, what are you doing?
I thought you were checking your mail.
When have you been writing this?
Stop it Malini. lt's just some personal crap.
Please don't read it...
Just let me read it...
you go take a shower.
-Malini!
-Go take a shower.
Malini stop it.
You're getting on my nerves now.
Okay now enough!
Stop prying.
I'm not prying...
I'm just reading.
S*** man!
This is amazing.
I can't believe you've written this... seriously!
Right, I had a look at the material.
It seems we've got a book here!
-l knew that...
-l don't know...
-Naina.
-l've just been writing to unwind.
Just relax.
What we have here is fabulous!
See it does need a little bit of work... tweak the shape... alter the structure a bit context and yet what we have is great.
Here's what I propose, okay!
Let me speak to my London office, and get their approval.
It won't be a problem.
In fact they'll love it.
Then we commission you to write it.
I'm not sure...
I've...
- Listen...
- Come on, Naina.
If you don't want to write it... we can always buy the raw material from you and commission somebody else to do the job.
But you know what, ideally that's not the best option.
Listen you've quit your job.
Just give this a shot!
You might actually enjoy it Naina.
Let me think about it...
People die to get their book published.
Like this one?
It's the chance of a lifetime.
And you have to get your mind off Rishabh and that Jai.
Chapter one. lt's monsoon in Mumbai.
The rain is splashing across the roads.
A young woman in a bright red car, drives through the grey landscape.
You are using my Post-30 club idea, after all...
Well listen the Celebrate guys liked your idea, better.
And since the detailing had been done... you know.
But it's completely unethical.
Well I'm really sorry...
No, you're not.
Don't worry we'll be able to sort this out.
But what I am going to need from you..
..is as much documentation as possible.
I will give you everything I've got.
Good.
Now, I'll sit with my team and we'll figure out... the best way forward in this case.
Copyright law enforcement in India, is at a very early stage.
So harassment and malpractice is probably..
..the only way we can nail them.
-Ok?
-Yeah.
You've just started writing your book.
There's no need to go on this crusade.
You've quit.
Now let it go...
Listen, writing is your priority... but it's important for you to get your due, I think.
I'm so angry.
How can I not speak up?
I know I'm taking on a major battle, but...there's no other option.
Lets settle this. 20 lakhs and you withdraw the case.
I'm not interested in settling.
Not enough?
We cannot get a stay order for this event.
I'm not giving up.
Do you want to file an appeal?
The Celebrate Spa Chain welcomes you to the launch of The Post 30 Club.
So let's get together and celebrate this occasion.
Yes I'm having so much fun, feeling very young and fresh too.
Here, I feel, somebody truly understand us.
It's very relaxing.
It's a lot of fun. lt's wonderful.
We're getting investment advice.
We're trying out herbal teas, we're getting massages done we're having a great time.
The Post 30 Club is a great campaign for Celebrate.
I am very grateful to the ADZ team.
The Post 30 Club...
I think it's a fabulous idea.
You know, we at ADZ, have really worked hard at it.
And the credit goes to Jamie Gill.
He's the Creative Head.
Have you taken a byte ofhis?
Yes, yes!
The Post 30 Club was definitely my brain child.
I did alot of research and it took a lot of thought to come up with the Celebrate Spa campaign.
Of course with the launch of The Post 30 Club...
Sometimes, even though we don't want the same things anymore... yesterday's broken dreams still haunt us.
Can I... meet Naina?
Wait a minute.
She's busy, she won't be able to see you.
Sorry.
This is Saloni...
-Hi!
-Nice to meet you.
I am Naina.
-l'll just go and see the baby.
-Sure!
-See you.
-Excuse me.
She seems really nice...
She is...
I'm happy.
I am happy for you.
Hi...
She is like a doll.
Her nose is just like yours.
Same nose!
So, mommy Ruksana...
how does it feel?
It's the best feeling in the world!
Both of you should feel this.
Hopefully... someday, without test tubes!
So how are things with Sahil?
He's back to his philandering ways.
but I don't care anymore.
I've got baby Noor now!
Maybe that's how you feel right now.
As long as you're happy Ruks.
The happiest I've ever been...
divorce just seems pointless now.
And Noor will need her daddy...
yes you will... yes you will.
No... what're you doing!
-Ok I'll also give...
-No Naina stop... ln the case of Naina Singh vs. ADZ... the bench has found ADZ guilty... on charges of corporate malpractice and harassment at the work place.
We're going to fight this!
No one messes with us, no one!
You, listen to me.
Now in this one...
Alfred!
You don't worry okay.
I'll figure something out.
And you know what!
We will file an appeal.
Rathi, it's all over.
What?
.
You will not fight any more cases.
Why?
- You're fired.
And so are Jamie and Ranjeet.
-You mean...
-Exactly what I said.
And I'll make sure that no other agency hires you.
Naina, I'm entering you as the creative director for the Spa campaign for the awards at Cannes.
Also we'd like to take you on as the national creative director of ADZ.
Thanks Alfred.
But I think I'll pass.
Hello... hi!
Friends on behalf of Pentad publishers..
..let me welcome Ms. Naina Singh... the debutant author of Turning 30!
Go Naina!
This book is officially being launched right here, right now!
It also happens to be Naina's birthday today.
Happy Birthday!
First of all, I'd like to thank my friend Malini, who made it her mission to make me write this book.
David, for his unstinting support and encouragement.
My friend Ruksana, for all her love that saw me through the writing of this book.
And of course my parents, especially my mother.
It's a wonderful way of celebrating my birthday... I've turned 31 today... and with the launch of my book, I think I've finally come to terms... with turning 30!
Mirrors lie and ask difficult questions.
Am I beautiful still?
Will he still love me when I have wrinkles?
Am I only what I do or who I love?
Have I missed the bus?
Why is turning 30 so hard?
Myth - 30 year old women find 40 year old men attractive.
Fact- 30 year old women find 22 year old boys more attractive.
It's called the "he's been with another woman radar".
Except it's not always reliable... because we see only what we choose to see.
Broken hearts can be mended.
All it takes is few nights of drunken revelry... and many nights of tear stained pillows.
The real solution to a broken heart is of course another man... well other men!
or better still - a hair cut.
A red dress and stilettos and..
..you feel like all your dreams can come true.
Then you wake up the next morning and realize, it's just another regular day... and you put your life on hold, until the next time you take out that red dress from your closet.
Thirty or not,we are all looking for happiness, but perhaps in the wrong places.
-Such a wannabe signature.
-Teach me a better one.
I don't know what to say...
You don'thave to say anything Rishabh...
-l didn't want it to turn out this way. -lt's okay.
I am sorry Naina.
I just...wish I hadn't been such a b******.
The past is over Rishabh.
I am not marrying Yamini.
It was all for the wrong reasons Naina...
What you and I had was real.
It's time for new beginnings.
So you'll give me another chance?
Find yourself first Rishabh...
and you'll find love.
Read my book, it has all the answers.
Jai!
I've sorted out my life now.
I've done what I had to do.
Will you marry me?
After rain comes sunshine.Just as winter always turns to spring.
But the spring blossom depends on how well..
..we are able to use the winter.
I guess I had learnt to brave the winter.
And it was finally time to greet spring!
Mumbai.
Electric energy.And the charm offrenzy.
Monsoon sweptstreets.
Neon lights.
And impossibledreams.
Hearts carelessly crushed under stilettos.
Career escalators moving at break-neck speed.
Mumbai!
Buzzing by day.
Pulsating bynight.
Where every young woman can livethe quintessential free independentlife.
Thecity I adopted.
And the city that adopted me.
Thecity where l struggled to find my feet.
Thecity where l discovered who I was... and began to dream about where l wanted my life to go.
Brick bybrick I built mylife here.
And now with two weeks to go for my 30th birthday I finally feel likel'vearrived.
Nainal'm cooking for you tonight.
Not again, Rishabh!
Every girl fancies aboyfriend, who could cook her ameal... but you on the otherhand... I am happy to order in!
I'm a low maintenancegirl.
That we'll know post marriage.
Lets figureout what babies eat.
Aren'twejumping thegun, Mr. Puri?
Can't wait...
So ifyou ask me... don't let Jamieget thebetter of you.
Your campaign's going to rock!
Stop trusting people so easily.
Just see people for what theytruly are.
Pass metheoliveoil please.
That's thewrong recipe.
You can't heat olive oil.
Trust me... when it comes to cooking food, and managing money.
The onlytwo things you can do right.
Really, andwriting poetry?
Correction.
Writing bad poetry.
And singingterribly.
Obviously, you'renot going to marry a boring banker boynow, are you?
It's also becausel'm also a chef, apoet and a singer that works in my favour.
It does... doesn'tit?
Hey, Cheers Naina!
Hey Rachna!
Hey!
Comehere...
let me pour you aglass.
What's theexcitement all about?
Aha... the Bru campaign!
We'vewon the silver lion at Cannes for it.
Wow!
Jamie is goingto France ...
to accept the award.
-Heywhere's your glass?
-My glass?
Cheers is never enough.
Hey!
- Cheers.
-Aren't you happy?
-Of course!
Looks like they didn't enter your nameas thecopywriter.
You know thatJamieand I both worked on this campaign.
It's his baby...
And he was making no headway... till I was roped in.
And I crackedtheidea.
You know Jamie's stand on this issue!
Anyway, itwas Rathorewho sent in theentry.
So it's his call.
Weall know why Rats would do that.
Naina please...
Don't Naina me.
Now...
Naina calm down...
leave all thebitchingto old Jamie.
Fuck OffJamie!
You shouldtake the award for themost ethical copywriter.
Let's face it. I do havean edge...
Bull shit!
What you have is atool... that you give out on hire.
Well who says it doesn't help to swing both ways, honey?
Theold man Ogilvyhimself said,
"Thereare very few men of genius in advertising agencies.
But weneed all wecan find.
Almost without exception they are disagreeable.
But don't destroythem.
They lay golden eggs." Eggs of gold Naina...
Eggs ofgold ".
But Mr. Golden Goose, Ogilvy also says,
"Our business is infestedwith idiots who try and impress using pretentious jargon."
Hey Naina, saw your U'va hoarding campaign in the morning... amazing, really eye-catching stuff!
So Jamie, do you want to take credit forthat as well?
No honey, U'vais all yours.
You can have all the Golden Lions andtheircubs and brouhaha with it.
We've lost the contract, again.
Becausewehaven't upgraded ourmachinery.
Why is itso difficult to upgradethemachinery?
I mean, you're losing so much business becauseofoutdated infrastructure right?
You need a lot ofcapital... I'm telling dadto takea loan but... with the recession and returns to the investmentbeing so low its not feasible
But I'm sure there's something else that wecan do. I mean... threebig factories...
a sheer waste.
Arethings really that bad?
Worse!
And I feel so helpless, you know.
I'm busy making money forthebank.
And doing nothing for my family.
Don't beso hard on yourself.
You havea right to do what you enjoy doing.
Isn't your car due for servicing?
Yes baby...take it next week.
Are you coming upstairs?
No honey, early morning meetingtomorrow.
Okay... goodnight.
Goodnight baby.
-Bye.
-Bye!
Couldn'tresist.
Turned back halfway.
And the morning meeting?
Get up... otherwise you'll miss yourmeeting.
Rishabh... getup!
Hurryup!
Am I seeing you tonight?
No honey, I haveto meet Maya aunty's daughter, Yamini tonight.
She's just back from theStates.
Do you wantmeto come along?
No you chill...
Punjwani uncle wants his daughterto getto know everyone.
It's going to beboring as hell but I can't giveit amiss.
And you know how mom and dad areaboutthese things.
Cool... anywayl haveto plan thepeaceconcert.
-Shotthrough the heart, and you're to blame...
-Rishabh!
darling you giveloveabad name...
Aren't you getting late...

is there any chancel could perform at theconcert?
No!
You'reunbearable!
Now c'mon you'regoing to getlate!
Bye sweetyhavea niceday.
You too... bye.
Okay guys whatabout this?
Listen black is not a day colour...
you can't wearthat!
But Ruks I look really nice andthin in it...
Who cares Ruksana... as long as you look good in it,justgo with it.
-Malini...
-Yes?
She has to look stunning.
This day comes oncein alifetime.
At least tell me you'll atleast pretend to be surprised when he gives you thering?
Oh yeah... guess what?
Oh my God you'reso well prepared...
Better safethan sorry.
Okaylisten can we...
Naina?
-Listen can weplease focus on my clothes...
-These are yours?
Yes... okay what aboutthis blue dress?
It's anice wrap dress.
Okaylisten we haveto have a proper engagement celebration, okay?
Why don't we just combine it with your birthday party?
That's a very good idea.
Well actually Rishabh and I may behaving aprivatecelebration.
If you dare to get marriedwithoutus there...
Don'tworry Mal.
Shewon't beableto,we'll gatecrash!
Hey Yamini... come sit!
Something to drink?
Yeah, aglass ofwhite winewould begreat.
-Whitewineplease.
-Suresir.
So... you're all grown up.
Well consideringthelast time you saw me, I was like 14 or something...
You're quitea fuddy-duddy yourself!
Did you just call mea fuddy-duddy?
Well, you're not a style icon!
Neither am I a fashion disaster.
But you've got this boring-serious-corporate-typelook.
You've got to loosen up...
Cheers!
Cheers. I think I'm fine though.
That's afirst by the way.
Give meoneday, I'll transform how you look.
I'm notgoing to be your guinea-pig!
C'mon it'll be fun!
A completemakeover.
Why don't you spare me and just become a... you know... stylist or something.
Hey, I enjoy fashion.
Butl don't want to do it professionally.
A lot ofmy friends are designers or opening stores...
So what do you want to do?
Someserious, hardcorebusiness.
Dad's told me to figure it out, he's willing to invest oncel'vedecided.
Interesting!
You know...
I didn't want to comeback.
I wantedto chill in New York fora few years.
Why didn't you?
My parents wanted meback.
And family matters to me more than anything else.
I'd do anythingto see mom and dad happy.
That's pretty surprising...
I mean, look at me, I'm just doing my own thing, I'm least bothered about whatmy family expects from me.
So in your mind, what you wantand what your family wants, are two differentthings...
Aren't they?
Maybe not...
Your girlfriend?
Yeah...
Take the call... lt's okay. I'll call back.
You'rebeing abad boy!
Am I?
And are you agood girl?
I wouldn't bethe best judgeofthat...
What does your boyfriend feel?
lfl was dating somebody... I wouldn't behere, right?
So you're giving me lessons in moral science?
No. I am just announcingthat I'm single...
You'renotthinking ahead, Rishabh!
Business, family...
You need to starttaking responsibility.
But you will only do as you please... as always...
Hi... how was yourday... lsn't ithottoday?
Excuse me.
Somewine?
-Yes.
Chenin Blanc please.
-Okay ma'am... and sir?
Sorry, I'm late.
The meetingtook forever.
No problem. lt's totally okay.
So, your campaign is all over town.
Yes well verdict's not in yet.
But work is notso hectic and... I was just thinking... ifwe could go to your Lonavla cottage,to celebratemy birthday... if you can takeout time that is... I mean, you don't haveto.
I just thoughtit will bea nice wayto bring in my birthday.
Wecan always havea party here... I'm getting married.
Maya aunty's daughter, Yamini. I told you about her.
You are hilarious!
And it's a damn funnyway to propose...
-l'm not...
I'm not...-l accept.
Look I'm serious. I am getting marriedto Yamini.
This is whatl came here to tell you ...
Look I...
I know this must come as areal shock to you.
Shock?
Have you gone mad?
I mean do you even know what you'resaying?
You methertwo days ago... I know Naina. I'm sorry... but...
And what aboutus?
You...
You'll be fine.
You're...
You're wonderful and lovely and smart.
You'll bewith aguywho deserves it.
Cut outthecrappy speech Rishabh.
It's not a speech okay, it's true...
Thetruth is thatwewere supposedto get married... thetruth is, welove each other, thetruth is that you were going to ask meto marry you today...
Look I'm not denying any ofthat...
but things have changed.
So how long have you been seeing her?
I've not been seeing her Naina.
Yeah... right!
Look...
I know this is the worstthing I can do to you.
Butl don't havea choice Naina.
My... my parents want to... I thought they liked me...
They do like you Nainabut...
This isn't aboutthem anyway.
You don't fuckingOff love meenough to marry me.
You don'thave the balls to stand up for what you fucking want Rishabh... that's theproblem.
I want different things Naina.
Different?
is shebetter in bed?
Look Naina...
I'm... I'm sorry...
You know I...
I still love you and I...
I always will love you.
Stop it Rishabh...
Naina let me drop you back...
Okay... you'rein no condition to drive... I'll manage.
I don'tknow what I'm doing for my birthday... I know its high timel thoughtabout getting married... but Rishabh and I arethrough.
Mom, I just told you everything.
I know you thought heis agreat guy.
So did I.
Yeah but its over. I don'tknow...
we will sort it out.
I don't know.
No, obviously it doesn't mean you haveto look for anew guy.
No... I know mom it'll become more difficult oncel turn 30... but I'm turning 30 in a week!
Yes, I know that the astrologer said it could happen anytimenow... but he's been sayingthat for years!
Okay mom, I have to go...
I am getting late forwork.
Yes... and I'm absolutely fine.
Thereis no need for you to fiyto Bombay.
Yes!
I am absolutelyfine.
Yes...okaymom bye, love you!
What does aguy reallymean when hebreaks up with you... but says,thathe still loves you and always will?
lfhemeans what he's saying why would he break up with you in the first place?
is it just a way ofmaking you feel better about being dumped?
Or is there a faint possibilitythat hemay comeback...?
TheSales of U'va haveactually fallen.
I mean this campaign is a total disaster.
We'rethelaughing stock of theentire magazine industry.
We needto withdraw all our ads, immediately!
Andwehaveto cancel our contract with ADZ.
No!
Seeweunderstand... and wetake full responsibility forthe loss.
And I'll puta new creativeteam on U'va.
Giveus a chanceto come up with an alternative.
I'm sorry, but we'retaking this brandto another agency.
Naina, would you stay back fora minute?
You'refired!
What?
I'm fired because the campaign has bombed?
It was an important campaign.
It's an insult.
We've lost faceing the industry.
Oh and fortherecord... this is the first time in history of our agency that... we've lost such a high profilecampaign!
I still stand bythe fact that it's agreat idea.
And it can happen to thebest ofus.
Sometimes ideas work and sometimes they don't.
And you know that theidea was pre-tested and everybody approved... including you.
I agree.
But as...
the creativehead... it is your responsibility.
It is myresponsibility.
But you can't fireme forthis!
It hasn't worked, we'll try again.
There's no again, Naina.
You know, you haven't a clue ofwhatworks forthe youth.
You don't have apulseon the segment.
And yourthinking is... too out-of-the-box.
And itis exactlymy 'out-of-the-box thinking that got us the award at Cannes... forwhich ofcourse, I'm getting no credit!
You've got amonth... find yourselfa new job.
Of coursel'm fine...
I know logicallywhy he wants to marry her.
She's rich as hell, heiress to agoldmine... andthen she's young and ithelps that she's so hot.
His family gets themoney his parents arehappy and he gets himself atrophywife.
It's thewhole package that works!
God knows how long he's been planning this.
I don't think hewas seeing her beforethis but we can check if you like.
-That's notthepoint...
-What's thepoint?
Thesolution to one man is another man.
With God's grace,we'll soon find another guy for Naina.
Ruksana... there's moreto life than men!
What do you want us to do for your birthday?
I don'tknow... whatever, anything!
30 is notjust any age you know, it's special!
You'renota genius if you haven't proved it by 30.
-l think 35 is the new 30...-40, I think.
It's killing me...
I can't believe Rishabh would do this to me.
And I keep thinking of Rishabh and Yamini together.
And to top it up I'm turning 30, fucking hell!
Jobless and man-less!
Naina, I'm 30, I'm not married...
it's no big deal, seriously.
Not everyone's as crazy as you.
I would have died ifl was turning 30 and I wasn't married yet.
Thankfully Sahil and I got married at theright time.
Check.
To cheer meup..
..Ruksana's husband Sahil took thethree ofus outto dinner.
Sahil is a sweetheart.
And Ruksanais onelucky girl.
Some collegeromances lasta lifetime.
As theevening progressed I feltbetter.
At least for sometime. ln this city friends are family.
Back home, it's lonely.
And I'm scared.
Butl'm going to put on abrave front.
And hopefullytherain will ease...
Should I get you a drink?
No thanks.
I haven'tbeen ableto organize yourstuff... lt's okay.
-Should I help?
-l'll manage.
-How far have you gonewith her?
-lt's none of your business Naina.
Stop it Naina...what are you doing?
So... when did you first sleep with her?
Rishabh...
Naina...
Yeah baby...
Oh yeah...
Stop!
I'm leaving!
She'll help out forthe birthday party. lt's too much work!
Oh, you remember...
but there's no party.
You'll be30, right?
Don't cook meany dinner!
Rats can'tbeserious about firing me. lt's probablyillegal.
He's pretty serious.
Check your contract.
And in case you've forgotten, thereis a recession... and weareplanning to downsize.
I'm goingto talk to Alfred.
Gettingthe New York officeinvolved might notbethebest thing to do.
After all you don't want to belabeled as atrouble maker.
I don't think I care.
Well start looking for your next job.
If you can find one, that is.
Sagging huh?
Even minestartedto hang when I hit 30.
All the firmness was gone.
But now I am saving fortheboob job.
I want to surprisemyhusband...
for ourwedding anniversary!
Wow!
Yours aren't that bad.
They'll last another 2-3 years.
And then, you'll also haveto get it done... to keep your husband happy.
You must bewhatnow... 30?
Turning 30 in fivedays.
Tension-tension, is it?
Well not really. I'm actually quite okay aboutturning 30!
What's thebig deal?
It's just another yeargoneby.
But you do need to settle down.
Veryhandsome guy, tall, great body... I could get you registered.
Justtell me... yourtype.
I was justtrying to help.
Every agencyis laying offpeople.
No oneis hiring.
But you can always try at...
Butl'll still only behired as an AssociateCreative Director...
To be the National Creative Director i'll haveto provemyself.
It's not goingto be easyhereeither.
After Anirban, Jamiewill besitting on that chair...
But I can'tletthem just fireme!
Hey, Sahil!
How're you doing?
Hi...
This is Shalini.
Wework together.
This is Sahil, my friend Ruksana's husband.
Why don't you join us?
You guys carry on...
I will catch up with you later.
Okay.
Hi this is Rishabh Puri. I'm sorry I can'ttake your call rightnow.
But do leavemeamessage.
I'll getback to you.
Thanks...
So that's it...
Rishabh never called meback and I justkept waiting andwaiting.
Talkingto me is not going to kill him right?
I don't know...
like why he's being so weird.
Focus on shopping.
No more talk of Rishabh or your job.
What the fuck is this?
You'returning 30... you need new lingerie!
Quickly now...
Wonder Bra!
I'm impressed.
Okay now... forthesecond part of your birthday present!
I don't know... it's really short.
Heyit's looking lovely.
Anywaythe solution to abreakup is ahaircut.
Yeah right.
Nails... second coat!
We've got somegreat vibrators and pussy pamperers..
..ifyou're interested...
Does itlook like I'm not getting any action?
is it written on my face?
!
Just felt like you needed it..
..normallyl know when someone's deprived.
Middle-aged housewives, 30 plus working ladies...
Just onelook, and I can tell.
What on earth is a pussy pamperer?
What on earth is a pussy pamperer?
Wouldn'tknow honey...
Sahil is my pussy pamperer!
Guess it's a device for thelesser privileged..
..celibatespinsters likeme.
Shutup!
That reminds me, I saw him at Prithvi.
Didn't hetell you?
Really?
Who was hewith?
Somechick.
Are you okay Ruks?
What happened?
It's been on for eight months.
She was a... part ofhis work thing.
Shewas firstan intern and then, she is apart ofhis team now... I've just been ignoring it.
You know how itis!
I keep pretending it's not happening.
You should talk to him Ruks.
Have you tried?
You know seeingthetwo of you together... I would never have believed it.
You guys arelike theperfect couple.
Are all dreams justillusions?
is marriage really so fragile arelationship?
Then why do wecovetit so much?
Sahil or Rishabh.
Thestory is the same.
Younger women just seem to be more desirable.
Have soul and substance, depth and commitment ceasedto matter?
Maybereal women likeus need real men... and that is arare species.
96.1 Fun FM.
Hi,this is Rahul!
Good morning...
This show is especially for you youngsters, may you be forever young, make the most of your youth!
So calling out to all those who arestill in theirtwenties...
Do you wakeup alone every morning?
Are you looking for your soul mate?
It's an account we've gotwithout pitching.
We'veto launch the Celebrate Women Spa chain .
It's specifically aimed at middle-agedwomen.
So that means you've decided not to fire me.
It also means that you don't getthe New York officeinvolved.
Ifthat's thecase, let mechoose theaccounts I want to work on.
You don'thave a choice Naina.
If you'rewilling to work on this brand... you stay.
Ifnot, you leave.
Let's face it.
You're not really up to handling abig youth brand.
And this, is a small-budget campaign.
It's not very complicated.
Maybeit's betterto befired.
Theball's in your court.
Heybythewaynice hair-cut!
So got anew hair cut?
Didn't expect to see you here.
Where's Yamini?
Well shewas busy.
So how... how's work?
I've been great...work's great!
So when are you comingto pick up therest of your stuff?
No, that's not necessary... just discard it.
Just discard the stuff, he says.
Justas hehas discarded me, and our relationship.
But I can't discard my feelings.
I want Rishabh back... desperately!
Everything's a burning crisis...
my lovelife, work, and even Ruksana's marriage.
I'm pregnant.
Have you told Sahil?
It'll help us start afresh.
And suddenly all my problems with Sahil don'tseem that important anymore.
I also wantto havea child.
My career is heading nowhere.
Maybemotherhood is my truecalling!
Then you betterdo it fast honey.
Your biological clock is ticking away.
Heis from Wharton business school.
Settled in Mumbai.
Seems quite good looking...
familylives in Delhi!
Helikes art, literature, music...
yourtypebaby!
Mom, get alife!
Your friends are having children Naina... and your boyfriends areflaky.
Do you wantto spend the rest ofyour lifealone?
You need to get serious about marriage.
I'll think aboutit when I'm ready.
Your papa and I are not getting any younger.
Who will look afteryou?
God forbid, if something wereto happen to us...
My friends!
Notifthey'rebusy with their babies!
This one is nice.
Nainal've alreadytold you, I'm notinterested in thestuff.
Listen I think it's best ifwe stay out of each other's lives.
And there is nothing to talk about Naina.
Bastard... doesn't even want to talk to me.
Three years... three years ofmy life I've invested in this relationship.
Somewomen make great girlfriends.
Butthey're justnot good enough for marriage.
I am oneofthem.
No, please don't cry baby.
Mothers and daughters have intriguing relationships.
Arvind is alawyer, just back from New York.
And mom has got herway... again!
-Bye.
-Byeaunty.
Arvind, honestly...
I'm not readyto getmarried.
I'm doing this just to givemom somepeaceofmind.
She's been insisting.
-Hey, I'm so glad to hearthat!
-Really?
You know what?
I'm already dating somebody.
The thing is, she's African-American, so mum's not readyto accept her.
And I wantto settledown with her.
So, I'm here justto pleasemum and aunt Rita.
So, you bettertell your mum you thoughtl wasn't suitable and "reject" me.
She's notgoing to buythat.
You haveto do something!
Just say "Arvind isn't good enough."
Still better "Arvind is aloose character!"
So that's how I rejected Arvind and mom's goneback to Delhi.
You and your mother areboth crazy.
You should havehit on him... even ifhe was half decent.
Please Ruksana, whereare your ethics?
Anyway, I'm still hung up on Rishabh.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would liketo congratulate Miss Ramona Faiza Shah... on theopening ofher new exhibition, it's titled 'Me'.
I request Miss Shah to now pleaselight the lamp.
Please.
Miss Shah,when did you start working on this exhibition?
Well I'vebeen working on this exhibition for..
..about 2 1/2 years and...
Sincewhen did Malini become such aleech to Ramona, man?
I don'tknow man...
this is likenew!
Isn'tthatJai?
Jai,who?
How many'Jais' do we know?
The one and only, college sweetheart!
Crazy orwhat?
Last I heard he was in London or something...
-Hi...
-How're you?
-Hi...
-l am well.
-Hi.-Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, my exhibition's on next hall.
Yourwork has becomeeven better.
I'll believeit, if you buy one Ruksana!
Giftmeone!
-Take...take your pick.
-All!
This is stunning... it's beautiful.
So you'reback in our city for good?
If your city wants me.
I havea few exhibitions here, so let's seehow it goes.
And I think I'm donewith London.
They'reso perfect together, aren't they?
-You saythat about every man Nainahas been with...
-Shut up.
So that's it!
My career is in the doldrums... and Rishabh has leftmeto havean arranged marriage...
That pretty much sums up my life.
I still haven't quite "made it."
So that's your idea ofmaking it?
Marrying arich, smart, eligible guy and... creatingwaves in theadworld...
Pretty clear cutand simplel'd say.
Pretty conventional and boring I'd say.
So you think I'm unconventional and interesting?
You'll haveto letmefind out.
Andwhywould I do that?
Because, you could do with some...
More beer!
Cheers!
So you think it's okay that I haven'tmade it?
Well I think it's great that you haven't madeit!
Andwhat about you?
Have you madeit?
The avant gardephotographer, therestless traveller.
Have you found what you'relooking for?
Well I'vealways said it's aboutthejourney...
So are you travelingwith someone?
As amatterof fact, yes I am... with mybeer!
Cheers to that!
Bottoms Up!
Good morning...
Teais ready.
Naina... wake up!
Whatever your reasons are formarrying Yamini... frankly I don't care. I still love you and I want you back.
Call off your engagement.
I'vemade a decision.
And I'm sticking byit.
We're through.
Don'tmake this harder than itis.
You know... it's tough for meas well.
I'm livingwith the guilt of, having let you down... but what else could I do?
Please bestrong and mature and understand.
Wenever reallyhad a future.
We do... you just don't want to give ita chance.
Hi, listen tomorrow's the 28th, remember?
So you have to tell us whetheryou'redoing..

Everyone grows up with fairytales.
Imagining magic wands and happy endings.

Excuseme!
I mean look at us.
Oh god!
I had no idea Ranvir hadthis footage!
I meant whatl said earlier.
What?
About sinking into yourdimples.
How much have you had to drink, Jai?
Naina I know I walked out of your life.
But I also know that I was immature.
I didn't know where l was headed, didn't know what to do with you.
Financiallyinsecure.
I mean for a guy at 26 spendingtherest of your life with onewoman can be scary.
I was afraid of commitment.
You're veryhigh... veryhigh Jai.
Will you just listen to me.
It was four years ago... so much has happened since then.
It doesn't reallymatter.
ltmatters to me.
I realized what an idiot I had been.
But you werealready with Rishabh bythen.
And I thought I had no right.
And now you do?
Well I thought I lost my chance... but life throws you a second chance when you least expect it.
That doesn't answer my question.
Well Nainal never stopped loving you.
Andwhen I saw you yesterday...
-it just took meback to...
-Jai.
Will you marry me?
M'am the door is locked inside.
Lalita, come back later...
No problem...
Give 'em...
What's with all this hotlingerie?
What to do?
One has to do all this to trick men into bed now...
Checkout mywonder bra!
Whataretheadvantages ofthis one, mademoiselle?
So I'm assuming it's a yes.
I'm still waiting for you to say yes.
Just becausel slept with you, doesn't mean I want to marry you.
That used to bemyline.
I'm not tryingto get back at you or anything.
Butit's justthatall of this is so sudden... you know.
And Rishabh... and... maybe I'm just on the rebound.
And I don'twant to lead you on...
Well I'm ready to take my chances.
I don'tknow Jai... I don't think I can deal with more than oneday at a time.
Juice?
Sure.
Sometimes, we wakeup Knowing just what itis that wehaveto do.
And a decision is made.
I'vedecided I'll do it.
Smart girl!
No tattling to the New York officethen...
When would I have to meettheclient?
Do your homework first... lt's a small brand, lets keep it conventional.
Happy birthday!
Happybirthdayto you...
Happybirthday dear Naina...
-Happy birthday to you...
-Thank you!
-Happybirthday!
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday Naina!
-Thanks.
Naina darling... I'm so glad you'renot leaving... otherwiselife here would beso dull, right Rats?
Havesome cakeJanampreet... cake!
Well I was hoping forthat wholebakerybut,this will do!
So,what're you doingtonight?
It's okay.
-Lets go?
-ln a short while...
Wewill leave... in ten minutes... promise!
You look like you're having agreat time... but I'm bored.
No...we'll go home afterthis to your place.
-My place?
-Or mine!
Listen, you'rehaving a horribletime.
Let's take you home.
No... wearegoing to go in two minutes...two minutes...
-Two minutes.-Two minutes.
Rishabh!
-Hi.-Hi.
Happybirthday.
Thank you. I'm sure you know Jai.
Rishabh
- Jai...
Jai
- Rishabh...
Rishabh
- Jai.
Congratulations!
-Thank you.
So where's the young, gorgeous brideto be?
Yamini!
Yes?
-Hi!
-Hi.
-Yamini that's Naina and Jai.
-Hello.
-Congratulations.
-Oh thank you so much... I'm really happy... I'm reallyhappy for you.
Oh!
Let's seethis...
no that's thehand...
Butl must saythat Rishabh is quite apain in theass...
literally!
Sorry, lets go get anotherdrink...
Come on.
Why did you do that?
I don't know.
Drop me home.
I'm sorry... andthank you for beingtheretoday.
I'll see you tomorrow... I just need some timealone...
Good night.
Why do wealways want themen who don't want us?
And neverwant the men who want us?
How can I still want Rishabh?
Why am I still trying?
And what on earth was I thinking taking Jai for Rishabh's engagement?
Maybel justbelieve in miracles.
And I think I can turn back theclock and rewritethe ending.
I don't know whatl'm doing.
And I can hardlytell the differencebetween rightandwrong.
Targetted at middle agedwomen... the aim ofthe Celebrate Women spa chain... is to revitalize and rejuvenatewomen... I think we've got thepicturehere.
So anyideas?
Not yet.
Okay... so Naina will presentthe campaign idea atthenext meeting.
Okay.
Great!
I havea theorythatthebest ads come from personal experience.
Someofthegood ones I have done, havereally...
And somehow this has comeover, as true and valid and persuasive.
But real life is confusing and nothing is black orwhite.
Ex-boyfriends are irresistible.
Rishabh is engaged to somebody else.
I'm 30.
And a onenight stand on the rebound seems to beturning into manymore.
Basically the ideals to shoot them going about their dailylives...
Wewanta peep into whattheir normal everydaylifeis like.
As forthequestions and interviews... justgetthem to open up with you and behonest.
Thereis no hard and fast ruleabout the guidelines.
Just use your own judgement and ask thequestions that you feel areright... and most importantly remember... that we are looking only attheSEC A... ideally the SEC A - 30 plus women...
So come on outthere...
go and have fun!
Hi... sorryl'm late.
I'vehad likethe craziest day in office, today.
This spa campaign presentation is driving meup thewall.
And to top it all I just started chumming.
Poor baby.
Thanks forcoming.
Thethings women go through to producebabies!
Waittill you have yours.
It's all worth it.
Where's Sahil?
Not coming, busy with work.
Don't worry. I'll manage.
I'm tired oftrying... ifl'm not pregnant this time, then I'm not going to take anymorebloodyinjections.
At therateatwhich mylifeis going I'll also haveto go in for ivf...
Any progress with Jai?
I'm okaywith justletting things be thewaythey are but...
But?
I can'tbelieveJai actuallywants to marry me. I feel he's notserious... he'll run out on me, again.
Ofcoursehe's serious.
You'rethe onewho's not making up her mind.
I can't marry him justbecause I'm 30 and it's timeto getmarried.
And I'm scared of test-tube babies...
You'renot still holding a candle for Rishabh, are you?
Ruksana...?
The ifs and buts oflife.
Areall men essentiallymama's boys?
How well do wereally know the men in our lives?
So how manywomen have you been with since webrokeup?
Hardly any...
What's hardly any?
Three... if you insist.
Onehad somepotential, but the othertwo were just timepass...
Basicallythings didn't work out with any ofthem... so you turned up at my doorstep now that your parents also want you to settledown.
Notlike your parents don'twant you to settledown.
I found two moregrey strands today...
Listen, I hope this evening isn'ttoo tiring for you...
Chill. I am just two months pregnant.
I'm fine.
Where's Malini, are wepicking her up?
She's coming by herself.
And Ramona?
She's not coming... I just don'tget this Malini and Ramonathing... I don'tknow what to think.
I'm justamazed she didn'ttell us all this while.
And like fools we're tryingto set her up with oneguy after another.
Do I havelipstick on my teeth?
No... actually you do!
No,just kidding!
Hello everybody!
Hi!
Well tonight is dedicated to Reenu..
..my dearestsister andthebrideto be.
Reenu, I am goingto miss you once you get married!
But girl... liveit up while you can!
And for all the girls in the house... haveagreat time!
I'm drinking on your behalf!
Mal... are you sureabout this?
I am.
Maybeit's just apassing phase... lt's not.
Maybe Ramona is like influencing you.
It's not like you'vehad any experiencein thepast...
Or have you?
Of coursenot!
Otherwise I would have known before...
What the...!
Besides I'm not the one living a sham, Ruksana.
What?
-Whatis thatsupposed to mean?
-Ok guys chill... enjoy theshow!
Cheers!
Weshould have a club forwomen over 50... to celebrate womanhood.
Yes.
Or a club for old girls who need new lays...
We're young at heart, you see!
Greyhair, wrinkles, sagging breasts... they are all signs ofa life well lived.
We'rematuring likewine...
Now better marry this second boy.
I am happythatJai has proposed to memom. I do like him... I don't know about spending therest ofmy life with him.
It's notthatsimple... I know I should forget Rishabh.
I'vereached office.
Bye.
I am still single, and a 30 year old single girl is a big deal for my family.
Everyonewanted me to get married.
But nothingworked out.
I felt terrible for 2-3 years after I turned 30.
But life goes on and you haveto accept yourself.
Myhusband also lost interest in me... after I turned 35.
Now I am trying to focus on my career.
I am multi tasking all thetime.
I need atleast 48 working hours in a day.
And I've lostmy sex drive.
I wantedto learn music, but where's the time?
I am divorced and now in anew relationship.
I haveneverbeen happier.
I justthink women need to let their hair down and start having fun.
Weshould havea club for all women over 50... to celebrate womanhood.
Oh my god!
I haven't donethis in ages.
The last bikel rode was yours in college.
-Really?
-Oh my god!
Okaytry not killing us.
C'mon.
Actually you'renot doing badly at all.
Thank you... hold me!
Vietnam was just fantastic.
Here... check this candid oneout...
Nice!
Have you totally stopped doing colour?
I don'tknow...
I am enjoying black and white.
Maybeit's just aphase...
This series will make you a fortune...
You're mad!
Come on, you don'thave to bemodest.
Remember 4-5 years ago I couldn't sell a singlepicture!
Yeah I know.
And you didn't wantto do commercial photography.
Thank God I went offto London, at least mywork got appreciatedthere.
Itwas niceto have you out ofmyhairthough.
Naina, I'm notstruggling anymore... I know.
Whatl mean is, I can afford the wedding ceremony and... thewedding band.
Are you advertising in thematrimonials?
"No familybusiness, no ancestral wealth... just earning well so can afford good life."
Okayhow about...
"Errant photographer son ofCivil Services' family... seeking homely match..." Ask your parents to place that.
I think it's agreat idea.
What say Ranjeet?
Okay Naina.
Go ahead and makethepresentation.
The Post- 30 Club will position theCelebrate Women's Spa chain... as the SEC A 30 plus woman's best friend...
A place where shecan connect with otherwomen...
A placewhich is beyond massages and aromatherapy.
A placewherewhilesipping juiceand getting acupressure... she can also havean art class, or get investment advice.
We'renot just talking copyidea here.
We'retalking about great brand equity!
I think wehavea seed ofan ideahere...
It might just work!
Thank you Mr. Desai.
That's fine.
My only concern is the budget, you know...
Let me get back to you with amoredetailed presentation.
Copy, hoardings, TVC samples... the exact campaign plan, a tentativemediaplan with costing.
And you takea decision afterthat.
Sounds good.
And another thing...
don't worry about thecost.
Wecamewith a small budgetbut now, we are goingto do this in abig way.
So we'relooking at the inaugural budget of 100 crores... and an annual budget of 35.
Wow!
-That's great... lt's just that... I wish we had known aboutthis earlier, you know.
Jamiel didn'tknow. I really didn't know. I swear to God.
I didn't know it was such abig campaign.
-You didn't know?
-Yeah.
And I had my constraints.
You know the New York office would haveraised hell... had I fired her forthe U'va campaign.
You know that...
Boo fucking hoo.
That's when I realized a side campaign would be the bestsolution.
-l needthis brand. -l know!
Listen, put her on something else... I can't.
- This is your love?
Oh pumpkin please understand.
- This is how you show me.
Yeah!
I sent you to Cannes...
didn't I?
So what?
-Oh c'mon!
-What the hell!
It is temptingto giveup.
But I must believe in myself...
And I must believeing my product...
To my darling... who will one daymake Ogilvy very proud!
Love Rishabh.
Somegifts areinvaluable and timeless...
Ogilvy has never failed me.
Miss you Rishabh.
What were you doing?
Nothing really...
What happened?
Nothing.
Tell me...
How do you feel about me?
Naina you can't keep evading this issue.
I mean it's not like weare just sleepingtogether.
I can understand you not wantingto get married.
Butl think, I deserveto know how you feel aboutme.
I really care about you Jai... I really do...
But it's hard because I have all this stuffing my head..
..that I need to sort out... I just need some time.
You'releading a doublelife...
You'renotbeing fairtoJai.
I'm not committedto Jai.
Anyway, I'm not cheating on him...
Maybenot physically...
but you are emotionally.
I am messed up. I am on the rebound.
AndJai knows that.
I told him rightat the beginning...
And hewalked into this with his eyes wide open.
But you can't expect him to hang around... while you wait for Rishabh to miraculously getback with you.
He's engagedto Yamini.
He's not getting back with you.
You just needto move on...
Do you think it's so easy to moveon?
Am I supposedto just, switch on and off?
is it so technical?
Ifnot Rishabh...
then just replace the guy?
In my head I was married to Rishabh...
Do you know how that feels?
No...
But it's over...
You justhave to letgo...
Letgo...?
Why should I let go ofwhat's mine?
At work I'm expectedto let go.
Put in all thehardwork andtheeffort... and when it's time for awards and promotions... I'm supposedto let go?
I'veput in years ofmytimeand effort into this relationship.
and when the timecomes to actually get married... the guyleaves me... and I'm supposedto let go?
I'm 30... not 22.
Thetimeto letgo is over.
Forgetit... you guys are not goingto understand.
Nobody does.
I was sleepingwith Jai, but I was still in lovewith Rishabh.
So what?
But then...
Jai was getting hurt in theprocess.
And I couldn't help it.
I realized I had reached a pointing my life, wherenobodyin the world understood me... notmy friends, not mymother, notJai, not Rishabh.
But then who has ever really understood..
..a woman's wounded and broken heart?
And who has ever known, how long itwill taketo heal?
I was truly alone.
And it didn't matter anymore.
Lights... roll camera... action!
Hi, I am Rajni Sharma, I'm 38. I am a housewife...
So this is little Naina working hardto crack the big fish!
Shouldn't I?
I wouldn't ifl were you...
You'd justgetsomebody else to do it and takethe credit.
Touchy!
I don't know abouttouchy.
The "touch" is definitely your forte.
And he never recovered from that insult...
Listen,this is an auspicious timeto get married.
You needto decidenow.
Or it'll be another four years.
Anyway, the girl is unlucky.
You came from Delhi to Mumbai... justto convinceme to marryJai... lt's been over amonth... sinceheasked you.
And you still haven't given him an answer!
You can'tbe so busywith your new campaign... that you don't have timeto makesuch..
..an important decision in your life.
I am busy.
This is Malini's dream come true.
Wow!
Our Mal's a star!
I just don't want her to drift away from us.
Yeah sheis really caught up with that Ramona.
Or maybewe'recreatingthe distance...
I don't know...
Don't worry...we'll befine, we've been together sincecollege!
-Look who's on Page 3?
-Who?
She's just... she's just too thin .
Too thin... who is this thin?
Okay no more lusting afterthat jerk.
That's great ma'am... spotlight's on you, good show!
Congratulations!
I'll get you somethingto eat..
-Yeah sure!
-l'll just come.
Mumbai Times,today?
-She saw it.-Saw what?
A photo of Rishabh and Yamini atsome party.
Sheetal is just a friend...
It's no big deal.
I'm seeing you.
It's a big deal.
Why can't you tell me the truth...?
I don't think you can handle the truth.
You know I think your friends just wantus...
This is not aboutmy friends...
Theythink thatsomehow I've turned you into alesbian...
Shutup...
Ramona...
They think thatif you break up with me, you'll becomestraight...
-Just shut up and leave!
-Comeon.
Justshut up and leave, Ramona!
No... no... no

-Thank you.-But... theother idea... recommended by your agency head, that's more viable.
I think abetter way of communicating..
..our entry into the spa market.
I guess therewas no need for meto makethis presentation.
The decision was already made.
Rats obviously gotJamie to present an alternativeto Celebrate.
This timeto the CEO,who he had already wined and dined... and I'm sureShalini would haveknown.
I am tired of your manipulative games...
Sit down.
You'reactually saying something!
You spineless bastard!
All you can do is lick their combined asses, whiletrying to keep your position secure.
We'll accept your resignation, okay!
You mean you'll welcomeit.
Whatever you think.
Jamieis justusing you to get ahead while you'velost your marbles... trying to appease your love interest.
Can't you see that?
Listen, lets get on with the formalities... because wecan do without your ranting and raving.
Fuck you all.
You're justmissing atool honey!
Yeah that's theone!
Being impulsiveis underrated.
I think thebest decisions areoften the ones..
..wetakeon the spur ofthemoment.
But then sometimes the biggestmistakes of ..
..our lives aremade on impulse.
Havel just madethebiggest mistakeofmylife?
Thrown awaymy chances atsuccess?
Impulse.
is that whyl'm with Jai...?
is that why Rishabh is marrying Yamini?
Aunty, don't you think what you did to mels unfair?
Unfair...?
C'mon aunty, stop pretending.
Till two months ago, Rishabh was going to marryme.
Then suddenly he dumps me to marry Yamini.
The decision was Rishabh's.
We don't interferein his life.
Ofcourse you did.
He was so upset becauseof yourbusiness problems.
Marrying Yamini will fix everything, right?
Her millions will revitalize your company.
I think you should mind your own business.
Itis my business!
If Rishabh wanted to marry you... hewould have.
And... you know he's engaged already.
I don't care. I know heloved me and wantedto marryme.
He was under pressureto please you.
lfhewas under pressure, wouldn't hehave joined the business?
At therateat which he's going, I'm surehewill.
Naina...whatare you doing here?
Tryingto sort out my life.
Shesays we pressurized you into marrying Yamini.
Whatis wrong with you, Naina?
We'vebeen over this a million times.
Then onelast timewon't hurt!
Then lets you and I talk...
Don't drag mom and dad into this.
Aren'ttheyresponsible?
Responsible forwhat?
Forwhat?
For getting you to marry that filthyrich bimbette... only for her money.
Take it easy Naina.
She's beautiful and young, that's abonus for you.
Have you killed yourconscience?
Naina stop it. I am warning you.
Your greed masquerading as obligation makes mesick Rishabh.
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
The truth fucking hurts.
That's your problem.
You... all of you are fucking hypocrites, with not an ounceofintegrity.
Naina stop it.
You know what..
-Get thehell out ofhere.
God will punish you!
It'll all come back to you... you haveno idea.
You will rot in...
You will rot in fucking hell.
Fuck you all.
You'll bemiserable forthe rest ofyourlives.
Mark my words!
Your idea was rejected.
You felt desperate, you quit your job.
That's no excuse.
Lifeis full ofups and downs.
You need to grow up and deal with them.
What's thematterwith you?
You still wanthim back... I don'tknow... lt's high time you know Naina.
I can't be your rebound sex toy forever.
Even I want the real thing!
I know you keep trying to get in touch with him... I don'tsay anything because you said you wanted moretime.
I'm trying mybest, Naina, but you're...
Jai... you'vealso suddenly appeared in my life, wanting to start off from exactly where you left off four years ago.
It's not so simple.
I was on the verge of marrying Rishabh.
Wewere...we weretogether in a way that I havenever been with you.
I got usedto theidea ofhaving him around.
Of... ofhim beingthere for me.
Nainal don'twant to know how good it was with him.
You need to start living in the present,.
and stop running away from whatis real in your life
Jai you walked out on me when it suited you... andwalked right back in when itsuited you.
It can't always beabout your convenience, Jai!
And it's very easy for you to accuse meofbeing commitment phobic, what was thestrength of your commitment four years ago..
..when I wanted to settle down?
You just ran away... disappeared!
I said I madea mistake.
But I'm here now.
And I want you now.
Naina I am ready to start afresh.
But you're obviously not.
I just needed closure. I needed to confront them onelast time.
You don't needto confront them.
You needto confront yourself.
And figureout what you want... I can't do this anymore.
Call me... when you sort your lifeout.
Ah... so listen, Shalini will be taking over... so you can, you know, hand over to her.
Okay?
I had to think about my career Naina... lt's all over.
The dream is shattered.
Ofloveand ambition...
nothing remains.
Naina!
Open thedoor, Naina!
Naina...
You've got everyoneso worried.
Nottaking anyone's calls.
Cutting yourself offlikethat!
Ruksana was goingto cancel her doctor's appointment..
..to comesee you.
Pull yourselftogether.
Look atme...
I'm not dying, am I?
Put your slipper down!
Go wash yourface.
And pleasemakemea cup oftea.
You can have some too!
Okay.
-Naina?
-Yeah.
I'm going to check my mail okay.
Just minimize the files thatareon.
Okay.
Hi mom.
Sorry, I was just goingto call you.
I'vebeen verybusy.
No I'm not being irresponsiblemom.
I told you theother day, my decision is final.
I'vealready quit.
Anyway, Shalini has replaced me.
-Do you wanthoney?
-No.
No...
Jai has not tried to contact me.
I love you too... byemom.
Hello,what are you doing?
I thought you were checking your mail.
When have you been writingthis?
Stop it Malini. lt's just somepersonal crap.
Pleasedon'tread it...
Just let me read it...
you go takea shower.
-Malini!
-Go takea shower.
Malini stop it.
You're getting on mynerves now.
Okaynow enough!
Stop prying.
I'm not prying...
I'm just reading.
Shit man!
This is amazing.
I can't believe you've written this... seriously!
Right, I had a look at the material.
It seems we'vegot abook here!
-l knew that...
-l don't know...
-Naina.
-l'vejust been writingto unwind.
Justrelax.
What we havehere is fabulous!
Seeit does need alittle bit ofwork... tweak the shape... alterthe structure abit context and yet what wehave is great.
Here's whatl propose, okay!
Let mespeak to my London office, and get their approval.
ltwon't be aproblem.
In factthey'll loveit.
Then we commission you to write it.
I'm not sure...
I've...
- Listen...
- Comeon, Naina.
If you don'twant to write it... wecan always buythe raw material from you and commission somebody elseto do thejob.
But you know what, ideally that's notthebest option.
Listen you'vequit your job.
Just givethis a shot!
You might actually enjoyit Naina.
Let me think about it...
Peopledieto get their book published.
Like this one?
It's the chanceof alifetime.
And you haveto get your mind off Rishabh and thatJai.
Chapter one. lt's monsoon in Mumbai.
Therain is splashing across the roads.
A youngwoman in abright red car, drives through thegreylandscape.
You areusing my Post-30 club idea, after all...
Well listen the Celebrate guys liked your idea, better.
And sincethedetailing had been done... you know.
But it's completely unethical.
Well I'm really sorry...
No, you're not.
Don't worry we'll be ablesortthis out.
But whatl am goingto need from you..
..is as much documentation as possible.
I will give you everything I'vegot.
Good.
Now, I'll sit with my team andwe'll figureout... thebest way forward in this case.
Copyright law enforcement in India, is at a very early stage.
So harassment and malpractice is probably..
..the onlywaywecan nail them.
-Ok?
-Yeah.
You've just started writing your book.
There's no need to go on this crusade.
You'vequit.
Now let it go...
Listen,writing is your priority... but it's important for you to get your due, I think.
I'm so angry.
How can I not speak up?
I know I'm taking on amajor battle, but...there's no other option.
Lets settlethis. 20 lakhs and you withdraw the case.
I'm notinterested in settling.
Not enough?
We cannot get a stay order forthis event.
I'm not giving up.
Do you want to filean appeal?
TheCelebrateSpa Chain welcomes you to thelaunch of The Post 30 Club.

Can I... meet Naina?
Wait aminute.
She's busy, she won't beable to see you.

I am happy for you.
Hi...
Sheis likea doll.
Her nose is just like yours.
Same nose!
So, mommy Ruksana...
how does it feel?
It's the best feeling in the world!
Both of you should feel this.
Hopefully... someday, without testtubes!
So how are things with Sahil?
He's back to his philanderingways.
buti don't careanymore.
I'vegot baby Noornow!
Maybethat's how you feel right now.
As long as you'rehappy Ruks.
Thehappiestl'veever been...
divorce just seems pointless now.
And Noorwill need her daddy...
yes you will... yes you will.
No... what're you doing!
-Ok I'll also give...
-No Naina stop... ln thecaseof Naina Singh vs. ADZ... thebench has found ADZ guilty... on charges of corporate malpractice and harassment at thework place.
We're goingto fightthis!
No onemesses with us, no one!
You, listen to me.
Now in this one...
Alfred!
You don't worry okay.
I'll figure something out.
And you know what!
We will filean appeal.
Rathi, it's all over.
What?
You will not fight any morecases.
Why?
- You'refired.
And so areJamieand Ranjeet.
-You mean...
-Exactlywhatl said.
And I'll make surethat no other agency hires you.
Naina, I'm entering you as thecreative director forthe Spa campaign fortheawards at Cannes.
Also we'd like to take you on as the national creativedirector of ADZ.
Thanks Alfred.
Butl think I'll pass.
Hello... hi!
Friends on behalfof Pentad publishers..
..letmewelcome Ms. Naina Singh... thedebutant author of Turning 30!
Go Naina!
This book is officiallybeing launched right here, right now!
Italso happens to be Naina's birthdaytoday.
Happy Birthday!
First of all, I'd like to thank my friend Malini, who made ithermission to make me writethis book.
David, for his unstinting supportand encouragement.
My friend Ruksana, for all her love that saw methrough thewriting ofthis book.
And ofcoursemy parents, especially my mother.
It's a wonderful way of celebrating mybirthday... I'veturned 31 today... and with thelaunch ofmy book, I think I'vefinally cometo terms... with turning 30!
Mirrors lieand ask difficult questions.
Am I beautiful still?
Will hestill loveme when I havewrinkles?
Am I only what I do orwho I love?
Havel missedthebus?
Whyis turning 30 so hard?
Myth - 30 year oldwomen find 40 year old men attractive.
Fact- 30 year oldwomen find 22 year old boys more attractive.
It's calledthe "he's been with anotherwoman radar".
Except it's not always reliable... because wesee only what we chooseto see.
Broken hearts can bemended.
All it takes is few nights ofdrunken revelry... and manynights of tear stained pillows.
The real solution to abroken heartis of courseanother man... well other men!
or better still - ahair cut.
A red dress and stilettos and..
..you feel like all your dreams can come true.
Then you wakeup thenext morning and realize, it's just another regular day... and you put your lifeon hold, until thenext time you takeout that red dress from your closet.
Thirty or not,we are all looking for happiness, but perhaps in thewrong places.
-Such a wannabe signature.
-Teach meabetter one.
I don't know whatto say...
You don'thave to say anything Rishabh...
-l didn't want itto turn out this way. -lt's okay.
I am sorry Naina.
I just...wish I hadn't been such a bastard.
Thepast is over Rishabh.
I am not marrying Yamini.
It was all forthe wrong reasons Naina...
What you and I had was real.
It's time fornew beginnings.
So you'll give me another chance?
Find yourselffirst Rishabh...
and you'll find love.
Read mybook, ithas all theanswers.
Jai!
I'vesorted out my life now.
I'vedonewhat I had to do.
Will you marry me?
After rain comes sunshine.Just as winter always turns to spring.
But thespring blossom depends on how well..
..we are ableto usethewinter.
I guess I had learnt to brave the winter.
And it was finally timeto greet spring!
Dear Dr. Jones,
I act on behalf of a client with access to very substantial funds who has indicated a desire to sponsor a project to introduce salmon and the sport of salmon fishing into the Yemen.
I would like to seek a meeting with you to identify how this challenging project might be initiated and resourced.
I might add that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office supports the project as a symbol of Anglo-Yemeni cooperation.
Yours sincerely, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Ms.
Fitzharris Price Investment Consultants.
Night.
Have a good evening.
You, too.
Say hi to soldier boy.
We're just friends, you know.
We've only met a couple of times.
- Yeah, you tell me that on Monday.
- Shut up.
- Hello.
- Hi.
It's great to see you.
- Yes.
Me, too.
Sorry.
- Yes?
- Yes.
- You, too.
- No, "Yes" is a start, that's fine.
- Stop it, I'm so nervous.
Why are you nervous?
I don't know.
I'm trying to be very sophisticated and grown-up.
Right.
No, grown-up, absolutely.
Quite right, yeah.
- Harriet.
- Yes?
Last one to the restaurant pays.
What?
You bastard.
Dear Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, thank you for your e-mail.
As a fisheries specialist, permit me a word or two about salmon.
Migratory salmonoids require cool, well-oxygenated water in which to spawn.
In addition, in the early stages of the salmon's life cycle, a good supply of fly life indigenous to the northern European rivers is necessary for the juvenile salmon, or parr, to survive.
Some considerable distance from the Indian Ocean, or indeed the Red Sea, as I am sure you are aware, though apparently not the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
We conclude that conditions in the Yemen make this project unfeasible.
Fundamentally unfeasible.
Yes, yes.
Fundamentally unfeasible.
We therefore regret that we are unable to help you any further in this matter.
Yours, Alfred Jones, Doctor.
I've put duck liver pate in your sandwich.
That's lovely.
Righto.
I'm off to bed.
Already?
- Airport car's coming at 5:00.
- Righto.
I'll maybe have another wee pass at the caddis fly paper.
You could read it on the airplane.
Up to my ear in reports, darling.
I'll read it when I'm back.
Right, then.
Good night.
Oh, my God, I don't do this.
I don't do this.
No, I can tell.
I haven't done this in a really long time.
- Okay.
- I'm so shy.
- Okay.
No, I'll sleep on the sofa.
- No, I'm so shy.
Look, Harriet, I mean it.
I...
Shut up.
You were saying.
You're shy.
I am shy and quiet.
Like Hitler.
I'm serious.
Robert, I...
Don't do this and then forget me.
I just don't wanna be an army barracks joke in the morning.
Please be nice to me.
Harriet, I'm serious, too.
I mean it.
So if you want me to sleep on the sofa, then I'll...
If you say, Captain Mayers, one more time you'll sleep on the sofa, you'll bloody well sleep on the sofa.
Captain Robert Mayers, 3-6-4-7-7-2.
Maxwell.
Better be good.
Mrs. Maxwell, we have a situation.
- What?
- Code Red in Afghanistan.
Go to sleep.
Tell me that's not a mosque.
Well, it is a religious establishment...
- Of course it's a bloody mosque!
- Well, of course...
- What's up?
- Go to sleep.
- ...make this a joint operation.
- No, no,no, no,no, no,no.
The British have absolutely nothing to do with this whatsoever.
And I want every single man, woman, child and goat in Afghanistan to know that.
My God, I didn't think we could make the war in Afghanistan any less popular, but, hey, even I can be wrong.
We'll have Vera Lynn strapping on her suicide belt in sympathy next.
Bravo, the bloody Marines.
Right, you lot.
We need a good news story from the Middle East, a big one.
And we need it now.
You've got an hour, get on with it.
Good news, eh?
New girl band, Middle East tour.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Touch my body No, no...
Okay-
Maybe not.
No.
British trans-Arabian rally.
For God's sake.
Come on, come on.
Come up with something.
What's this?
A project to introduce salmon fishing to the Yemen.
Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Is that the best you puffed-up Oxbridge-educated moronic buffoons can come up with?
Yes?
Yes, Prime Minister.
Well, no, I'm working on it right now.
I think I may have come up with something that you'll like.
Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing.
Are you dollies trying to get me fired?
Well, here we go.
Fish it is
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Hello.
Mrs. Maxwell on line one, sir.
Busy.
She says it's urgent, sir.
Maxwell who?
The press officer to the Prime Minister, sir.
Patricia.
They haven't pensioned you off yet, then?
Listen, I got the heads-up from the FCO about this salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Fancy it?
- Well, I...
- We do.
Chasing a good news story out of the Middle East.
Anglo-Yemeni relations back on track.
Arab-Western cultural détente through the ancient sport of yanking poor sodding fish out of rivers.
What do you reckon?
Well, it's a bit of a long shot, to be honest.
Well, don't be honest.
Lunatic's an oil sheikh.
Got money pouring out of his arse.
Good friend of the West.
Good friend of the Party, too, so give it a go, eh, dolly?
Well, we'll certainly bend every sinew to the job, Patricia.
I'll set up a working party immediately.
- What?
- Hey!
Don't you "working party" me, you short-arsed little pen-pusher.
I did not say kick it into the long grass.
I said do it!
Yes, Patricia.
Right away.
Mr. Jones?
Morning, Mr. Jones.
Good morning, Betty.
I trust you had a nice weekend.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Jones.
Mr. Sugden would like a word.
Would he indeed?
What do you think of that?
It's for the caddis fly report.
Need something racy for the cover.
Something to rev up the YouTube generation.
I know it's not quite what we would expect from a scientific paper, but we must keep up with the times, Mrs. Burnside.
Mr. Sugden asked to see you, Mr. Jones.
I'm not too sure that I don't have a picture of a caddis being eaten alive by a spider somewhere.
There it is.
That's a beauty.
What do you think about that for...
Good God.
Little too much, do you think?
No, not if you're making a horror film.
Look, this e-mail about the salmon thing.
Yes.
Did I miss April Fools' Day or something?
Did you like my little swipe at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wonks?
Yeah, well, I just had another e-mail from the FCO today.
Rattle their cage, did I?
Look, you wouldn't take a meeting with her, would you?
This Chetwode-Talbot woman.
She represents this Sheikh Muhammed bloke.
Why would I want to do that?
Why would I want to traipse across London to discuss that nonsense?
I've very important work to do here, as you can very well see.
Yeah, well, the FCO, in their infinite W, feel that a meeting on this is important business, too, Alfred.
Lord, the tendrils of this busybody government.
Dr. Jones, as your Operational Line Manager,
I am asking you with extreme prejudice to take a meeting with Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
I take it that's an order?
Take it how you wish.
Nazi.
Wanker.
Morning.
Dr. Jones?
Miss Chetwode-Talbot is expecting me.
Yes, it's a bit of a mouthful.
Do call me Harriet.
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Do you want to come with me?
Yes.
Do come in.
Please, sit down.
Yeah, anywhere you like.
Would you like tea or coffee?
No, thank you.
So...
Fitzharris Price represent the sheikh's assets in this country, including a number of estates in Scotland.
He's a very keen fisherman, so he asked us if we would...
- Water.
- Sorry?
Water, Miss Chetwode-Talbot.
H2O.
Do you want sparkling or still?
Not for me, for the fish.
Fish require water.
You are familiar with that concept?
Yes.
I am, yes.
So, to save us both a lot of time, let me keep this brief and simple.
Here it's very cold.
It rains a lot.
Here it's very hot.
It doesn't rain a lot.
Do you see the difference?
Well, you're pointing to Saudi Arabia, Dr. Jones, not the Yemen.
You seem to be deliberately missing the point.
With respect, not really.
You see, unlike Saudi Arabia, parts of the Yemen get up to 250 millimeters of rainfall a month in the wet season.
It gets the edge of the monsoon, you see.
And the dry season?
Well, interestingly, recent oil explorations have uncovered a number of very large freshwater aquifers, which could sort of recharge the wadi in the dry season using a dam.
I'm sure they could.
So, when he's built his dam, why don't you get back to me then?
Completed, couple of years ago.
Long-term plan is to irrigate thousands of acres of desert.
We could grow watermelons, maize, cotton.
Now you're going to tell me it isn't hot in the Yemen, too, aren't you?
Well, in the mountainous areas, the nighttime temperatures get down to well below 20 Celsius.
And, of course, I defer to your expert knowledge, Dr. Jones, but I do believe that Pacific salmon get as far south as California.
Temperatures are not too dissimilar there.
- Water.
- For the fish.
- No, for me.
- Of course.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Yes, Dr. Jones?
This is plainly ridiculous.
There's just no way that salmon can survive in those sort of environments.
If your sheikh wants to pour his money down the drain, why doesn't he buy himself a football club or something?
Look, Dr. Jones.
I don't really think it's my place to explain the sheikh's motivations.
But I will say this, that of all of our wealthy clients, he is different.
I would go so far as to describe him as a visionary man.
- A visionary?
- Yes, I know, it's not a very fashionable word, but if you decide to take this project with us, then you can judge for yourself when you meet him.
My line manager asked me to come here and take this meeting to discuss your project and that I have done.
I thank you for your time, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
I'll see myself out.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Did you get my e-mail?
Yes.
What did it say?
Took the meeting.
Waste of time, as predicted.
Now, if you don't mind, I'll get back to my work.
Dr. Jones.
What is this?
P45.
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't understand.
Well, a P45 is the official document given to an employee when his services are no longer required by his, or her, employer.
Yes, but, Bernard, this has got my...
Or you can sign this letter stating that you are delighted to assign yourself, exclusively, to the Yemeni salmon fishing project with immediate effect.
It's up to you.
But, Bernard, you know as well as I do this thing is a bloody joke.
There's no way you can get salmon that far up a...
Just there.
This is blackmail, Sugden.
This is a bloody outrage.
Fitzharris Price will be paying your salary while on secondment.
Almost double what it is now.
I'd say that's a bloody outrage.
Double?
Can I have time to think about this?
Nope.
- Can I borrow your pen?
- No.
It's my special one with the italic nib.
Hey.
Hold it, hold it.
Hold it.
Brian, what...
What have you got in bar seven?
I should have resigned.
You can't afford to resign.
Matter of principle.
I have a standing in the scientific community, Mary.
A reputation.
You have a mortgage.
Two, three, four.
Maybe I should resign.
We could have a baby.
Why not?
You could stay on at work and I could bring up the nipper.
I could take him to the park and to school.
I could take him fishing.
What do you think?
They're really losing the plot in Geneva.
One minute they're buying Euros, the next minute they can't ditch them fast enough for dollars.
They're panicking, and guess who they want to bail them out.
I can't imagine.
Say a command.
- Shut up.
- Say a command.
What were you shouting about back there?
Nothing.
Say a command.
Mar)'-
Oh, Lord.
Well, that should do you for a while.
Thank you, Mary.
Good night.
Night, dear.
Oh, Jesus.
Good morning.
Yes, Staff.
I've gotta go.
Now?
Yeah.
That was the call.
Sorry.
Is it Afghanistan?
It's somewhere sandy, that's for sure.
- I'll go get some tea.
- No, look...
- No, it's all right, Robert.
It's...
- No, no, come here.
Look, the last few weeks...
This is good.
Wonderful.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.
Will you wait for me?
Now go get that tea.
You bastard.
Well, firstly, we would need to trap 10,000 salmon from the North Sea, for the sake of argument, get them to the Yemen alive, don't ask me how, where they would be deposited in temperature and oxygen-controlled holding tanks built into a wadi
that would, hallelujah, open during the rainy season, allowing the salmon to migrate upstream for, say, 10 kilometers, which would allow your sheikh to hoick them out of the water to his heart's content.
Of course, until the dry season, when they will all
die.
Well, unless we feed the wadi all year round using the dam.
Of course.
Stupid idiot man.
Why not use precious water resources to support one man's sport fishing?
So, now that we have year-round water, why not build some gravel spawning grounds, breed the world's first Arabian salmon, and teach the clever fellows to migrate to the Indian Ocean...
Wonderful, wonderful idea.
...singing, "Step we gaily, here we go.
Heel for heel and toe for toe."
Rough cost?
Cost?
Cost.
Forty million.
No, 45...
- Fifty million.
- Dollars?
- Dollars.
- Dollars.
Or pounds.
Pounds.
At least.
So it's theoretically possible?
Well, it's theoretically possible in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is theoretically possible.
It's very impressive, Dr. Jones.
No, it's not.
It's nonsense.
Look, I just made it all up.
No, the drawing.
Real talent, if I might say so.
Excellent start.
So I suppose we should just crack on and get things started now?
You can't hold me to this.
I mean, these are just random ideas.
I mean, this is a sort of joke.
Well, I'm sure you wouldn't joke about a 50-million-pound project, Dr. Jones.
Not when you're in charge of it.
Well, the sheikh is so looking forward to meeting you, and he'll be back in the next couple of weeks.
So, in the meantime, is there anything else that I can do for you?
Well, as a matter of fact, there is.
Could you arrange a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
The one in China?
Is there another?
British Oxygen Company.
A meeting with them as well.
And then, what are those great big transport aircraft called?
The big Russian military...
Antonovs.
Find out about renting two of those, one for the fish and one to carry all the money that we're going to need.
When that's done, I'd be delighted to start working.
Good day, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good day, Dr. Jones.
Mary!
Up here.
Boy, did I put a hurricane up that Chetwode-Talbot woman.
You would have laughed.
I told her I wanted a meeting with the Three Gorges Dam team from...
Where are you going?
Geneva.
I told you.
You didn't say now.
Well, I am.
Tomorrow.
Well, how long are you going for?
Six weeks, to start with.
Six weeks?
There's no need to shout.
Six weeks, though, Mary.
This is a big chance for me.
I'll be heading up the whole operation.
Well, you could say "Congratulations."
Great.
Enough is enough.
It's job or marriage.
You've got to make a decision and make it now, God damn it.
There are planes, you know, Fred.
And I get Sundays off.
Mostly.
You can get all your horrible old fishing stuff out again.
Didn't even ask me.
Just went and did it.
I know.
I'm sorry.
It just suddenly seemed like the right decision.
Maybe for both of us.
Fred, I don't want to leave on bad terms.
No.
No.
I'll open a bottle of something fizzy.
Okay?
Reports are coming in from Afghanistan of a British soldier killed while on duty in Helmand Province.
An improvised explosive device detonated during a routine search in a local village.
This...
The Minister for Culture's been photographed doing what?
Naked or clothed?
Boy or girl?
How old?
Jesus.
Well, at least she's legal.
Press statement from us saying that we're a party of policy not personality, concentrating on the real issues of getting this country back on track in times of economic hardship and not tabloid sensationalism, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Meanwhile, get the useless arse on the front page of every paper apologizing for being born, big spread in Hello!
with blonde forgiving wife and cute kids.
If they're not cute, find a horse or something.
Joshua!
Hood.
Don't you suck your teeth at me, young man.
I'm not one of your bitches from the Baltimore low-rises.
You feel me?
I'm your fucking mother!
Got to go.
Meeting.
Dear Dr. Jones, the sheikh has requested your company at his estate in Glen Tulloch to discuss the salmon project further.
Please advise which dates would suit you best.
Many thanks, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Fitzharris Price.
Mr. Sugden would like to see you in the canteen, sir.
Up his arse with a meter ruler.
Thanks, Betty.
- Which one is he?
- Over here.
Fred.
Can I introduce Patricia Maxwell?
She is the Prime Minister's press officer.
Hello.
Fifty million from Sheikh Muhammed thingammy.
It's the first-stage payment on research development for the salmon fishing project.
The PM's keeping a close eye on this one.
It's just what we need right now, a bit of Anglo-Arab news that isn't about things that explode.
I want to know, is it a goer?
Goer?
Well, look, the complexities.
I mean, I barely know even where to begin, but, well, just for starters, we would need 10,000 live salmon.
Is 10,000 salmon a lot?
Well, if they're to come from British waters, and I don't see where else they're gonna come from.
I mean, you would need the permission of the Environment Agency.
That's your job, Bernard.
Okay, so you get on to the EA and get this man his salmon.
- Miss Maxwell.
Ms.
- Mrs. Happily married.
Details in Who's Who.
Mrs. Maxwell, there are two million fishermen in the UK who are, I would say, unusually protective of...
How many?
- Two million.
- Two million?
- Yes.
- Bloody hell.
Two million out there waving their little rods around?
Are they the kind that vote our way?
They vote for those that best look after their fish, in my experience.
I bet they do, I bet they do.
Right, so, Prime Minister on the front cover of Fishy Weekly or whatever.
Best friend of the British fisherfolk.
Spearing a leaping salmon.
I like this.
I like it a lo' [.
They do have magazines, these people?
They can read?
Aye, the Angling Times, Trout and Salmon,
Coarse Fishing Monthly, Bassmania.
Bassmania?
Marvelous.
Marvelous.
That's marvelous.
This has just become a priority project.
Anything I can do, just give me a call.
Two million.
God, men, what a species.
I don't think she got the right end of the stick there.
Your call, I think, Bernard.
Ten thousand native Atlantic salmon on my desk by Friday, please.
Yeah, well, you'd just better come through on this, Jones.
It's been a long time since I was back.
- Yes?
- A long time.
You see?
- Is that where he lives?
- Yes.
He has many estates, but this one's his favorite.
- May I present Malcolm, the butler.
- Hello.
- This is Dr. Jones.
- Welcome to Glen Tulloch, sir.
His Excellency thought you might like to avail yourself of the fishing while you're waiting.
Thank you very much.
May I present Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama.
This is Dr. Jones.
It's a great pleasure to meet you, Your Excellency.
To meet the creator of the Woolly Jones, the pleasure's all mine, sir.
That's very kind.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, do you realize that for more than 10 years
I have fished with a Woolly Jones?
Really?
What's a Woolly Jones?
Dr. Jones invented a famous fly.
Well, it's a sentimental habit that some fly-tiers have of calling a fly after...
Anyway, I don't approve of that sort of thing normally, but...
Woolly Jones.
It's a great name.
A bloody good fly, that's for sure.
Please allow me to show you a delightful lie just around the corner.
Absolutely.
Lead on.
You think I'm mad?
- No, Your Excellency.
I...
- Of course you do.
I would question yourjudgment if you did not.
Though I have judgment enough to know that under there lies a fish much cleverer than I.
I'm a great admirer of the British for many reasons, but still there are mysteries to me.
The rich are frightened of the poor.
The poor are frightened of the rich.
And even your politicians, they try to sound like the people on the EastEnders.
A wonderful program, but still.
Yes, the great British class system.
Indeed.
But fishermen, I have noticed, they don't care whether I'm brown or white, rich or poor, wearing robes or waders.
All they care about is the fish, the river and the game we play.
For fishermen, the only virtues are patience, tolerance and humility.
I like this.
You are struck dumb by my naivety, Dr. Alfred.
No, you're on.
- What?
- You're on.
- This is a sign.
- A sign?
A sign that I should stop talking bollocks and fish.
Come here.
- Nicely done, sir.
- Thank you.
Very nicely done.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Hello, Dr. Jones.
Is that yours?
- The dress.
- Yes.
This is not mine.
It suits you very well.
Thank you.
They seem to know my size.
That not strike you as a wee bit sinister?
The idea of the sheikh's tailor tracking me across London with some kind of satellite measuring device?
They asked me for your size.
And I took a guess.
Well, for future reference,
I have a 32-inch waist, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
- Right.
- Not a 34.
No pies for me.
Note taken, sorry about that.
Thank you.
Ms. Harriet has told me of your marvelous plan.
Plan?
Well, not so much of a plan, really, as more of a feasibility study.
Theoretically possible, you said, Dr. Jones.
- Theoretically.
Jndeed.
It would be a miracle of God if it were to happen.
I'm more of a facts-and-figures man myself.
You're not a religious man?
No.
No, I'm not.
But you're a fisherman, Dr. Jones.
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
How many hours do you fish before you catch something?
Dozens?
Gosh, hundreds sometimes.
Is that a good use of your time for a facts-and-figures man?
But you persist in the wind and the rain and the cold with such poor odds of success.
Why?
Because you're a man of faith, Dr. Alfred.
And in the end, you are rewarded for your faith and constancy
With a fish.
With due respect, fishing and religion are hardly the same thing, Your Excellency.
With equal respect,
I have to disagree.
A toast?
To faith.
And fish.
To faith and fish.
To faith and fish.
And science.
And science.
You're unhappy tonight, Ms. Harriet?
No.
I'm fine, really.
I have too many wives not to know when a woman is unhappy.
Though mine are not so quiet about it.
Robert, he's my boyfriend, has just been posted to Afghanistan.
Or somewhere.
I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.
For how long?
They don't really tell us things like that.
How worrying.
I just try not to think about it.
- And you are married, Dr. Alfred?
Jndeed.
It is kind of her to spare you.
My wife's actually working abroad at the moment in Geneva, so...
So you two have more in common than one might suppose.
I have put my feet in it.
Please forgive me.
Perfect moment to retire to bed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
You're welcome.
- Dr. Alfred.
- Your Excellency.
I know you have been persuaded to help us, but unless you do this with an open heart,
I don't think anything will come of it.
So, please, consider.
Of course.
I hope we meet again.
Dr. Jones.
Yes?
Well, I was just wondering what you thought.
Well, the sheikh's English has a certain tendency towards the mystical, don't you think?
But then, doolally as this entire enterprise clearly is,
I've had the most pleasant day I can remember having for quite a long time.
So, if the sheikh is paying, as it were, on we go.
Great.
Good night, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good night, Dr. Jones.
It's been a pleasure.
Yes.
Have you any idea what an outcry there would be if the Environment Agency stripped British rivers of 10,000 salmon and shipped them off to the effing Yemen?
Well, how many can you spare?
None!
Christ, Bernard!
Anglers, they're obsessive crazies.
You think AI Qaeda are a threat, think again, mate.
I've seen a fly fisherman wade into a river and try and drown a canoeist just for passing by in a Day-Glo jacket.
You haven't got a hope in hell of getting these fish from British rivers.
- Yes?
- Dr. Jones.
Hello.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
How nice.
- Did we book a meeting?
- No.
You know how you said that you wanted a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
- Did I say that?
- Yes.
That might have been a little hasty.
- They're outside.
- Who?
The chief hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam.
Here?
I e-mailed them about the flow rate calculus, and I think there must have been some kind of...
My Mandarin is very rusty.
Bloody hell.
We are able to control the flow of water from the upstream dam.
But we are...
Well, we're concerned about the capability of the sandstone walls.
I mean, there's the possibility also of some flash-flood scenario.
Thank you very much.
My God, do you think we got away with it?
- Do you know, I think we did.
- I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
No, please don't apologize.
I think we've just found our engineers.
- Yes.
- I mean, should the project, of course, get that far.
Your Mandarin was much better than I expected.
- Thank you.
- Bernard Sugden, Head of Department.
Hello.
Alfred not bothering you too much, I hope?
No.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot from Fitzharris Price.
Hello.
Bet he doesn't even know your first name, does he?
So, who were all those little chippy-chappies?
Those are the engineers from the Three Gorges Dam.
What, the one in China?
- Is there another?
- Don't think there's another one.
Would have appreciated an introduction.
Bernard is the man who's responsible for acquiring our 10,000 native Atlantic salmon.
How's that coming along, Bernard?
Don't you worry about that, Fred.
It's all in hand.
Well, don't dilly-dally.
Our end is coming along.
- We're bang on schedule, in fact.
- Yes.
A debrief in the canteen, or has Fred brought in the famous sandwiches?
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot and I are going out for lunch, Bernard.
There's lots to discuss.
Clare, could you ask Betty to bring my bag?
Thank you.
Certainly, Dr. Jones.
Are you sure you won't have one?
At lunch time?
Dr. Jones, I haven't spoken a word of Mandarin for about four years, so I am celebrating even if you're not.
I only drink alcohol on the weekend.
And even then, only after 7:00.
No exceptions?
None that I can think of.
Well, yeah.
We got married on a Friday, but I think it was, as I recall, a bank holiday in Northern Ireland, so I allowed myself, I think, a glass on a technicality.
That was an attempt at a joke, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Right.
Good one.
Do you really think it's going extremely well?
- What?
- The project.
The project.
Well, it's utter nonsense, of course, naturally, the bagatelle of a man with more money than sense, but...
I haven't actually found anything to say that it couldn't work.
You know, theoretically, of course.
In theory.
Well, theoretically speaking, in theory it...
- We'll see, yes.
- Of course.
Actually, these are the companies that have bid for the contract to build the holding tanks at the downstream end of the wadi.
- Shall we go through these?
- Now?
Yes, we could go through them now.
Well, we could work and eat, no?
Yes, I...
Yes, all right, then.
- This one's from...
- Before that, cheers.
- Cheers.
- Very bad luck with water.
Some people think it's bad luck.
- EWB...
- Sorry.
Excuse me.
It's the barracks.
It's Robert.
- Sorry.
- No.
Go on.
- Hello.
- Go ahead.
Hello?
Yes?
What?
What?
Are you all right, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
He's missing in action.
What does that mean?
- Come upstairs and we'll get you your...
- No, I just need a minute.
Hello.
My name's Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Well, I only knew him for three weeks, but I am Robert's girlfriend.
I was wondering if you knew anything...
Of course.
Yes.
Sorry, Mrs. Mayers.
Yes, I...
Yes, of course.
Goodbye.
You've reached Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Leave a message after the beep.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, it's Dr. Jones here.
Please forgive me for calling you on your home number.
I was at something of a loss.
I realize that this has not been an easy week for you, but I was wondering when you might be coming back into the office.
I had a very productive meeting with the engineers from British Oxygen Company and, well, there's a lot of data coming in.
Really a considerable amount.
I'm sure I don't have to remind you that we are working to a deadline.
Time and tide, as I am sure you are aware, waits for no man.
Or woman.
Anyway, I look fon/vard to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
Goodbye.
Can I come in?
Why?
Well, you might get cold.
- Very nice.
- What?
Your flat.
Very pleasant.
Look, I'm not...
I'm not coming into work, all right, because I need to stay here.
I need to be here in case there's news.
So, actually, anyone with a shred of understanding, or humanity, or simple feeling, who, frankly, wasn't suffering from some kind of Asperger's, would know that the last thing that I need
is your bullying little phone call asking me to come into work so that you can update me on fish.
You want to fill me in on fishing.
Well, Dr. Jones, you can take your work and you can shove it up your unfeeling arse.
I didn't come here to talk to you about work.
Then why are you here?
I made you a sandwich.
Why?
You're probably not eating.
Are you?
No.
You see, it's very important.
You must eat something.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Here.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do because...
I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
Call me Fred.
Just call me Fred.
- You're all right now?
- Yeah.
You all right?
- Sorry.
- No, dont
Why don't I get a plate and we...
You can put this on a plate.
- Shall I do it?
- No, it's okay.
I'll do it.
I'm so sorry about what I said before.
That is just unforgivable.
The great thing about people with Asperger's is it's very difficult to hurt their feelings.
So it's all right, you can say whatever you like.
You don't have...
You know, I was upset.
And rightly so.
Look, I took the liberty of buying a wee bottle of wine.
Now, I hope you don't mind.
I know it's not the weekend, but this one goes very well with duck.
I'm not very hungry.
Harriet, you've got to try and eat...
Is it all right...
Is it all right for me to call you Harriet?
My father is...
He's ex-Army, so he's like very stiff upper lip and don't make a fuss about anything, but I'm more of a gusher.
I think that's his word for me, anyway.
My upper lip's never been very stiff, I'm afraid.
But you still have a boyfriend.
I mean, I don't know a great deal about such things, but...
Robert hasn't been listed as being dead, has he?
No.
But I just feel that "missing in action" is Army-speak for...
Dead?
No.
No, as a civil servant, I happen to know that the Ministry of Defense absolutely hate uncertainty of any kind.
If he were dead, they would simply say "dead."
Can you stop using that word, please?
- I beg your pardon.
- It's okay.
They say that they'll call when there's news.
But they don't, so I guess there isn't.
Come to the Yemen.
We're leaving tomorrow, just for a few days.
- Geological studies, engineering surveys.
- No.
We even have a team of archeologists checking we're not about to submerge the Ark of the Covenant, which would be unfortunate, you know.
No, I can't leave because there might be news and...
Well, then, you'll fly back on the sheikh's private jet immediately.
Why would he do that?
Because I asked him to.
Your services are very highly valued by the sheikh, and by me.
The project really can't do without you.
Who the hell cares?
Project?
I mean, it's fishing.
You know, who the hell cares?
Well, strangely enough, I do.
I mean, I know it's probably just a terrible folly, but, still, I can't help sometimes imagining that this crazy enterprise might just come off.
You know, with a bit of luck and with the right people.
And you, you are most definitely, most definitely one of the most rightest people that I've had the good fortune to come across.
If you'll forgive the grammatical inadequacies of that sentence.
Do you sometimes think that maybe we're just part of a lavish practical joke?
What do you mean?
Salmon, here?
Yes, I'm beginning to suppose that.
I don't know anyone that goes to church anymore.
I don't think I do, either.
On a Sunday, we go to Target.
You know, this gravel here is perfect for salmon to lay their eggs in between.
Who'd have thought that here in the middle of the Yemen, perfect spawning grounds for salmon?
Fred, look.
What?
Yes.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Harriet, the water.
- It's beautiful.
- It's cold.
The water in her well is cold.
Oh, my goodness.
It's really happening, Fred.
Oh, my goodness, it really is.
Unbelievable.
These men, they say that by bringing water, life, to this desert,
I am bringing the Western ways to our land.
They say I have insulted God himself.
I say they are fools.
A thousand apologies, my friends.
Please, this is not a way to introduce you to our great enterprise.
Look.
Is it not magnificent?
It's beautiful.
Certainly is.
Bloody amazing.
- Hello.
- Hello.
For the last time, Sugden, there is absolutely no way I can get you these fish.
Tom, this comes from the top.
The very top.
I don't care if God's taken up fly fishing.
Now, I suggest you make this work, Tom.
Is that a threat, Sugden?
These are difficult days, Tom.
Cuts.
Cuts everywhere.
I don't know.
Is the Environment Agency a frontline service?
That is a threat.
See it as an opportunity.
Well, then.
An opportunity.
Hilary, get me Matthew Sweet from Fly Fishing Monthly, will you?
That's all I've been told, and so I...
Okay.
All right, then.
Well, please, please, please call me when...
Okay.
Bye.
I'm so sorry.
Did I wake you up?
No.
No, no.
News?
No.
No, I was just leaving a message on Robert's phone which is ridiculous because he hasn't got his phone with him.
And I know that.
Just turning into a madwoman.
No.
No, when things get tricky in my life, I talk to my fish.
I have a pond.
Talking to an answering machine is no madder than chatting to koi carp.
I just somehow wouldn't associate you with having a tricky life.
Well, it wouldn't do to talk about your emotions with a colleague, would it, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
No, I think...
I think things are beyond tricky, really.
They have been for some time.
Mary's in Geneva.
I'm here.
The koi carp are alone in Surrey.
We got married very young.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't really know things were hard.
No, don't apologize.
There's always hope.
For me and for you.
Do you know, I can't even remember what he looks like.
Not exactly.
But I'm stuck, and I can't move on.
Does that make any sense?
Yes.
Totally.
I feel a bit like I've been stuck for years.
Yes, but you can move on.
Well, I suppose in theory.
You should be happy, Fred.
I knew you'd have a pond.
The traitor has had his chance.
You know what to do.
Do not fail us.
I think the idea of taking Scottish salmon to a foreign country is absolutely absurd.
These fish have been running these rivers for tens of thousands of years.
I've fished the rivers of Scotland all my life.
Yes, Prime Minister.
It would appear that the gentle fisherfolk are not so effing gentle after all.
...rape and pillage of our national rivers...
What, ditch the whole thing?
No.
No, no, no, Prime Minister.
No, we mustjust find the fish somewhere bloody else.
Your turrets are blocking my reception.
Well, I'm terribly sorry about that, madam.
If you'd care to follow me, please.
Mrs. Maxwell.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- It's an honor.
Happy birthday, Patricia.
Yes, we could do with a few more like you in Cabinet.
Very good, Your Excellency.
I'm grateful, indeed, that you could spare some time for our little project.
Yes.
Well, we have gone out on a bit of a limb for you, Your Excellency, but the Prime Minister does love his fishing.
- Really?
- Yes.
Rod's never out of his hand.
Anyway, down to business.
The fish.
The salmon.
We're not gonna get it out of British waters.
There's a bloody big fuss about it, as no doubt you've heard.
Don't know what it is about fishing.
Anyway, no-goer.
- Yes, but I thought...
- However,
I have solved your problem.
See?
There must be thousands in this one alone.
This guy's got four fish farms up and down the coast.
Stocks all the Tescos.
Right under your nose.
These fish were bred for the dinner table.
It's barbaric.
They've never run in their lives.
Neither have their forebears for two generations.
Why would they run for us?
...the difference in these salmon...
We'd open the sluices and they would just drift off downstream never to be seen again.
Well, get a couple of days fishing out of it, then just re-stock or whatever the word is.
Seems to be no shortage of them.
...In transit for the supermarkets.
These fish will never run.
They're just not right.
Not right?
Well, a fish is a fish is a fish, isn't it?
No.
You see, Mrs. Maxwell, I have a vision.
Tired, bloated pretenders are not part of this vision.
Well, unfortunately, Her Majesty's Government also has a vision, and that vision is farmed fish or no fish.
Then I must thank you for your precious time.
And decline.
No advisers, either.
Back at your desk on Monday, Fred.
Well, in that case, I resign.
Resignation accepted.
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.
So, this leaves us with what?
Well, with no salmon.
We must have faith, Dr. Alfred.
Well, that's a very laudable sentiment, Your Excellency, but we're running out of time.
Can't catch faith with a fishing rod.
Hello, Fred.
Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I didn't think he looked right, that man.
And he pulled out a gun!
Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Alfred.
Thank you very much.
Don't be silly.
Don't be silly.
It was only a cast, really.
A very good cast.
An essential cast, one might say.
Yes, I suppose one might say that.
- Here.
- My God, Fred.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
It was very quick.
It was over in a flash, really.
How did you do that?
I did a right-handed snake roll.
Did I get him?
Yes, it was extraordinary.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you very much.
Please, continue your work as if nothing had happened.
Of course, of course.
I owe you my life.
No.
Please, come on.
Anyone would have...
This is not one of those British metaphors, Dr. Alfred.
The debt will be repaid.
- Bye, now.
- Goodbye.
Bye.
In response to the Right Honorable Member's question of the 7th of last month, the Ministry of Defense can now confirm that an engagement by British Special Forces against known terrorists did occur on the 13th of September.
The details of this operation are classified.
However, I am at liberty to say that serious casualties were incurred by the British forces.
I deeply regret to inform the House that there were no survivors.
An internal investigation is being carried out.
Sorry to wake you up.
- No, don't be.
- It's just...
It's okay.
It's just...
I just never got the chance to really know him.
Mary?
Fred?
There you are.
I had no idea you were...
I got a day off and thought, "Why not surprise him?"
I've got this wonderful Swiss mountain Comté from a little shop round the corner in Geneva.
Is everything all right, Fred?
Where's your suit and tie?
Day off?
I resigned.
Don't be ridiculous.
You've resigned?
What about your pension?
It's final salary.
Well, the government pulled out of the salmon fishing project and we'd put a lot of time and energy into it.
I didn't want to walk away from that.
Well?
Well, everyone involved.
I'm still being paid, if that's what you're worried about.
Fitzharris Price have been more than...
I might have known she'd be involved.
If you're referring to Harriet, we're working on the project together.
Of course she's involved.
- Harriet?
- What do you mean exactly by that, Mary?
I've seen her photograph on the Fitzharris Price website.
You're making a fool of yourself.
Now it's you that's being ridiculous.
Am I'?
I'm not the one abandoning a decent, highly respected job for a joke fishing project and a short-skirted office girl.
- She's not an office girl.
- What is she, then, Fred?
Hey?
Just what is she?
She's a colleague.
- She's a very talented colleague and...
- And?
And a friend!
She's just a friend!
Are you in love with her?
I've done nothing, Mary.
I have no expectations.
I didn't ask about your expectations.
I asked if you were in love with her.
This is a mid-life crisis.
It's textbook, it's pathetic.
I'm so sorry, Mary.
You'll be back, Fred.
Or you'll try.
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
You'd think a bloody scientist would know that much!
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
We don't need native river fish.
We'll be all right with farmed salmon.
I know.
I don't much like them, but...
Well, they will run.
I know it.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Despite our moral and philosophical objections, farmed salmon will run.
I'm absolutely sure of it.
You are tireless, Doctor.
You have uncovered some new research?
A new paper, perhaps?
No, I just know it.
You just know it.
I see.
Faith, Dr. Alfred.
Damn it.
Yes, all right, then, faith.
So?
They're alive.
That hurts!
Sorry, sweetie.
- Mrs. Maxwell?
- What?
Amazing news.
One of the officers presumed dead,
Captain Robert Mayers, has been found alive.
- Good.
- Yes, we're very pleased.
Yes, very good.
It's very good news for the family.
And his girlfriend, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who else knows about this?
You're the first to know.
Right, keep it that way.
Total press embargo.
Do you understand?
- Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
- That salmon fishing thing.
Is that still happening?
As far as I'm aware.
- It is?
- Yes.
- Yemen?
- Yes.
Perfect.
Yes, this is all coming together very nicely.
I intended to create a small miracle.
Something to glorify God and bring our tribes together.
Sometimes I wonder if we haven't created something that glorifies man.
It is a very fine line.
Hubris, Dr. Alfred.
Hubris.
- It's nice here.
- Beautiful.
You know, Fred, this project, it saved me.
I think.
You know, with everything that happened.
So those farmed fish had better run.
- I believe they will.
- You do?
Yes, I believe that it's in the very core of their being to head upstream even if they never have, even if the parent fish never have.
Look at this.
Look at that.
Mary said something about me.
She said that I was genetically programmed to return to a dull pedestrian life with her.
That it was in my DNA.
Do you think that you are?
No.
No, I belong here.
I always have done.
- Harriet.
- Yes.
I was wondering about you and me.
The theoretical possibility in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is a theoretical possibility.
Obviously.
Or salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Yes.
- Yes?
- Yes.
I just need a little time.
Of course, of course.
All the time you want.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Mr. Foreign Secretary.
- Brian Fleet.
The great fisherman.
The great...
Well, it has been a little while, to be honest.
A bit rusty, you know.
Some skills are never forgotten.
Please, follow this man to your tent.
I shall join you shortly.
What have you been saying?
Fishing's the last thing anyone's gonna be interested in, trust me.
Get ready for the photo op of a lifetime, Sonny Jim.
N-S-R.
No salmon required.
Is that a Woolly Jones?
No, this is a new one I've invented.
IS it?
What's it called?
This one is called the Chetwode-Talbot Beauty.
That's very nice.
It's true.
You're not being funny?
No, I don't have a sense of humor, as you recall.
That is true.
- Beautiful.
- Yes, she is.
Here.
Thank you.
Don't you think we should be doing something, Fred?
Preparing?
L am preparing-
Well, for the whole thing, you know.
Everything's done, Harriet, it's fine.
Just relax.
Did you just...
Dr. Alfred Jones just told me to relax.
What is the world coming to?
Oh, my God.
Harriet.
Right, Harriet and Robert...
Right, okay.
Shut up, hacks.
No military stuff.
It's classified.
Anyway, I don't think you'd understand it.
The only thing you need to know is that this man, Captain Mayers here, is a war hero.
Human interest stuff only.
Sir.
Harriet, can you tell us how it feels?
It feels like it's a...
It's a...
It's a shock, but it's wonderful.
Please can we have a kiss?
Go on.
Come on.
I am sorry, my friend.
No
- No, it's- - -
It's a miracle.
Indeed.
Nevertheless, I'm sorry.
All right, gentlemen, gentlemen, I think that's all.
A little privacy for the couple, please.
I'd just like to say that the British government is proud to have played a small but significant part in this extraordinary reunion of Harriet and Captain Mayers.
That's what we're here for.
This is strange.
Bad strange?
No, good strange.
Do you mind if we don't...
No, of course not.
There's no rush.
Will you just hold me?
How did you get caught up in this, H?
Salmon fishing out here?
It's ridiculous.
Well, you never know with the sheikh.
I expect there will be a six-star hotel and a golf course before you know it.
That's not his style at all.
Don't you believe it.
He's gotta make his money back somehow.
They're no fools, these Arabs.
You don't sleep, either?
No, not much.
Well...
At least there's no bloody journos around at this time, anyway.
You've been very good to Harriet, Fred.
I appreciate it.
I love her.
Yeah, she's great.
She's really great.
No.
I love her.
Does she love you?
I don't know now.
Yesterday, you weren't alive.
Well, I apologize for not being dead in a ditch.
I don't think I can accept your apology.
Is that a joke?
Yes, yes, sort of.
I'm not...
I've never been very good at jokes.
It's all right, Robert.
Really.
It's all right.
The day has arrived.
Before the dam, this was a dry riverbed.
And now, as you all can see, we have water.
And today, we hope we shall discover the one missing thing.
So, thank you, one and all, for coming as not one of you, not even my dear self, knows if this curious experiment of mine will actually work.
It better had bloody work.
Doesn't matter if it works or not, dolly.
All that matters is you.
Fishing on Sky tonight with our war hero.
- I haven't done this in years.
- For God's sake.
There are 10,000 fish in there.
If you can't hook one of them, you can just flip off back to Transport.
My intention is to color this desert in green.
Make an agricultural industry for my people, and the sons and daughters of my people for generations to come.
- Right on cue.
- So here we are,
Muslims, Christians and the odd heathen.
We are all gathered here in an act of faith.
And why not?
And now, the moment that we are all waiting for, the fruits of all our efforts.
The moment of truth.
Open the sluices.
Where's it going?
It's going the wrong way.
It's heading downstream.
Wait a minute.
It's turned around.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
- Look, they're going upstream.
- Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, my God, they're running.
Fred, look.
Look!
- They're running, Fred!
- They're running!
Blondie.
Come down here, come on.
Come down here now.
Look, we ought to get a picture of him with the sheikh.
- It's working, Your Excellency.
- It is.
They are running upstream, look!
Let's go fishing, Dr. Alfred.
Turn it on, dolly.
I need to get further out.
For God's sakes.
Come on, off you go!
Have you got that?
Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
But can we get them closer together?
God, I'll give it a go.
Robert, darling.
Can you come...
Can you turn around a bit?
I'm worried about what he's doing with his rod.
Lovely.
And, Brian, just a nice smile, that would be good.
Did you get that?
God, he's useless, isn't he?
More fun without waders, Dr. Alfred.
Yes.
I think I caught one, Dr. Alfred.
It's a beauty, Your Excellency.
Look out behind you!
Your Excellency, behind you!
Step UP-
No, you first!
I repay my debts, Dr. Alfred.
- Okay.
I'll pull you up.
After...
- Okay.
Here, Your Excellency, hold on.
Here, come on.
We won't need these anymore.
I just don't understand who would do this.
Why would they do this?
I know who.
And I know why.
Can't you find them?
Arrest them?
What for?
Jusfice.
Jusfice.
I think these destroyers...
Bad men, certainly.
But I think perhaps they have a point.
I expected people to understand what we were doing here.
I expected them to see that it was really not about fishing at all.
In the end, I asked for too much.
Will you try again?
The question is "Will we try again?"
This was ours.
Yes, I think maybe Robert wants to go home.
So, I don't...
I don't know.
Does home call, Dr. Fred?
I don't really have a home anymore.
There was a moment when I had everything, but...
Well, now I don't know what to do.
When the time comes, you will know.
Well, until then.
Thank you.
Just gonna say goodbye to Fred.
Are you sure?
Sorry?
Listen, Harriet.
When I was in the desert, the only thing that kept me going was the thought of you.
You don't owe me anything.
I want you to understand that.
So...
We're going.
I'm so sorry, Fred.
It was an extraordinary idea.
It almost worked, too.
I wasn't talking about the project.
No, I'm not sure that I was.
I never meant to hurt you like this.
It's not your fault.
I don't know what to do.
I can't help you there, I'm afraid.
Are you going to stay?
Stay for what?
There's nothing here anymore.
Not you, not a single fish left in the river.
Well, someone's gonna have to make a move.
Good luck, Harriet.
Dr. Alfred, look!
They're alive!
I'm going to stay.
I want to start again.
I'll do it on my own if I have to.
I'll start small, though, this time.
A different approach.
Just a few fish to begin with.
Involve the local community more.
Make it their project, not ours.
That's the way to protect it.
Do you need an assistant, Dr. Jones?
Well, I suppose I will.
I'm sure the sheikh has somebody that...
An assistant?
A partner.
A partner.
Yes, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
More than anything.
Dear Dr. Jones,
I act on behalf of a client with access to very substantial funds who has indicated a desire to sponsor a project to introduce salmon and the sport of salmon fishing into the Yemen.
I would like to seek a meeting with you to identify how this challenging project might be initiated and resourced.
I might add that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office supports the project as a symbol of Anglo-Yemeni cooperation.
Yours sincerely, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Ms.
Fitzharris Price Investment Consultants.
Night.
Have a good evening.
You, too.
Say hi to soldier boy.
We're just friends, you know.
We've only met a couple of times.
- Yeah, you tell me that on Monday.
- Shut up.
- Hello.
- Hi.
It's great to see you.
- Yes.
Me, too.
Sorry.
- Yes?
- Yes.
- You, too.
- No, "Yes" is a start, that's fine.
- Stop it, I'm so nervous.
Why are you nervous?
I don't know.
I'm trying to be very sophisticated and grown-up.
Right.
No, grown-up, absolutely.
Quite right, yeah.
- Harriet.
- Yes?
Last one to the restaurant pays.
What?
You bastard.
Dear Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, thank you for your e-mail.
As a fisheries specialist, permit me a word or two about salmon.
Migratory salmonoids require cool, well-oxygenated water in which to spawn.
In addition, in the early stages of the salmon's life cycle, a good supply of fly life indigenous to the northern European rivers is necessary for the juvenile salmon, or parr, to survive.
Some considerable distance from the Indian Ocean, or indeed the Red Sea, as I am sure you are aware, though apparently not the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
We conclude that conditions in the Yemen make this project unfeasible.
Fundamentally unfeasible.
Yes, yes.
Fundamentally unfeasible.
We therefore regret that we are unable to help you any further in this matter.
Yours, Alfred Jones, Doctor.
I've put duck liver pate in your sandwich.
That's lovely.
Righto.
I'm off to bed.
Already?
- Airport car's coming at 5:00.
- Righto.
I'll maybe have another wee pass at the caddis fly paper.
You could read it on the airplane.
Up to my ear in reports, darling.
I'll read it when I'm back.
Right, then.
Good night.
Oh, my God, I don't do this.
I don't do this.
No, I can tell.
I haven't done this in a really long time.
- Okay.
- I'm so shy.
- Okay.
No, I'll sleep on the sofa.
- No, I'm so shy.
Look, Harriet, I mean it.
I...
Shut up.
You were saying.
You're shy.
I am shy and quiet.
Like Hitler.
I'm serious.
Robert, I...
Don't do this and then forget me.
I just don't wanna be an army barracks joke in the morning.
Please be nice to me.
Harriet, I'm serious, too.
I mean it.
So if you want me to sleep on the sofa, then I'll...
If you say, Captain Mayers, one more time you'll sleep on the sofa, you'll bloody well sleep on the sofa.
Captain Robert Mayers, 3-6-4-7-7-2.
Maxwell.
Better be good.
Mrs. Maxwell, we have a situation.
- What?
- Code Red in Afghanistan.
Go to sleep.
Tell me that's not a mosque.
Well, it is a religious establishment...
- Of course it's a bloody mosque!
- Well, of course...
- What's up?
- Go to sleep.
- ...make this a joint operation.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The British have absolutely nothing to do with this whatsoever.
And I want every single man, woman, child and goat in Afghanistan to know that.
My God, I didn't think we could make the war in Afghanistan any less popular, but, hey, even I can be wrong.
We'll have Vera Lynn strapping on her suicide belt in sympathy next.
Bravo, the bloody Marines.
Right, you lot.
We need a good news story from the Middle East, a big one.
And we need it now.
You've got an hour, get on with it.
Good news, eh?
New girl band, Middle East tour.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Touch my body No, no...
Okay...
Maybe not.
No.
British trans-Arabian rally.
For God's sake.
Come on, come on.
Come up with something.
What's this?
A project to introduce salmon fishing to the Yemen.
Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Is that the best you puffed-up Oxbridge-educated moronic buffoons can come up with?
Yes?
Yes, Prime Minister.
Well, no, I'm working on it right now.
I think I may have come up with something that you'll like.
Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing.
Are you dollies trying to get me fired?
Well, here we go.
Fish it is.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Hello.
Mrs. Maxwell on line one, sir.
Busy.
She says it's urgent, sir.
Maxwell who?
The press officer to the Prime Minister, sir.
Patricia.
They haven't pensioned you off yet, then?
Listen, I got the heads-up from the FCO about this salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Fancy it?
- Well, I...
- We do.
Chasing a good news story out of the Middle East.
Anglo-Yemeni relations back on track.
Arab-Western cultural détente through the ancient sport of yanking poor sodding fish out of rivers.
What do you reckon?
Well, it's a bit of a long shot, to be honest.
Well, don't be honest.
Lunatic's an oil sheikh.
Got money pouring out of his arse.
Good friend of the West.
Good friend of the Party, too, so give it a go, eh, dolly?
Well, we'll certainly bend every sinew to the job, Patricia.
I'll set up a working party immediately.
- What?
- Hey!
Don't you "working party" me, you short-arsed little pen-pusher.
I did not say kick it into the long grass.
I said do it!
Yes, Patricia.
Right... away.
Mr. Jones?
Morning, Mr. Jones.
Good morning, Betty.
I trust you had a nice weekend.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Jones.
Mr. Sugden would like a word.
Would he indeed?
What do you think of that?
It's for the caddis fly report.
Need something racy for the cover.
Something to rev up the YouTube generation.
I know it's not quite what we would expect from a scientific paper, but we must keep up with the times, Mrs. Burnside.
Mr. Sugden asked to see you, Mr. Jones.
I'm not too sure that I don't have a picture of a caddis being eaten alive by a spider somewhere.
There it is.
That's a beauty.
What do you think about that for...
Good God.
Little too much, do you think?
No, not if you're making a horror film.
Look, this e-mail about the salmon thing.
Yes.
Did I miss April Fools' Day or something?
Did you like my little swipe at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wonks?
Yeah, well, I just had another e-mail from the FCO today.
Rattle their cage, did I?
Look, you wouldn't take a meeting with her, would you?
This Chetwode-Talbot woman.
She represents this Sheikh Muhammed bloke.
Why would I want to do that?
Why would I want to traipse across London to discuss that nonsense?
I've very important work to do here, as you can very well see.
Yeah, well, the FCO, in their infinite W, feel that a meeting on this is important business, too, Alfred.
Lord, the tendrils of this busybody government.
Dr. Jones, as your Operational Line Manager,
I am asking you with extreme prejudice to take a meeting with Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
I take it that's an order?
Take it how you wish.
Nazi.
Wanker.
Morning.
Dr. Jones?
Miss Chetwode-Talbot is expecting me.
Yes, it's a bit of a mouthful.
Do call me Harriet.
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Do you want to come with me?
Yes.
Do come in.
Please, sit down.
Yeah, anywhere you like.
Would you like tea or coffee?
No, thank you.
So...
Fitzharris Price represent the sheikh's assets in this country, including a number of estates in Scotland.
He's a very keen fisherman, so he asked us if we would...
- Water.
- Sorry?
Water, Miss Chetwode-Talbot.
H2O.
Do you want sparkling or still?
Not for me, for the fish.
Fish require water.
You are familiar with that concept?
Yes.
I am, yes.
So, to save us both a lot of time, let me keep this brief and simple.
Here it's very cold.
It rains a lot.
Here it's very hot.
It doesn't rain a lot.
Do you see the difference?
Well, you're pointing to Saudi Arabia, Dr. Jones, not the Yemen.
You seem to be deliberately missing the point.
With respect, not really.
You see, unlike Saudi Arabia, parts of the Yemen get up to 250 millimeters of rainfall a month in the wet season.
It gets the edge of the monsoon, you see.
And the dry season?
Well, interestingly, recent oil explorations have uncovered a number of very large freshwater aquifers, which could sort of recharge the wadi in the dry season using a dam.
I'm sure they could.
So, when he's built his dam, why don't you get back to me then?
Completed, couple of years ago.
Long-term plan is to irrigate thousands of acres of desert.
We could grow watermelons, maize, cotton.
Now you're going to tell me it isn't hot in the Yemen, too, aren't you?
Well, in the mountainous areas, the nighttime temperatures get down to well below 20 Celsius.
And, of course, I defer to your expert knowledge, Dr. Jones, but I do believe that Pacific salmon get as far south as California.
Temperatures are not too dissimilar there.
- Water.
- For the fish.
- No, for me.
- Of course.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Yes, Dr. Jones?
This is plainly ridiculous.
There's just no way that salmon can survive in those sort of environments.
If your sheikh wants to pour his money down the drain, why doesn't he buy himself a football club or something?
Look, Dr. Jones.
I don't really think it's my place to explain the sheikh's motivations.
But I will say this, that of all of our wealthy clients, he is different.
I would go so far as to describe him as a visionary man.
- A visionary?
- Yes, I know, it's not a very fashionable word, but if you decide to take this project with us, then you can judge for yourself when you meet him.
My line manager asked me to come here and take this meeting to discuss your project and that I have done.
I thank you for your time, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
I'll see myself out.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Did you get my e-mail?
Yes.
What did it say?
Took the meeting.
Waste of time, as predicted.
Now, if you don't mind, I'll get back to my work.
Dr. Jones.
What is this?
P45.
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't understand.
Well, a P45 is the official document given to an employee when his services are no longer required by his, or her, employer.
Yes, but, Bernard, this has got my...
Or you can sign this letter stating that you are delighted to assign yourself, exclusively, to the Yemeni salmon fishing project with immediate effect.
It's up to you.
But, Bernard, you know as well as I do this thing is a bloody joke.
There's no way you can get salmon that far up a...
Just there.
This is blackmail, Sugden.
This is a bloody outrage.
Fitzharris Price will be paying your salary while on secondment.
Almost double what it is now.
I'd say that's a bloody outrage.
Double?
Can I have time to think about this?
Nope.
- Can I borrow your pen?
- No.
It's my special one with the italic nib.
Hey.
Hold it, hold it.
Hold it.
Brian, what...
What have you got in bar seven?
I should have resigned.
You can't afford to resign.
Matter of principle.
I have a standing in the scientific community, Mary.
A reputation.
You have a mortgage.
Two, three, four.
Maybe I should resign.
We could have a baby.
Why not?
You could stay on at work and I could bring up the nipper.
I could take him to the park and to school.
I could take him fishing.
What do you think?
They're really losing the plot in Geneva.
One minute they're buying Euros, the next minute they can't ditch them fast enough for dollars.
They're panicking, and guess who they want to bail them out.
I can't imagine.
Say a command.
- Shut up.
- Say a command.
What were you shouting about back there?
Nothing.
Say a command.
Mar)'...
Oh, Lord.
Well, that should do you for a while.
Thank you, Mary.
Good night.
Night, dear.
Oh, Jesus.
Good morning.
Yes, Staff.
I've gotta go.
Now?
Yeah.
That was the call.
Sorry.
Is it Afghanistan?
It's somewhere sandy, that's for sure.
- I'll go get some tea.
- No, look...
- No, it's all right, Robert.
It's...
- No, no, come here.
Look, the last few weeks...
This is good.
Wonderful.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.
Will you wait for me?
Now go get that tea.
You bastard.
Well, firstly, we would need to trap 10,000 salmon from the North Sea, for the sake of argument, get them to the Yemen alive, don't ask me how, where they would be deposited in temperature and oxygen-controlled holding tanks built into a wadi
that would, hallelujah, open during the rainy season, allowing the salmon to migrate upstream for, say, 10 kilometers, which would allow your sheikh to hoick them out of the water to his heart's content.
Of course, until the dry season, when they will all
die.
Well, unless we feed the wadi all year round using the dam.
Of course.
Stupid idiot man.
Why not use precious water resources to support one man's sport fishing?
So, now that we have year-round water, why not build some gravel spawning grounds, breed the world's first Arabian salmon, and teach the clever fellows to migrate to the Indian Ocean...
Wonderful, wonderful idea.
Singing, "Step we gaily, here we go.
Heel for heel and toe for toe."
Rough cost?
Cost?
Cost.
Forty million.
No, 45...
- Fifty million.
- Dollars?
- Dollars.
- Dollars.
Or pounds.
Pounds.
At least.
So it's theoretically possible?
Well, it's theoretically possible in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is theoretically possible.
It's very impressive, Dr. Jones.
No, it's not.
It's nonsense.
Look, I just made it all up.
No, the drawing.
Real talent, if I might say so.
Excellent start.
So I suppose we should just crack on and get things started now?
You can't hold me to this.
I mean, these are just random ideas.
I mean, this is a sort of joke.
Well, I'm sure you wouldn't joke about a 50-million-pound project, Dr. Jones.
Not when you're in charge of it.
Well, the sheikh is so looking forward to meeting you, and he'll be back in the next couple of weeks.
So, in the meantime, is there anything else that I can do for you?
Well, as a matter of fact, there is.
Could you arrange a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
The one in China?
Is there another?
British Oxygen Company.
A meeting with them as well.
And then, what are those great big transport aircraft called?
The big Russian military...
Antonovs.
Find out about renting two of those, one for the fish and one to carry all the money that we're going to need.
When that's done, I'd be delighted to start working.
Good day, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good day, Dr. Jones.
Mary!
Up here.
Boy, did I put a hurricane up that Chetwode-Talbot woman.
You would have laughed.
I told her I wanted a meeting with the Three Gorges Dam team from...
Where are you going?
Geneva.
I told you.
You didn't say now.
Well, I am.
Tomorrow.
Well, how long are you going for?
Six weeks, to start with.
Six weeks?
There's no need to shout.
Six weeks, though, Mary.
This is a big chance for me.
I'll be heading up the whole operation.
Well, you could say "Congratulations."
Great.
Enough is enough.
It's job or marriage.
You've got to make a decision and make it now, God damn it.
There are planes, you know, Fred.
And I get Sundays off.
Mostly.
You can get all your horrible old fishing stuff out again.
Didn't even ask me.
Just went and did it.
I know.
I'm sorry.
It just suddenly seemed like the right decision.
Maybe for both of us.
Fred, I don't want to leave on bad terms.
No.
No.
I'll open a bottle of something fizzy.
Okay?
Reports are coming in from Afghanistan of a British soldier killed while on duty in Helmand Province.
An improvised explosive device detonated during a routine search in a local village.
This...
The Minister for Culture 's been photographed doing what?
Naked or clothed?
Boy or girl?
How old?
Jesus.
Well, at least she's legal.
Press statement from us saying that we're a party of policy not personality, concentrating on the real issues of getting this country back on track in times of economic hardship and not tabloid sensationalism, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Meanwhile, get the useless arse on the front page of every paper apologizing for being born, big spread in Hello!
with blonde forgiving wife and cute kids.
If they're not cute, find a horse or something.
Joshua!
Hood.
Don't you suck your teeth at me, young man.
I'm not one of your bitches from the Baltimore low-rises.
You feel me?
I'm your fucking mother!
Got to go.
Meeting.
Dear Dr. Jones, the sheikh has requested your company at his estate in Glen Tulloch to discuss the salmon project further.
Please advise which dates would suit you best.
Many thanks, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Fitzharris Price.
Mr. Sugden would like to see you in the canteen, sir.
Up his arse with a meter ruler.
Thanks, Betty.
- Which one is he?
- Over here.
Fred.
Can I introduce Patricia Maxwell?
She is the Prime Minister's press officer.
Hello.
Fifty million from Sheikh Muhammed thingammy.
It's the first-stage payment on research development for the salmon fishing project.
The PM's keeping a close eye on this one.
It's just what we need right now, a bit of Anglo-Arab news that isn't about things that explode.
I want to know, is it a goer?
Goer?
Well, look, the complexities.
I mean, I barely know even where to begin, but, well, just for starters, we would need 10,000 live salmon.
Is 10,000 salmon a lot?
Well, if they're to come from British waters, and I don't see where else they're gonna come from.
I mean, you would need the permission of the Environment Agency.
That's your job, Bernard.
Okay, so you get on to the EA and get this man his salmon.
- Miss Maxwell.
Ms.
- Mrs. Happily married.
Details in Who's Who.
Mrs. Maxwell, there are two million fishermen in the UK who are, I would say, unusually protective of...
How many?
- Two million.
- Two million?
- Yes.
- Bloody hell.
Two million out there waving their little rods around?
Are they the kind that vote our way?
They vote for those that best look after their fish, in my experience.
I bet they do, I bet they do.
Right, so, Prime Minister on the front cover of Fishy Weekly or whatever.
Best friend of the British fisherfolk.
Spearing a leaping salmon.
I like this.
I like it a lo'[.
They do have magazines, these people?
They can read?
Aye, the Angling Times, Trout and Salmon,
Coarse Fishing Monthly, Bassmania.
Bassmania?
Marvelous.
Marvelous.
That's marvelous.
This has just become a priority project.
Anything I can do, just give me a call.
Two million.
God, men, what a species.
I don't think she got the right end of the stick there.
Your call, I think, Bernard.
Ten thousand native Atlantic salmon on my desk by Friday, please.
Yeah, well, you'd just better come through on this, Jones.
It's been a long time since I was back.
- Yes?
- A long time.
You see?
- Is that where he lives?
- Yes.
He has many estates, but this one's his favorite.
- May I present Malcolm, the butler.
- Hello.
- This is Dr. Jones.
- Welcome to Glen Tulloch, sir.
His Excellency thought you might like to avail yourself of the fishing while you're waiting.
Thank you very much.
May I present Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama.
This is Dr. Jones.
It's a great pleasure to meet you, Your Excellency.
To meet the creator of the Woolly Jones, the pleasure's all mine, sir.
That's very kind.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, do you realize that for more than 10 years
I have fished with a Woolly Jones?
Really?
What's a Woolly Jones?
Dr. Jones invented a famous fly.
Well, it's a sentimental habit that some fly-tiers have of calling a fly after...
Anyway, I don't approve of that sort of thing normally, but...
Woolly Jones.
It's a great name.
A bloody good fly, that's for sure.
Please allow me to show you a delightful lie just around the corner.
Absolutely.
Lead on.
You think I'm mad?
- No, Your Excellency.
I...
- Of course you do.
I would question your judgment if you did not.
Though I have judgment enough to know that under there lies a fish much cleverer than I.
I'm a great admirer of the British for many reasons, but still there are mysteries to me.
The rich are frightened of the poor.
The poor are frightened of the rich.
And even your politicians, they try to sound like the people on the EastEnders.
A wonderful program, but still.
Yes, the great British class system.
Indeed.
But fishermen, I have noticed, they don't care whether I'm brown or white, rich or poor, wearing robes or waders.
All they care about is the fish, the river and the game we play.
For fishermen, the only virtues are patience, tolerance and humility.
I like this.
You are struck dumb by my naivety, Dr. Alfred.
No, you're on.
- What?
- You're on.
- This is a sign.
- A sign?
A sign that I should stop talking bollocks and fish.
Come here.
- Nicely done, sir.
- Thank you.
Very nicely done.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Hello, Dr. Jones.
Is that yours?
- The dress.
- Yes.
This is not mine.
It suits you very well.
Thank you.
They seem to know my size.
That not strike you as a wee bit sinister?
The idea of the sheikh's tailor tracking me across London with some kind of satellite measuring device?
They asked me for your size.
And I took a guess.
Well, for future reference,
I have a 32-inch waist, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
- Right.
- Not a 34.
No pies for me.
Note taken, sorry about that.
Thank you.
Ms. Harriet has told me of your marvelous plan.
Plan?
Well, not so much of a plan, really, as more of a feasibility study.
Theoretically possible, you said, Dr. Jones.
Theoretically.
Indeed.
It would be a miracle of God if it were to happen.
I'm more of a facts-and-figures man myself.
You're not a religious man?
No.
No, I'm not.
But you're a fisherman, Dr. Jones.
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
How many hours do you fish before you catch something?
Dozens?
Gosh, hundreds sometimes.
Is that a good use of your time for a facts-and-figures man?
But you persist in the wind and the rain and the cold with such poor odds of success.
Why?
Because you're a man of faith, Dr. Alfred.
And in the end, you are rewarded for your faith and constancy.
With a fish.
With due respect, fishing and religion are hardly the same thing, Your Excellency.
With equal respect,
I have to disagree.
A toast?
To faith.
And fish.
To faith and fish.
To faith and fish.
And science.
And science.
You're unhappy tonight, Ms. Harriet?
No.
I'm fine, really.
I have too many wives not to know when a woman is unhappy.
Though mine are not so quiet about it.
Robert, he's my boyfriend, has just been posted to Afghanistan.
Or somewhere.
I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.
For how long?
They don't really tell us things like that.
How worrying.
I just try not to think about it.
And you are married, Dr. Alfred?
Indeed.
It is kind of her to spare you.
My wife's actually working abroad at the moment in Geneva, so...
So you two have more in common than one might suppose.
I have put my feet in it.
Please forgive me.
Perfect moment to retire to bed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
You're welcome.
- Dr. Alfred.
- Your Excellency.
I know you have been persuaded to help us, but unless you do this with an open heart,
I don't think anything will come of it.
So, please, consider.
Of course.
I hope we meet again.
Dr. Jones.
Yes?
Well, I was just wondering what you thought.
Well, the sheikh's English has a certain tendency towards the mystical, don't you think?
But then, doolally as this entire enterprise clearly is,
I've had the most pleasant day I can remember having for quite a long time.
So, if the sheikh is paying, as it were, on we go.
Great.
Good night, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good night, Dr. Jones.
It's been a pleasure.
Yes.
Have you any idea what an outcry there would be if the Environment Agency stripped British rivers of 10,000 salmon and shipped them off to the effing Yemen?
Well, how many can you spare?
None!
Christ, Bernard!
Anglers, they're obsessive crazies.
You think AI Qaeda are a threat, think again, mate.
I've seen a fly fisherman wade into a river and try and drown a canoeist just for passing by in a Day-Glo jacket.
You haven't got a hope in hell of getting these fish from British rivers.
- Yes?
- Dr. Jones.
Hello.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
How nice.
- Did we book a meeting?
- No.
You know how you said that you wanted a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
- Did I say that?
- Yes.
That might have been a little hasty.
- They're outside.
- Who?
The chief hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam.
Here?
I e-mailed them about the flow rate calculus, and I think there must have been some kind of...
My Mandarin is very rusty.
Bloody hell.
We are able to control the flow of water from the upstream dam.
But we are...
Well, we're concerned about the capability of the sandstone walls.
I mean, there's the possibility also of some flash-flood scenario.
Thank you very much.
My God, do you think we got away with it?
- Do you know, I think we did.
- I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
No, please don't apologize.
I think we've just found our engineers.
- Yes.
- I mean, should the project, of course, get that far.
Your Mandarin was much better than I expected.
- Thank you.
- Bernard Sugden, Head of Department.
Hello.
Alfred not bothering you too much, I hope?
No.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot from Fitzharris Price.
Hello.
Bet he doesn't even know your first name, does he?
So, who were all those little chippy-chappies?
Those are the engineers from the Three Gorges Dam.
What, the one in China?
- Is there another?
- Don't think there's another one.
Would have appreciated an introduction.
Bernard is the man who's responsible for acquiring our 10,000 native Atlantic salmon.
How's that coming along, Bernard?
Don't you worry about that, Fred.
It's all in hand.
Well, don't dilly-dally.
Our end is coming along.
- We're bang on schedule, in fact.
- Yes.
A debrief in the canteen, or has Fred brought in the famous sandwiches?
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot and I are going out for lunch, Bernard.
There's lots to discuss.
Clare, could you ask Betty to bring my bag?
Thank you.
Certainly, Dr. Jones.
Are you sure you won't have one?
At lunch time?
Dr. Jones, I haven't spoken a word of Mandarin for about four years, so I am celebrating even if you're not.
I only drink alcohol on the weekend.
And even then, only after 7:00.
No exceptions?
None that I can think of.
Well, yeah.
We got married on a Friday, but I think it was, as I recall, a bank holiday in Northern Ireland, so I allowed myself, I think, a glass on a technicality.
That was an attempt at a joke, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Right.
Good one.
Do you really think it's going extremely well?
- What?
- The project.
The project.
Well, it's utter nonsense, of course, naturally, the bagatelle of a man with more money than sense, but...
I haven't actually found anything to say that it couldn't work.
You know, theoretically, of course.
In theory.
Well, theoretically speaking, in theory it...
- We'll see, yes.
- Of course.
Actually, these are the companies that have bid for the contract to build the holding tanks at the downstream end of the wadi.
- Shall we go through these?
- Now?
Yes, we could go through them now.
Well, we could work and eat, no?
Yes, I...
Yes, all right, then.
- This one's from...
- Before that, cheers.
- Cheers.
- Very bad luck with water.
Some people think it's bad luck.
- EWB...
- Sorry.
Excuse me.
It's the barracks.
It's Robert.
- Sorry.
- No.
Go on.
- Hello.
- Go ahead.
Hello?
Yes?
What?
What?
Are you all right, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
He's missing in action.
What does that mean?
- Come upstairs and we'll get you your...
- No, I just need a minute.
Hello.
My name's Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Well, I only knew him for three weeks, but I am Robert's girlfriend.
I was wondering if you knew anything...
Of course.
Yes.
Sorry, Mrs. Mayers.
Yes, I...
Yes, of course.
Goodbye.
You've reached Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Leave a message after the beep.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, it's Dr. Jones here.
Please forgive me for calling you on your home number.
I was at something of a loss.
I realize that this has not been an easy week for you, but I was wondering when you might be coming back into the office.
I had a very productive meeting with the engineers from British Oxygen Company and, well, there's a lot of data coming in.
Really a considerable amount.
I'm sure I don't have to remind you that we are working to a deadline.
Time and tide, as I am sure you are aware, waits for no man.
Or woman.
Anyway, I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
Goodbye.
Can I come in?
Why?
Well, you might get cold.
- Very nice.
- What?
Your flat.
Very pleasant.
Look, I'm not...
I'm not coming into work, all right, because I need to stay here.
I need to be here in case there's news.
So, actually, anyone with a shred of understanding, or humanity, or simple feeling, who, frankly, wasn't suffering from some kind of Asperger's, would know that the last thing that I need
is your bullying little phone call asking me to come into work so that you can update me on fish.
You want to fill me in on fishing.
Well, Dr. Jones, you can take your work and you can shove it up your unfeeling arse.
I didn't come here to talk to you about work.
Then why are you here?
I made you a sandwich.
Why?
You're probably not eating.
Are you?
No.
You see, it's very important.
You must eat something.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Here.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do because...
I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
Call me Fred.
Just call me Fred.
- You're all right now?
- Yeah.
You all right?
- Sorry.
- No, don't.
Why don't I get a plate and we...
You can put this on a plate.
- Shall I do it?
- No, it's okay.
I'll do it.
I'm so sorry about what I said before.
That is just unforgivable.
The great thing about people with Asperger's is it's very difficult to hurt their feelings.
So it's all right, you can say whatever you like.
You don't have...
You know, I was upset.
And rightly so.
Look, I took the liberty of buying a wee bottle of wine.
Now, I hope you don't mind.
I know it's not the weekend, but this one goes very well with duck.
I'm not very hungry.
Harriet, you've got to try and eat...
Is it all right...
Is it all right for me to call you Harriet?
My father is...
He's ex-Army, so he's like very stiff upper lip and don't make a fuss about anything, but I'm more of a gusher.
I think that's his word for me, anyway.
My upper lip's never been very stiff, I'm afraid.
But you still have a boyfriend.
I mean, I don't know a great deal about such things, but...
Robert hasn't been listed as being dead, has he?
No.
But I just feel that "missing in action" is Army-speak for...
Dead?
No.
No, as a civil servant, I happen to know that the Ministry of Defense absolutely hate uncertainty of any kind.
If he were dead, they would simply say "dead."
Can you stop using that word, please?
- I beg your pardon.
- It's okay.
They say that they'll call when there's news.
But they don't, so I guess there isn't.
Come to the Yemen.
We're leaving tomorrow, just for a few days.
- Geological studies, engineering surveys.
- No.
We even have a team of archeologists checking we're not about to submerge the Ark of the Covenant, which would be unfortunate, you know.
No, I can't leave because there might be news and...
Well, then, you'll fly back on the sheikh's private jet immediately.
Why would he do that?
Because I asked him to.
Your services are very highly valued by the sheikh, and by me.
The project really can't do without you.
Who the hell cares?
Project?
I mean, it's fishing.
You know, who the hell cares?
Well, strangely enough, I do.
I mean, I know it's probably just a terrible folly, but, still, I can't help sometimes imagining that this crazy enterprise might just come off.
You know, with a bit of luck and with the right people.
And you, you are most definitely, most definitely one of the most rightest people that I've had the good fortune to come across.
If you'll forgive the grammatical inadequacies of that sentence.
Do you sometimes think that maybe we're just part of a lavish practical joke?
What do you mean?
Salmon, here?
Yes, I'm beginning to suppose that.
I don't know anyone that goes to church any more.
I don't think I do, either.
On a Sunday, we go to Target.
You know, this gravel here is perfect for salmon to lay their eggs in between.
Who'd have thought that here in the middle of the Yemen, perfect spawning grounds for salmon?
Fred, look.
What?
Yes.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Harriet, the water.
- It's beautiful.
- It's cold.
The water in her well is cold.
Oh, my goodness.
It's really happening, Fred.
Oh, my goodness, it really is.
Unbelievable.
These men, they say that by bringing water, life, to this desert,
I am bringing the Western ways to our land.
They say I have insulted God himself.
I say they are fools.
A thousand apologies, my friends.
Please, this is not a way to introduce you to our great enterprise.
Look.
Is it not magnificent?
It's beautiful.
Certainly is.
Bloody amazing.
- Hello.
- Hello.
For the last time, Sugden, there is absolutely no way I can get you these fish.
Tom, this comes from the top.
The very top.
I don't care if God's taken up fly fishing.
Now, I suggest you make this work, Tom.
Is that a threat, Sugden?
These are difficult days, Tom.
Cuts.
Cuts everywhere.
I don't know.
Ls the Environment Agency a frontline service?
That is a threat.
See it as an opportunity.
Well, then.
An opportunity.
Hilary, get me Matthew Sweet from Fly Fishing Monthly, will you?
That's all I've been told, and so I...
Okay.
All right, then.
Well, please, please, please call me when...
Okay.
Bye.
I'm so sorry.
Did I wake you up?
No.
No, no.
News?
No.
No, I was just leaving a message on Robert's phone which is ridiculous because he hasn't got his phone with him.
And I know that.
Just turning into a madwoman.
No.
No, when things get tricky in my life, I talk to my fish.
I have a pond.
Talking to an answering machine is no madder than chatting to koi carp.
I just somehow wouldn't associate you with having a tricky life.
Well, it wouldn't do to talk about your emotions with a colleague, would it, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
No, I think...
I think things are beyond tricky, really.
They have been for some time.
Mary's in Geneva.
I'm here.
The koi carp are alone in Surrey.
We got married very young.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't really know things were hard.
No, don't apologize.
There's always hope.
For me and for you.
Do you know, I can't even remember what he looks like.
Not exactly.
But I'm stuck, and I can't move on.
Does that make any sense?
Yes.
Totally.
I feel a bit like I've been stuck for years.
Yes, but you can move on.
Well, I suppose in theory.
You should be happy, Fred.
I knew you'd have a pond.
The traitor has had his chance.
You know what to do.
Do not fail us.
I think the idea of taking Scottish salmon to a foreign country is absolutely absurd.
These fish have been running these rivers for tens of thousands of years.
I've fished the rivers of Scotland all my life.
Yes, Prime Minister.
It would appear that the gentle fisherfolk are not so effing gentle after all.
Rape and pillage of our national rivers...
What, ditch the whole thing?
No.
No, no, no, Prime Minister.
No, we must just find the fish somewhere bloody else.
Your turrets are blocking my reception.
Well, I'm terribly sorry about that, madam.
If you'd care to follow me, please.
Mrs. Maxwell.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- It's an honor.
Happy birthday, Patricia.
Yes, we could do with a few more like you in Cabinet.
Very good, Your Excellency.
I'm grateful, indeed, that you could spare some time for our little project.
Yes.
Well, we have gone out on a bit of a limb for you, Your Excellency, but the Prime Minister does love his fishing.
- Really?
- Yes.
Rod's never out of his hand.
Anyway, down to business.
The fish.
The salmon.
We're not gonna get it out of British waters.
There's a bloody big fuss about it, as no doubt you've heard.
Don't know what it is about fishing.
Anyway, no-goer.
- Yes, but I thought...
- However,
I have solved your problem.
See?
There must be thousands in this one alone.
This guy's got four fish farms up and down the coast.
Stocks all the Tescos.
Right under your nose.
These fish were bred for the dinner table.
It's barbaric.
They've never run in their lives.
Neither have their forebears for two generations.
Why would they run for us?
The difference in these salmon...
We'd open the sluices and they would just drift off downstream never to be seen again.
Well, get a couple of days fishing out of it, then just re-stock or whatever the word is.
Seems to be no shortage of them.
In transit for the supermarkets.
These fish will never run.
They're just not right.
Not right?
Well, a fish is a fish is a fish, isn't it?
No.
You see, Mrs. Maxwell, I have a vision.
Tired, bloated pretenders are not part of this vision.
Well, unfortunately, Her Majesty's Government also has a vision, and that vision is farmed fish or no fish.
Then I must thank you for your precious time.
And decline.
No advisers, either.
Back at your desk on Monday, Fred.
Well, in that case, I resign.
Resignation accepted.
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.
So, this leaves us with what?
Well, with no salmon.
We must have faith, Dr. Alfred.
Well, that's a very laudable sentiment, Your Excellency, but we're running out of time.
Can't catch faith with a fishing rod.
Hello, Fred.
Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I didn't think he looked right, that man.
And he pulled out a gun!
Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Alfred.
Thank you very much.
Don't be silly.
Don't be silly.
It was only a cast, really.
A very good cast.
An essential cast, one might say.
Yes, I suppose one might say that.
- Here.
- My God, Fred.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
It was very quick.
It was over in a flash, really.
How did you do that?
I did a right-handed snake roll.
Did I get him?
Yes, it was extraordinary.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you very much.
Please, continue your work as if nothing had happened.
Of course, of course.
I owe you my life.
No.
Please, come on.
Anyone would have...
This is not one of those British metaphors, Dr. Alfred.
The debt will be repaid.
- Bye, now.
- Goodbye.
Bye.
In response to the Right Honorable Member's question of the 7th of last month, the Ministry of Defense can now confirm that an engagement by British Special Forces against known terrorists did occur on the 13th of September.
The details of this operation are classified.
However, I am at liberty to say that serious casualties were incurred by the British forces.
I deeply regret to inform the House that there were no survivors.
An internal investigation is being carried out.
Sorry to wake you up.
- No, don't be.
- It's just...
It's okay.
It's just...
I just never got the chance to really know him.
Mary?
Fred?
There you are.
I had no idea you were...
I got a day off and thought, "Why not surprise him?"
I've got this wonderful Swiss mountain Comté from a little shop round the corner in Geneva.
Is everything all right, Fred?
Where's your suit and tie?
Day off?
I resigned.
Don't be ridiculous.
You've resigned?
What about your pension?
It's final salary.
Well, the government pulled out of the salmon fishing project and we'd put a lot of time and energy into it.
I didn't want to walk away from that.
Well?
Well, everyone involved.
I'm still being paid, if that's what you're worried about.
Fitzharris Price have been more than...
I might have known she'd be involved.
If you're referring to Harriet, we're working on the project together.
Of course she's involved.
- Harriet?
- What do you mean exactly by that, Mary?
I've seen her photograph on the Fitzharris Price website.
You're making a fool of yourself.
Now it's you that's being ridiculous.
Am I'.?
I'm not the one abandoning a decent, highly respected job for a joke fishing project and a short-skirted office girl.
- She's not an office girl.
- What is she, then, Fred?
Hey?
Just what is she?
She's a colleague.
- She's a very talented colleague and...
- And?
And a friend!
She's just a friend!
Are you in love with her?
I've done nothing, Mary.
I have no expectations.
I didn't ask about your expectations.
I asked if you were in love with her.
This is a mid-life crisis.
It's textbook, it's pathetic.
I'm so sorry, Mary.
You'll be back, Fred.
Or you'll try.
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
You'd think a bloody scientist would know that much!
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
We don't need native river fish.
We'll be all right with farmed salmon.
I know.
I don't much like them, but...
Well, they will run.
I know it.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Despite our moral and philosophical objections, farmed salmon will run.
I'm absolutely sure of it.
You are tireless, Doctor.
You have uncovered some new research?
A new paper, perhaps?
No, I just know it.
You just know it.
I see.
Faith, Dr. Alfred.
Damn it.
Yes, all right, then, faith.
So?
They're alive.
That hurts!
Sorry, sweetie.
- Mrs. Maxwell?
- What?
Amazing news.
One of the officers presumed dead,
Captain Robert Mayers, has been found alive.
- Good.
- Yes, we're very pleased.
Yes, very good.
It's very good news for the family.
And his girlfriend, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who else knows about this?
You're the first to know.
Right, keep it that way.
Total press embargo.
Do you understand?
- Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
- That salmon fishing thing.
Is that still happening?
As far as I'm aware.
- It is?
- Yes.
- Yemen?
- Yes.
Perfect.
Yes, this is all coming together very nicely.
I intended to create a small miracle.
Something to glorify God and bring our tribes together.
Sometimes I wonder if we haven't created something that glorifies man.
It is a very fine line.
Hubris, Dr. Alfred.
Hubris.
- It's nice here.
- Beautiful.
You know, Fred, this project, it saved me.
I think.
You know, with everything that happened.
So those farmed fish had better run.
- I believe they will.
- You do?
Yes, I believe that it's in the very core of their being to head upstream even if they never have, even if the parent fish never have.
Look at this.
Look at that.
Mary said something about me.
She said that I was genetically programmed to return to a dull pedestrian life with her.
That it was in my DNA.
Do you think that you are?
No.
No, I belong here.
I always have done.
- Harriet.
- Yes.
I was wondering about you and me.
The theoretical possibility in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is a theoretical possibility.
Obviously.
Or salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Yes.
- Yes?
- Yes.
I just need a little time.
Of course, of course.
All the time you want.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Mr. Foreign Secretary.
- Brian Fleet.
The great fisherman.
The great...
Well, it has been a little while, to be honest.
A bit rusty, you know.
Some skills are never forgotten.
Please, follow this man to your tent.
I shall join you shortly.
What have you been saying?
Fishing's the last thing anyone's gonna be interested in, trust me.
Get ready for the photo op of a lifetime, Sonny Jim.
N-S-R.
No salmon required.
Is that a Woolly Jones?
No, this is a new one I've invented.
IS it?
What's it called?
This one is called the Chetwode-Talbot Beauty.
That's very nice.
It's true.
You're not being funny?
No, I don't have a sense of humor, as you recall.
That is true.
- Beautiful.
- Yes, she is.
Here.
Thank you.
Don't you think we should be doing something, Fred?
Preparing?
L am preparing...
Well, for the whole thing, you know.
Everything's done, Harriet, it's fine.
Just relax.
Did you just...
Dr. Alfred Jones just told me to relax.
What is the world coming to?
Oh, my God.
Harriet.
Right, Harriet and Robert...
Right, okay.
Shut up, hacks.
No military stuff.
It's classified.
Anyway, I don't think you'd understand it.
The only thing you need to know is that this man, Captain Mayers here, is a war hero.
Human interest stuff only.
Sir.
Harriet, can you tell us how it feels?
It feels like it's a...
It's a...
It's a shock, but it's wonderful.
Please can we have a kiss?
Go on.
Come on.
I am sorry, my friend.
No-No, it's...
It's a miracle.
Indeed.
Nevertheless, I'm sorry.
All right, gentlemen, gentlemen, I think that's all.
A little privacy for the couple, please.
I'd just like to say that the British government is proud to have played a small but significant part in this extraordinary reunion of Harriet and Captain Mayers.
That's what we're here for.
This is strange.
Bad strange?
No, good strange.
Do you mind if we don't...
No, of course not.
There's no rush.
Will you just hold me?
How did you get caught up in this, H?
Salmon fishing out here?
It's ridiculous.
Well, you never know with the sheikh.
I expect there will be a six-star hotel and a golf course before you know it.
That's not his style at all.
Don't you believe it.
He's gotta make his money back somehow.
They're no fools, these Arabs.
You don't sleep, either?
No, not much.
Well...
At least there's no bloody journos around at this time, anyway.
You've been very good to Harriet, Fred.
I appreciate it.
I love her.
Yeah, she's great.
She's really great.
No.
I love her.
Does she love you?
I don't know now.
Yesterday, you weren't alive.
Well, I apologize for not being dead in a ditch.
I don't think I can accept your apology.
Is that a joke?
Yes, yes, sort of.
I'm not...
I've never been very good at jokes.
It's all right, Robert.
Really.
It's all right.
The day has arrived.
Before the dam, this was a dry riverbed.
And now, as you all can see, we have water.
And today, we hope we shall discover the one missing thing.
So, thank you, one and all, for coming as not one of you, not even my dear self, knows if this curious experiment of mine will actually work.
It better had bloody work.
Doesn't matter if it works or not, dolly.
All that matters is you.
Fishing on Sky tonight with our war hero.
- I haven't done this in years.
- For God's sake.
There are 10,000 fish in there.
If you can't hook one of them, you can just flip off back to Transport.
My intention is to color this desert in green.
Make an agricultural industry for my people, and the sons and daughters of my people for generations to come.
- Right on cue.
- So here we are,
Muslims, Christians and the odd heathen.
We are all gathered here in an act of faith.
And why not?
And now, the moment that we are all waiting for, the fruits of all our efforts.
The moment of truth.
Open the sluices.
Where's it going?
It's going the wrong way.
It's heading downstream.
Wait a minute.
It's turned around.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
- Look, they're going upstream.
- Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, my God, they're running.
Fred, look.
Look!
- They're running, Fred!
- They're running!
Blondie.
Come down here, come on.
Come down here now.
Look, we ought to get a picture of him with the sheikh.
- It's working, Your Excellency.
- It is.
They are running upstream, look!
Let's go fishing, Dr. Alfred.
Turn it on, dolly.
I need to get further out.
For God's sakes.
Come on, off you go!
Have you got that?
Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
But can we get them closer together?
God, I'll give it a go.
Robert, darling.
Can you come...
Can you turn around a bit?
I'm worried about what he's doing with his rod.
Lovely.
And, Brian, just a nice smile, that would be good.
Did you get that?
God, he's useless, isn't he?
More fun without waders, Dr. Alfred.
Yes.
I think I caught one, Dr. Alfred.
It's a beauty, Your Excellency.
Look out behind you!
Your Excellency, behind you!
Step UP...
No, you first!
I repay my debts, Dr. Alfred.
- Okay.
I'll pull you up.
After...
- Okay.
Here, Your Excellency, hold on.
Here, come on.
We won't need these any more.
I just don't understand who would do this.
Why would they do this?
I know who.
And I know why.
Can't you find them?
Arrest them?
What for?
Justice.
Justice.
I think these destroyers...
Bad men, certainly.
But I think perhaps they have a point.
I expected people to understand what we were doing here.
I expected them to see that it was really not about fishing at all.
In the end, I asked for too much.
Will you try again?
The question is "Will we try again?"
This was ours.
Yes, I think maybe Robert wants to go home.
So, I don't...
I don't know.
Does home call, Dr. Fred?
I don't really have a home any more.
There was a moment when I had everything, but...
Well, now I don't know what to do.
When the time comes, you will know.
Well, until then.
Thank you.
Just gonna say goodbye to Fred.
Are you sure?
Sorry?
Listen, Harriet.
When I was in the desert, the only thing that kept me going was the thought of you.
You don't owe me anything.
I want you to understand that.
So...
We're going.
I'm so sorry, Fred.
It was an extraordinary idea.
It almost worked, too.
I wasn't talking about the project.
No, I'm not sure that I was.
I never meant to hurt you like this.
It's not your fault.
I don't know what to do.
I can't help you there, I'm afraid.
Are you going to stay?
Stay for what?
There's nothing here any more.
Not you, not a single fish left in the river.
Well, someone's gonna have to make a move.
Good luck, Harriet.
Dr. Alfred, look!
They're alive!
I'm going to stay.
I want to start again.
I'll do it on my own if I have to.
I'll start small, though, this time.
A different approach.
Just a few fish to begin with.
Involve the local community more.
Make it their project, not ours.
That's the way to protect it.
Do you need an assistant, Dr. Jones?
Well, I suppose I will.
I'm sure the sheikh has somebody that...
An assistant?
A partner.
A partner.
Yes, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
More than anything.
Dear Dr. Jones,
I act on behalf of a client with access to very substantial funds who has indicated a desire to sponsor a project to introduce salmon and the sport of salmon fishing into the Yemen.
I would like to seek a meeting with you to identify how this challenging project might be initiated and resourced.
I might add that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office supports the project as a symbol of Anglo-Yemeni cooperation.
Yours sincerely, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Ms.
Fitzharris Price Investment Consultants.
Night.
Have a good evening.
You, too.
Say hi to soldier boy.
We're just friends, you know.
We've only met a couple of times.
- Yeah, you tell me that on Monday.
- Shut up.
- Hello.
- Hi.
It's great to see you.
- Yes.
Me, too.
Sorry.
- Yes?
- Yes.
- You, too.
- No, "Yes" is a start, that's fine.
- Stop it, I'm so nervous.
Why are you nervous?
I don't know.
I'm trying to be very sophisticated and grown-up.
Right.
No, grown-up, absolutely.
Quite right, yeah.
- Harriet.
- Yes?
Last one to the restaurant pays.
What?
You bastard.
Dear Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, thank you for your e-mail.
As a fisheries specialist, permit me a word or two about salmon.
Migratory salmonoids require cool, well-oxygenated water in which to spawn.
In addition, in the early stages of the salmon's life cycle, a good supply of fly life indigenous to the northern European rivers is necessary for the juvenile salmon, or parr, to survive.
Some considerable distance from the Indian Ocean, or indeed the Red Sea, as I am sure you are aware, though apparently not the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
We conclude that conditions in the Yemen make this project unfeasible.
Fundamentally unfeasible.
Yes, yes.
Fundamentally unfeasible.
We therefore regret that we are unable to help you any further in this matter.
Yours, Alfred Jones, Doctor.
I've put duck liver pate in your sandwich.
That's lovely.
Righto.
I'm off to bed.
Already?
- Airport car's coming at 5:00.
- Righto.
I'll maybe have another wee pass at the caddis fly paper.
You could read it on the airplane.
Up to my ear in reports, darling.
I'll read it when I'm back.
Right, then.
Good night.
Oh, my God, I don't do this.
I don't do this.
No, I can tell.
I haven't done this in a really long time.
- Okay.
- I'm so shy.
- Okay.
No, I'll sleep on the sofa.
- No, I'm so shy.
Look, Harriet, I mean it.
I...
Shut up.
You were saying.
You're shy.
I am shy and quiet.
Like Hitler.
I'm serious.
Robert, I...
Don't do this and then forget me.
I just don't wanna be an army barracks joke in the morning.
Please be nice to me.
Harriet, I'm serious, too.
I mean it.
So if you want me to sleep on the sofa, then I'll...
If you say, Captain Mayers, one more time you'll sleep on the sofa, you'll bloody well sleep on the sofa.
Captain Robert Mayers, 3-6-4-7-7-2.
Maxwell.
Better be good.
Mrs. Maxwell, we have a situation.
- What?
- Code Red in Afghanistan.
Go to sleep.
Tell me that's not a mosque.
Well, it is a religious establishment...
- Of course it's a bloody mosque!
- Well, of course...
- What's up?
- Go to sleep.
- ...make this a joint operation.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The British have absolutely nothing to do with this whatsoever.
And I want every single man, woman, child and goat in Afghanistan to know that.
My God, I didn't think we could make the war in Afghanistan any less popular, but, hey, even I can be wrong.
We'll have Vera Lynn strapping on her suicide belt in sympathy next.
Bravo, the bloody Marines.
Right, you lot.
We need a good news story from the Middle East, a big one.
And we need it now.
You've got an hour, get on with it.
Good news, eh?
New girl band, Middle East tour.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Touch my body No, no...
Okay...
Maybe not.
No.
British trans-Arabian rally.
For God's sake.
Come on, come on.
Come up with something.
What's this?
A project to introduce salmon fishing to the Yemen.
Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Is that the best you puffed-up Oxbridge-educated moronic buffoons can come up with?
Yes?
Yes, Prime Minister.
Well, no, I'm working on it right now.
I think I may have come up with something that you'll like.
Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing.
Are you dollies trying to get me fired?
Well, here we go.
Fish it is.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Hello.
Mrs. Maxwell on line one, sir.
Busy.
She says it's urgent, sir.
Maxwell who?
The press officer to the Prime Minister, sir.
Patricia.
They haven't pensioned you off yet, then?
Listen, I got the heads-up from the FCO about this salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Fancy it?
- Well, I...
- We do.
Chasing a good news story out of the Middle East.
Anglo-Yemeni relations back on track.
Arab-Western cultural détente through the ancient sport of yanking poor sodding fish out of rivers.
What do you reckon?
Well, it's a bit of a long shot, to be honest.
Well, don't be honest.
Lunatic's an oil sheikh.
Got money pouring out of his arse.
Good friend of the West.
Good friend of the Party, too, so give it a go, eh, dolly?
Well, we'll certainly bend every sinew to the job, Patricia.
I'll set up a working party immediately.
- What?
- Hey!
Don't you "working party" me, you short-arsed little pen-pusher.
I did not say kick it into the long grass.
I said do it!
Yes, Patricia.
Right... away.
Mr. Jones?
Morning, Mr. Jones.
Good morning, Betty.
I trust you had a nice weekend.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Jones.
Mr. Sugden would like a word.
Would he indeed?
What do you think of that?
It's for the caddis fly report.
Need something racy for the cover.
Something to rev up the YouTube generation.
I know it's not quite what we would expect from a scientific paper, but we must keep up with the times, Mrs. Burnside.
Mr. Sugden asked to see you, Mr. Jones.
I'm not too sure that I don't have a picture of a caddis being eaten alive by a spider somewhere.
There it is.
That's a beauty.
What do you think about that for...
Good God.
Little too much, do you think?
No, not if you're making a horror film.
Look, this e-mail about the salmon thing.
Yes.
Did I miss April Fools' Day or something?
Did you like my little swipe at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wonks?
Yeah, well, I just had another e-mail from the FCO today.
Rattle their cage, did I?
Look, you wouldn't take a meeting with her, would you?
This Chetwode-Talbot woman.
She represents this Sheikh Muhammed bloke.
Why would I want to do that?
Why would I want to traipse across London to discuss that nonsense?
I've very important work to do here, as you can very well see.
Yeah, well, the FCO, in their infinite W, feel that a meeting on this is important business, too, Alfred.
Lord, the tendrils of this busybody government.
Dr. Jones, as your Operational Line Manager,
I am asking you with extreme prejudice to take a meeting with Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
I take it that's an order?
Take it how you wish.
Nazi.
Wanker.
Morning.
Dr. Jones?
Miss Chetwode-Talbot is expecting me.
Yes, it's a bit of a mouthful.
Do call me Harriet.
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Do you want to come with me?
Yes.
Do come in.
Please, sit down.
Yeah, anywhere you like.
Would you like tea or coffee?
No, thank you.
So...
Fitzharris Price represent the sheikh's assets in this country, including a number of estates in Scotland.
He's a very keen fisherman, so he asked us if we would...
- Water.
- Sorry?
Water, Miss Chetwode-Talbot.
H2O.
Do you want sparkling or still?
Not for me, for the fish.
Fish require water.
You are familiar with that concept?
Yes.
I am, yes.
So, to save us both a lot of time, let me keep this brief and simple.
Here it's very cold.
It rains a lot.
Here it's very hot.
It doesn't rain a lot.
Do you see the difference?
Well, you're pointing to Saudi Arabia, Dr. Jones, not the Yemen.
You seem to be deliberately missing the point.
With respect, not really.
You see, unlike Saudi Arabia, parts of the Yemen get up to 250 millimeters of rainfall a month in the wet season.
It gets the edge of the monsoon, you see.
And the dry season?
Well, interestingly, recent oil explorations have uncovered a number of very large freshwater aquifers, which could sort of recharge the wadi in the dry season using a dam.
I'm sure they could.
So, when he's built his dam, why don't you get back to me then?
Completed, couple of years ago.
Long-term plan is to irrigate thousands of acres of desert.
We could grow watermelons, maize, cotton.
Now you're going to tell me it isn't hot in the Yemen, too, aren't you?
Well, in the mountainous areas, the nighttime temperatures get down to well below 20 Celsius.
And, of course, I defer to your expert knowledge, Dr. Jones, but I do believe that Pacific salmon get as far south as California.
Temperatures are not too dissimilar there.
- Water.
- For the fish.
- No, for me.
- Of course.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Yes, Dr. Jones?
This is plainly ridiculous.
There's just no way that salmon can survive in those sort of environments.
If your sheikh wants to pour his money down the drain, why doesn't he buy himself a football club or something?
Look, Dr. Jones.
I don't really think it's my place to explain the sheikh's motivations.
But I will say this, that of all of our wealthy clients, he is different.
I would go so far as to describe him as a visionary man.
- A visionary?
- Yes, I know, it's not a very fashionable word, but if you decide to take this project with us, then you can judge for yourself when you meet him.
My line manager asked me to come here and take this meeting to discuss your project and that I have done.
I thank you for your time, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
I'll see myself out.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Did you get my e-mail?
Yes.
What did it say?
Took the meeting.
Waste of time, as predicted.
Now, if you don't mind, I'll get back to my work.
Dr. Jones.
What is this?
P45.
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't understand.
Well, a P45 is the official document given to an employee when his services are no longer required by his, or her, employer.
Yes, but, Bernard, this has got my...
Or you can sign this letter stating that you are delighted to assign yourself, exclusively, to the Yemeni salmon fishing project with immediate effect.
It's up to you.
But, Bernard, you know as well as I do this thing is a bloody joke.
There's no way you can get salmon that far up a...
Just there.
This is blackmail, Sugden.
This is a bloody outrage.
Fitzharris Price will be paying your salary while on secondment.
Almost double what it is now.
I'd say that's a bloody outrage.
Double?
Can I have time to think about this?
Nope.
- Can I borrow your pen?
- No.
It's my special one with the italic nib.
Hey.
Hold it, hold it.
Hold it.
Brian, what...
What have you got in bar seven?
I should have resigned.
You can't afford to resign.
Matter of principle.
I have a standing in the scientific community, Mary.
A reputation.
You have a mortgage.
Two, three, four.
Maybe I should resign.
We could have a baby.
Why not?
You could stay on at work and I could bring up the nipper.
I could take him to the park and to school.
I could take him fishing.
What do you think?
They're really losing the plot in Geneva.
One minute they're buying Euros, the next minute they can't ditch them fast enough for dollars.
They're panicking, and guess who they want to bail them out.
I can't imagine.
Say a command.
- Shut up.
- Say a command.
What were you shouting about back there?
Nothing.
Say a command.
Mar)'...
Oh, Lord.
Well, that should do you for a while.
Thank you, Mary.
Good night.
Night, dear.
Oh, Jesus.
Good morning.
Yes, Staff.
I've gotta go.
Now?
Yeah.
That was the call.
Sorry.
Is it Afghanistan?
It's somewhere sandy, that's for sure.
- I'll go get some tea.
- No, look...
- No, it's all right, Robert.
It's...
- No, no, come here.
Look, the last few weeks...
This is good.
Wonderful.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.
Will you wait for me?
Now go get that tea.
You bastard.
Well, firstly, we would need to trap 10,000 salmon from the North Sea, for the sake of argument, get them to the Yemen alive, don't ask me how, where they would be deposited in temperature and oxygen-controlled holding tanks built into a wadi
that would, hallelujah, open during the rainy season, allowing the salmon to migrate upstream for, say, 10 kilometers, which would allow your sheikh to hoick them out of the water to his heart's content.
Of course, until the dry season, when they will all
die.
Well, unless we feed the wadi all year round using the dam.
Of course.
Stupid idiot man.
Why not use precious water resources to support one man's sport fishing?
So, now that we have year-round water, why not build some gravel spawning grounds, breed the world's first Arabian salmon, and teach the clever fellows to migrate to the Indian Ocean...
Wonderful, wonderful idea.
Singing, "Step we gaily, here we go.
Heel for heel and toe for toe."
Rough cost?
Cost?
Cost.
Forty million.
No, 45...
- Fifty million.
- Dollars?
- Dollars.
- Dollars.
Or pounds.
Pounds.
At least.
So it's theoretically possible?
Well, it's theoretically possible in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is theoretically possible.
It's very impressive, Dr. Jones.
No, it's not.
It's nonsense.
Look, I just made it all up.
No, the drawing.
Real talent, if I might say so.
Excellent start.
So I suppose we should just crack on and get things started now?
You can't hold me to this.
I mean, these are just random ideas.
I mean, this is a sort of joke.
Well, I'm sure you wouldn't joke about a 50-million-pound project, Dr. Jones.
Not when you're in charge of it.
Well, the sheikh is so looking forward to meeting you, and he'll be back in the next couple of weeks.
So, in the meantime, is there anything else that I can do for you?
Well, as a matter of fact, there is.
Could you arrange a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
The one in China?
Is there another?
British Oxygen Company.
A meeting with them as well.
And then, what are those great big transport aircraft called?
The big Russian military...
Antonovs.
Find out about renting two of those, one for the fish and one to carry all the money that we're going to need.
When that's done, I'd be delighted to start working.
Good day, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good day, Dr. Jones.
Mary!
Up here.
Boy, did I put a hurricane up that Chetwode-Talbot woman.
You would have laughed.
I told her I wanted a meeting with the Three Gorges Dam team from...
Where are you going?
Geneva.
I told you.
You didn't say now.
Well, I am.
Tomorrow.
Well, how long are you going for?
Six weeks, to start with.
Six weeks?
There's no need to shout.
Six weeks, though, Mary.
This is a big chance for me.
I'll be heading up the whole operation.
Well, you could say "Congratulations."
Great.
Enough is enough.
It's job or marriage.
You've got to make a decision and make it now, God damn it.
There are planes, you know, Fred.
And I get Sundays off.
Mostly.
You can get all your horrible old fishing stuff out again.
Didn't even ask me.
Just went and did it.
I know.
I'm sorry.
It just suddenly seemed like the right decision.
Maybe for both of us.
Fred, I don't want to leave on bad terms.
No.
No.
I'll open a bottle of something fizzy.
Okay?
Reports are coming in from Afghanistan of a British soldier killed while on duty in Helmand Province.
An improvised explosive device detonated during a routine search in a local village.
This...
The Minister for Culture 's been photographed doing what?
Naked or clothed?
Boy or girl?
How old?
Jesus.
Well, at least she's legal.
Press statement from us saying that we're a party of policy not personality, concentrating on the real issues of getting this country back on track in times of economic hardship and not tabloid sensationalism, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Meanwhile, get the useless arse on the front page of every paper apologizing for being born, big spread in Hello!
with blonde forgiving wife and cute kids.
If they're not cute, find a horse or something.
Joshua!
Hood.
Don't you suck your teeth at me, young man.
I'm not one of your bitches from the Baltimore low-rises.
You feel me?
I'm your fucking mother!
Got to go.
Meeting.
Dear Dr. Jones, the sheikh has requested your company at his estate in Glen Tulloch to discuss the salmon project further.
Please advise which dates would suit you best.
Many thanks, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Fitzharris Price.
Mr. Sugden would like to see you in the canteen, sir.
Up his arse with a meter ruler.
Thanks, Betty.
- Which one is he?
- Over here.
Fred.
Can I introduce Patricia Maxwell?
She is the Prime Minister's press officer.
Hello.
Fifty million from Sheikh Muhammed thingammy.
It's the first-stage payment on research development for the salmon fishing project.
The PM's keeping a close eye on this one.
It's just what we need right now, a bit of Anglo-Arab news that isn't about things that explode.
I want to know, is it a goer?
Goer?
Well, look, the complexities.
I mean, I barely know even where to begin, but, well, just for starters, we would need 10,000 live salmon.
Is 10,000 salmon a lot?
Well, if they're to come from British waters, and I don't see where else they're gonna come from.
I mean, you would need the permission of the Environment Agency.
That's your job, Bernard.
Okay, so you get on to the EA and get this man his salmon.
- Miss Maxwell.
Ms.
- Mrs. Happily married.
Details in Who's Who.
Mrs. Maxwell, there are two million fishermen in the UK who are, I would say, unusually protective of...
How many?
- Two million.
- Two million?
- Yes.
- Bloody hell.
Two million out there waving their little rods around?
Are they the kind that vote our way?
They vote for those that best look after their fish, in my experience.
I bet they do, I bet they do.
Right, so, Prime Minister on the front cover of Fishy Weekly or whatever.
Best friend of the British fisherfolk.
Spearing a leaping salmon.
I like this.
I like it a lo'[.
They do have magazines, these people?
They can read?
Aye, the Angling Times, Trout and Salmon,
Coarse Fishing Monthly, Bassmania.
Bassmania?
Marvelous.
Marvelous.
That's marvelous.
This has just become a priority project.
Anything I can do, just give me a call.
Two million.
God, men, what a species.
I don't think she got the right end of the stick there.
Your call, I think, Bernard.
Ten thousand native Atlantic salmon on my desk by Friday, please.
Yeah, well, you'd just better come through on this, Jones.
It's been a long time since I was back.
- Yes?
- A long time.
You see?
- Is that where he lives?
- Yes.
He has many estates, but this one's his favorite.
- May I present Malcolm, the butler.
- Hello.
- This is Dr. Jones.
- Welcome to Glen Tulloch, sir.
His Excellency thought you might like to avail yourself of the fishing while you're waiting.
Thank you very much.
May I present Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama.
This is Dr. Jones.
It's a great pleasure to meet you, Your Excellency.
To meet the creator of the Woolly Jones, the pleasure's all mine, sir.
That's very kind.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, do you realize that for more than 10 years
I have fished with a Woolly Jones?
Really?
What's a Woolly Jones?
Dr. Jones invented a famous fly.
Well, it's a sentimental habit that some fly-tiers have of calling a fly after...
Anyway, I don't approve of that sort of thing normally, but...
Woolly Jones.
It's a great name.
A bloody good fly, that's for sure.
Please allow me to show you a delightful lie just around the corner.
Absolutely.
Lead on.
You think I'm mad?
- No, Your Excellency.
I...
- Of course you do.
I would question your judgment if you did not.
Though I have judgment enough to know that under there lies a fish much cleverer than I.
I'm a great admirer of the British for many reasons, but still there are mysteries to me.
The rich are frightened of the poor.
The poor are frightened of the rich.
And even your politicians, they try to sound like the people on the EastEnders.
A wonderful program, but still.
Yes, the great British class system.
Indeed.
But fishermen, I have noticed, they don't care whether I'm brown or white, rich or poor, wearing robes or waders.
All they care about is the fish, the river and the game we play.
For fishermen, the only virtues are patience, tolerance and humility.
I like this.
You are struck dumb by my naivety, Dr. Alfred.
No, you're on.
- What?
- You're on.
- This is a sign.
- A sign?
A sign that I should stop talking bollocks and fish.
Come here.
- Nicely done, sir.
- Thank you.
Very nicely done.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Hello, Dr. Jones.
Is that yours?
- The dress.
- Yes.
This is not mine.
It suits you very well.
Thank you.
They seem to know my size.
That not strike you as a wee bit sinister?
The idea of the sheikh's tailor tracking me across London with some kind of satellite measuring device?
They asked me for your size.
And I took a guess.
Well, for future reference,
I have a 32-inch waist, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
- Right.
- Not a 34.
No pies for me.
Note taken, sorry about that.
Thank you.
Ms. Harriet has told me of your marvelous plan.
Plan?
Well, not so much of a plan, really, as more of a feasibility study.
Theoretically possible, you said, Dr. Jones.
Theoretically.
Indeed.
It would be a miracle of God if it were to happen.
I'm more of a facts-and-figures man myself.
You're not a religious man?
No.
No, I'm not.
But you're a fisherman, Dr. Jones.
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
How many hours do you fish before you catch something?
Dozens?
Gosh, hundreds sometimes.
Is that a good use of your time for a facts-and-figures man?
But you persist in the wind and the rain and the cold with such poor odds of success.
Why?
Because you're a man of faith, Dr. Alfred.
And in the end, you are rewarded for your faith and constancy.
With a fish.
With due respect, fishing and religion are hardly the same thing, Your Excellency.
With equal respect,
I have to disagree.
A toast?
To faith.
And fish.
To faith and fish.
To faith and fish.
And science.
And science.
You're unhappy tonight, Ms. Harriet?
No.
I'm fine, really.
I have too many wives not to know when a woman is unhappy.
Though mine are not so quiet about it.
Robert, he's my boyfriend, has just been posted to Afghanistan.
Or somewhere.
I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.
For how long?
They don't really tell us things like that.
How worrying.
I just try not to think about it.
And you are married, Dr. Alfred?
Indeed.
It is kind of her to spare you.
My wife's actually working abroad at the moment in Geneva, so...
So you two have more in common than one might suppose.
I have put my feet in it.
Please forgive me.
Perfect moment to retire to bed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
You're welcome.
- Dr. Alfred.
- Your Excellency.
I know you have been persuaded to help us, but unless you do this with an open heart,
I don't think anything will come of it.
So, please, consider.
Of course.
I hope we meet again.
Dr. Jones.
Yes?
Well, I was just wondering what you thought.
Well, the sheikh's English has a certain tendency towards the mystical, don't you think?
But then, doolally as this entire enterprise clearly is,
I've had the most pleasant day I can remember having for quite a long time.
So, if the sheikh is paying, as it were, on we go.
Great.
Good night, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good night, Dr. Jones.
It's been a pleasure.
Yes.
Have you any idea what an outcry there would be if the Environment Agency stripped British rivers of 10,000 salmon and shipped them off to the effing Yemen?
Well, how many can you spare?
None!
Christ, Bernard!
Anglers, they're obsessive crazies.
You think AI Qaeda are a threat, think again, mate.
I've seen a fly fisherman wade into a river and try and drown a canoeist just for passing by in a Day-Glo jacket.
You haven't got a hope in hell of getting these fish from British rivers.
- Yes?
- Dr. Jones.
Hello.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
How nice.
- Did we book a meeting?
- No.
You know how you said that you wanted a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
- Did I say that?
- Yes.
That might have been a little hasty.
- They're outside.
- Who?
The chief hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam.
Here?
I e-mailed them about the flow rate calculus, and I think there must have been some kind of...
My Mandarin is very rusty.
Bloody hell.
We are able to control the flow of water from the upstream dam.
But we are...
Well, we're concerned about the capability of the sandstone walls.
I mean, there's the possibility also of some flash-flood scenario.
Thank you very much.
My God, do you think we got away with it?
- Do you know, I think we did.
- I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
No, please don't apologize.
I think we've just found our engineers.
- Yes.
- I mean, should the project, of course, get that far.
Your Mandarin was much better than I expected.
- Thank you.
- Bernard Sugden, Head of Department.
Hello.
Alfred not bothering you too much, I hope?
No.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot from Fitzharris Price.
Hello.
Bet he doesn't even know your first name, does he?
So, who were all those little chippy-chappies?
Those are the engineers from the Three Gorges Dam.
What, the one in China?
- Is there another?
- Don't think there's another one.
Would have appreciated an introduction.
Bernard is the man who's responsible for acquiring our 10,000 native Atlantic salmon.
How's that coming along, Bernard?
Don't you worry about that, Fred.
It's all in hand.
Well, don't dilly-dally.
Our end is coming along.
- We're bang on schedule, in fact.
- Yes.
A debrief in the canteen, or has Fred brought in the famous sandwiches?
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot and I are going out for lunch, Bernard.
There's lots to discuss.
Clare, could you ask Betty to bring my bag?
Thank you.
Certainly, Dr. Jones.
Are you sure you won't have one?
At lunch time?
Dr. Jones, I haven't spoken a word of Mandarin for about four years, so I am celebrating even if you're not.
I only drink alcohol on the weekend.
And even then, only after 7:00.
No exceptions?
None that I can think of.
Well, yeah.
We got married on a Friday, but I think it was, as I recall, a bank holiday in Northern Ireland, so I allowed myself, I think, a glass on a technicality.
That was an attempt at a joke, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Right.
Good one.
Do you really think it's going extremely well?
- What?
- The project.
The project.
Well, it's utter nonsense, of course, naturally, the bagatelle of a man with more money than sense, but...
I haven't actually found anything to say that it couldn't work.
You know, theoretically, of course.
In theory.
Well, theoretically speaking, in theory it...
- We'll see, yes.
- Of course.
Actually, these are the companies that have bid for the contract to build the holding tanks at the downstream end of the wadi.
- Shall we go through these?
- Now?
Yes, we could go through them now.
Well, we could work and eat, no?
Yes, I...
Yes, all right, then.
- This one's from...
- Before that, cheers.
- Cheers.
- Very bad luck with water.
Some people think it's bad luck.
- EWB...
- Sorry.
Excuse me.
It's the barracks.
It's Robert.
- Sorry.
- No.
Go on.
- Hello.
- Go ahead.
Hello?
Yes?
What?
What?
Are you all right, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
He's missing in action.
What does that mean?
- Come upstairs and we'll get you your...
- No, I just need a minute.
Hello.
My name's Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Well, I only knew him for three weeks, but I am Robert's girlfriend.
I was wondering if you knew anything...
Of course.
Yes.
Sorry, Mrs. Mayers.
Yes, I...
Yes, of course.
Goodbye.
You've reached Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Leave a message after the beep.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, it's Dr. Jones here.
Please forgive me for calling you on your home number.
I was at something of a loss.
I realize that this has not been an easy week for you, but I was wondering when you might be coming back into the office.
I had a very productive meeting with the engineers from British Oxygen Company and, well, there's a lot of data coming in.
Really a considerable amount.
I'm sure I don't have to remind you that we are working to a deadline.
Time and tide, as I am sure you are aware, waits for no man.
Or woman.
Anyway, I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
Goodbye.
Can I come in?
Why?
Well, you might get cold.
- Very nice.
- What?
Your flat.
Very pleasant.
Look, I'm not...
I'm not coming into work, all right, because I need to stay here.
I need to be here in case there's news.
So, actually, anyone with a shred of understanding, or humanity, or simple feeling, who, frankly, wasn't suffering from some kind of Asperger's, would know that the last thing that I need
is your bullying little phone call asking me to come into work so that you can update me on fish.
You want to fill me in on fishing.
Well, Dr. Jones, you can take your work and you can shove it up your unfeeling arse.
I didn't come here to talk to you about work.
Then why are you here?
I made you a sandwich.
Why?
You're probably not eating.
Are you?
No.
You see, it's very important.
You must eat something.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Here.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do because...
I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
Call me Fred.
Just call me Fred.
- You're all right now?
- Yeah.
You all right?
- Sorry.
- No, don't.
Why don't I get a plate and we...
You can put this on a plate.
- Shall I do it?
- No, it's okay.
I'll do it.
I'm so sorry about what I said before.
That is just unforgivable.
The great thing about people with Asperger's is it's very difficult to hurt their feelings.
So it's all right, you can say whatever you like.
You don't have...
You know, I was upset.
And rightly so.
Look, I took the liberty of buying a wee bottle of wine.
Now, I hope you don't mind.
I know it's not the weekend, but this one goes very well with duck.
I'm not very hungry.
Harriet, you've got to try and eat...
Is it all right...
Is it all right for me to call you Harriet?
My father is...
He's ex-Army, so he's like very stiff upper lip and don't make a fuss about anything, but I'm more of a gusher.
I think that's his word for me, anyway.
My upper lip's never been very stiff, I'm afraid.
But you still have a boyfriend.
I mean, I don't know a great deal about such things, but...
Robert hasn't been listed as being dead, has he?
No.
But I just feel that "missing in action" is Army-speak for...
Dead?
No.
No, as a civil servant, I happen to know that the Ministry of Defense absolutely hate uncertainty of any kind.
If he were dead, they would simply say "dead."
Can you stop using that word, please?
- I beg your pardon.
- It's okay.
They say that they'll call when there's news.
But they don't, so I guess there isn't.
Come to the Yemen.
We're leaving tomorrow, just for a few days.
- Geological studies, engineering surveys.
- No.
We even have a team of archeologists checking we're not about to submerge the Ark of the Covenant, which would be unfortunate, you know.
No, I can't leave because there might be news and...
Well, then, you'll fly back on the sheikh's private jet immediately.
Why would he do that?
Because I asked him to.
Your services are very highly valued by the sheikh, and by me.
The project really can't do without you.
Who the hell cares?
Project?
I mean, it's fishing.
You know, who the hell cares?
Well, strangely enough, I do.
I mean, I know it's probably just a terrible folly, but, still, I can't help sometimes imagining that this crazy enterprise might just come off.
You know, with a bit of luck and with the right people.
And you, you are most definitely, most definitely one of the most rightest people that I've had the good fortune to come across.
If you'll forgive the grammatical inadequacies of that sentence.
Do you sometimes think that maybe we're just part of a lavish practical joke?
What do you mean?
Salmon, here?
Yes, I'm beginning to suppose that.
I don't know anyone that goes to church any more.
I don't think I do, either.
On a Sunday, we go to Target.
You know, this gravel here is perfect for salmon to lay their eggs in between.
Who'd have thought that here in the middle of the Yemen, perfect spawning grounds for salmon?
Fred, look.
What?
Yes.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Harriet, the water.
- It's beautiful.
- It's cold.
The water in her well is cold.
Oh, my goodness.
It's really happening, Fred.
Oh, my goodness, it really is.
Unbelievable.
These men, they say that by bringing water, life, to this desert,
I am bringing the Western ways to our land.
They say I have insulted God himself.
I say they are fools.
A thousand apologies, my friends.
Please, this is not a way to introduce you to our great enterprise.
Look.
Is it not magnificent?
It's beautiful.
Certainly is.
Bloody amazing.
- Hello.
- Hello.
For the last time, Sugden, there is absolutely no way I can get you these fish.
Tom, this comes from the top.
The very top.
I don't care if God's taken up fly fishing.
Now, I suggest you make this work, Tom.
Is that a threat, Sugden?
These are difficult days, Tom.
Cuts.
Cuts everywhere.
I don't know.
Ls the Environment Agency a frontline service?
That is a threat.
See it as an opportunity.
Well, then.
An opportunity.
Hilary, get me Matthew Sweet from Fly Fishing Monthly, will you?
That's all I've been told, and so I...
Okay.
All right, then.
Well, please, please, please call me when...
Okay.
Bye.
I'm so sorry.
Did I wake you up?
No.
No, no.
News?
No.
No, I was just leaving a message on Robert's phone which is ridiculous because he hasn't got his phone with him.
And I know that.
Just turning into a madwoman.
No.
No, when things get tricky in my life, I talk to my fish.
I have a pond.
Talking to an answering machine is no madder than chatting to koi carp.
I just somehow wouldn't associate you with having a tricky life.
Well, it wouldn't do to talk about your emotions with a colleague, would it, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
No, I think...
I think things are beyond tricky, really.
They have been for some time.
Mary's in Geneva.
I'm here.
The koi carp are alone in Surrey.
We got married very young.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't really know things were hard.
No, don't apologize.
There's always hope.
For me and for you.
Do you know, I can't even remember what he looks like.
Not exactly.
But I'm stuck, and I can't move on.
Does that make any sense?
Yes.
Totally.
I feel a bit like I've been stuck for years.
Yes, but you can move on.
Well, I suppose in theory.
You should be happy, Fred.
I knew you'd have a pond.
The traitor has had his chance.
You know what to do.
Do not fail us.
I think the idea of taking Scottish salmon to a foreign country is absolutely absurd.
These fish have been running these rivers for tens of thousands of years.
I've fished the rivers of Scotland all my life.
Yes, Prime Minister.
It would appear that the gentle fisherfolk are not so effing gentle after all.
Rape and pillage of our national rivers...
What, ditch the whole thing?
No.
No, no, no, Prime Minister.
No, we must just find the fish somewhere bloody else.
Your turrets are blocking my reception.
Well, I'm terribly sorry about that, madam.
If you'd care to follow me, please.
Mrs. Maxwell.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- It's an honor.
Happy birthday, Patricia.
Yes, we could do with a few more like you in Cabinet.
Very good, Your Excellency.
I'm grateful, indeed, that you could spare some time for our little project.
Yes.
Well, we have gone out on a bit of a limb for you, Your Excellency, but the Prime Minister does love his fishing.
- Really?
- Yes.
Rod's never out of his hand.
Anyway, down to business.
The fish.
The salmon.
We're not gonna get it out of British waters.
There's a bloody big fuss about it, as no doubt you've heard.
Don't know what it is about fishing.
Anyway, no-goer.
- Yes, but I thought...
- However,
I have solved your problem.
See?
There must be thousands in this one alone.
This guy's got four fish farms up and down the coast.
Stocks all the Tescos.
Right under your nose.
These fish were bred for the dinner table.
It's barbaric.
They've never run in their lives.
Neither have their forebears for two generations.
Why would they run for us?
The difference in these salmon...
We'd open the sluices and they would just drift off downstream never to be seen again.
Well, get a couple of days fishing out of it, then just re-stock or whatever the word is.
Seems to be no shortage of them.
In transit for the supermarkets.
These fish will never run.
They're just not right.
Not right?
Well, a fish is a fish is a fish, isn't it?
No.
You see, Mrs. Maxwell, I have a vision.
Tired, bloated pretenders are not part of this vision.
Well, unfortunately, Her Majesty's Government also has a vision, and that vision is farmed fish or no fish.
Then I must thank you for your precious time.
And decline.
No advisers, either.
Back at your desk on Monday, Fred.
Well, in that case, I resign.
Resignation accepted.
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.
So, this leaves us with what?
Well, with no salmon.
We must have faith, Dr. Alfred.
Well, that's a very laudable sentiment, Your Excellency, but we're running out of time.
Can't catch faith with a fishing rod.
Hello, Fred.
Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I didn't think he looked right, that man.
And he pulled out a gun!
Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Alfred.
Thank you very much.
Don't be silly.
Don't be silly.
It was only a cast, really.
A very good cast.
An essential cast, one might say.
Yes, I suppose one might say that.
- Here.
- My God, Fred.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
It was very quick.
It was over in a flash, really.
How did you do that?
I did a right-handed snake roll.
Did I get him?
Yes, it was extraordinary.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you very much.
Please, continue your work as if nothing had happened.
Of course, of course.
I owe you my life.
No.
Please, come on.
Anyone would have...
This is not one of those British metaphors, Dr. Alfred.
The debt will be repaid.
- Bye, now.
- Goodbye.
Bye.
In response to the Right Honorable Member's question of the 7th of last month, the Ministry of Defense can now confirm that an engagement by British Special Forces against known terrorists did occur on the 13th of September.
The details of this operation are classified.
However, I am at liberty to say that serious casualties were incurred by the British forces.
I deeply regret to inform the House that there were no survivors.
An internal investigation is being carried out.
Sorry to wake you up.
- No, don't be.
- It's just...
It's okay.
It's just...
I just never got the chance to really know him.
Mary?
Fred?
There you are.
I had no idea you were...
I got a day off and thought, "Why not surprise him?"
I've got this wonderful Swiss mountain Comté from a little shop round the corner in Geneva.
Is everything all right, Fred?
Where's your suit and tie?
Day off?
I resigned.
Don't be ridiculous.
You've resigned?
What about your pension?
It's final salary.
Well, the government pulled out of the salmon fishing project and we'd put a lot of time and energy into it.
I didn't want to walk away from that.
Well?
Well, everyone involved.
I'm still being paid, if that's what you're worried about.
Fitzharris Price have been more than...
I might have known she'd be involved.
If you're referring to Harriet, we're working on the project together.
Of course she's involved.
- Harriet?
- What do you mean exactly by that, Mary?
I've seen her photograph on the Fitzharris Price website.
You're making a fool of yourself.
Now it's you that's being ridiculous.
Am I'.?
I'm not the one abandoning a decent, highly respected job for a joke fishing project and a short-skirted office girl.
- She's not an office girl.
- What is she, then, Fred?
Hey?
Just what is she?
She's a colleague.
- She's a very talented colleague and...
- And?
And a friend!
She's just a friend!
Are you in love with her?
I've done nothing, Mary.
I have no expectations.
I didn't ask about your expectations.
I asked if you were in love with her.
This is a mid-life crisis.
It's textbook, it's pathetic.
I'm so sorry, Mary.
You'll be back, Fred.
Or you'll try.
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
You'd think a bloody scientist would know that much!
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
We don't need native river fish.
We'll be all right with farmed salmon.
I know.
I don't much like them, but...
Well, they will run.
I know it.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Despite our moral and philosophical objections, farmed salmon will run.
I'm absolutely sure of it.
You are tireless, Doctor.
You have uncovered some new research?
A new paper, perhaps?
No, I just know it.
You just know it.
I see.
Faith, Dr. Alfred.
Damn it.
Yes, all right, then, faith.
So?
They're alive.
That hurts!
Sorry, sweetie.
- Mrs. Maxwell?
- What?
Amazing news.
One of the officers presumed dead,
Captain Robert Mayers, has been found alive.
- Good.
- Yes, we're very pleased.
Yes, very good.
It's very good news for the family.
And his girlfriend, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who else knows about this?
You're the first to know.
Right, keep it that way.
Total press embargo.
Do you understand?
- Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
- That salmon fishing thing.
Is that still happening?
As far as I'm aware.
- It is?
- Yes.
- Yemen?
- Yes.
Perfect.
Yes, this is all coming together very nicely.
I intended to create a small miracle.
Something to glorify God and bring our tribes together.
Sometimes I wonder if we haven't created something that glorifies man.
It is a very fine line.
Hubris, Dr. Alfred.
Hubris.
- It's nice here.
- Beautiful.
You know, Fred, this project, it saved me.
I think.
You know, with everything that happened.
So those farmed fish had better run.
- I believe they will.
- You do?
Yes, I believe that it's in the very core of their being to head upstream even if they never have, even if the parent fish never have.
Look at this.
Look at that.
Mary said something about me.
She said that I was genetically programmed to return to a dull pedestrian life with her.
That it was in my DNA.
Do you think that you are?
No.
No, I belong here.
I always have done.
- Harriet.
- Yes.
I was wondering about you and me.
The theoretical possibility in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is a theoretical possibility.
Obviously.
Or salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Yes.
- Yes?
- Yes.
I just need a little time.
Of course, of course.
All the time you want.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Mr. Foreign Secretary.
- Brian Fleet.
The great fisherman.
The great...
Well, it has been a little while, to be honest.
A bit rusty, you know.
Some skills are never forgotten.
Please, follow this man to your tent.
I shall join you shortly.
What have you been saying?
Fishing's the last thing anyone's gonna be interested in, trust me.
Get ready for the photo op of a lifetime, Sonny Jim.
N-S-R.
No salmon required.
Is that a Woolly Jones?
No, this is a new one I've invented.
IS it?
What's it called?
This one is called the Chetwode-Talbot Beauty.
That's very nice.
It's true.
You're not being funny?
No, I don't have a sense of humor, as you recall.
That is true.
- Beautiful.
- Yes, she is.
Here.
Thank you.
Don't you think we should be doing something, Fred?
Preparing?
L am preparing...
Well, for the whole thing, you know.
Everything's done, Harriet, it's fine.
Just relax.
Did you just...
Dr. Alfred Jones just told me to relax.
What is the world coming to?
Oh, my God.
Harriet.
Right, Harriet and Robert...
Right, okay.
Shut up, hacks.
No military stuff.
It's classified.
Anyway, I don't think you'd understand it.
The only thing you need to know is that this man, Captain Mayers here, is a war hero.
Human interest stuff only.
Sir.
Harriet, can you tell us how it feels?
It feels like it's a...
It's a...
It's a shock, but it's wonderful.
Please can we have a kiss?
Go on.
Come on.
I am sorry, my friend.
No-No, it's...
It's a miracle.
Indeed.
Nevertheless, I'm sorry.
All right, gentlemen, gentlemen, I think that's all.
A little privacy for the couple, please.
I'd just like to say that the British government is proud to have played a small but significant part in this extraordinary reunion of Harriet and Captain Mayers.
That's what we're here for.
This is strange.
Bad strange?
No, good strange.
Do you mind if we don't...
No, of course not.
There's no rush.
Will you just hold me?
How did you get caught up in this, H?
Salmon fishing out here?
It's ridiculous.
Well, you never know with the sheikh.
I expect there will be a six-star hotel and a golf course before you know it.
That's not his style at all.
Don't you believe it.
He's gotta make his money back somehow.
They're no fools, these Arabs.
You don't sleep, either?
No, not much.
Well...
At least there's no bloody journos around at this time, anyway.
You've been very good to Harriet, Fred.
I appreciate it.
I love her.
Yeah, she's great.
She's really great.
No.
I love her.
Does she love you?
I don't know now.
Yesterday, you weren't alive.
Well, I apologize for not being dead in a ditch.
I don't think I can accept your apology.
Is that a joke?
Yes, yes, sort of.
I'm not...
I've never been very good at jokes.
It's all right, Robert.
Really.
It's all right.
The day has arrived.
Before the dam, this was a dry riverbed.
And now, as you all can see, we have water.
And today, we hope we shall discover the one missing thing.
So, thank you, one and all, for coming as not one of you, not even my dear self, knows if this curious experiment of mine will actually work.
It better had bloody work.
Doesn't matter if it works or not, dolly.
All that matters is you.
Fishing on Sky tonight with our war hero.
- I haven't done this in years.
- For God's sake.
There are 10,000 fish in there.
If you can't hook one of them, you can just flip off back to Transport.
My intention is to color this desert in green.
Make an agricultural industry for my people, and the sons and daughters of my people for generations to come.
- Right on cue.
- So here we are,
Muslims, Christians and the odd heathen.
We are all gathered here in an act of faith.
And why not?
And now, the moment that we are all waiting for, the fruits of all our efforts.
The moment of truth.
Open the sluices.
Where's it going?
It's going the wrong way.
It's heading downstream.
Wait a minute.
It's turned around.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
- Look, they're going upstream.
- Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, my God, they're running.
Fred, look.
Look!
- They're running, Fred!
- They're running!
Blondie.
Come down here, come on.
Come down here now.
Look, we ought to get a picture of him with the sheikh.
- It's working, Your Excellency.
- It is.
They are running upstream, look!
Let's go fishing, Dr. Alfred.
Turn it on, dolly.
I need to get further out.
For God's sakes.
Come on, off you go!
Have you got that?
Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
But can we get them closer together?
God, I'll give it a go.
Robert, darling.
Can you come...
Can you turn around a bit?
I'm worried about what he's doing with his rod.
Lovely.
And, Brian, just a nice smile, that would be good.
Did you get that?
God, he's useless, isn't he?
More fun without waders, Dr. Alfred.
Yes.
I think I caught one, Dr. Alfred.
It's a beauty, Your Excellency.
Look out behind you!
Your Excellency, behind you!
Step UP...
No, you first!
I repay my debts, Dr. Alfred.
- Okay.
I'll pull you up.
After...
- Okay.
Here, Your Excellency, hold on.
Here, come on.
We won't need these any more.
I just don't understand who would do this.
Why would they do this?
I know who.
And I know why.
Can't you find them?
Arrest them?
What for?
Justice.
Justice.
I think these destroyers...
Bad men, certainly.
But I think perhaps they have a point.
I expected people to understand what we were doing here.
I expected them to see that it was really not about fishing at all.
In the end, I asked for too much.
Will you try again?
The question is "Will we try again?"
This was ours.
Yes, I think maybe Robert wants to go home.
So, I don't...
I don't know.
Does home call, Dr. Fred?
I don't really have a home any more.
There was a moment when I had everything, but...
Well, now I don't know what to do.
When the time comes, you will know.
Well, until then.
Thank you.
Just gonna say goodbye to Fred.
Are you sure?
Sorry?
Listen, Harriet.
When I was in the desert, the only thing that kept me going was the thought of you.
You don't owe me anything.
I want you to understand that.
So...
We're going.
I'm so sorry, Fred.
It was an extraordinary idea.
It almost worked, too.
I wasn't talking about the project.
No, I'm not sure that I was.
I never meant to hurt you like this.
It's not your fault.
I don't know what to do.
I can't help you there, I'm afraid.
Are you going to stay?
Stay for what?
There's nothing here any more.
Not you, not a single fish left in the river.
Well, someone's gonna have to make a move.
Good luck, Harriet.
Dr. Alfred, look!
They're alive!
I'm going to stay.
I want to start again.
I'll do it on my own if I have to.
I'll start small, though, this time.
A different approach.
Just a few fish to begin with.
Involve the local community more.
Make it their project, not ours.
That's the way to protect it.
Do you need an assistant, Dr. Jones?
Well, I suppose I will.
I'm sure the sheikh has somebody that...
An assistant?
A partner.
A partner.
Yes, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
More than anything.
Dear Dr. Jones,
I act on behalf of a client with access to very substantial funds who has indicated a desire to sponsor a project to introduce salmon and the sport of salmon fishing into the Yemen.
I would like to seek a meeting with you to identify how this challenging project might be initiated and resourced.
I might add that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office supports the project as a symbol of Anglo-Yemeni cooperation.
Yours sincerely, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Ms.
Fitzharris Price Investment Consultants.
Night.
Have a good evening.
You, too.
Say hi to soldier boy.
We're just friends, you know.
We've only met a couple of times.
- Yeah, you tell me that on Monday.
- Shut up.
- Hello.
- Hi.
It's great to see you.
- Yes.
Me, too.
Sorry.
- Yes?
- Yes.
- You, too.
- No, "Yes" is a start, that's fine.
- Stop it, I'm so nervous.
Why are you nervous?
I don't know.
I'm trying to be very sophisticated and grown-up.
Right.
No, grown-up, absolutely.
Quite right, yeah.
- Harriet.
- Yes?
Last one to the restaurant pays.
What?
You bastard.
Dear Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, thank you for your e-mail.
As a fisheries specialist, permit me a word or two about salmon.
Migratory salmonoids require cool, well-oxygenated water in which to spawn.
In addition, in the early stages of the salmon's life cycle, a good supply of fly life indigenous to the northern European rivers is necessary for the juvenile salmon, or parr, to survive.
Some considerable distance from the Indian Ocean, or indeed the Red Sea, as I am sure you are aware, though apparently not the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
We conclude that conditions in the Yemen make this project unfeasible.
Fundamentally unfeasible.
Yes, yes.
Fundamentally unfeasible.
We therefore regret that we are unable to help you any further in this matter.
Yours, Alfred Jones, Doctor.
I've put duck liver pate in your sandwich.
That's lovely.
Righto.
I'm off to bed.
Already?
- Airport car's coming at 5:00.
- Righto.
I'll maybe have another wee pass at the caddis fly paper.
You could read it on the airplane.
Up to my ear in reports, darling.
I'll read it when I'm back.
Right, then.
Good night.
Oh, my God, I don't do this.
I don't do this.
No, I can tell.
I haven't done this in a really long time.
- Okay.
- I'm so shy.
- Okay.
No, I'll sleep on the sofa.
- No, I'm so shy.
Look, Harriet, I mean it.
I...
Shut up.
You were saying.
You're shy.
I am shy and quiet.
Like Hitler.
I'm serious.
Robert, I...
Don't do this and then forget me.
I just don't wanna be an army barracks joke in the morning.
Please be nice to me.
Harriet, I'm serious, too.
I mean it.
So if you want me to sleep on the sofa, then I'll...
If you say, Captain Mayers, one more time you'll sleep on the sofa, you'll bloody well sleep on the sofa.
Captain Robert Mayers, 3-6-4-7-7-2.
Maxwell.
Better be good.
Mrs. Maxwell, we have a situation.
- What?
- Code Red in Afghanistan.
Go to sleep.
Tell me that's not a mosque.
Well, it is a religious establishment...
- Of course it's a bloody mosque!
- Well, of course...
- What's up?
- Go to sleep.
- ...make this a joint operation.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The British have absolutely nothing to do with this whatsoever.
And I want every single man, woman, child and goat in Afghanistan to know that.
My God, I didn't think we could make the war in Afghanistan any less popular, but, hey, even I can be wrong.
We'll have Vera Lynn strapping on her suicide belt in sympathy next.
Bravo, the bloody Marines.
Right, you lot.
We need a good news story from the Middle East, a big one.
And we need it now.
You've got an hour, get on with it.
Good news, eh?
New girl band, Middle East tour.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Touch my body No, no...
Okay...
Maybe not.
No.
British trans-Arabian rally.
For God's sake.
Come on, come on.
Come up with something.
What's this?
A project to introduce salmon fishing to the Yemen.
Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Is that the best you puffed-up Oxbridge-educated moronic buffoons can come up with?
Yes?
Yes, Prime Minister.
Well, no, I'm working on it right now.
I think I may have come up with something that you'll like.
Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing.
Are you dollies trying to get me fired?
Well, here we go.
Fish it is
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Hello.
Mrs. Maxwell on line one, sir.
Busy.
She says it's urgent, sir.
Maxwell who?
The press officer to the Prime Minister, sir.
Patricia.
They haven't pensioned you off yet, then?
Listen, I got the heads-up from the FCO about this salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Fancy it?
- Well, I...
- We do.
Chasing a good news story out of the Middle East.
Anglo-Yemeni relations back on track.
Arab-Western cultural détente through the ancient sport of yanking poor sodding fish out of rivers.
What do you reckon?
Well, it's a bit of a long shot, to be honest.
Well, don't be honest.
Lunatic's an oil sheikh.
Got money pouring out of his arse.
Good friend of the West.
Good friend of the Party, too, so give it a go, eh, dolly?
Well, we'll certainly bend every sinew to the job, Patricia.
I'll set up a working party immediately.
- What?
- Hey!
Don't you "working party" me, you short-arsed little pen-pusher.
I did not say kick it into the long grass.
I said do it!
Yes, Patricia.
Right... away.
Mr. Jones?
Morning, Mr. Jones.
Good morning, Betty.
I trust you had a nice weekend.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Jones.
Mr. Sugden would like a word.
Would he indeed?
What do you think of that?
It's for the caddis fly report.
Need something racy for the cover.
Something to rev up the YouTube generation.
I know it's not quite what we would expect from a scientific paper, but we must keep up with the times, Mrs. Burnside.
Mr. Sugden asked to see you, Mr. Jones.
I'm not too sure that I don't have a picture of a caddis being eaten alive by a spider somewhere.
There it is.
That's a beauty.
What do you think about that for...
Good God.
Little too much, do you think?
No, not if you're making a horror film.
Look, this e-mail about the salmon thing.
Yes.
Did I miss April Fools' Day or something?
Did you like my little swipe at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wonks?
Yeah, well, I just had another E-mail from the FCO today.
Rattle their cage, did I?
Look, you wouldn't take a meeting with her, would you?
This Chetwode-Talbot woman.
She represents this Sheikh Muhammad bloke.
Why would I want to do that?
Why would I want to traipse across London to discuss that nonsense?
I've very important work to do here, as you can very well see.
Yeah, well, the FCO, in their infinite W, feel that a meeting on this is important business, too, Alfred.
Lord, the tendrils of this busybody government.
Dr. Jones, as your Operational Line Manager,
I am asking you with extreme prejudice to take a meeting with Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
I take it that's an order?
Take it how you wish.
Nazi.
Wanker.
Morning.
Dr. Jones?
Miss Chetwode-Talbot is expecting me.
Yes, it's a bit of a mouthful.
Do call me Harriet.
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Do you want to come with me?
Yes.
Do come in.
Please, sit down.
Yeah, anywhere you like.
Would you like tea or coffee?
No, thank you.
So...
Fitzharris Price represent the sheikh's assets in this country, including a number of estates in Scotland.
He's a very keen fisherman, so he asked us if we would...
- Water.
- Sorry?
Water, Miss Chetwode-Talbot.
H2O.
Do you want sparkling or still?
Not for me, for the fish.
Fish require water.
You are familiar with that concept?
Yes.
I am, yes.
So, to save us both a lot of time, let me keep this brief and simple.
Here it's very cold.
It rains a lot.
Here it's very hot.
It doesn't rain a lot.
Do you see the difference?
Well, you're pointing to Saudi Arabia, Dr. Jones, not the Yemen.
You seem to be deliberately missing the point.
With respect, not really.
You see, unlike Saudi Arabia, parts of the Yemen get up to 250 millimeters of rainfall a month in the wet season.
It gets the edge of the monsoon, you see.
And the dry season?
Well, interestingly, recent oil explorations have uncovered a number of very large freshwater aquifers, which could sort of recharge the wadi in the dry season using a dam.
I'm sure they could.
So, when he's built his dam, why don't you get back to me then?
Completed, couple of years ago.
Long-term plan is to irrigate thousands of acres of desert.
We could grow watermelons, maize, cotton.
Now you're going to tell me it isn't hot in the Yemen, too, aren't you?
Well, in the mountainous areas, the nighttime temperatures get down to well below 20 Celsius.
And, of course, I defer to your expert knowledge, Dr. Jones, but I do believe that Pacific salmon get as far south as California.
Temperatures are not too dissimilar there.
- Water.
- For the fish.
- No, for me.
- Of course.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Yes, Dr. Jones?
This is plainly ridiculous.
There's just no way that salmon can survive in those sort of environments.
If your sheikh wants to pour his money down the drain, why doesn't he buy himself a football club or something?
Look, Dr. Jones.
I don't really think it's my place to explain the sheikh's motivations.
But I will say this, that of all of our wealthy clients, he is different.
I would go so far as to describe him as a visionary man.
- A visionary?
- Yes, I know, it's not a very fashionable word, but if you decide to take this project with us, then you can judge for yourself when you meet him.
My line manager asked me to come here and take this meeting to discuss your project and that I have done.
I thank you for your time, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
I'll see myself out.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Did you get my e-mail?
Yes.
What did it say?
Took the meeting.
Waste of time, as predicted.
Now, if you don't mind, I'll get back to my work.
Dr. Jones.
What is this?
P45.
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't understand.
Well, a P45 is the official document given to an employee when his services are no longer required by his, or her, employer.
Yes, but, Bernard, this has got my...
Or you can sign this letter stating that you are delighted to assign yourself, exclusively, to the Yemeni salmon fishing project with immediate effect.
It's up to you.
But, Bernard, you know as well as I do this thing is a bloody joke.
There's no way you can get salmon that far up a...
Just there.
This is blackmail, Sugden.
This is a bloody outrage.
Fitzharris Price will be paying your salary while on secondment.
Almost double what it is now.
I'd say that's a bloody outrage.
Double?
Can I have time to think about this?
Nope.
- Can I borrow your pen?
- No.
It's my special one with the italic nib.
Hey.
Hold it, hold it.
Hold it.
Brian, what...
What have you got in bar seven?
I should have resigned.
You can't afford to resign.
Matter of principle.
I have a standing in the scientific community, Mary.
A reputation.
You have a mortgage.
Two, three, four.
Maybe I should resign.
We could have a baby.
Why not?
You could stay on at work and I could bring up the nipper.
I could take him to the park and to school.
I could take him fishing.
What do you think?
They're really losing the plot in Geneva.
One minute they're buying Euros, the next minute they can't ditch them fast enough for dollars.
They're panicking, and guess who they want to bail them out.
I can't imagine.
Say a command.
- Shut up.
- Say a command.
What were you shouting about back there?
Nothing.
Say a command.
Mar)'...
Oh, Lord.
Well, that should do you for a while.
Thank you, Mary.
Good night.
Night, dear.
Oh, Jesus.
Good morning.
Yes, Staff.
I've gotta go.
Now?
Yeah.
That was the call.
Sorry.
Is it Afghanistan?
It's somewhere sandy, that's for sure.
- I'll go get some tea.
- No, look...
- No, it's all right, Robert.
It's...
- No, no, come here.
Look, the last few weeks...
This is good.
Wonderful.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.
Will you wait for me?
Now go get that tea.
You bastard.
Well, firstly, we would need to trap 10,000 salmon from the North Sea, for the sake of argument, get them to the Yemen alive, don't ask me how, where they would be deposited in temperature and oxygen-controlled holding tanks built into a wadi
that would, hallelujah, open during the rainy season, allowing the salmon to migrate upstream for, say, 10 kilometers, which would allow your sheikh to hoick them out of the water to his heart's content.
Of course, until the dry season, when they will all
die.
Well, unless we feed the wadi all year round using the dam.
Of course.
Stupid idiot man.
Why not use precious water resources to support one man's sport fishing?
So, now that we have year-round water, why not build some gravel spawning grounds, breed the world's first Arabian salmon, and teach the clever fellows to migrate to the Indian Ocean...
Wonderful, wonderful idea.
Singing, "Step we gaily, here we go.
Heel for heel and toe for toe."
Rough cost?
Cost?
Cost.
Forty million.
No, 45...
- Fifty million.
- Dollars?
- Dollars.
- Dollars.
Or pounds.
Pounds.
At least.
So it's theoretically possible?
Well, it's theoretically possible in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is theoretically possible.
It's very impressive, Dr. Jones.
No, it's not.
It's nonsense.
Look, I just made it all up.
No, the drawing.
Real talent, if I might say so.
Excellent start.
So I suppose we should just crack on and get things started now?
You can't hold me to this.
I mean, these are just random ideas.
I mean, this is a sort of joke.
Well, I'm sure you wouldn't joke about a 50-million-pound project, Dr. Jones.
Not when you're in charge of it.
Well, the sheikh is so looking forward to meeting you, and he'll be back in the next couple of weeks.
So, in the meantime, is there anything else that I can do for you?
Well, as a matter of fact, there is.
Could you arrange a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
The one in China?
Is there another?
British Oxygen Company.
A meeting with them as well.
And then, what are those great big transport aircraft called?
The big Russian military...
Antonovs.
Find out about renting two of those, one for the fish and one to carry all the money that we're going to need.
When that's done, I'd be delighted to start working.
Good day, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good day, Dr. Jones.
Mary!
Up here.
Boy, did I put a hurricane up that Chetwode-Talbot woman.
You would have laughed.
I told her I wanted a meeting with the Three Gorges Dam team from...
Where are you going?
Geneva.
I told you.
You didn't say now.
Well, I am.
Tomorrow.
Well, how long are you going for?
Six weeks, to start with.
Six weeks?
There's no need to shout.
Six weeks, though, Mary.
This is a big chance for me.
I'll be heading up the whole operation.
Well, you could say "Congratulations."
Great.
Enough is enough.
It's job or marriage.
You've got to make a decision and make it now, God damn it.
There are planes, you know, Fred.
And I get Sundays off.
Mostly.
You can get all your horrible old fishing stuff out again.
Didn't even ask me.
Just went and did it.
I know.
I'm sorry.
It just suddenly seemed like the right decision.
Maybe for both of us.
Fred, I don't want to leave on bad terms.
No.
No.
I'll open a bottle of something fizzy.
Okay?
Reports are coming in from Afghanistan of a British soldier killed while on duty in Helmand Province.
An improvised explosive device detonated during a routine search in a local village.
This...
The Minister for Culture's been photographed doing what?
Naked or clothed?
Boy or girl?
How old?
Jesus.
Well, at least she's legal.
Press statement from us saying that we're a party of policy not personality, concentrating on the real issues of getting this country back on track in times of economic hardship and not tabloid sensationalism, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Meanwhile, get the useless arse on the front page of every paper apologizing for being born, big spread in Hello!
with blonde forgiving wife and cute kids.
If they're not cute, find a horse or something.
Joshua!
Hood.
Don't you suck your teeth at me, young man.
I'm not one of your bitches from the Baltimore low-rises.
You feel me?
I'm your fucking mother!
Got to go.
Meeting.
Dear Dr. Jones, the sheikh has requested your company at his estate in Glen Tulloch to discuss the salmon project further.
Please advise which dates would suit you best.
Many thanks, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Fitzharris Price.
Mr. Sugden would like to see you in the canteen, sir.
Up his arse with a meter ruler.
Thanks, Betty.
- Which one is he?
- Over here.
Fred.
Can I introduce Patricia Maxwell?
She is the Prime Minister's press officer.
Hello.
Fifty million from Sheikh Muhammad thingammy.
It's the first-stage payment on research development for the salmon fishing project.
The PM's keeping a close eye on this one.
It's just what we need right now, a bit of Anglo-Arab news that isn't about things that explode.
I want to know, is it a goer?
Goer?
Well, look, the complexities.
I mean, I barely know even where to begin, but, well, just for starters, we would need 10,000 live salmon.
Is 10,000 salmon a lot?
Well, if they're to come from British waters, and I don't see where else they're gonna come from.
I mean, you would need the permission of the Environment Agency.
That's your job, Bernard.
Okay, so you get on to the EA and get this man his salmon.
- Miss Maxwell.
Ms.
- Mrs. Happily married.
Details in Who's Who.
Mrs. Maxwell, there are two million fishermen in the UK who are, I would say, unusually protective of...
How many?
- Two million.
- Two million?
- Yes.
- Bloody hell.
Two million out there waving their little rods around?
Are they the kind that vote our way?
They vote for those that best look after their fish, in my experience.
I bet they do, I bet they do.
Right, so, Prime Minister on the front cover of Fishy Weekly or whatever.
Best friend of the British fisher folk.
Spearing a leaping salmon.
I like this.
I like it a lo'[.
They do have magazines, these people?
They can read?
Aye, the Angling Times, Trout and Salmon,
Coarse Fishing Monthly, Bassmania.
Bassmania?
Marvelous.
Marvelous.
That's marvelous.
This has just become a priority project.
Anything I can do, just give me a call.
Two million.
God, men, what a species.
I don't think she got the right end of the stick there.
Your call, I think, Bernard.
Ten thousand native Atlantic salmon on my desk by Friday, please.
Yeah, well, you'd just better come through on this, Jones.
It's been a long time since I was back.
- Yes?
- A long time.
You see?
- Is that where he lives?
- Yes.
He has many estates, but this one's his favorite.
- May I present Malcolm, the butler.
- Hello.
- This is Dr. Jones.
- Welcome to Glen Tulloch, sir.
His Excellency thought you might like to avail yourself of the fishing while you're waiting.
Thank you very much.
May I present Sheikh Muhammad bin Zaidi bani Tihama.
This is Dr. Jones.
It's a great pleasure to meet you, Your Excellency.
To meet the creator of the Woolly Jones, the pleasure's all mine, sir.
That's very kind.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, do you realize that for more than 10 years
I have fished with a Woolly Jones?
Really?
What's a Woolly Jones?
Dr. Jones invented a famous fly.
Well, it's a sentimental habit that some fly-tiers have of calling a fly after...
Anyway, I don't approve of that sort of thing normally, but...
Woolly Jones.
It's a great name.
A bloody good fly, that's for sure.
Please allow me to show you a delightful lie just around the corner.
Absolutely.
Lead on.
You think I'm mad?
- No, Your Excellency.
I...
- Of course you do.
I would question your judgment if you did not.
Though I have judgment enough to know that under there lies a fish much cleverer than I.
I'm a great admirer of the British for many reasons, but still there are mysteries to me.
The rich are frightened of the poor.
The poor are frightened of the rich.
And even your politicians, they try to sound like the people on the EastEnders.
A wonderful program, but still.
Yes, the great British class system.
Indeed.
But fishermen, I have noticed, they don't care whether I'm brown or white, rich or poor, wearing robes or waders.
All they care about is the fish, the river and the game we play.
For fishermen, the only virtues are patience, tolerance and humility.
I like this.
You are struck dumb by my naivety, Dr. Alfred.
No, you're on.
- What?
- You're on.
- This is a sign.
- A sign?
A sign that I should stop talking bollocks and fish.
Come here.
- Nicely done, sir.
- Thank you.
Very nicely done.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Hello, Dr. Jones.
Is that yours?
- The dress.
- Yes.
This is not mine.
It suits you very well.
Thank you.
They seem to know my size.
That not strike you as a wee bit sinister?
The idea of the sheikh's tailor tracking me across London with some kind of satellite measuring device?
They asked me for your size.
And I took a guess.
Well, for future reference,
I have a 32-inch waist, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
- Right.
- Not a 34.
No pies for me.
Note taken, sorry about that.
Thank you.
Ms. Harriet has told me of your marvelous plan.
Plan?
Well, not so much of a plan, really, as more of a feasibility study.
Theoretically possible, you said, Dr. Jones.
- Theoretically.
- Indeed.
It would be a miracle of God if it were to happen.
I'm more of a facts-and-figures man myself.
You're not a religious man?
No.
No, I'm not.
But you're a fisherman, Dr. Jones.
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
How many hours do you fish before you catch something?
Dozens?
Gosh, hundreds sometimes.
Is that a good use of your time for a facts-and-figures man?
But you persist in the wind and the rain and the cold with such poor odds of success.
Why?
Because you're a man of faith, Dr. Alfred.
And in the end, you are rewarded for your faith and constancy
With a fish.
With due respect, fishing and religion are hardly the same thing, Your Excellency.
With equal respect,
I have to disagree.
A toast?
To faith.
And fish.
To faith and fish.
To faith and fish.
And science.
And science.
You're unhappy tonight, Ms. Harriet?
No.
I'm fine, really.
I have too many wives not to know when a woman is unhappy.
Though mine are not so quiet about it.
Robert, he's my boyfriend, has just been posted to Afghanistan.
Or somewhere.
I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.
For how long?
They don't really tell us things like that.
How worrying.
I just try not to think about it.
- And you are married, Dr. Alfred?
- Indeed.
It is kind of her to spare you.
My wife's actually working abroad at the moment in Geneva, so...
So you two have more in common than one might suppose.
I have put my feet in it.
Please forgive me.
Perfect moment to retire to bed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
You're welcome.
- Dr. Alfred.
- Your Excellency.
I know you have been persuaded to help us, but unless you do this with an open heart,
I don't think anything will come of it.
So, please, consider.
Of course.
I hope we meet again.
Dr. Jones.
Yes?
Well, I was just wondering what you thought.
Well, the sheikh's English has a certain tendency towards the mystical, don't you think?
But then, doolally as this entire enterprise clearly is,
I've had the most pleasant day I can remember having for quite a long time.
So, if the sheikh is paying, as it were, on we go.
Great.
Good night, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good night, Dr. Jones.
It's been a pleasure.
Yes.
Have you any idea what an outcry there would be if the Environment Agency stripped British rivers of 10,000 salmon and shipped them off to the effing Yemen?
Well, how many can you spare?
None!
Christ, Bernard!
Anglers, they're obsessive crazies.
You think Al Qaeda are a threat, think again, mate.
I've seen a fly fisherman wade into a river and try and drown a canoeist just for passing by in a Day-Glo jacket.
You haven't got a hope in hell of getting these fish from British rivers.
- Yes?
- Dr. Jones.
Hello.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
How nice.
- Did we book a meeting?
- No.
You know how you said that you wanted a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
- Did I say that?
- Yes.
That might have been a little hasty.
- They're outside.
- Who?
The chief hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam.
Here?
I e-mailed them about the flow rate calculus, and I think there must have been some kind of...
My Mandarin is very rusty.
Bloody hell.
We are able to control the flow of water from the upstream dam.
But we are...
Well, we're concerned about the capability of the sandstone walls.
I mean, there's the possibility also of some flash-flood scenario.
Thank you very much.
My God, do you think we got away with it?
- Do you know, I think we did.
- I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
No, please don't apologize.
I think we've just found our engineers.
- Yes.
- I mean, should the project, of course, get that far.
Your Mandarin was much better than I expected.
- Thank you.
- Bernard Sugden, Head of Department.
Hello.
Alfred not bothering you too much, I hope?
No.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot from Fitzharris Price.
Hello.
Bet he doesn't even know your first name, does he?
So, who were all those little chippy-chappies?
Those are the engineers from the Three Gorges Dam.
What, the one in China?
- Is there another?
- Don't think there's another one.
Would have appreciated an introduction.
Bernard is the man who's responsible for acquiring our 10,000 native Atlantic salmon.
How's that coming along, Bernard?
Don't you worry about that, Fred.
It's all in hand.
Well, don't dilly-dally.
Our end is coming along.
- We're bang on schedule, in fact.
- Yes.
A debrief in the canteen, or has Fred brought in the famous sandwiches?
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot and I are going out for lunch, Bernard.
There's lots to discuss.
Clare, could you ask Betty to bring my bag?
Thank you.
Certainly, Dr. Jones.
Are you sure you won't have one?
At lunch time?
Dr. Jones, I haven't spoken a word of Mandarin for about four years, so I am celebrating even if you're not.
I only drink alcohol on the weekend.
And even then, only after 7:00.
No exceptions?
None that I can think of.
Well, yeah.
We got married on a Friday, but I think it was, as I recall, a bank holiday in Northern Ireland, so I allowed myself, I think, a glass on a technicality.
That was an attempt at a joke, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Right.
Good one.
Do you really think it's going extremely well?
- What?
- The project.
The project.
Well, it's utter nonsense, of course, naturally, the bagatelle of a man with more money than sense, but...
I haven't actually found anything to say that it couldn't work.
You know, theoretically, of course.
In theory.
Well, theoretically speaking, in theory it...
- We'll see, yes.
- Of course.
Actually, these are the companies that have bid for the contract to build the holding tanks at the downstream end of the wadi.
- Shall we go through these?
- Now?
Yes, we could go through them now.
Well, we could work and eat, no?
Yes, I...
Yes, all right, then.
- This one's from...
- Before that, cheers.
- Cheers.
- Very bad luck with water.
Some people think it's bad luck.
- EWB...
- Sorry.
Excuse me.
It's the barracks.
It's Robert.
- Sorry.
- No.
Go on.
- Hello.
- Go ahead.
Hello?
Yes?
What?
What?
Are you all right, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
He's missing in action.
What does that mean?
- Come upstairs and we'll get you your...
- No, I just need a minute.
Hello.
My name's Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Well, I only knew him for three weeks, but I am Robert's girlfriend.
I was wondering if you knew anything...
Of course.
Yes.
Sorry, Mrs. Mayers.
Yes, I...
Yes, of course.
Goodbye.
You've reached Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Leave a message after the beep.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, it's Dr. Jones here.
Please forgive me for calling you on your home number.
I was at something of a loss.
I realize that this has not been an easy week for you, but I was wondering when you might be coming back into the office.
I had a very productive meeting with the engineers from British Oxygen Company and, well, there's a lot of data coming in.
Really a considerable amount.
I'm sure I don't have to remind you that we are working to a deadline.
Time and tide, as I am sure you are aware, waits for no man.
Or woman.
Anyway, I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
Goodbye.
Can I come in?
Why?
Well, you might get cold.
- Very nice.
- What?
Your flat.
Very pleasant.
Look, I'm not...
I'm not coming into work, all right, because I need to stay here.
I need to be here in case there's news.
So, actually, anyone with a shred of understanding, or humanity, or simple feeling, who, frankly, wasn't suffering from some kind of Asperger's, would know that the last thing that I need
is your bullying little phone call asking me to come into work so that you can update me on fish.
You want to fill me in on fishing.
Well, Dr. Jones, you can take your work and you can shove it up your unfeeling arse.
I didn't come here to talk to you about work.
Then why are you here?
I made you a sandwich.
Why?
You're probably not eating.
Are you?
No.
You see, it's very important.
You must eat something.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Here.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do because...
I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
Call me Fred.
Just call me Fred.
- You're all right now?
- Yeah.
You all right?
- Sorry.
- No, don't.
Why don't I get a plate and we...
You can put this on a plate.
- Shall I do it?
- No, it's okay.
I'll do it.
I'm so sorry about what I said before.
That is just unforgivable.
The great thing about people with Asperger's is it's very difficult to hurt their feelings.
So it's all right, you can say whatever you like.
You don't have...
You know, I was upset.
And rightly so.
Look, I took the liberty of buying a wee bottle of wine.
Now, I hope you don't mind.
I know it's not the weekend, but this one goes very well with duck.
I'm not very hungry.
Harriet, you've got to try and eat...
Is it all right...
Is it all right for me to call you Harriet?
My father is...
He's ex-Army, so he's like very stiff upper lip and don't make a fuss about anything, but I'm more of a gusher.
I think that's his word for me, anyway.
My upper lip's never been very stiff, I'm afraid.
But you still have a boyfriend.
I mean, I don't know a great deal about such things, but...
Robert hasn't been listed as being dead, has he?
No.
But I just feel that "missing in action" is Army-speak for...
Dead?
No.
No, as a civil servant, I happen to know that the Ministry of Defense absolutely hate uncertainty of any kind.
If he were dead, they would simply say "dead."
Can you stop using that word, please?
- I beg your pardon.
- It's okay.
They say that they'll call when there's news.
But they don't, so I guess there isn't.
Come to the Yemen.
We're leaving tomorrow, just for a few days.
- Geological studies, engineering surveys.
- No.
We even have a team of archeologists checking we're not about to submerge the Ark of the Covenant, which would be unfortunate, you know.
No, I can't leave because there might be news and...
Well, then, you'll fly back on the sheikh's private jet immediately.
Why would he do that?
Because I asked him to.
Your services are very highly valued by the sheikh, and by me.
The project really can't do without you.
Who the hell cares?
Project?
I mean, it's fishing.
You know, who the hell cares?
Well, strangely enough, I do.
I mean, I know it's probably just a terrible folly, but, still, I can't help sometimes imagining that this crazy enterprise might just come off.
You know, with a bit of luck and with the right people.
And you, you are most definitely, most definitely one of the most rightest people that I've had the good fortune to come across.
If you'll forgive the grammatical inadequacies of that sentence.
Do you sometimes think that maybe we're just part of a lavish practical joke?
What do you mean?
Salmon, here?
Yes, I'm beginning to suppose that.
I don't know anyone that goes to church anymore.
I don't think I do, either.
On a Sunday, we go to Target.
You know, this gravel here is perfect for salmon to lay their eggs in between.
Who'd have thought that here in the middle of the Yemen, perfect spawning grounds for salmon?
Fred, look.
What?
Yes.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Harriet, the water.
- It's beautiful.
- It's cold.
The water in her well is cold.
Oh, my goodness.
It's really happening, Fred.
Oh, my goodness, it really is.
Unbelievable.
These men, they say that by bringing water, life, to this desert,
I am bringing the Western ways to our land.
They say I have insulted God himself.
I say they are fools.
A thousand apologies, my friends.
Please, this is not a way to introduce you to our great enterprise.
Look.
Is it not magnificent?
It's beautiful.
Certainly is.
Bloody amazing.
- Hello.
- Hello.
For the last time, Sugden, there is absolutely no way I can get you these fish.
Tom, this comes from the top.
The very top.
I don't care if God's taken up fly fishing.
Now, I suggest you make this work, Tom.
Is that a threat, Sugden?
These are difficult days, Tom.
Cuts.
Cuts everywhere.
I don't know.
Is the Environment Agency a front line service?
That is a threat.
See it as an opportunity.
Well, then.
An opportunity.
Hilary, get me Matthew Sweet from Fly Fishing Monthly, will you?
That's all I've been told, and so I...
Okay.
All right, then.
Well, please, please, please call me when...
Okay.
Bye.
I'm so sorry.
Did I wake you up?
No.
No, no.
News?
No.
No, I was just leaving a message on Robert's phone which is ridiculous because he hasn't got his phone with him.
And I know that.
Just turning into a madwoman.
No.
No, when things get tricky in my life, I talk to my fish.
I have a pond.
Talking to an answering machine is no madder than chatting to koi carp.
I just somehow wouldn't associate you with having a tricky life.
Well, it wouldn't do to talk about your emotions with a colleague, would it, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
No, I think...
I think things are beyond tricky, really.
They have been for some time.
Mary's in Geneva.
I'm here.
The koi carp are alone in Surrey.
We got married very young.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't really know things were hard.
No, don't apologize.
There's always hope.
For me and for you.
Do you know, I can't even remember what he looks like.
Not exactly.
But I'm stuck, and I can't move on.
Does that make any sense?
Yes.
Totally.
I feel a bit like I've been stuck for years.
Yes, but you can move on.
Well, I suppose in theory.
You should be happy, Fred.
I knew you'd have a pond.
The traitor has had his chance.
You know what to do.
Do not fail us.
I think the idea of taking Scottish salmon to a foreign country is absolutely absurd.
These fish have been running these rivers for tens of thousands of years.
I've fished the rivers of Scotland all my life.
Yes, Prime Minister.
It would appear that the gentle fisher folk are not so effing gentle after all.
Rape and pillage of our national rivers...
What, ditch the whole thing?
No.
No, no, no, Prime Minister.
No, we must just find the fish somewhere bloody else.
Your turrets are blocking my reception.
Well, I'm terribly sorry about that, madam.
If you'd care to follow me, please.
Mrs. Maxwell.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- It's an honor.
Happy birthday, Patricia.
Yes, we could do with a few more like you in Cabinet.
Very good, Your Excellency.
I'm grateful, indeed, that you could spare some time for our little project.
Yes.
Well, we have gone out on a bit of a limb for you, Your Excellency, but the Prime Minister does love his fishing.
- Really?
- Yes.
Rod's never out of his hand.
Anyway, down to business.
The fish.
The salmon.
We're not gonna get it out of British waters.
There's a bloody big fuss about it, as no doubt you've heard.
Don't know what it is about fishing.
Anyway, no-goer.
- Yes, but I thought...
- However,
I have solved your problem.
See?
There must be thousands in this one alone.
This guy's got four fish farms up and down the coast.
Stocks all the Tescos.
Right under your nose.
These fish were bred for the dinner table.
It's barbaric.
They've never run in their lives.
Neither have their forebears for two generations.
Why would they run for us?
The difference in these salmon...
We'd open the sluices and they would just drift off downstream never to be seen again.
Well, get a couple of days fishing out of it, then just re-stock or whatever the word is.
Seems to be no shortage of them.
In transit for the supermarkets.
These fish will never run.
They're just not right.
Not right?
Well, a fish is a fish is a fish, isn't it?
No.
You see, Mrs. Maxwell, I have a vision.
Tired, bloated pretenders are not part of this vision.
Well, unfortunately, Her Majesty's Government also has a vision, and that vision is farmed fish or no fish.
Then I must thank you for your precious time.
And decline.
No advisers, either.
Back at your desk on Monday, Fred.
Well, in that case, I resign.
Resignation accepted.
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.
So, this leaves us with what?
Well, with no salmon.
We must have faith, Dr. Alfred.
Well, that's a very laudable sentiment, Your Excellency, but we're running out of time.
Can't catch faith with a fishing rod.
Hello, Fred.
Sheikh Muhammad bin Zaidi bani Tihama!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I didn't think he looked right, that man.
And he pulled out a gun!
Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Alfred.
Thank you very much.
Don't be silly.
Don't be silly.
It was only a cast, really.
A very good cast.
An essential cast, one might say.
Yes, I suppose one might say that.
- Here.
- My God, Fred.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
It was very quick.
It was over in a flash, really.
How did you do that?
I did a right-handed snake roll.
Did I get him?
Yes, it was extraordinary.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you very much.
Please, continue your work as if nothing had happened.
Of course, of course.
I owe you my life.
No.
Please, come on.
Anyone would have...
This is not one of those British metaphors, Dr. Alfred.
The debt will be repaid.
- Bye, now.
- Goodbye.
Bye.
In response to the Right Honorable Member's question of the 7th of last month, the Ministry of Defense can now confirm that an engagement by British Special Forces against known terrorists did occur on the 13th of September.
The details of this operation are classified.
However, I am at liberty to say that serious casualties were incurred by the British forces.
I deeply regret to inform the House that there were no survivors.
An internal investigation is being carried out.
Sorry to wake you up.
- No, don't be.
- It's just...
It's okay.
It's just...
I just never got the chance to really know him.
Mary?
Fred?
There you are.
I had no idea you were...
I got a day off and thought, "Why not surprise him?"
I've got this wonderful Swiss mountain Comté from a little shop round the corner in Geneva.
Is everything all right, Fred?
Where's your suit and tie?
Day off?
I resigned.
Don't be ridiculous.
You've resigned?
What about your pension?
It's final salary.
Well, the government pulled out of the salmon fishing project and we'd put a lot of time and energy into it.
I didn't want to walk away from that.
Well?
Well, everyone involved.
I'm still being paid, if that's what you're worried about.
Fitzharris Price have been more than...
I might have known she'd be involved.
If you're referring to Harriet, we're working on the project together.
Of course she's involved.
- Harriet?
- What do you mean exactly by that, Mary?
I've seen her photograph on the Fitzharris Price website.
You're making a fool of yourself.
Now it's you that's being ridiculous.
Am I'.?
I'm not the one abandoning a decent, highly respected job for a joke fishing project and a short-skirted office girl.
- She's not an office girl.
- What is she, then, Fred?
Hey?
Just what is she?
She's a colleague.
- She's a very talented colleague and...
- And?
And a friend!
She's just a friend!
Are you in love with her?
I've done nothing, Mary.
I have no expectations.
I didn't ask about your expectations.
I asked if you were in love with her.
This is a mid-life crisis.
It's textbook, it's pathetic.
I'm so sorry, Mary.
You'll be back, Fred.
Or you'll try.
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
You'd think a bloody scientist would know that much!
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
We don't need native river fish.
We'll be all right with farmed salmon.
I know.
I don't much like them, but...
Well, they will run.
I know it.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Despite our moral and philosophical objections, farmed salmon will run.
I'm absolutely sure of it.
You are tireless, Doctor.
You have uncovered some new research?
A new paper, perhaps?
No, I just know it.
You just know it.
I see.
Faith, Dr. Alfred.
Damn it.
Yes, all right, then, faith.
So?
They're alive.
That hurts!
Sorry, sweetie.
- Mrs. Maxwell?
- What?
Amazing news.
One of the officers presumed dead,
Captain Robert Mayers, has been found alive.
- Good.
- Yes, we're very pleased.
Yes, very good.
It's very good news for the family.
And his girlfriend, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who else knows about this?
You're the first to know.
Right, keep it that way.
Total press embargo.
Do you understand?
- Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
- That salmon fishing thing.
Is that still happening?
As far as I'm aware.
- It is?
- Yes.
- Yemen?
- Yes.
Perfect.
Yes, this is all coming together very nicely.
I intended to create a small miracle.
Something to glorify God and bring our tribes together.
Sometimes I wonder if we haven't created something that glorifies man.
It is a very fine line.
Hubris, Dr. Alfred.
Hubris.
- It's nice here.
- Beautiful.
You know, Fred, this project, it saved me.
I think.
You know, with everything that happened.
So those farmed fish had better run.
- I believe they will.
- You do?
Yes, I believe that it's in the very core of their being to head upstream even if they never have, even if the parent fish never have.
Look at this.
Look at that.
Mary said something about me.
She said that I was genetically programmed to return to a dull pedestrian life with her.
That it was in my DNA.
Do you think that you are?
No.
No, I belong here.
I always have done.
- Harriet.
- Yes.
I was wondering about you and me.
The theoretical possibility in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is a theoretical possibility.
Obviously.
Or salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Yes.
- Yes?
- Yes.
I just need a little time.
Of course, of course.
All the time you want.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Mr. Foreign Secretary.
- Brian Fleet.
The great fisherman.
The great...
Well, it has been a little while, to be honest.
A bit rusty, you know.
Some skills are never forgotten.
Please, follow this man to your tent.
I shall join you shortly.
What have you been saying?
Fishing's the last thing anyone's gonna be interested in, trust me.
Get ready for the photo op of a lifetime, Sonny Jim.
N-S-R.
No salmon required.
Is that a Woolly Jones?
No, this is a new one I've invented.
IS it?
What's it called?
This one is called the Chetwode-Talbot Beauty.
That's very nice.
It's true.
You're not being funny?
No, I don't have a sense of humor, as you recall.
That is true.
- Beautiful.
- Yes, she is.
Here.
Thank you.
Don't you think we should be doing something, Fred?
Preparing?
I am preparing...
Well, for the whole thing, you know.
Everything's done, Harriet, it's fine.
Just relax.
Did you just...
Dr. Alfred Jones just told me to relax.
What is the world coming to?
Oh, my God.
Harriet.
Right, Harriet and Robert...
Right, okay.
Shut up, hacks.
No military stuff.
It's classified.
Anyway, I don't think you'd understand it.
The only thing you need to know is that this man, Captain Mayers here, is a war hero.
Human interest stuff only.
Sir.
Harriet, can you tell us how it feels?
It feels like it's a...
It's a...
It's a shock, but it's wonderful.
Please can we have a kiss?
Go on.
Come on.
I am sorry, my friend.
No-No, it's...
It's a miracle.
Indeed.
Nevertheless, I'm sorry.
All right, gentlemen, gentlemen, I think that's all.
A little privacy for the couple, please.
I'd just like to say that the British government is proud to have played a small but significant part in this extraordinary reunion of Harriet and Captain Mayers.
That's what we're here for.
This is strange.
Bad strange?
No, good strange.
Do you mind if we don't...
No, of course not.
There's no rush.
Will you just hold me?
How did you get caught up in this, H?
Salmon fishing out here?
It's ridiculous.
Well, you never know with the sheikh.
I expect there will be a six-star hotel and a golf course before you know it.
That's not his style at all.
Don't you believe it.
He's gotta make his money back somehow.
They're no fools, these Arabs.
You don't sleep, either?
No, not much.
Well...
At least there's no bloody journos around at this time, anyway.
You've been very good to Harriet, Fred.
I appreciate it.
I love her.
Yeah, she's great.
She's really great.
No.
I love her.
Does she love you?
I don't know now.
Yesterday, you weren't alive.
Well, I apologize for not being dead in a ditch.
I don't think I can accept your apology.
Is that a joke?
Yes, yes, sort of.
I'm not...
I've never been very good at jokes.
It's all right, Robert.
Really.
It's all right.
The day has arrived.
Before the dam, this was a dry riverbed.
And now, as you all can see, we have water.
And today, we hope we shall discover the one missing thing.
So, thank you, one and all, for coming as not one of you, not even my dear self, knows if this curious experiment of mine will actually work.
It better had bloody work.
Doesn't matter if it works or not, dolly.
All that matters is you.
Fishing on Sky tonight with our war hero.
- I haven't done this in years.
- For God's sake.
There are 10,000 fish in there.
If you can't hook one of them, you can just flip off back to Transport.
My intention is to color this desert in green.
Make an agricultural industry for my people, and the sons and daughters of my people for generations to come.
- Right on cue.
- So here we are,
Muslims, Christians and the odd heathen.
We are all gathered here in an act of faith.
And why not?
And now, the moment that we are all waiting for, the fruits of all our efforts.
The moment of truth.
Open the sluices.
Where's it going?
It's going the wrong way.
It's heading downstream.
Wait a minute.
It's turned around.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
- Look, they're going upstream.
- Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, my God, they're running.
Fred, look.
Look!
- They're running, Fred!
- They're running!
Blondie.
Come down here, come on.
Come down here now.
Look, we ought to get a picture of him with the sheikh.
- It's working, Your Excellency.
- It is.
They are running upstream, look!
Let's go fishing, Dr. Alfred.
Turn it on, dolly.
I need to get further out.
For God's sakes.
Come on, off you go!
Have you got that?
Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
But can we get them closer together?
God, I'll give it a go.
Robert, darling.
Can you come...
Can you turn around a bit?
I'm worried about what he's doing with his rod.
Lovely.
And, Brian, just a nice smile, that would be good.
Did you get that?
God, he's useless, isn't he?
More fun without waders, Dr. Alfred.
Yes.
I think I caught one, Dr. Alfred.
It's a beauty, Your Excellency.
Look out behind you!
Your Excellency, behind you!
Step UP...
No, you first!
I repay my debts, Dr. Alfred.
- Okay.
I'll pull you up.
After...
- Okay.
Here, Your Excellency, hold on.
Here, come on.
We won't need these anymore.
I just don't understand who would do this.
Why would they do this?
I know who.
And I know why.
Can't you find them?
Arrest them?
What for?
Justice.
Justice.
I think these destroyers...
Bad men, certainly.
But I think perhaps they have a point.
I expected people to understand what we were doing here.
I expected them to see that it was really not about fishing at all.
In the end, I asked for too much.
Will you try again?
The question is "Will we try again?"
This was ours.
Yes, I think maybe Robert wants to go home.
So, I don't...
I don't know.
Does home call, Dr. Fred?
I don't really have a home anymore.
There was a moment when I had everything, but...
Well, now I don't know what to do.
When the time comes, you will know.
Well, until then.
Thank you.
Just gonna say goodbye to Fred.
Are you sure?
Sorry?
Listen, Harriet.
When I was in the desert, the only thing that kept me going was the thought of you.
You don't owe me anything.
I want you to understand that.
So...
We're going.
I'm so sorry, Fred.
It was an extraordinary idea.
It almost worked, too.
I wasn't talking about the project.
No, I'm not sure that I was.
I never meant to hurt you like this.
It's not your fault.
I don't know what to do.
I can't help you there, I'm afraid.
Are you going to stay?
Stay for what?
There's nothing here anymore.
Not you, not a single fish left in the river.
Well, someone's gonna have to make a move.
Good luck, Harriet.
Dr. Alfred, look!
They're alive!
I'm going to stay.
I want to start again.
I'll do it on my own if I have to.
I'll start small, though, this time.
A different approach.
Just a few fish to begin with.
Involve the local community more.
Make it their project, not ours.
That's the way to protect it.
Do you need an assistant, Dr. Jones?
Well, I suppose I will.
I'm sure the sheikh has somebody that...
An assistant?
A partner.
A partner.
Yes, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
More than anything.
Dear Dr. Jones,
I act on behalf of a client with access to very substantial funds who has indicated a desire to sponsor a project to introduce salmon and the sport of salmon fishing into the Yemen.
I would like to seek a meeting with you to identify how this challenging project might be initiated and resourced.
I might add that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office supports the project as a symbol of Anglo-Yemeni cooperation.
Yours sincerely, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Ms.
Fitzharris Price Investment Consultants.
Night.
Have a good evening.
You, too.
Say hi to soldier boy.
We're just friends, you know.
We've only met a couple of times.
- Yeah, you tell me that on Monday.
- Shut up.
- Hello.
- Hi.
It's great to see you.
- Yes.
Me, too.
Sorry.
- Yes?
- Yes.
- You, too.
- No, "Yes" is a start, that's fine.
- Stop it, I'm so nervous.
Why are you nervous?
I don't know.
I'm trying to be very sophisticated and grown-up.
Right.
No, grown-up, absolutely.
Quite right, yeah.
- Harriet.
- Yes?
Last one to the restaurant pays.
What?
You bastard.
Dear Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, thank you for your e-mail.
As a fisheries specialist, permit me a word or two about salmon.
Migratory salmonoids require cool, well-oxygenated water in which to spawn.
In addition, in the early stages of the salmon's life cycle, a good supply of fly life indigenous to the northern European rivers is necessary for the juvenile salmon, or parr, to survive.
Some considerable distance from the Indian Ocean, or indeed the Red Sea, as I am sure you are aware, though apparently not the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
We conclude that conditions in the Yemen make this project unfeasible.
Fundamentally unfeasible.
Yes, yes.
Fundamentally unfeasible.
We therefore regret that we are unable to help you any further in this matter.
Yours, Alfred Jones, Doctor.
I've put duck liver pate in your sandwich.
That's lovely.
Righto.
I'm off to bed.
Already?
- Airport car's coming at 5:00.
- Righto.
I'll maybe have another wee pass at the caddis fly paper.
You could read it on the airplane.
Up to my ear in reports, darling.
I'll read it when I'm back.
Right, then.
Good night.
Oh, my God, I don't do this.
I don't do this.
No, I can tell.
I haven't done this in a really long time.
- Okay.
- I'm so shy.
- Okay.
No, I'll sleep on the sofa.
- No, I'm so shy.
Look, Harriet, I mean it.
I...
Shut up.
You were saying.
You're shy.
I am shy and quiet.
Like Hitler.
I'm serious.
Robert, I...
Don't do this and then forget me.
I just don't wanna be an army barracks joke in the morning.
Please be nice to me.
Harriet, I'm serious, too.
I mean it.
So if you want me to sleep on the sofa, then I'll...
If you say, Captain Mayers, one more time you'll sleep on the sofa, you'll bloody well sleep on the sofa.
Captain Robert Mayers, 3-6-4-7-7-2.
Maxwell.
Better be good.
Mrs. Maxwell, we have a situation.
- What?
- Code Red in Afghanistan.
Go to sleep.
Tell me that's not a mosque.
Well, it is a religious establishment...
- Of course it's a bloody mosque!
- Well, of course...
- What's up?
- Go to sleep.
- ...make this a joint operation.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The British have absolutely nothing to do with this whatsoever.
And I want every single man, woman, child and goat in Afghanistan to know that.
My God, I didn't think we could make the war in Afghanistan any less popular, but, hey, even I can be wrong.
We'll have Vera Lynn strapping on her suicide belt in sympathy next.
Bravo, the bloody Marines.
Right, you lot.
We need a good news story from the Middle East, a big one.
And we need it now.
You've got an hour, get on with it.
Good news, eh?
New girl band, Middle East tour.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Touch my body No, no...
Okay...
Maybe not.
No.
British trans-Arabian rally.
For God's sake.
Come on, come on.
Come up with something.
What's this?
A project to introduce salmon fishing to the Yemen.
Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Is that the best you puffed-up Oxbridge-educated moronic buffoons can come up with?
Yes?
Yes, Prime Minister.
Well, no, I'm working on it right now.
I think I may have come up with something that you'll like.
Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing.
Are you dollies trying to get me fired?
Well, here we go.
Fish it is.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Hello.
Mrs. Maxwell on line one, sir.
Busy.
She says it's urgent, sir.
Maxwell who?
The press officer to the Prime Minister, sir.
Patricia.
They haven't pensioned you off yet, then?
Listen, I got the heads-up from the FCO about this salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Fancy it?
- Well, I...
- We do.
Chasing a good news story out of the Middle East.
Anglo-Yemeni relations back on track.
Arab-Western cultural détente through the ancient sport of yanking poor sodding fish out of rivers.
What do you reckon?
Well, it's a bit of a long shot, to be honest.
Well, don't be honest.
Lunatic's an oil sheikh.
Got money pouring out of his arse.
Good friend of the West.
Good friend of the Party, too, so give it a go, eh, dolly?
Well, we'll certainly bend every sinew to the job, Patricia.
I'll set up a working party immediately.
- What?
- Hey!
Don't you "working party" me, you short-arsed little pen-pusher.
I did not say kick it into the long grass.
I said do it!
Yes, Patricia.
Right... away.
Mr. Jones?
Morning, Mr. Jones.
Good morning, Betty.
I trust you had a nice weekend.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Jones.
Mr. Sugden would like a word.
Would he indeed?
What do you think of that?
It's for the caddis fly report.
Need something racy for the cover.
Something to rev up the YouTube generation.
I know it's not quite what we would expect from a scientific paper, but we must keep up with the times, Mrs. Burnside.
Mr. Sugden asked to see you, Mr. Jones.
I'm not too sure that I don't have a picture of a caddis being eaten alive by a spider somewhere.
There it is.
That's a beauty.
What do you think about that for...
Good God.
Little too much, do you think?
No, not if you're making a horror film.
Look, this e-mail about the salmon thing.
Yes.
Did I miss April Fools' Day or something?
Did you like my little swipe at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wonks?
Yeah, well, I just had another e-mail from the FCO today.
Rattle their cage, did I?
Look, you wouldn't take a meeting with her, would you?
This Chetwode-Talbot woman.
She represents this Sheikh Muhammed bloke.
Why would I want to do that?
Why would I want to traipse across London to discuss that nonsense?
I've very important work to do here, as you can very well see.
Yeah, well, the FCO, in their infinite W, feel that a meeting on this is important business, too, Alfred.
Lord, the tendrils of this busybody government.
Dr. Jones, as your Operational Line Manager,
I am asking you with extreme prejudice to take a meeting with Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
I take it that's an order?
Take it how you wish.
Nazi.
Wanker.
Morning.
Dr. Jones?
Miss Chetwode-Talbot is expecting me.
Yes, it's a bit of a mouthful.
Do call me Harriet.
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Do you want to come with me?
Yes.
Do come in.
Please, sit down.
Yeah, anywhere you like.
Would you like tea or coffee?
No, thank you.
So...
Fitzharris Price represent the sheikh's assets in this country, including a number of estates in Scotland.
He's a very keen fisherman, so he asked us if we would...
- Water.
- Sorry?
Water, Miss Chetwode-Talbot.
H2O.
Do you want sparkling or still?
Not for me, for the fish.
Fish require water.
You are familiar with that concept?
Yes.
I am, yes.
So, to save us both a lot of time, let me keep this brief and simple.
Here it's very cold.
It rains a lot.
Here it's very hot.
It doesn't rain a lot.
Do you see the difference?
Well, you're pointing to Saudi Arabia, Dr. Jones, not the Yemen.
You seem to be deliberately missing the point.
With respect, not really.
You see, unlike Saudi Arabia, parts of the Yemen get up to 250 millimeters of rainfall a month in the wet season.
It gets the edge of the monsoon, you see.
And the dry season?
Well, interestingly, recent oil explorations have uncovered a number of very large freshwater aquifers, which could sort of recharge the wadi in the dry season using a dam.
I'm sure they could.
So, when he's built his dam, why don't you get back to me then?
Completed, couple of years ago.
Long-term plan is to irrigate thousands of acres of desert.
We could grow watermelons, maize, cotton.
Now you're going to tell me it isn't hot in the Yemen, too, aren't you?
Well, in the mountainous areas, the nighttime temperatures get down to well below 20 Celsius.
And, of course, I defer to your expert knowledge, Dr. Jones, but I do believe that Pacific salmon get as far south as California.
Temperatures are not too dissimilar there.
- Water.
- For the fish.
- No, for me.
- Of course.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Yes, Dr. Jones?
This is plainly ridiculous.
There's just no way that salmon can survive in those sort of environments.
If your sheikh wants to pour his money down the drain, why doesn't he buy himself a football club or something?
Look, Dr. Jones.
I don't really think it's my place to explain the sheikh's motivations.
But I will say this, that of all of our wealthy clients, he is different.
I would go so far as to describe him as a visionary man.
- A visionary?
- Yes, I know, it's not a very fashionable word, but if you decide to take this project with us, then you can judge for yourself when you meet him.
My line manager asked me to come here and take this meeting to discuss your project and that I have done.
I thank you for your time, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
I'll see myself out.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Did you get my e-mail?
Yes.
What did it say?
Took the meeting.
Waste of time, as predicted.
Now, if you don't mind, I'll get back to my work.
Dr. Jones.
What is this?
P45.
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't understand.
Well, a P45 is the official document given to an employee when his services are no longer required by his, or her, employer.
Yes, but, Bernard, this has got my...
Or you can sign this letter stating that you are delighted to assign yourself, exclusively, to the Yemeni salmon fishing project with immediate effect.
It's up to you.
But, Bernard, you know as well as I do this thing is a bloody joke.
There's no way you can get salmon that far up a...
Just there.
This is blackmail, Sugden.
This is a bloody outrage.
Fitzharris Price will be paying your salary while on secondment.
Almost double what it is now.
I'd say that's a bloody outrage.
Double?
Can I have time to think about this?
Nope.
- Can I borrow your pen?
- No.
It's my special one with the italic nib.
Hey.
Hold it, hold it.
Hold it.
Brian, what...
What have you got in bar seven?
I should have resigned.
You can't afford to resign.
Matter of principle.
I have a standing in the scientific community, Mary.
A reputation.
You have a mortgage.
Two, three, four.
Maybe I should resign.
We could have a baby.
Why not?
You could stay on at work and I could bring up the nipper.
I could take him to the park and to school.
I could take him fishing.
What do you think?
They're really losing the plot in Geneva.
One minute they're buying Euros, the next minute they can't ditch them fast enough for dollars.
They're panicking, and guess who they want to bail them out.
I can't imagine.
Say a command.
- Shut up.
- Say a command.
What were you shouting about back there?
Nothing.
Say a command.
Mar)'...
Oh, Lord.
Well, that should do you for a while.
Thank you, Mary.
Good night.
Night, dear.
Oh, Jesus.
Good morning.
Yes, Staff.
I've gotta go.
Now?
Yeah.
That was the call.
Sorry.
Is it Afghanistan?
It's somewhere sandy, that's for sure.
- I'll go get some tea.
- No, look...
- No, it's all right, Robert.
It's...
- No, no, come here.
Look, the last few weeks...
This is good.
Wonderful.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.
Will you wait for me?
Now go get that tea.
You bastard.
Well, firstly, we would need to trap 10,000 salmon from the North Sea, for the sake of argument, get them to the Yemen alive, don't ask me how, where they would be deposited in temperature and oxygen-controlled holding tanks built into a wadi
that would, hallelujah, open during the rainy season, allowing the salmon to migrate upstream for, say, 10 kilometers, which would allow your sheikh to hoick them out of the water to his heart's content.
Of course, until the dry season, when they will all
die.
Well, unless we feed the wadi all year round using the dam.
Of course.
Stupid idiot man.
Why not use precious water resources to support one man's sport fishing?
So, now that we have year-round water, why not build some gravel spawning grounds, breed the world's first Arabian salmon, and teach the clever fellows to migrate to the Indian Ocean...
Wonderful, wonderful idea.
Singing, "Step we gaily, here we go.
Heel for heel and toe for toe."
Rough cost?
Cost?
Cost.
Forty million.
No, 45...
- Fifty million.
- Dollars?
- Dollars.
- Dollars.
Or pounds.
Pounds.
At least.
So it's theoretically possible?
Well, it's theoretically possible in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is theoretically possible.
It's very impressive, Dr. Jones.
No, it's not.
It's nonsense.
Look, I just made it all up.
No, the drawing.
Real talent, if I might say so.
Excellent start.
So I suppose we should just crack on and get things started now?
You can't hold me to this.
I mean, these are just random ideas.
I mean, this is a sort of joke.
Well, I'm sure you wouldn't joke about a 50-million-pound project, Dr. Jones.
Not when you're in charge of it.
Well, the sheikh is so looking forward to meeting you, and he'll be back in the next couple of weeks.
So, in the meantime, is there anything else that I can do for you?
Well, as a matter of fact, there is.
Could you arrange a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
The one in China?
Is there another?
British Oxygen Company.
A meeting with them as well.
And then, what are those great big transport aircraft called?
The big Russian military...
Antonovs.
Find out about renting two of those, one for the fish and one to carry all the money that we're going to need.
When that's done, I'd be delighted to start working.
Good day, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good day, Dr. Jones.
Mary!
Up here.
Boy, did I put a hurricane up that Chetwode-Talbot woman.
You would have laughed.
I told her I wanted a meeting with the Three Gorges Dam team from...
Where are you going?
Geneva.
I told you.
You didn't say now.
Well, I am.
Tomorrow.
Well, how long are you going for?
Six weeks, to start with.
Six weeks?
There's no need to shout.
Six weeks, though, Mary.
This is a big chance for me.
I'll be heading up the whole operation.
Well, you could say "Congratulations."
Great.
Enough is enough.
It's job or marriage.
You've got to make a decision and make it now, God damn it.
There are planes, you know, Fred.
And I get Sundays off.
Mostly.
You can get all your horrible old fishing stuff out again.
Didn't even ask me.
Just went and did it.
I know.
I'm sorry.
It just suddenly seemed like the right decision.
Maybe for both of us.
Fred, I don't want to leave on bad terms.
No.
No.
I'll open a bottle of something fizzy.
Okay?
Reports are coming in from Afghanistan of a British soldier killed while on duty in Helmand Province.
An improvised explosive device detonated during a routine search in a local village.
This...
The Minister for Culture 's been photographed doing what?
Naked or clothed?
Boy or girl?
How old?
Jesus.
Well, at least she's legal.
Press statement from us saying that we're a party of policy not personality, concentrating on the real issues of getting this country back on track in times of economic hardship and not tabloid sensationalism, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Meanwhile, get the useless arse on the front page of every paper apologizing for being born, big spread in Hello!
with blonde forgiving wife and cute kids.
If they're not cute, find a horse or something.
Joshua!
Hood.
Don't you suck your teeth at me, young man.
I'm not one of your bitches from the Baltimore low-rises.
You feel me?
I'm your fucking mother!
Got to go.
Meeting.
Dear Dr. Jones, the sheikh has requested your company at his estate in Glen Tulloch to discuss the salmon project further.
Please advise which dates would suit you best.
Many thanks, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Fitzharris Price.
Mr. Sugden would like to see you in the canteen, sir.
Up his arse with a meter ruler.
Thanks, Betty.
- Which one is he?
- Over here.
Fred.
Can I introduce Patricia Maxwell?
She is the Prime Minister's press officer.
Hello.
Fifty million from Sheikh Muhammed thingammy.
It's the first-stage payment on research development for the salmon fishing project.
The PM's keeping a close eye on this one.
It's just what we need right now, a bit of Anglo-Arab news that isn't about things that explode.
I want to know, is it a goer?
Goer?
Well, look, the complexities.
I mean, I barely know even where to begin, but, well, just for starters, we would need 10,000 live salmon.
Is 10,000 salmon a lot?
Well, if they're to come from British waters, and I don't see where else they're gonna come from.
I mean, you would need the permission of the Environment Agency.
That's your job, Bernard.
Okay, so you get on to the EA and get this man his salmon.
- Miss Maxwell.
Ms.
- Mrs. Happily married.
Details in Who's Who.
Mrs. Maxwell, there are two million fishermen in the UK who are, I would say, unusually protective of...
How many?
- Two million.
- Two million?
- Yes.
- Bloody hell.
Two million out there waving their little rods around?
Are they the kind that vote our way?
They vote for those that best look after their fish, in my experience.
I bet they do, I bet they do.
Right, so, Prime Minister on the front cover of Fishy Weekly or whatever.
Best friend of the British fisherfolk.
Spearing a leaping salmon.
I like this.
I like it a lo'[.
They do have magazines, these people?
They can read?
Aye, the Angling Times, Trout and Salmon,
Coarse Fishing Monthly, Bassmania.
Bassmania?
Marvelous.
Marvelous.
That's marvelous.
This has just become a priority project.
Anything I can do, just give me a call.
Two million.
God, men, what a species.
I don't think she got the right end of the stick there.
Your call, I think, Bernard.
Ten thousand native Atlantic salmon on my desk by Friday, please.
Yeah, well, you'd just better come through on this, Jones.
It's been a long time since I was back.
- Yes?
- A long time.
You see?
- Is that where he lives?
- Yes.
He has many estates, but this one's his favorite.
- May I present Malcolm, the butler.
- Hello.
- This is Dr. Jones.
- Welcome to Glen Tulloch, sir.
His Excellency thought you might like to avail yourself of the fishing while you're waiting.
Thank you very much.
May I present Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama.
This is Dr. Jones.
It's a great pleasure to meet you, Your Excellency.
To meet the creator of the Woolly Jones, the pleasure's all mine, sir.
That's very kind.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, do you realize that for more than 10 years
I have fished with a Woolly Jones?
Really?
What's a Woolly Jones?
Dr. Jones invented a famous fly.
Well, it's a sentimental habit that some fly-tiers have of calling a fly after...
Anyway, I don't approve of that sort of thing normally, but...
Woolly Jones.
It's a great name.
A bloody good fly, that's for sure.
Please allow me to show you a delightful lie just around the corner.
Absolutely.
Lead on.
You think I'm mad?
- No, Your Excellency.
I...
- Of course you do.
I would question your judgment if you did not.
Though I have judgment enough to know that under there lies a fish much cleverer than I.
I'm a great admirer of the British for many reasons, but still there are mysteries to me.
The rich are frightened of the poor.
The poor are frightened of the rich.
And even your politicians, they try to sound like the people on the EastEnders.
A wonderful program, but still.
Yes, the great British class system.
Indeed.
But fishermen, I have noticed, they don't care whether I'm brown or white, rich or poor, wearing robes or waders.
All they care about is the fish, the river and the game we play.
For fishermen, the only virtues are patience, tolerance and humility.
I like this.
You are struck dumb by my naivety, Dr. Alfred.
No, you're on.
- What?
- You're on.
- This is a sign.
- A sign?
A sign that I should stop talking bollocks and fish.
Come here.
- Nicely done, sir.
- Thank you.
Very nicely done.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Hello, Dr. Jones.
Is that yours?
- The dress.
- Yes.
This is not mine.
It suits you very well.
Thank you.
They seem to know my size.
That not strike you as a wee bit sinister?
The idea of the sheikh's tailor tracking me across London with some kind of satellite measuring device?
They asked me for your size.
And I took a guess.
Well, for future reference,
I have a 32-inch waist, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
- Right.
- Not a 34.
No pies for me.
Note taken, sorry about that.
Thank you.
Ms. Harriet has told me of your marvelous plan.
Plan?
Well, not so much of a plan, really, as more of a feasibility study.
Theoretically possible, you said, Dr. Jones.
Theoretically.
Indeed.
It would be a miracle of God if it were to happen.
I'm more of a facts-and-figures man myself.
You're not a religious man?
No.
No, I'm not.
But you're a fisherman, Dr. Jones.
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
How many hours do you fish before you catch something?
Dozens?
Gosh, hundreds sometimes.
Is that a good use of your time for a facts-and-figures man?
But you persist in the wind and the rain and the cold with such poor odds of success.
Why?
Because you're a man of faith, Dr. Alfred.
And in the end, you are rewarded for your faith and constancy.
With a fish.
With due respect, fishing and religion are hardly the same thing, Your Excellency.
With equal respect,
I have to disagree.
A toast?
To faith.
And fish.
To faith and fish.
To faith and fish.
And science.
And science.
You're unhappy tonight, Ms. Harriet?
No.
I'm fine, really.
I have too many wives not to know when a woman is unhappy.
Though mine are not so quiet about it.
Robert, he's my boyfriend, has just been posted to Afghanistan.
Or somewhere.
I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.
For how long?
They don't really tell us things like that.
How worrying.
I just try not to think about it.
And you are married, Dr. Alfred?
Indeed.
It is kind of her to spare you.
My wife's actually working abroad at the moment in Geneva, so...
So you two have more in common than one might suppose.
I have put my feet in it.
Please forgive me.
Perfect moment to retire to bed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
You're welcome.
- Dr. Alfred.
- Your Excellency.
I know you have been persuaded to help us, but unless you do this with an open heart,
I don't think anything will come of it.
So, please, consider.
Of course.
I hope we meet again.
Dr. Jones.
Yes?
Well, I was just wondering what you thought.
Well, the sheikh's English has a certain tendency towards the mystical, don't you think?
But then, doolally as this entire enterprise clearly is,
I've had the most pleasant day I can remember having for quite a long time.
So, if the sheikh is paying, as it were, on we go.
Great.
Good night, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good night, Dr. Jones.
It's been a pleasure.
Yes.
Have you any idea what an outcry there would be if the Environment Agency stripped British rivers of 10,000 salmon and shipped them off to the effing Yemen?
Well, how many can you spare?
None!
Christ, Bernard!
Anglers, they're obsessive crazies.
You think AI Qaeda are a threat, think again, mate.
I've seen a fly fisherman wade into a river and try and drown a canoeist just for passing by in a Day-Glo jacket.
You haven't got a hope in hell of getting these fish from British rivers.
- Yes?
- Dr. Jones.
Hello.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
How nice.
- Did we book a meeting?
- No.
You know how you said that you wanted a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
- Did I say that?
- Yes.
That might have been a little hasty.
- They're outside.
- Who?
The chief hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam.
Here?
I e-mailed them about the flow rate calculus, and I think there must have been some kind of...
My Mandarin is very rusty.
Bloody hell.
We are able to control the flow of water from the upstream dam.
But we are...
Well, we're concerned about the capability of the sandstone walls.
I mean, there's the possibility also of some flash-flood scenario.
Thank you very much.
My God, do you think we got away with it?
- Do you know, I think we did.
- I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
No, please don't apologize.
I think we've just found our engineers.
- Yes.
- I mean, should the project, of course, get that far.
Your Mandarin was much better than I expected.
- Thank you.
- Bernard Sugden, Head of Department.
Hello.
Alfred not bothering you too much, I hope?
No.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot from Fitzharris Price.
Hello.
Bet he doesn't even know your first name, does he?
So, who were all those little chippy-chappies?
Those are the engineers from the Three Gorges Dam.
What, the one in China?
- Is there another?
- Don't think there's another one.
Would have appreciated an introduction.
Bernard is the man who's responsible for acquiring our 10,000 native Atlantic salmon.
How's that coming along, Bernard?
Don't you worry about that, Fred.
It's all in hand.
Well, don't dilly-dally.
Our end is coming along.
- We're bang on schedule, in fact.
- Yes.
A debrief in the canteen, or has Fred brought in the famous sandwiches?
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot and I are going out for lunch, Bernard.
There's lots to discuss.
Clare, could you ask Betty to bring my bag?
Thank you.
Certainly, Dr. Jones.
Are you sure you won't have one?
At lunch time?
Dr. Jones, I haven't spoken a word of Mandarin for about four years, so I am celebrating even if you're not.
I only drink alcohol on the weekend.
And even then, only after 7:00.
No exceptions?
None that I can think of.
Well, yeah.
We got married on a Friday, but I think it was, as I recall, a bank holiday in Northern Ireland, so I allowed myself, I think, a glass on a technicality.
That was an attempt at a joke, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Right.
Good one.
Do you really think it's going extremely well?
- What?
- The project.
The project.
Well, it's utter nonsense, of course, naturally, the bagatelle of a man with more money than sense, but...
I haven't actually found anything to say that it couldn't work.
You know, theoretically, of course.
In theory.
Well, theoretically speaking, in theory it...
- We'll see, yes.
- Of course.
Actually, these are the companies that have bid for the contract to build the holding tanks at the downstream end of the wadi.
- Shall we go through these?
- Now?
Yes, we could go through them now.
Well, we could work and eat, no?
Yes, I...
Yes, all right, then.
- This one's from...
- Before that, cheers.
- Cheers.
- Very bad luck with water.
Some people think it's bad luck.
- EWB...
- Sorry.
Excuse me.
It's the barracks.
It's Robert.
- Sorry.
- No.
Go on.
- Hello.
- Go ahead.
Hello?
Yes?
What?
What?
Are you all right, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
He's missing in action.
What does that mean?
- Come upstairs and we'll get you your...
- No, I just need a minute.
Hello.
My name's Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Well, I only knew him for three weeks, but I am Robert's girlfriend.
I was wondering if you knew anything...
Of course.
Yes.
Sorry, Mrs. Mayers.
Yes, I...
Yes, of course.
Goodbye.
You've reached Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Leave a message after the beep.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, it's Dr. Jones here.
Please forgive me for calling you on your home number.
I was at something of a loss.
I realize that this has not been an easy week for you, but I was wondering when you might be coming back into the office.
I had a very productive meeting with the engineers from British Oxygen Company and, well, there's a lot of data coming in.
Really a considerable amount.
I'm sure I don't have to remind you that we are working to a deadline.
Time and tide, as I am sure you are aware, waits for no man.
Or woman.
Anyway, I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
Goodbye.
Can I come in?
Why?
Well, you might get cold.
- Very nice.
- What?
Your flat.
Very pleasant.
Look, I'm not...
I'm not coming into work, all right, because I need to stay here.
I need to be here in case there's news.
So, actually, anyone with a shred of understanding, or humanity, or simple feeling, who, frankly, wasn't suffering from some kind of Asperger's, would know that the last thing that I need
is your bullying little phone call asking me to come into work so that you can update me on fish.
You want to fill me in on fishing.
Well, Dr. Jones, you can take your work and you can shove it up your unfeeling arse.
I didn't come here to talk to you about work.
Then why are you here?
I made you a sandwich.
Why?
You're probably not eating.
Are you?
No.
You see, it's very important.
You must eat something.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Here.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do because...
I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
Call me Fred.
Just call me Fred.
- You're all right now?
- Yeah.
You all right?
- Sorry.
- No, don't.
Why don't I get a plate and we...
You can put this on a plate.
- Shall I do it?
- No, it's okay.
I'll do it.
I'm so sorry about what I said before.
That is just unforgivable.
The great thing about people with Asperger's is it's very difficult to hurt their feelings.
So it's all right, you can say whatever you like.
You don't have...
You know, I was upset.
And rightly so.
Look, I took the liberty of buying a wee bottle of wine.
Now, I hope you don't mind.
I know it's not the weekend, but this one goes very well with duck.
I'm not very hungry.
Harriet, you've got to try and eat...
Is it all right...
Is it all right for me to call you Harriet?
My father is...
He's ex-Army, so he's like very stiff upper lip and don't make a fuss about anything, but I'm more of a gusher.
I think that's his word for me, anyway.
My upper lip's never been very stiff, I'm afraid.
But you still have a boyfriend.
I mean, I don't know a great deal about such things, but...
Robert hasn't been listed as being dead, has he?
No.
But I just feel that "missing in action" is Army-speak for...
Dead?
No.
No, as a civil servant, I happen to know that the Ministry of Defense absolutely hate uncertainty of any kind.
If he were dead, they would simply say "dead."
Can you stop using that word, please?
- I beg your pardon.
- It's okay.
They say that they'll call when there's news.
But they don't, so I guess there isn't.
Come to the Yemen.
We're leaving tomorrow, just for a few days.
- Geological studies, engineering surveys.
- No.
We even have a team of archeologists checking we're not about to submerge the Ark of the Covenant, which would be unfortunate, you know.
No, I can't leave because there might be news and...
Well, then, you'll fly back on the sheikh's private jet immediately.
Why would he do that?
Because I asked him to.
Your services are very highly valued by the sheikh, and by me.
The project really can't do without you.
Who the hell cares?
Project?
I mean, it's fishing.
You know, who the hell cares?
Well, strangely enough, I do.
I mean, I know it's probably just a terrible folly, but, still, I can't help sometimes imagining that this crazy enterprise might just come off.
You know, with a bit of luck and with the right people.
And you, you are most definitely, most definitely one of the most rightest people that I've had the good fortune to come across.
If you'll forgive the grammatical inadequacies of that sentence.
Do you sometimes think that maybe we're just part of a lavish practical joke?
What do you mean?
Salmon, here?
Yes, I'm beginning to suppose that.
I don't know anyone that goes to church any more.
I don't think I do, either.
On a Sunday, we go to Target.
You know, this gravel here is perfect for salmon to lay their eggs in between.
Who'd have thought that here in the middle of the Yemen, perfect spawning grounds for salmon?
Fred, look.
What?
Yes.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Harriet, the water.
- It's beautiful.
- It's cold.
The water in her well is cold.
Oh, my goodness.
It's really happening, Fred.
Oh, my goodness, it really is.
Unbelievable.
These men, they say that by bringing water, life, to this desert,
I am bringing the Western ways to our land.
They say I have insulted God himself.
I say they are fools.
A thousand apologies, my friends.
Please, this is not a way to introduce you to our great enterprise.
Look.
Is it not magnificent?
It's beautiful.
Certainly is.
Bloody amazing.
- Hello.
- Hello.
For the last time, Sugden, there is absolutely no way I can get you these fish.
Tom, this comes from the top.
The very top.
I don't care if God's taken up fly fishing.
Now, I suggest you make this work, Tom.
Is that a threat, Sugden?
These are difficult days, Tom.
Cuts.
Cuts everywhere.
I don't know.
Is the Environment Agency a frontline service?
That is a threat.
See it as an opportunity.
Well, then.
An opportunity.
Hilary, get me Matthew Sweet from Fly Fishing Monthly, will you?
That's all I've been told, and so I...
Okay.
All right, then.
Well, please, please, please call me when...
Okay.
Bye.
I'm so sorry.
Did I wake you up?
No.
No, no.
News?
No.
No, I was just leaving a message on Robert's phone which is ridiculous because he hasn't got his phone with him.
And I know that.
Just turning into a madwoman.
No.
No, when things get tricky in my life, I talk to my fish.
I have a pond.
Talking to an answering machine is no madder than chatting to koi carp.
I just somehow wouldn't associate you with having a tricky life.
Well, it wouldn't do to talk about your emotions with a colleague, would it, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
No, I think...
I think things are beyond tricky, really.
They have been for some time.
Mary's in Geneva.
I'm here.
The koi carp are alone in Surrey.
We got married very young.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't really know things were hard.
No, don't apologize.
There's always hope.
For me and for you.
Do you know, I can't even remember what he looks like.
Not exactly.
But I'm stuck, and I can't move on.
Does that make any sense?
Yes.
Totally.
I feel a bit like I've been stuck for years.
Yes, but you can move on.
Well, I suppose in theory.
You should be happy, Fred.
I knew you'd have a pond.
The traitor has had his chance.
You know what to do.
Do not fail us.
I think the idea of taking Scottish salmon to a foreign country is absolutely absurd.
These fish have been running these rivers for tens of thousands of years.
I've fished the rivers of Scotland all my life.
Yes, Prime Minister.
It would appear that the gentle fisherfolk are not so effing gentle after all.
Rape and pillage of our national rivers...
What, ditch the whole thing?
No.
No, no, no, Prime Minister.
No, we must just find the fish somewhere bloody else.
Your turrets are blocking my reception.
Well, I'm terribly sorry about that, madam.
If you'd care to follow me, please.
Mrs. Maxwell.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- It's an honor.
Happy birthday, Patricia.
Yes, we could do with a few more like you in Cabinet.
Very good, Your Excellency.
I'm grateful, indeed, that you could spare some time for our little project.
Yes.
Well, we have gone out on a bit of a limb for you, Your Excellency, but the Prime Minister does love his fishing.
- Really?
- Yes.
Rod's never out of his hand.
Anyway, down to business.
The fish.
The salmon.
We're not gonna get it out of British waters.
There's a bloody big fuss about it, as no doubt you've heard.
Don't know what it is about fishing.
Anyway, no-goer.
- Yes, but I thought...
- However,
I have solved your problem.
See?
There must be thousands in this one alone.
This guy's got four fish farms up and down the coast.
Stocks all the Tescos.
Right under your nose.
These fish were bred for the dinner table.
It's barbaric.
They've never run in their lives.
Neither have their forebears for two generations.
Why would they run for us?
The difference in these salmon...
We'd open the sluices and they would just drift off downstream never to be seen again.
Well, get a couple of days fishing out of it, then just re-stock or whatever the word is.
Seems to be no shortage of them.
In transit for the supermarkets.
These fish will never run.
They're just not right.
Not right?
Well, a fish is a fish is a fish, isn't it?
No.
You see, Mrs. Maxwell, I have a vision.
Tired, bloated pretenders are not part of this vision.
Well, unfortunately, Her Majesty's Government also has a vision, and that vision is farmed fish or no fish.
Then I must thank you for your precious time.
And decline.
No advisers, either.
Back at your desk on Monday, Fred.
Well, in that case, I resign.
Resignation accepted.
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.
So, this leaves us with what?
Well, with no salmon.
We must have faith, Dr. Alfred.
Well, that's a very laudable sentiment, Your Excellency, but we're running out of time.
Can't catch faith with a fishing rod.
Hello, Fred.
Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I didn't think he looked right, that man.
And he pulled out a gun!
Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Alfred.
Thank you very much.
Don't be silly.
Don't be silly.
It was only a cast, really.
A very good cast.
An essential cast, one might say.
Yes, I suppose one might say that.
- Here.
- My God, Fred.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
It was very quick.
It was over in a flash, really.
How did you do that?
I did a right-handed snake roll.
Did I get him?
Yes, it was extraordinary.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you very much.
Please, continue your work as if nothing had happened.
Of course, of course.
I owe you my life.
No.
Please, come on.
Anyone would have...
This is not one of those British metaphors, Dr. Alfred.
The debt will be repaid.
- Bye, now.
- Goodbye.
Bye.
In response to the Right Honorable Member's question of the 7th of last month, the Ministry of Defense can now confirm that an engagement by British Special Forces against known terrorists did occur on the 13th of September.
The details of this operation are classified.
However, I am at liberty to say that serious casualties were incurred by the British forces.
I deeply regret to inform the House that there were no survivors.
An internal investigation is being carried out.
Sorry to wake you up.
- No, don't be.
- It's just...
It's okay.
It's just...
I just never got the chance to really know him.
Mary?
Fred?
There you are.
I had no idea you were...
I got a day off and thought, "Why not surprise him?"
I've got this wonderful Swiss mountain Comté from a little shop round the corner in Geneva.
Is everything all right, Fred?
Where's your suit and tie?
Day off?
I resigned.
Don't be ridiculous.
You've resigned?
What about your pension?
It's final salary.
Well, the government pulled out of the salmon fishing project and we'd put a lot of time and energy into it.
I didn't want to walk away from that.
Well?
Well, everyone involved.
I'm still being paid, if that's what you're worried about.
Fitzharris Price have been more than...
I might have known she'd be involved.
If you're referring to Harriet, we're working on the project together.
Of course she's involved.
- Harriet?
- What do you mean exactly by that, Mary?
I've seen her photograph on the Fitzharris Price website.
You're making a fool of yourself.
Now it's you that's being ridiculous.
Am I'.?
I'm not the one abandoning a decent, highly respected job for a joke fishing project and a short-skirted office girl.
- She's not an office girl.
- What is she, then, Fred?
Hey?
Just what is she?
She's a colleague.
- She's a very talented colleague and...
- And?
And a friend!
She's just a friend!
Are you in love with her?
I've done nothing, Mary.
I have no expectations.
I didn't ask about your expectations.
I asked if you were in love with her.
This is a mid-life crisis.
It's textbook, it's pathetic.
I'm so sorry, Mary.
You'll be back, Fred.
Or you'll try.
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
You'd think a bloody scientist would know that much!
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
We don't need native river fish.
We'll be all right with farmed salmon.
I know.
I don't much like them, but...
Well, they will run.
I know it.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Despite our moral and philosophical objections, farmed salmon will run.
I'm absolutely sure of it.
You are tireless, Doctor.
You have uncovered some new research?
A new paper, perhaps?
No, I just know it.
You just know it.
I see.
Faith, Dr. Alfred.
Damn it.
Yes, all right, then, faith.
So?
They're alive.
That hurts!
Sorry, sweetie.
- Mrs. Maxwell?
- What?
Amazing news.
One of the officers presumed dead,
Captain Robert Mayers, has been found alive.
- Good.
- Yes, we're very pleased.
Yes, very good.
It's very good news for the family.
And his girlfriend, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who else knows about this?
You're the first to know.
Right, keep it that way.
Total press embargo.
Do you understand?
- Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
- That salmon fishing thing.
Is that still happening?
As far as I'm aware.
- It is?
- Yes.
- Yemen?
- Yes.
Perfect.
Yes, this is all coming together very nicely.
I intended to create a small miracle.
Something to glorify God and bring our tribes together.
Sometimes I wonder if we haven't created something that glorifies man.
It is a very fine line.
Hubris, Dr. Alfred.
Hubris.
- It's nice here.
- Beautiful.
You know, Fred, this project, it saved me.
I think.
You know, with everything that happened.
So those farmed fish had better run.
- I believe they will.
- You do?
Yes, I believe that it's in the very core of their being to head upstream even if they never have, even if the parent fish never have.
Look at this.
Look at that.
Mary said something about me.
She said that I was genetically programmed to return to a dull pedestrian life with her.
That it was in my DNA.
Do you think that you are?
No.
No, I belong here.
I always have done.
- Harriet.
- Yes.
I was wondering about you and me.
The theoretical possibility in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is a theoretical possibility.
Obviously.
Or salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Yes.
- Yes?
- Yes.
I just need a little time.
Of course, of course.
All the time you want.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Mr. Foreign Secretary.
- Brian Fleet.
The great fisherman.
The great...
Well, it has been a little while, to be honest.
A bit rusty, you know.
Some skills are never forgotten.
Please, follow this man to your tent.
I shall join you shortly.
What have you been saying?
Fishing's the last thing anyone's gonna be interested in, trust me.
Get ready for the photo op of a lifetime, Sonny Jim.
N-S-R.
No salmon required.
Is that a Woolly Jones?
No, this is a new one I've invented.
IS it?
What's it called?
This one is called the Chetwode-Talbot Beauty.
That's very nice.
It's true.
You're not being funny?
No, I don't have a sense of humor, as you recall.
That is true.
- Beautiful.
- Yes, she is.
Here.
Thank you.
Don't you think we should be doing something, Fred?
Preparing?
L am preparing...
Well, for the whole thing, you know.
Everything's done, Harriet, it's fine.
Just relax.
Did you just...
Dr. Alfred Jones just told me to relax.
What is the world coming to?
Oh, my God.
Harriet.
Right, Harriet and Robert...
Right, okay.
Shut up, hacks.
No military stuff.
It's classified.
Anyway, I don't think you'd understand it.
The only thing you need to know is that this man, Captain Mayers here, is a war hero.
Human interest stuff only.
Sir.
Harriet, can you tell us how it feels?
It feels like it's a...
It's a...
It's a shock, but it's wonderful.
Please can we have a kiss?
Go on.
Come on.
I am sorry, my friend.
No-No, it's...
It's a miracle.
Indeed.
Nevertheless, I'm sorry.
All right, gentlemen, gentlemen, I think that's all.
A little privacy for the couple, please.
I'd just like to say that the British government is proud to have played a small but significant part in this extraordinary reunion of Harriet and Captain Mayers.
That's what we're here for.
This is strange.
Bad strange?
No, good strange.
Do you mind if we don't...
No, of course not.
There's no rush.
Will you just hold me?
How did you get caught up in this, H?
Salmon fishing out here?
It's ridiculous.
Well, you never know with the sheikh.
I expect there will be a six-star hotel and a golf course before you know it.
That's not his style at all.
Don't you believe it.
He's gotta make his money back somehow.
They're no fools, these Arabs.
You don't sleep, either?
No, not much.
Well...
At least there's no bloody journos around at this time, anyway.
You've been very good to Harriet, Fred.
I appreciate it.
I love her.
Yeah, she's great.
She's really great.
No.
I love her.
Does she love you?
I don't know now.
Yesterday, you weren't alive.
Well, I apologize for not being dead in a ditch.
I don't think I can accept your apology.
Is that a joke?
Yes, yes, sort of.
I'm not...
I've never been very good at jokes.
It's all right, Robert.
Really.
It's all right.
The day has arrived.
Before the dam, this was a dry riverbed.
And now, as you all can see, we have water.
And today, we hope we shall discover the one missing thing.
So, thank you, one and all, for coming as not one of you, not even my dear self, knows if this curious experiment of mine will actually work.
It better had bloody work.
Doesn't matter if it works or not, dolly.
All that matters is you.
Fishing on Sky tonight with our war hero.
- I haven't done this in years.
- For God's sake.
There are 10,000 fish in there.
If you can't hook one of them, you can just flip off back to Transport.
My intention is to color this desert in green.
Make an agricultural industry for my people, and the sons and daughters of my people for generations to come.
- Right on cue.
- So here we are,
Muslims, Christians and the odd heathen.
We are all gathered here in an act of faith.
And why not?
And now, the moment that we are all waiting for, the fruits of all our efforts.
The moment of truth.
Open the sluices.
Where's it going?
It's going the wrong way.
It's heading downstream.
Wait a minute.
It's turned around.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
- Look, they're going upstream.
- Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, my God, they're running.
Fred, look.
Look!
- They're running, Fred!
- They're running!
Blondie.
Come down here, come on.
Come down here now.
Look, we ought to get a picture of him with the sheikh.
- It's working, Your Excellency.
- It is.
They are running upstream, look!
Let's go fishing, Dr. Alfred.
Turn it on, dolly.
I need to get further out.
For God's sakes.
Come on, off you go!
Have you got that?
Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
But can we get them closer together?
God, I'll give it a go.
Robert, darling.
Can you come...
Can you turn around a bit?
I'm worried about what he's doing with his rod.
Lovely.
And, Brian, just a nice smile, that would be good.
Did you get that?
God, he's useless, isn't he?
More fun without waders, Dr. Alfred.
Yes.
I think I caught one, Dr. Alfred.
It's a beauty, Your Excellency.
Look out behind you!
Your Excellency, behind you!
Step UP...
No, you first!
I repay my debts, Dr. Alfred.
- Okay.
I'll pull you up.
After...
- Okay.
Here, Your Excellency, hold on.
Here, come on.
We won't need these any more.
I just don't understand who would do this.
Why would they do this?
I know who.
And I know why.
Can't you find them?
Arrest them?
What for?
Justice.
Justice.
I think these destroyers...
Bad men, certainly.
But I think perhaps they have a point.
I expected people to understand what we were doing here.
I expected them to see that it was really not about fishing at all.
In the end, I asked for too much.
Will you try again?
The question is "Will we try again?"
This was ours.
Yes, I think maybe Robert wants to go home.
So, I don't...
I don't know.
Does home call, Dr. Fred?
I don't really have a home any more.
There was a moment when I had everything, but...
Well, now I don't know what to do.
When the time comes, you will know.
Well, until then.
Thank you.
Just gonna say goodbye to Fred.
Are you sure?
Sorry?
Listen, Harriet.
When I was in the desert, the only thing that kept me going was the thought of you.
You don't owe me anything.
I want you to understand that.
So...
We're going.
I'm so sorry, Fred.
It was an extraordinary idea.
It almost worked, too.
I wasn't talking about the project.
No, I'm not sure that I was.
I never meant to hurt you like this.
It's not your fault.
I don't know what to do.
I can't help you there, I'm afraid.
Are you going to stay?
Stay for what?
There's nothing here any more.
Not you, not a single fish left in the river.
Well, someone's gonna have to make a move.
Good luck, Harriet.
Dr. Alfred, look!
They're alive!
I'm going to stay.
I want to start again.
I'll do it on my own if I have to.
I'll start small, though, this time.
A different approach.
Just a few fish to begin with.
Involve the local community more.
Make it their project, not ours.
That's the way to protect it.
Do you need an assistant, Dr. Jones?
Well, I suppose I will.
I'm sure the sheikh has somebody that...
An assistant?
A partner.
A partner.
Yes, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
More than anything.
Dear Dr. Jones,
I act on behalf of a client with access to very substantial funds who has indicated a desire to sponsor a project to introduce salmon and the sport of salmon fishing into the Yemen.
I would like to seek a meeting with you to identify how this challenging project might be initiated and resourced.
I might add that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office supports the project as a symbol of Anglo-Yemeni cooperation.
Yours sincerely, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Ms.
Fitzharris Price Investment Consultants.
Night.
Have a good evening.
You, too.
Say hi to soldier boy.
We're just friends, you know.
We've only met a couple of times.
- Yeah, you tell me that on Monday.
- Shut up.
- Hello.
- Hi.
It's great to see you.
- Yes.
Me, too.
Sorry.
- Yes?
- Yes.
- You, too.
- No, "Yes" is a start, that's fine.
- Stop it, I'm so nervous.
Why are you nervous?
I don't know.
I'm trying to be very sophisticated and grown-up.
Right.
No, grown-up, absolutely.
Quite right, yeah.
- Harriet.
- Yes?
Last one to the restaurant pays.
What?
You bastard.
Dear Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, thank you for your e-mail.
As a fisheries specialist, permit me a word or two about salmon.
Migratory salmonoids require cool, well-oxygenated water in which to spawn.
In addition, in the early stages of the salmon's life cycle, a good supply of fly life indigenous to the northern European rivers is necessary for the juvenile salmon, or parr, to survive.
Some considerable distance from the Indian Ocean, or indeed the Red Sea, as I am sure you are aware, though apparently not the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
We conclude that conditions in the Yemen make this project unfeasible.
Fundamentally unfeasible.
Yes, yes.
Fundamentally unfeasible.
We therefore regret that we are unable to help you any further in this matter.
Yours, Alfred Jones, Doctor.
I've put duck liver pate in your sandwich.
That's lovely.
Righto.
I'm off to bed.
Already?
- Airport car's coming at 5:00.
- Righto.
I'll maybe have another wee pass at the caddis fly paper.
You could read it on the airplane.
Up to my ear in reports, darling.
I'll read it when I'm back.
Right, then.
Good night.
Oh, my God, I don't do this.
I don't do this.
No, I can tell.
I haven't done this in a really long time.
- Okay.
- I'm so shy.
- Okay.
No, I'll sleep on the sofa.
- No, I'm so shy.
Look, Harriet, I mean it.
I...
Shut up.
You were saying.
You're shy.
I am shy and quiet.
Like Hitler.
I'm serious.
Robert, I...
Don't do this and then forget me.
I just don't wanna be an army barracks joke in the morning.
Please be nice to me.
Harriet, I'm serious, too.
I mean it.
So if you want me to sleep on the sofa, then I'll...
If you say, Captain Mayers, one more time you'll sleep on the sofa, you'll bloody well sleep on the sofa.
Captain Robert Mayers, 3-6-4-7-7-2.
Maxwell.
Better be good.
Mrs. Maxwell, we have a situation.
- What?
- Code Red in Afghanistan.
Go to sleep.
Tell me that's not a mosque.
Well, it is a religious establishment...
- Of course it's a bloody mosque!
- Well, of course...
- What's up?
- Go to sleep.
-...make this a joint operation.
- No,no,no,no,no,no,no.
The British have absolutely nothing to do with this whatsoever.
And I want every single man, woman, child and goat in Afghanistan to know that.
My God, I didn't think we could make the war in Afghanistan any less popular, but, hey, even I can be wrong.
We'll have Vera Lynn strapping on her suicide belt in sympathy next.
Bravo, the bloody Marines.
Right, you lot.
We need a good news story from the Middle East, a big one.
And we need it now.
You've got an hour, get on with it.
Good news, eh?
New girl band, Middle East tour.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Touch my body No, no...
Okay-
Maybe not.
No.
British trans-Arabian rally.
For God's sake.
Come on, come on.
Come up with something.
What's this?
A project to introduce salmon fishing to the Yemen.
Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Is that the best you puffed-up Oxbridge-educated moronic buffoons can come up with?
Yes?
Yes, Prime Minister.
Well, no, I'm working on it right now.
I think I may have come up with something that you'll like.
Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing.
Are you dollies trying to get me fired?
Well, here we go.
Fish it is
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Hello.
Mrs. Maxwell on line one, sir.
Busy.
She says it's urgent, sir.
Maxwell who?
The press officer to the Prime Minister, sir.
Patricia.
They haven't pensioned you off yet, then?
Listen, I got the heads-up from the FCO about this salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Fancy it?
- Well, I...
- We do.
Chasing a good news story out of the Middle East.
Anglo-Yemeni relations back on track.
Arab-Western cultural détente through the ancient sport of yanking poor sodding fish out of rivers.
What do you reckon?
Well, it's a bit of a long shot, to be honest.
Well, don't be honest.
Lunatic's an oil sheikh.
Got money pouring out of his arse.
Good friend of the West.
Good friend of the Party, too, so give it a go, eh, dolly?
Well, we'll certainly bend every sinew to the job, Patricia.
I'll set up a working party immediately.
- What?
- Hey!
Don't you "working party" me, you short-arsed little pen-pusher.
I did not say kick it into the long grass.
I said do it!
Yes, Patricia.
Right away.
Mr. Jones?
Morning, Mr. Jones.
Good morning, Betty.
I trust you had a nice weekend.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Jones.
Mr. Sugden would like a word.
Would he indeed?
What do you think of that?
It's for the caddis fly report.
Need something racy for the cover.
Something to rev up the YouTube generation.
I know it's not quite what we would expect from a scientific paper, but we must keep up with the times, Mrs. Burnside.
Mr. Sugden asked to see you, Mr. Jones.
I'm not too sure that I don't have a picture of a caddis being eaten alive by a spider somewhere.
There it is.
That's a beauty.
What do you think about that for...
Good God.
Little too much, do you think?
No, not if you're making a horror film.
Look, this e-mail about the salmon thing.
Yes.
Did I miss April Fools' Day or something?
Did you like my little swipe at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wonks?
Yeah, well, I just had another e-mail from the FCO today.
Rattle their cage, did I?
Look, you wouldn't take a meeting with her, would you?
This Chetwode-Talbot woman.
She represents this Sheikh Muhammed bloke.
Why would I want to do that?
Why would I want to traipse across London to discuss that nonsense?
I've very important work to do here, as you can very well see.
Yeah, well, the FCO, in their infinite W, feel that a meeting on this is important business, too, Alfred.
Lord, the tendrils of this busybody government.
Dr. Jones, as your Operational Line Manager,
I am asking you with extreme prejudice to take a meeting with Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
I take it that's an order?
Take it how you wish.
Nazi.
Wanker.
Morning.
Dr. Jones?
Miss Chetwode-Talbot is expecting me.
Yes, it's a bit of a mouthful.
Do call me Harriet.
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Do you want to come with me?
Yes.
Do come in.
Please, sit down.
Yeah, anywhere you like.
Would you like tea or coffee?
No, thank you.
So...
Fitzharris Price represent the sheikh's assets in this country, including a number of estates in Scotland.
He's a very keen fisherman, so he asked us if we would...
- Water.
- Sorry?
Water, Miss Chetwode-Talbot.
H2O.
Do you want sparkling or still?
Not for me, for the fish.
Fish require water.
You are familiar with that concept?
Yes.
I am, yes.
So, to save us both a lot of time, let me keep this brief and simple.
Here it's very cold.
It rains a lot.
Here it's very hot.
It doesn't rain a lot.
Do you see the difference?
Well, you're pointing to Saudi Arabia, Dr. Jones, not the Yemen.
You seem to be deliberately missing the point.
With respect, not really.
You see, unlike Saudi Arabia, parts of the Yemen get up to 250 millimeters of rainfall a month in the wet season.
It gets the edge of the monsoon, you see.
And the dry season?
Well, interestingly, recent oil explorations have uncovered a number of very large freshwater aquifers, which could sort of recharge the wadi in the dry season using a dam.
I'm sure they could.
So, when he's built his dam, why don't you get back to me then?
Completed, couple of years ago.
Long-term plan is to irrigate thousands of acres of desert.
We could grow watermelons, maize, cotton.
Now you're going to tell me it isn't hot in the Yemen, too, aren't you?
Well, in the mountainous areas, the nighttime temperatures get down to well below 20 Celsius.
And, of course, I defer to your expert knowledge, Dr. Jones, but I do believe that Pacific salmon get as far south as California.
Temperatures are not too dissimilar there.
- Water.
- For the fish.
- No, for me.
- Of course.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Yes, Dr. Jones?
This is plainly ridiculous.
There's just no way that salmon can survive in those sort of environments.
If your sheikh wants to pour his money down the drain, why doesn't he buy himself a football club or something?
Look, Dr. Jones.
I don't really think it's my place to explain the sheikh's motivations.
But I will say this, that of all of our wealthy clients, he is different.
I would go so far as to describe him as a visionary man.
- A visionary?
- Yes, I know, it's not a very fashionable word, but if you decide to take this project with us, then you can judge for yourself when you meet him.
My line manager asked me to come here and take this meeting to discuss your project and that I have done.
I thank you for your time, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
I'll see myself out.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Did you get my e-mail?
Yes.
What did it say?
Took the meeting.
Waste of time, as predicted.
Now, if you don't mind, I'll get back to my work.
Dr. Jones.
What is this?
P45.
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't understand.
Well, a P45 is the official document given to an employee when his services are no longer required by his, or her, employer.
Yes, but, Bernard, this has got my...
Or you can sign this letter stating that you are delighted to assign yourself, exclusively, to the Yemeni salmon fishing project with immediate effect.
It's up to you.
But, Bernard, you know as well as I do this thing is a bloody joke.
There's no way you can get salmon that far up a...
Just there.
This is blackmail, Sugden.
This is a bloody outrage.
Fitzharris Price will be paying your salary while on secondment.
Almost double what it is now.
I'd say that's a bloody outrage.
Double?
Can I have time to think about this?
Nope.
- Can I borrow your pen?
- No.
It's my special one with the italic nib.
Hey.
Hold it, hold it.
Hold it.
Brian, what...
What have you got in bar seven?
I should have resigned.
You can't afford to resign.
Matter of principle.
I have a standing in the scientific community, Mary.
A reputation.
You have a mortgage.
Two, three, four.
Maybe I should resign.
We could have a baby.
Why not?
You could stay on at work and I could bring up the nipper.
I could take him to the park and to school.
I could take him fishing.
What do you think?
They're really losing the plot in Geneva.
One minute they're buying Euros, the next minute they can't ditch them fast enough for dollars.
They're panicking, and guess who they want to bail them out.
I can't imagine.
Say a command.
- Shut up.
- Say a command.
What were you shouting about back there?
Nothing.
Say a command.
Mar)'-
Oh, Lord.
Well, that should do you for a while.
Thank you, Mary.
Good night.
Night, dear.
Oh, Jesus.
Good morning.
Yes, Staff.
I've gotta go.
Now?
Yeah.
That was the call.
Sorry.
Is it Afghanistan?
It's somewhere sandy, that's for sure.
- I'll go get some tea.
- No, look...
- No, it's all right, Robert.
It's...
- No, no, come here.
Look, the last few weeks...
This is good.
Wonderful.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.
Will you wait for me?
Now go get that tea.
You bastard.
Well, firstly, we would need to trap 10,000 salmon from the North Sea, for the sake of argument, get them to the Yemen alive, don't ask me how, where they would be deposited in temperature and oxygen-controlled holding tanks built into a wadi
that would, hallelujah, open during the rainy season, allowing the salmon to migrate upstream for, say, 10 kilometers, which would allow your sheikh to hoick them out of the water to his heart's content.
Of course, until the dry season, when they will all
die.
Well, unless we feed the wadi all year round using the dam.
Of course.
Stupid idiot man.
Why not use precious water resources to support one man's sport fishing?
So, now that we have year-round water, why not build some gravel spawning grounds, breed the world's first Arabian salmon, and teach the clever fellows to migrate to the Indian Ocean...
Wonderful, wonderful idea.
...singing, "Step we gaily, here we go.
Heel for heel and toe for toe."
Rough cost?
Cost?
Cost.
Forty million.
No, 45...
- Fifty million.
- Dollars?
- Dollars.
- Dollars.
Or pounds.
Pounds.
At least.
So it's theoretically possible?
Well, it's theoretically possible in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is theoretically possible.
It's very impressive, Dr. Jones.
No, it's not.
It's nonsense.
Look, I just made it all up.
No, the drawing.
Real talent, if I might say so.
Excellent start.
So I suppose we should just crack on and get things started now?
You can't hold me to this.
I mean, these are just random ideas.
I mean, this is a sort of joke.
Well, I'm sure you wouldn't joke about a 50-million-pound project, Dr. Jones.
Not when you're in charge of it.
Well, the sheikh is so looking forward to meeting you, and he'll be back in the next couple of weeks.
So, in the meantime, is there anything else that I can do for you?
Well, as a matter of fact, there is.
Could you arrange a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
The one in China?
Is there another?
British Oxygen Company.
A meeting with them as well.
And then, what are those great big transport aircraft called?
The big Russian military...
Antonovs.
Find out about renting two of those, one for the fish and one to carry all the money that we're going to need.
When that's done, I'd be delighted to start working.
Good day, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good day, Dr. Jones.
Mary!
Up here.
Boy, did I put a hurricane up that Chetwode-Talbot woman.
You would have laughed.
I told her I wanted a meeting with the Three Gorges Dam team from...
Where are you going?
Geneva.
I told you.
You didn't say now.
Well, I am.
Tomorrow.
Well, how long are you going for?
Six weeks, to start with.
Six weeks?
There's no need to shout.
Six weeks, though, Mary.
This is a big chance for me.
I'll be heading up the whole operation.
Well, you could say "Congratulations."
Great.
Enough is enough.
It's job or marriage.
You've got to make a decision and make it now, God damn it.
There are planes, you know, Fred.
And I get Sundays off.
Mostly.
You can get all your horrible old fishing stuff out again.
Didn't even ask me.
Just went and did it.
I know.
I'm sorry.
It just suddenly seemed like the right decision.
Maybe for both of us.
Fred, I don't want to leave on bad terms.
No.
No.
I'll open a bottle of something fizzy.
Okay?
Reports are coming in from Afghanistan of a British soldier killed while on duty in Helmand Province.
An improvised explosive device detonated during a routine search in a local village.
This...
The Minister for Culture 's been photographed doing what?
Naked or clothed?
Boy or girl?
How old?
Jesus.
Well, at least she's legal.
Press statement from us saying that we're a party of policy not personality, concentrating on the real issues of getting this country back on track in times of economic hardship and not tabloid sensationalism, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Meanwhile, get the useless arse on the front page of every paper apologizing for being born, big spread in Hello!
with blonde forgiving wife and cute kids.
If they're not cute, find a horse or something.
Joshua!
Hood.
Don't you suck your teeth at me, young man.
I'm not one of your bitches from the Baltimore low-rises.
You feel me?
I'm your fucking mother!
Got to go.
Meeting.
Dear Dr. Jones, the sheikh has requested your company at his estate in Glen Tulloch to discuss the salmon project further.
Please advise which dates would suit you best.
Many thanks, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Fitzharris Price.
Mr. Sugden would like to see you in the canteen, sir.
Up his arse with a meter ruler.
Thanks, Betty.
- Which one is he?
- Over here.
Fred.
Can I introduce Patricia Maxwell?
She is the Prime Minister's press officer.
Hello.
Fifty million from Sheikh Muhammed thingammy.
It's the first-stage payment on research development for the salmon fishing project.
The PM's keeping a close eye on this one.
It's just what we need right now, a bit of Anglo-Arab news that isn't about things that explode.
I want to know, is it a goer?
Goer?
Well, look, the complexities.
I mean, I barely know even where to begin, but, well, just for starters, we would need 10,000 live salmon.
Is 10,000 salmon a lot?
Well, if they're to come from British waters, and I don't see where else they're gonna come from.
I mean, you would need the permission of the Environment Agency.
That's your job, Bernard.
Okay, so you get on to the EA and get this man his salmon.
- Miss Maxwell.
Ms.
- Mrs. Happily married.
Details in Who's Who.
Mrs. Maxwell, there are two million fishermen in the UK who are, I would say, unusually protective of...
How many?
- Two million.
- Two million?
- Yes.
- Bloody hell.
Two million out there waving their little rods around?
Are they the kind that vote our way?
They vote for those that best look after their fish, in my experience.
I bet they do, I bet they do.
Right, so, Prime Minister on the front cover of Fishy Weekly or whatever.
Best friend of the British fisherfolk.
Spearing a leaping salmon.
I like this.
I like it a lo'[.
They do have magazines, these people?
They can read?
Aye, the Angling Times, Trout and Salmon,
Coarse Fishing Monthly, Bassmania.
Bassmania?
Marvelous.
Marvelous.
That's marvelous.
This has just become a priority project.
Anything I can do, just give me a call.
Two million.
God, men, what a species.
I don't think she got the right end of the stick there.
Your call, I think, Bernard.
Ten thousand native Atlantic salmon on my desk by Friday, please.
Yeah, well, you'd just better come through on this, Jones.
It's been a long time since I was back.
- Yes?
- A long time.
You see?
- Is that where he lives?
- Yes.
He has many estates, but this one's his favorite.
- May I present Malcolm, the butler.
- Hello.
- This is Dr. Jones.
- Welcome to Glen Tulloch, sir.
His Excellency thought you might like to avail yourself of the fishing while you're waiting.
Thank you very much.
May I present Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama.
This is Dr. Jones.
It's a great pleasure to meet you, Your Excellency.
To meet the creator of the Woolly Jones, the pleasure's all mine, sir.
That's very kind.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, do you realize that for more than 10 years
I have fished with a Woolly Jones?
Really?
What's a Woolly Jones?
Dr. Jones invented a famous fly.
Well, it's a sentimental habit that some fly-tiers have of calling a fly after...
Anyway, I don't approve of that sort of thing normally, but...
Woolly Jones.
It's a great name.
A bloody good fly, that's for sure.
Please allow me to show you a delightful lie just around the corner.
Absolutely.
Lead on.
You think I'm mad?
- No, Your Excellency.
I...
- Of course you do.
I would question yourjudgment if you did not.
Though I have judgment enough to know that under there lies a fish much cleverer than I.
I'm a great admirer of the British for many reasons, but still there are mysteries to me.
The rich are frightened of the poor.
The poor are frightened of the rich.
And even your politicians, they try to sound like the people on the EastEnders.
A wonderful program, but still.
Yes, the great British class system.
Indeed.
But fishermen, I have noticed, they don't care whether I'm brown or white, rich or poor, wearing robes or waders.
All they care about is the fish, the river and the game we play.
For fishermen, the only virtues are patience, tolerance and humility.
I like this.
You are struck dumb by my naivety, Dr. Alfred.
No, you're on.
- What?
- You're on.
- This is a sign.
- A sign?
A sign that I should stop talking bollocks and fish.
Come here.
- Nicely done, sir.
- Thank you.
Very nicely done.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Hello, Dr. Jones.
Is that yours?
- The dress.
- Yes.
This is not mine.
It suits you very well.
Thank you.
They seem to know my size.
That not strike you as a wee bit sinister?
The idea of the sheikh's tailor tracking me across London with some kind of satellite measuring device?
They asked me for your size.
And I took a guess.
Well, for future reference,
I have a 32-inch waist, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
- Right.
- Not a 34.
No pies for me.
Note taken, sorry about that.
Thank you.
Ms. Harriet has told me of your marvelous plan.
Plan?
Well, not so much of a plan, really, as more of a feasibility study.
Theoretically possible, you said, Dr. Jones.
- Theoretically.
Jndeed.
It would be a miracle of God if it were to happen.
I'm more of a facts-and-figures man myself.
You're not a religious man?
No.
No, I'm not.
But you're a fisherman, Dr. Jones.
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
How many hours do you fish before you catch something?
Dozens?
Gosh, hundreds sometimes.
Is that a good use of your time for a facts-and-figures man?
But you persist in the wind and the rain and the cold with such poor odds of success.
Why?
Because you're a man of faith, Dr. Alfred.
And in the end, you are rewarded for your faith and constancy
With a fish.
With due respect, fishing and religion are hardly the same thing, Your Excellency.
With equal respect,
I have to disagree.
A toast?
To faith.
And fish.
To faith and fish.
To faith and fish.
And science.
And science.
You're unhappy tonight, Ms. Harriet?
No.
I'm fine, really.
I have too many wives not to know when a woman is unhappy.
Though mine are not so quiet about it.
Robert, he's my boyfriend, has just been posted to Afghanistan.
Or somewhere.
I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.
For how long?
They don't really tell us things like that.
How worrying.
I just try not to think about it.
- And you are married, Dr. Alfred?
Jndeed.
It is kind of her to spare you.
My wife's actually working abroad at the moment in Geneva, so...
So you two have more in common than one might suppose.
I have put my feet in it.
Please forgive me.
Perfect moment to retire to bed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
You're welcome.
- Dr. Alfred.
- Your Excellency.
I know you have been persuaded to help us, but unless you do this with an open heart,
I don't think anything will come of it.
So, please, consider.
Of course.
I hope we meet again.
Dr. Jones.
Yes?
Well, I was just wondering what you thought.
Well, the sheikh's English has a certain tendency towards the mystical, don't you think?
But then, doolally as this entire enterprise clearly is,
I've had the most pleasant day I can remember having for quite a long time.
So, if the sheikh is paying, as it were, on we go.
Great.
Good night, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good night, Dr. Jones.
It's been a pleasure.
Yes.
Have you any idea what an outcry there would be if the Environment Agency stripped British rivers of 10,000 salmon and shipped them off to the effing Yemen?
Well, how many can you spare?
None!
Christ, Bernard!
Anglers, they're obsessive crazies.
You think AI Qaeda are a threat, think again, mate.
I've seen a fly fisherman wade into a river and try and drown a canoeist just for passing by in a Day-Glo jacket.
You haven't got a hope in hell of getting these fish from British rivers.
- Yes?
- Dr. Jones.
Hello.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
How nice.
- Did we book a meeting?
- No.
You know how you said that you wanted a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
- Did I say that?
- Yes.
That might have been a little hasty.
- They're outside.
- Who?
The chief hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam.
Here?
I e-mailed them about the flow rate calculus, and I think there must have been some kind of...
My Mandarin is very rusty.
Bloody hell.
We are able to control the flow of water from the upstream dam.
But we are...
Well, we're concerned about the capability of the sandstone walls.
I mean, there's the possibility also of some flash-flood scenario.
Thank you very much.
My God, do you think we got away with it?
- Do you know, I think we did.
- I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
No, please don't apologize.
I think we've just found our engineers.
- Yes.
- I mean, should the project, of course, get that far.
Your Mandarin was much better than I expected.
- Thank you.
- Bernard Sugden, Head of Department.
Hello.
Alfred not bothering you too much, I hope?
No.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot from Fitzharris Price.
Hello.
Bet he doesn't even know your first name, does he?
So, who were all those little chippy-chappies?
Those are the engineers from the Three Gorges Dam.
What, the one in China?
- Is there another?
- Don't think there's another one.
Would have appreciated an introduction.
Bernard is the man who's responsible for acquiring our 10,000 native Atlantic salmon.
How's that coming along, Bernard?
Don't you worry about that, Fred.
It's all in hand.
Well, don't dilly-dally.
Our end is coming along.
- We're bang on schedule, in fact.
- Yes.
A debrief in the canteen, or has Fred brought in the famous sandwiches?
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot and I are going out for lunch, Bernard.
There's lots to discuss.
Clare, could you ask Betty to bring my bag?
Thank you.
Certainly, Dr. Jones.
Are you sure you won't have one?
At lunch time?
Dr. Jones, I haven't spoken a word of Mandarin for about four years, so I am celebrating even if you're not.
I only drink alcohol on the weekend.
And even then, only after 7:00.
No exceptions?
None that I can think of.
Well, yeah.
We got married on a Friday, but I think it was, as I recall, a bank holiday in Northern Ireland, so I allowed myself, I think, a glass on a technicality.
That was an attempt at a joke, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Right.
Good one.
Do you really think it's going extremely well?
- What?
- The project.
The project.
Well, it's utter nonsense, of course, naturally, the bagatelle of a man with more money than sense, but...
I haven't actually found anything to say that it couldn't work.
You know, theoretically, of course.
In theory.
Well, theoretically speaking, in theory it...
- We'll see, yes.
- Of course.
Actually, these are the companies that have bid for the contract to build the holding tanks at the downstream end of the wadi.
- Shall we go through these?
- Now?
Yes, we could go through them now.
Well, we could work and eat, no?
Yes, I...
Yes, all right, then.
- This one's from...
- Before that, cheers.
- Cheers.
- Very bad luck with water.
Some people think it's bad luck.
- EWB...
- Sorry.
Excuse me.
It's the barracks.
It's Robert.
- Sorry.
- No.
Go on.
- Hello.
- Go ahead.
Hello?
Yes?
What?
What?
Are you all right, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
He's missing in action.
What does that mean?
- Come upstairs and we'll get you your...
- No, I just need a minute.
Hello.
My name's Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Well, I only knew him for three weeks, but I am Robert's girlfriend.
I was wondering if you knew anything...
Of course.
Yes.
Sorry, Mrs. Mayers.
Yes, I...
Yes, of course.
Goodbye.
You've reached Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Leave a message after the beep.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, it's Dr. Jones here.
Please forgive me for calling you on your home number.
I was at something of a loss.
I realize that this has not been an easy week for you, but I was wondering when you might be coming back into the office.
I had a very productive meeting with the engineers from British Oxygen Company and, well, there's a lot of data coming in.
Really a considerable amount.
I'm sure I don't have to remind you that we are working to a deadline.
Time and tide, as I am sure you are aware, waits for no man.
Or woman.
Anyway, I look fon/vard to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
Goodbye.
Can I come in?
Why?
Well, you might get cold.
- Very nice.
- What?
Your flat.
Very pleasant.
Look, I'm not...
I'm not coming into work, all right, because I need to stay here.
I need to be here in case there's news.
So, actually, anyone with a shred of understanding, or humanity, or simple feeling, who, frankly, wasn't suffering from some kind of Asperger's, would know that the last thing that I need
is your bullying little phone call asking me to come into work so that you can update me on fish.
You want to fill me in on fishing.
Well, Dr. Jones, you can take your work and you can shove it up your unfeeling arse.
I didn't come here to talk to you about work.
Then why are you here?
I made you a sandwich.
Why?
You're probably not eating.
Are you?
No.
You see, it's very important.
You must eat something.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Here.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do because...
I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
Call me Fred.
Just call me Fred.
- You're all right now?
- Yeah.
You all right?
- Sorry.
- No,dont
Why don't I get a plate and we...
You can put this on a plate.
- Shall I do it?
- No, it's okay.
I'll do it.
I'm so sorry about what I said before.
That is just unforgivable.
The great thing about people with Asperger's is it's very difficult to hurt their feelings.
So it's all right, you can say whatever you like.
You don't have...
You know, I was upset.
And rightly so.
Look, I took the liberty of buying a wee bottle of wine.
Now, I hope you don't mind.
I know it's not the weekend, but this one goes very well with duck.
I'm not very hungry.
Harriet, you've got to try and eat...
Is it all right...
Is it all right for me to call you Harriet?
My father is...
He's ex-Army, so he's like very stiff upper lip and don't make a fuss about anything, but I'm more of a gusher.
I think that's his word for me, anyway.
My upper lip's never been very stiff, I'm afraid.
But you still have a boyfriend.
I mean, I don't know a great deal about such things, but...
Robert hasn't been listed as being dead, has he?
No.
But I just feel that "missing in action" is Army-speak for...
Dead?
No.
No, as a civil servant, I happen to know that the Ministry of Defense absolutely hate uncertainty of any kind.
If he were dead, they would simply say "dead."
Can you stop using that word, please?
- I beg your pardon.
- It's okay.
They say that they'll call when there's news.
But they don't, so I guess there isn't.
Come to the Yemen.
We're leaving tomorrow, just for a few days.
- Geological studies, engineering surveys.
- No.
We even have a team of archeologists checking we're not about to submerge the Ark of the Covenant, which would be unfortunate, you know.
No, I can't leave because there might be news and...
Well, then, you'll fly back on the sheikh's private jet immediately.
Why would he do that?
Because I asked him to.
Your services are very highly valued by the sheikh, and by me.
The project really can't do without you.
Who the hell cares?
Project?
I mean, it's fishing.
You know, who the hell cares?
Well, strangely enough, I do.
I mean, I know it's probably just a terrible folly, but, still, I can't help sometimes imagining that this crazy enterprise might just come off.
You know, with a bit of luck and with the right people.
And you, you are most definitely, most definitely one of the most rightest people that I've had the good fortune to come across.
If you'll forgive the grammatical inadequacies of that sentence.
Do you sometimes think that maybe we're just part of a lavish practical joke?
What do you mean?
Salmon, here?
Yes, I'm beginning to suppose that.
I don't know anyone that goes to church anymore.
I don't think I do, either.
On a Sunday, we go to Target.
You know, this gravel here is perfect for salmon to lay their eggs in between.
Who'd have thought that here in the middle of the Yemen, perfect spawning grounds for salmon?
Fred, look.
What?
Yes.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Harriet, the water.
- It's beautiful.
- It's cold.
The water in her well is cold.
Oh, my goodness.
It's really happening, Fred.
Oh, my goodness, it really is.
Unbelievable.
These men, they say that by bringing water, life, to this desert,
I am bringing the Western ways to our land.
They say I have insulted God himself.
I say they are fools.
A thousand apologies, my friends.
Please, this is not a way to introduce you to our great enterprise.
Look.
Is it not magnificent?
It's beautiful.
Certainly is.
Bloody amazing.
- Hello.
- Hello.
For the last time, Sugden, there is absolutely no way I can get you these fish.
Tom, this comes from the top.
The very top.
I don't care if God's taken up fly fishing.
Now, I suggest you make this work, Tom.
Is that a threat, Sugden?
These are difficult days, Tom.
Cuts.
Cuts everywhere.
I don't know. ls the Environment Agency a frontline service?
That is a threat.
See it as an opportunity.
Well, then.
An opportunity.
Hilary, get me Matthew Sweet from Fly Fishing Monthly, will you?
That's all I've been told, and so I...
Okay.
All right, then.
Well, please, please, please call me when...
Okay.
Bye.
I'm so sorry.
Did I wake you up?
No.
No, no.
News?
No.
No, I was just leaving a message on Robert's phone which is ridiculous because he hasn't got his phone with him.
And I know that.
Just turning into a madwoman.
No.
No, when things get tricky in my life, I talk to my fish.
I have a pond.
Talking to an answering machine is no madder than chatting to koi carp.
I just somehow wouldn't associate you with having a tricky life.
Well, it wouldn't do to talk about your emotions with a colleague, would it, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
No, I think...
I think things are beyond tricky, really.
They have been for some time.
Mary's in Geneva.
I'm here.
The koi carp are alone in Surrey.
We got married very young.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't really know things were hard.
No, don't apologize.
There's always hope.
For me and for you.
Do you know, I can't even remember what he looks like.
Not exactly.
But I'm stuck, and I can't move on.
Does that make any sense?
Yes.
Totally.
I feel a bit like I've been stuck for years.
Yes, but you can move on.
Well, I suppose in theory.
You should be happy, Fred.
I knew you'd have a pond.
The traitor has had his chance.
You know what to do.
Do not fail us.
I think the idea of taking Scottish salmon to a foreign country is absolutely absurd.
These fish have been running these rivers for tens of thousands of years.
I've fished the rivers of Scotland all my life.
Yes, Prime Minister.
It would appear that the gentle fisherfolk are not so effing gentle after all.
...rape and pillage of our national rivers...
What, ditch the whole thing?
No.
No, no, no, Prime Minister.
No, we mustjust find the fish somewhere bloody else.
Your turrets are blocking my reception.
Well, I'm terribly sorry about that, madam.
If you'd care to follow me, please.
Mrs. Maxwell.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- It's an honor.
Happy birthday, Patricia.
Yes, we could do with a few more like you in Cabinet.
Very good, Your Excellency.
I'm grateful, indeed, that you could spare some time for our little project.
Yes.
Well, we have gone out on a bit of a limb for you, Your Excellency, but the Prime Minister does love his fishing.
- Really?
- Yes.
Rod's never out of his hand.
Anyway, down to business.
The fish.
The salmon.
We're not gonna get it out of British waters.
There's a bloody big fuss about it, as no doubt you've heard.
Don't know what it is about fishing.
Anyway, no-goer.
- Yes, but I thought...
- However,
I have solved your problem.
See?
There must be thousands in this one alone.
This guy's got four fish farms up and down the coast.
Stocks all the Tescos.
Right under your nose.
These fish were bred for the dinner table.
It's barbaric.
They've never run in their lives.
Neither have their forebears for two generations.
Why would they run for us?
...the difference in these salmon...
We'd open the sluices and they would just drift off downstream never to be seen again.
Well, get a couple of days fishing out of it, then just re-stock or whatever the word is.
Seems to be no shortage of them.
...In transit for the supermarkets.
These fish will never run.
They're just not right.
Not right?
Well, a fish is a fish is a fish, isn't it?
No.
You see, Mrs. Maxwell, I have a vision.
Tired, bloated pretenders are not part of this vision.
Well, unfortunately, Her Majesty's Government also has a vision, and that vision is farmed fish or no fish.
Then I must thank you for your precious time.
And decline.
No advisers, either.
Back at your desk on Monday, Fred.
Well, in that case, I resign.
Resignation accepted.
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.
So, this leaves us with what?
Well, with no salmon.
We must have faith, Dr. Alfred.
Well, that's a very laudable sentiment, Your Excellency, but we're running out of time.
Can't catch faith with a fishing rod.
Hello, Fred.
Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I didn't think he looked right, that man.
And he pulled out a gun!
Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Alfred.
Thank you very much.
Don't be silly.
Don't be silly.
It was only a cast, really.
A very good cast.
An essential cast, one might say.
Yes, I suppose one might say that.
- Here.
- My God, Fred.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
It was very quick.
It was over in a flash, really.
How did you do that?
I did a right-handed snake roll.
Did I get him?
Yes, it was extraordinary.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you very much.
Please, continue your work as if nothing had happened.
Of course, of course.
I owe you my life.
No.
Please, come on.
Anyone would have...
This is not one of those British metaphors, Dr. Alfred.
The debt will be repaid.
- Bye, now.
- Goodbye.
Bye.
In response to the Right Honorable Member's question of the 7th of last month, the Ministry of Defense can now confirm that an engagement by British Special Forces against known terrorists did occur on the 13th of September.
The details of this operation are classified.
However, I am at liberty to say that serious casualties were incurred by the British forces.
I deeply regret to inform the House that there were no survivors.
An internal investigation is being carried out.
Sorry to wake you up.
- No, don't be.
- It's just...
It's okay.
It's just...
I just never got the chance to really know him.
Mary?
Fred?
There you are.
I had no idea you were...
I got a day off and thought, "Why not surprise him?"
I've got this wonderful Swiss mountain Comté from a little shop round the corner in Geneva.
Is everything all right, Fred?
Where's your suit and tie?
Day off?
I resigned.
Don't be ridiculous.
You've resigned?
What about your pension?
It's final salary.
Well, the government pulled out of the salmon fishing project and we'd put a lot of time and energy into it.
I didn't want to walk away from that.
Well?
Well, everyone involved.
I'm still being paid, if that's what you're worried about.
Fitzharris Price have been more than...
I might have known she'd be involved.
If you're referring to Harriet, we're working on the project together.
Of course she's involved.
- Harriet?
- What do you mean exactly by that, Mary?
I've seen her photograph on the Fitzharris Price website.
You're making a fool of yourself.
Now it's you that's being ridiculous.
Am I'.?
I'm not the one abandoning a decent, highly respected job for a joke fishing project and a short-skirted office girl.
- She's not an office girl.
- What is she, then, Fred?
Hey?
Just what is she?
She's a colleague.
- She's a very talented colleague and...
- And?
And a friend!
She's just a friend!
Are you in love with her?
I've done nothing, Mary.
I have no expectations.
I didn't ask about your expectations.
I asked if you were in love with her.
This is a mid-life crisis.
It's textbook, it's pathetic.
I'm so sorry, Mary.
You'll be back, Fred.
Or you'll try.
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
You'd think a bloody scientist would know that much!
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
We don't need native river fish.
We'll be all right with farmed salmon.
I know.
I don't much like them, but...
Well, they will run.
I know it.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Despite our moral and philosophical objections, farmed salmon will run.
I'm absolutely sure of it.
You are tireless, Doctor.
You have uncovered some new research?
A new paper, perhaps?
No, I just know it.
You just know it.
I see.
Faith, Dr. Alfred.
Damn it.
Yes, all right, then, faith.
So?
They're alive.
That hurts!
Sorry, sweetie.
- Mrs. Maxwell?
- What?
Amazing news.
One of the officers presumed dead,
Captain Robert Mayers, has been found alive.
- Good.
- Yes, we're very pleased.
Yes, very good.
It's very good news for the family.
And his girlfriend, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who else knows about this?
You're the first to know.
Right, keep it that way.
Total press embargo.
Do you understand?
- Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
- That salmon fishing thing.
Is that still happening?
As far as I'm aware.
- It is?
- Yes.
- Yemen?
- Yes.
Perfect.
Yes, this is all coming together very nicely.
I intended to create a small miracle.
Something to glorify God and bring our tribes together.
Sometimes I wonder if we haven't created something that glorifies man.
It is a very fine line.
Hubris, Dr. Alfred.
Hubris.
- It's nice here.
- Beautiful.
You know, Fred, this project, it saved me.
I think.
You know, with everything that happened.
So those farmed fish had better run.
- I believe they will.
- You do?
Yes, I believe that it's in the very core of their being to head upstream even if they never have, even if the parent fish never have.
Look at this.
Look at that.
Mary said something about me.
She said that I was genetically programmed to return to a dull pedestrian life with her.
That it was in my DNA.
Do you think that you are?
No.
No, I belong here.
I always have done.
- Harriet.
- Yes.
I was wondering about you and me.
The theoretical possibility in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is a theoretical possibility.
Obviously.
Or salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Yes.
- Yes?
- Yes.
I just need a little time.
Of course, of course.
All the time you want.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Mr. Foreign Secretary.
- Brian Fleet.
The great fisherman.
The great...
Well, it has been a little while, to be honest.
A bit rusty, you know.
Some skills are never forgotten.
Please, follow this man to your tent.
I shall join you shortly.
What have you been saying?
Fishing's the last thing anyone's gonna be interested in, trust me.
Get ready for the photo op of a lifetime, Sonny Jim.
N-S-R.
No salmon required.
Is that a Woolly Jones?
No, this is a new one I've invented.
IS it?
What's it called?
This one is called the Chetwode-Talbot Beauty.
That's very nice.
It's true.
You're not being funny?
No, I don't have a sense of humor, as you recall.
That is true.
- Beautiful.
- Yes, she is.
Here.
Thank you.
Don't you think we should be doing something, Fred?
Preparing?
L am preparing-
Well, for the whole thing, you know.
Everything's done, Harriet, it's fine.
Just relax.
Did you just...
Dr. Alfred Jones just told me to relax.
What is the world coming to?
Oh, my God.
Harriet.
Right, Harriet and Robert...
Right, okay.
Shut up, hacks.
No military stuff.
It's classified.
Anyway, I don't think you'd understand it.
The only thing you need to know is that this man, Captain Mayers here, is a war hero.
Human interest stuff only.
Sir.
Harriet, can you tell us how it feels?
It feels like it's a...
It's a...
It's a shock, but it's wonderful.
Please can we have a kiss?
Go on.
Come on.
I am sorry, my friend.
No
- No, it's- - -
It's a miracle.
Indeed.
Nevertheless, I'm sorry.
All right, gentlemen, gentlemen, I think that's all.
A little privacy for the couple, please.
I'd just like to say that the British government is proud to have played a small but significant part in this extraordinary reunion of Harriet and Captain Mayers.
That's what we're here for.
This is strange.
Bad strange?
No, good strange.
Do you mind if we don't...
No, of course not.
There's no rush.
Will you just hold me?
How did you get caught up in this, H?
Salmon fishing out here?
It's ridiculous.
Well, you never know with the sheikh.
I expect there will be a six-star hotel and a golf course before you know it.
That's not his style at all.
Don't you believe it.
He's gotta make his money back somehow.
They're no fools, these Arabs.
You don't sleep, either?
No, not much.
Well...
At least there's no bloody journos around at this time, anyway.
You've been very good to Harriet, Fred.
I appreciate it.
I love her.
Yeah, she's great.
She's really great.
No.
I love her.
Does she love you?
I don't know now.
Yesterday, you weren't alive.
Well, I apologize for not being dead in a ditch.
I don't think I can accept your apology.
Is that a joke?
Yes, yes, sort of.
I'm not...
I've never been very good at jokes.
It's all right, Robert.
Really.
It's all right.
The day has arrived.
Before the dam, this was a dry riverbed.
And now, as you all can see, we have water.
And today, we hope we shall discover the one missing thing.
So, thank you, one and all, for coming as not one of you, not even my dear self, knows if this curious experiment of mine will actually work.
It better had bloody work.
Doesn't matter if it works or not, dolly.
All that matters is you.
Fishing on Sky tonight with our war hero.
- I haven't done this in years.
- For God's sake.
There are 10,000 fish in there.
If you can't hook one of them, you can just flip off back to Transport.
My intention is to color this desert in green.
Make an agricultural industry for my people, and the sons and daughters of my people for generations to come.
- Right on cue.
- So here we are,
Muslims, Christians and the odd heathen.
We are all gathered here in an act of faith.
And why not?
And now, the moment that we are all waiting for, the fruits of all our efforts.
The moment of truth.
Open the sluices.
Where's it going?
It's going the wrong way.
It's heading downstream.
Wait a minute.
It's turned around.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
- Look, they're going upstream.
- Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, my God, they're running.
Fred, look.
Look!
- They're running, Fred!
- They're running!
Blondie.
Come down here, come on.
Come down here now.
Look, we ought to get a picture of him with the sheikh.
- It's working, Your Excellency.
- It is.
They are running upstream, look!
Let's go fishing, Dr. Alfred.
Turn it on, dolly.
I need to get further out.
For God's sakes.
Come on, off you go!
Have you got that?
Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
But can we get them closer together?
God, I'll give it a go.
Robert, darling.
Can you come...
Can you turn around a bit?
I'm worried about what he's doing with his rod.
Lovely.
And, Brian, just a nice smile, that would be good.
Did you get that?
God, he's useless, isn't he?
More fun without waders, Dr. Alfred.
Yes.
I think I caught one, Dr. Alfred.
It's a beauty, Your Excellency.
Look out behind you!
Your Excellency, behind you!
Step UP-
No, you first!
I repay my debts, Dr. Alfred.
- Okay.
I'll pull you up.
After...
- Okay.
Here, Your Excellency, hold on.
Here, come on.
We won't need these anymore.
I just don't understand who would do this.
Why would they do this?
I know who.
And I know why.
Can't you find them?
Arrest them?
What for?
Jusfice.
Jusfice.
I think these destroyers...
Bad men, certainly.
But I think perhaps they have a point.
I expected people to understand what we were doing here.
I expected them to see that it was really not about fishing at all.
In the end, I asked for too much.
Will you try again?
The question is "Will we try again?"
This was ours.
Yes, I think maybe Robert wants to go home.
So, I don't...
I don't know.
Does home call, Dr. Fred?
I don't really have a home anymore.
There was a moment when I had everything, but...
Well, now I don't know what to do.
When the time comes, you will know.
Well, until then.
Thank you.
Just gonna say goodbye to Fred.
Are you sure?
Sorry?
Listen, Harriet.
When I was in the desert, the only thing that kept me going was the thought of you.
You don't owe me anything.
I want you to understand that.
So...
We're going.
I'm so sorry, Fred.
It was an extraordinary idea.
It almost worked, too.
I wasn't talking about the project.
No, I'm not sure that I was.
I never meant to hurt you like this.
It's not your fault.
I don't know what to do.
I can't help you there, I'm afraid.
Are you going to stay?
Stay for what?
There's nothing here anymore.
Not you, not a single fish left in the river.
Well, someone's gonna have to make a move.
Good luck, Harriet.
Dr. Alfred, look!
They're alive!
I'm going to stay.
I want to start again.
I'll do it on my own if I have to.
I'll start small, though, this time.
A different approach.
Just a few fish to begin with.
Involve the local community more.
Make it their project, not ours.
That's the way to protect it.
Do you need an assistant, Dr. Jones?
Well, I suppose I will.
I'm sure the sheikh has somebody that...
An assistant?
A partner.
A partner.
Yes, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
More than anything.
HARRIET:
Dear Dr. Jones,
I act on behalf of a client with access to very substantial funds who has indicated a desire to sponsor a project to introduce salmon and the sport of salmon fishing into the Yemen.
I would like to seek a meeting with you to identify how this challenging project might be initiated and resourced.
I might add that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office supports the project as a symbol of Anglo-Yemeni cooperation.
Yours sincerely, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Ms.
Fitzharris Price Investment Consultants.
(PHONE RINGING)

Have a good evening.
You, too.
Say hi to soldier boy.
We're just friends, you know.
We've only met a couple of times.
Yeah, you tell me that on Monday.
Shut up.
Hello.
Hi.
It's great to see you.
Yes.
Me, too.
Sorry.
Yes?
Yes.
You, too.
(HARRIET LAUGHS)
No, "Yes" is a start, that's fine.
Stop it, I'm so nervous.
Why are you nervous?
I don't know.
I'm trying to be very sophisticated and grown-up.
Right.
No, grown-up, absolutely.
Mmm.
Quite right, yeah.
Harriet.
Yes?
Last one to the restaurant pays.
What?
Oh, you bastard.
FRED:
Dear Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, thank you for your e-mail.
As a fisheries specialist, permit me a word or two about salmon.
Migratory salmonoids require cool, well-oxygenated water in which to spawn.
In addition, in the early stages of the salmon's life cycle, a good supply of fly life indigenous to the northern European rivers is necessary for the juvenile salmon, or parr, to survive.
Some considerable distance from the Indian Ocean, or indeed the Red Sea, as I am sure you are aware... (READING)
Fundamentally unfeasible.
Yes, yes.
(READING)
We therefore regret that we are unable to help you any further in this matter.
Yours, Alfred Jones, Doctor.
I've put duck liver pâté in your sandwich.
Oh, that's lovely.
Righto.
I'm off to bed.
Already?
Airport car's coming at 5:00.
Righto.
Um, I'll maybe have another wee pass at the, er, caddis fly paper.
You could read it on the airplane.
Up to my ear in reports, darling.
I'll read it when I'm back.
Right, then.
Good night.
(HARRIET MOANS)
Oh, my God, I don't do this.
I don't do this.
No, I can tell.
I haven't done this in a really long time.
Okay.
(EXHALES) I'm so shy.
Okay.
No, I'll sleep on the sofa.
No, I'm so shy.
Look, Harriet, I mean it.
I...
Shut up. (CHUCKLES)
You were saying.
You're shy.
(SIGHS) I am shy and quiet.

I'm serious.
Robert, I...
Don't do this and then forget me.
I just don't wanna be an army barracks joke in the morning.
Please be nice to me.
Harriet, I'm serious, too.
I mean it.
So if you want me to sleep on the sofa, then I'll...
If you say, Captain Mayers, one more time you'll sleep on the sofa, you'll bloody well sleep on the sofa.

I trust you had a nice weekend.

Mr. Sugden would like a word.
Would he indeed?
What do you think of that?
Oh.
It's for the caddis fly report.
Need something racy for the cover.
Something to rev up the YouTube generation.
I know it's not quite what we would expect from a scientific paper, but we must keep up with the times, Mrs. Burnside.
Mr. Sugden asked to see you, Mr. Jones.
I'm not too sure that I don't have a picture of a caddis being eaten alive by a spider somewhere.
There it is.
Oh, that's a beauty.
What do you think about that for...
BERNARD:
Good God.
Little too much, do you think?
No, not if you're making a horror film.
Look, this e-mail about the salmon thing.
Oh, yes.
Did I miss April Fools' Day or something?
Did you like my little swipe at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wonks?
Yeah, well, I just had another e-mail from the FCO today.
Rattle their cage, did I?
Look, you wouldn't take a meeting with her, would you?
This Chetwode-Talbot woman.
She represents this Sheikh Muhammed bloke.
Why would I want to do that?
Why would I want to traipse across London to discuss that nonsense?
I've very important work to do here, as you can very well see.
Yeah, well, the FCO, in their infinite W, feel that a meeting on this is important business, too, Alfred.
Lord, the tendrils of this busybody government.
(SIGHS) Dr. Jones, as your Operational Line Manager,
I am asking you with extreme prejudice to take a meeting with Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Oh, I take it that's an order?
Take it how you wish.
Nazi.
Wanker.
Morning.
Dr. Jones?
Er, Miss Chetwode-Talbot is expecting me.
Yes, it's a bit of a mouthful.
Do call me Harriet.
Oh.
Oh.
Er, nice to meet you.
You, too.
Do you want to come with me?
Yes.
HARRIET:
Do come in.
Please, sit down.
Yeah, anywhere you like.
Would you like tea or coffee?
No, thank you.
So... (HARRIET CLEARS THROAT)
Fitzharris Price, er, represent the sheikh's assets in this country, including a number of estates in Scotland.
Um, he's a very keen fisherman, so he asked us if we would...
Water.
Sorry?
Water, Miss Chetwode-Talbot.
H2O.
Do you want sparkling or still?
Not for me, for the fish.
Fish require water.
You are familiar with that concept?
Yes.
I am, yes.
So, to save us both a lot of time, let me keep this brief and simple.
Here it's very cold.
It rains a lot.
Mmm.
Here it's very hot.
It doesn't rain a lot.
Do you see the difference?
Well, you're pointing to Saudi Arabia, Dr. Jones, not the Yemen.
You seem to be deliberately missing the point.
With respect, er, not really.
You see, unlike Saudi Arabia, parts of the Yemen get up to 250 millimeters of rainfall a month in the wet season.
It gets the edge of the monsoon, you see.
And the dry season?
Well, interestingly, recent oil explorations, uh, have uncovered a number of very large freshwater aquifers, which could sort of recharge the wadi in the dry season using a dam.
I'm sure they could.
So, when he's built his dam, why don't you get back to me then?
Completed, couple of years ago.
Long-term plan is to irrigate thousands of acres of desert.
Uh, we could grow watermelons, maize, cotton.
Now you're going to tell me it isn't hot in the Yemen, too, aren't you?
Well, in the mountainous areas, the nighttime temperatures get down to well below 20 Celsius.
And, of course, I defer to your expert knowledge, Dr. Jones, but I do believe that Pacific salmon get as far south as California.
Temperatures are not too dissimilar there.
Water.
For the fish.
No, for me.
Of course.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Yes, Dr. Jones?
FRED:
This is plainly ridiculous.
There's just no way that salmon can survive in those sort of environments.
If your sheikh wants to pour his money down the drain, why doesn't he buy himself a football club or something?
Look, Dr. Jones.
I don't really think it's my place to explain the sheikh's motivations.
But I will say this, that of all of our wealthy clients, he is different.
I would go so far as to describe him as a visionary man.
A visionary?
Yes, I know, it's not a very fashionable word, but if you decide to take this project with us, then you can judge for yourself when you meet him.
My line manager asked me to come here and take this meeting to discuss your project and that I have done.
I thank you for your time, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
I'll see myself out.
Goodbye.
Oh.
Thank you.
(GIGGLING)
FRED:
Did you get my e-mail?
Yes.
What did it say?
Took the meeting.
Waste of time, as predicted.
Now, if you don't mind, I'll get back to my work.
Uh, Dr. Jones.
What is this?
P45.
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't understand.
Oh, well, a P45 is the official document given to an employee when his services are no longer required by his, or her, employer.
Yes, but, Bernard, this has got my...
Or you can sign this letter stating that you are delighted to assign yourself, exclusively, to the Yemeni salmon fishing project with immediate effect.
It's up to you.
But, Bernard, you know as well as I do this thing is a bloody joke.
There's no way you can get salmon that far up a...
Just there.
This is blackmail, Sugden.
This is a bloody outrage.
Fitzharris Price will be paying your salary while on secondment.
Almost double what it is now.
I'd say that's a bloody outrage.
Double?
Can I have time to think about this?
Nope.
Can I borrow your pen?
No.

Oh, you bastard. (LAUGHS)
FRED:
Well, firstly, we would need to trap 10,000 salmon from the North Sea, for the sake of argument, get them to the Yemen alive, don't ask me how, where they would be deposited in temperature and oxygen-controlled holding tanks built into a wadi
that would, hallelujah, open during the rainy season, allowing the salmon to migrate upstream for, say, 10 kilometers, which would allow your sheikh to hoick them out of the water to his heart's content.
Of course, until the dry season, when they will all
die.
Well, unless we feed the wadi all year round using the dam.
Of course.
Stupid idiot man.
Why not use precious water resources to support one man's sport fishing?
So, now that we have year-round water, why not build some gravel spawning grounds, breed the world's first Arabian salmon, and teach the clever fellows to migrate to the Indian Ocean...
Wonderful, wonderful idea.

Heel for heel and toe for toe."

Forty million.
No, 45...
Fifty million.

Er, or pounds.
Pounds.
Mmm-hmm.
At least.
So it's theoretically possible?
Well, it's theoretically possible in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is theoretically possible.
(SIGHS) It's very impressive, Dr. Jones.
No, it's not.
It's nonsense.
I...
Look, I just made it all up.
No, the drawing.
Real talent, if I might say so.
Excellent start.
So I suppose we should just crack on and get things started now?
You can't hold me to this.
I mean, these are just random ideas.
I mean, this is a sort of joke.
Well, I'm sure you wouldn't joke about a 50-million pound project, Dr. Jones.
Not when you're in charge of it.
Well, the sheikh is so looking forward to meeting you, and he'll be back in the next couple of weeks.
So, in the meantime, is there anything else that I can do for you?
Well, as a matter of fact, there is.
Mmm-hmm.
Could you arrange a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
Er, the one in China?
ls there another?
I...
British Oxygen Company.
A meeting with them as well.
And then, what are those great big transport aircraft called?
The big Russian military...
Antonovs.
Mmm.
Find out about renting two of those, one for the fish and one to carry all the money that we're going to need.
When that's done, I'd be delighted to start working.
Good day, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good day, Dr. Jones.

It's just what we need right now, a bit of Anglo-Arab news that isn't about things that explode.
I want to know, is it a goer?
Goer?
Well, look, the complexities.
I mean, I barely know even where to begin, but, well, just for starters, we would need 10,000 live salmon.
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
Oh. ls 10,000 salmon a lot?
Well, if they're to come from British waters, and I don't see where else they're gonna come from.
I mean, you would need the permission of the Environment Agency.
Oh, that's your job, Bernard.
Okay, so you get on to the EA and get this man his salmon.
Hmm?
Miss Maxwell.
Ms. Mrs. Happily married.
Details in Who's Who.
Mrs. Maxwell, there are two million fishermen in the UK who are, I would say, unusually protective of...
How many?
Two million.
Two million?
Yes.
(GASPS) Bloody hell.
Two million out there waving their little rods around?
FRED:
Uh-huh.
Are they the kind that vote our way?
They vote for those that best look after their fish, in my experience.
I bet they do, I bet they do.
Whoo!
Right, so, Prime Minister on the front cover of Fishy Weekly or whatever.
Best friend of the British fisher folk.
Spearing a leaping salmon.
Oh, I like this. (CHUCKLES)
I like it a lot.
They do have magazines, these people?
They can read?
Aye, the Angling Times, Trout and Salmon,
Coarse Fishing Monthly, Bassmania.
Bassmania?
Marvelous.
(LAUGHING) Marvelous.
That's marvelous.
(MOBILE PHONE CHIMES) Ooh.
Ooh.
This has just become a priority project.
Anything I can do, just give me a call.
Two million.
(MAKES WHOOSHING SOUND)
God, men, what a species.
I don't think she got the right end of the stick there.
Your call, I think, Bernard.
Ten thousand native Atlantic salmon on my desk by Friday, please.
Ta-ta.
Yeah, well, you'd just better come through on this, Jones.
(TYPING)
It's been a long time since I was back.
HARRIET:
Oh, yes?
A long time.
You see?
ls that where he lives?
Yes.
He has many estates, but this one's his favorite.
May I present Malcolm, the butler.
Hello.
This is Dr. Jones.
Welcome to Glen Tulloch, sir.
His Excellency thought you might like to avail yourself of the fishing while you're waiting.
Oh.
(MAN CHANTING IN ARABIC)
Thank you very much.
(MEN CHANTING IN ARABIC)
May I present Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama.
This is Dr. Jones.
It's a great pleasure to meet you, Your Excellency.
To meet the creator of the Woolly Jones, the pleasure's all mine, sir.
Oh.
That's very kind.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, do you realize that for more than 10 years
I have fished with a Woolly Jones?
Really?
What's a Woolly Jones?
(CHUCKLES)
Dr. Jones invented a famous fly.
Well, it's a sentimental habit that some fly-tiers have of calling a fly after...
Anyway, I don't approve of that sort of thing normally, but...
Woolly Jones.
It's a great name.
A bloody good fly, that's for sure.
Please allow me to show you a delightful lie just around the corner.
Absolutely.
Lead on.
You think I'm mad?
No, Your Excellency.
I...
Of course you do.
I would question your judgment if you did not.
Though I have judgment enough to know that under there lies a fish much cleverer than I.
I'm a great admirer of the British, for many reasons, but still there are mysteries to me.
The rich are frightened of the poor.
The poor are frightened of the rich.
And even your politicians, they try to sound like the people on the EastEnders.
Ah.
A wonderful program, but still.
Yes, the great British class system.
SHEIKH:
Indeed.
But fishermen, I have noticed, they don't care whether I'm brown or white, rich or poor, wearing robes or waders.
All they care about is the fish, the river and the game we play.
For fishermen, the only virtues are patience, tolerance and humility.
I like this.
You are struck dumb by my naivety, Dr. Alfred.
No, you're on.
What?
You're on.
(GRUNTING)
SHEIKH:
This is a sign.
A sign?
A sign that I should stop talking bollocks and fish.
(FRED LAUGHING)
Come here.
Nicely done, sir.
Thank you.
Very nicely done.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Oh, hello, Dr. Jones.
ls that yours?
The dress.
Uh, yes.
Oh.
This is not mine.
It suits you very well.
Thank you.
They seem to know my size.
Mmm.
That not strike you as a wee bit sinister?
The idea of the sheikh's tailor tracking me across London with some kind of satellite measuring device?
They asked me for your size.
And I took a guess.
Oh.
Well, for future reference,
I have a 32-inch waist, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Right.
Not a 34.
No pies for me.
Note taken, sorry about that.
Thank you.
Ms. Harriet has told me of your marvelous plan.
Plan?
Well, not so much of a plan, really, it's, uh, more of a feasibility study.
Theoretically possible, you said, Dr. Jones.
Theoretically.
Indeed.
It would be a miracle of God if it were to happen.
I'm more of a facts-and-figures man myself.
You're not a religious man?
No.
No, I'm not.
SHEIKH:
But you're a fisherman, Dr. Jones.
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
How many hours do you fish before you catch something?
Dozens?
Oh, gosh, hundreds sometimes.
ls that a good use of your time for a facts-and-figures man?
But you persist in the wind and the rain and the cold with such poor odds of success.
Why?
Hmm?
Because you're a man of faith, Dr. Alfred.
And in the end, you are rewarded for your faith and constancy with a fish.
With due respect, uh, fishing and religion are hardly the same thing, Your Excellency.
With equal respect,
I have to disagree.
A toast?
To faith.
And fish.
To faith and fish.
And science.
(ALL LAUGHING)
And science.
You're unhappy tonight, Ms. Harriet?
No. (CHUCKLES) I'm fine, really.
I have too many wives not to know when a woman is unhappy.
Though mine are not so quiet about it.
Um...
Robert, he's my boyfriend, has just been posted to Afghanistan.
Uh, or somewhere.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.
For how long?
Mmm.
They don't really tell us things like that.
How worrying.
I just try not to think about it.
SHEIKH:
And you are married, Dr. Alfred?
Indeed.
It is kind of her to spare you.
Oh, my...
My wife's actually working abroad at the moment in Geneva, so...
So you two have more in common than one might suppose.
(HARRIET LAUGHS)
I have put my feet in it.
Please forgive me.
Perfect moment to retire to bed.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
You're welcome.
Dr. Alfred.
Your Excellency.
I know you have been persuaded to help us, but unless you do this with an open heart,
I don't think anything will come of it.
So, please, consider.
Of course.
I hope we meet again.
Dr. Jones.
Yes?
Well, I was just wondering what you thought.
Well, the sheikh's English has a certain tendency towards the mystical, don't you think?
But then, doolally as this entire enterprise clearly is,
I've had the most pleasant day I can remember having for quite a long time.
So, if the sheikh is paying, as it were, on we go.
Great.
Good night, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good night, Dr. Jones.
It's been a pleasure.
Yes.
Have you any idea what an outcry there would be if the Environment Agency stripped British rivers of 10,000 salmon and shipped them off to the effing Yemen?
Well, how many can you spare?
None!
Christ, Bernard!
Anglers, they're obsessive crazies.
Hmm?
You think Al Qaeda are a threat, think again, mate.
I've seen a fly fisherman wade into a river and try and drown a canoeist just for passing by in a Day-Glo jacket.
You haven't got a hope in hell of getting these fish from British rivers.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yes?
Dr. Jones.
Hello.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
How nice.
Did we book a meeting?
No.
You know how you said that you wanted a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
Did I say that?
Yes.
That might have been a little hasty.
They're outside.
Who?
The chief hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam.
Here?
I e-mailed them about the flow rate calculus, and I think there must have been some kind of...
My Mandarin is very rusty.
Bloody hell.
We are able to control the flow of water from the upstream dam.
(TRANSLATES IN MANDARIN)
But we are...
(TRANSLATES)
Well, we're concerned about the capability of the sandstone walls.
(HARRIET TRANSLATES)
I mean, there's the possibility also of some flash-flood scenario.
(TRANSLATES IN MANDARIN)
FRED:
Thank you very much.
My God, do you think we got away with it?
Do you know, I think we did.
I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
No, please don't apologize.
I think we've just found our engineers.
Yes.
I mean, should the project, of course, get that far.
Your Mandarin was much better than I expected.
HARRIET:
Thank you.
Bernard Sugden, Head of Department.
Hello.
Alfred not bothering you too much, I hope?
No.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot from Fitzharris Price.
Hello.
Bet he doesn't even know your first name, does he?
So, who were all those little chippy-chappies, huh?
Those are the engineers from the Three Gorges Dam.
What, the one in China?
ls there another?
Don't think there's another one.
Would have appreciated an introduction.
Bernard is the man who's responsible for acquiring our 10,000 native Atlantic salmon.
How's that coming along, Bernard?
Don't you worry about that, Fred.
It's, uh, all in hand.
Well, don't dilly-dally.
Our end is coming along.
We're bang on schedule, in fact.
Yes.
Mmm.
A debrief in the canteen, or has Fred brought in the famous sandwiches?
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot and I are going out for lunch, Bernard.
There's lots to discuss.
Clare, could you ask Betty to bring my bag?
Thank you.
CLARE:
Certainly, Dr. Jones.
Are you sure you won't have one?
At lunch time?
(SIGHS) Dr. Jones, I haven't spoken a word of Mandarin for about four years, so I am celebrating even if you're not.
I only drink alcohol on the weekend.
And even then, only after 7:00.
No exceptions?
None that I can think of.
Well, yeah.
I got...
We got married on a Friday, but I think it was, as I recall, a bank holiday in Northern Ireland, so I allowed myself, I think, a glass on a technicality.
That was an attempt at a joke, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
(CHUCKLES) Oh, right.
Good one.
Do you really think it's going extremely well?
What?
The project.
Oh, the project.
Well, it's utter nonsense, of course, naturally, the bagatelle of a man with more money than sense, but...
I haven't actually found anything to say that it couldn't work.
You know, theoretically, of course.
ln theory.
Well, theoretically speaking, in theory it...
We'll see, yes.
Of course.
Actually, these are the companies that have bid for the contract to build the holding tanks at the downstream end of the wadi.
Shall we go through these?
Now?
Yes, we could go through them now.
Well, we could work and eat, no?
Yes, I...
Yes, all right, then.
This one's from...
Before that, cheers.
Cheers.
Very bad luck with water.
Some people think it's bad luck.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
EWB...
Ooh, sorry.
Excuse me.
Ooh, it's the barracks.
Oh, it's Robert.
Sorry.
Oh, no.
Go on.
Hello.
Go ahead.
Hello?
Yes?
What?
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
Are you all right, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
He's missing in action.
What does that mean?
Come upstairs and we'll get you your...
No, I just need a minute.
Hello.
My name's Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Well, I only knew him for three weeks, but I am Robert's girlfriend.
Um, I was wondering if you knew anything...
Of course.
Yes.
Sorry, Mrs. Mayers.
Yes, I...
Yes, of course.
Goodbye.
(PHONE RINGING)
(ANSWERING MACHINE) You've reached Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Leave a message after the beep.
(BEEP)
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, it's Dr. Jones here.
Please forgive me for calling you on your home number.
I was at something of a loss.
I realize that this has not been an easy week for you but, uh,
I was wondering when you might be coming back into the office.
I had a very productive meeting with the engineers from British Oxygen Company and, uh, well, there's a lot of data coming in.
Really a considerable amount.
I'm sure I don't have to remind you that we are working to a deadline.
Time and tide, as I am sure you are aware, waits for no man.
Or woman.
Anyway, I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
Goodbye.
(KNOCKING)
Oh.
Can I come in?
Why?
Well, you might get cold.
Very nice.
What?
Your flat.
Very pleasant.
Look, I'm not...
I'm not coming into work, all right, because I need to stay here.
I need to be here in case there's news.
So, actually, anyone with a shred of understanding, or humanity, or simple feeling, who, frankly, wasn't suffering from some kind of Asperger's, would know that the last thing that I need
is your bullying little phone call asking me to come into work so that you can update me on fish.
You want to fill me in on fishing.
Well, Dr. Jones, you can take your work and you can shove it up your unfeeling arse.
I didn't come here to talk to you about work.
Then why are you here?
I made you a sandwich.
Why?
You're probably not eating.
Are you?
(SIGHS)
No.
You see, it's very important.
You, you must eat something.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Here.
(SOBBING)
I don't know what to do.
(SOBBING)
I don't know what to do because...
I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
Call me, um, Fred.
Just call me Fred.
You're all right now?
Yeah.
You all right?
Sorry.
No, don't.
Oh, why don't I get a plate and we...
You can put this on a plate.
Shall I do it?
No, it's okay.
I'll do it.
I'm so sorry about what I said before.
That is just unforgivable.
The great thing about people with Asperger's is it's very difficult to hurt their feelings.
So it's all right, you can say whatever you like.
You don't have...
You know, I was upset.
And rightly so.
Look, I took the liberty of buying a wee bottle of wine.
Now, I hope you don't mind.
I know it's not the weekend, but this one goes very well with duck.
I'm not very hungry.
Harriet, you've got to try and eat... ls it all right...
ls it all right for me to call you Harriet?
(LAUGHING)
(SNIFFLES)
Um, my father is, um...
He's ex-Army, so he's like very stiff upper lip and don't make a fuss about anything, but I'm more of a gusher.
I think that's his word for me, anyway.
My upper lip's never been very stiff, I'm afraid.
But you still have a boyfriend.
I mean, I don't know a great deal about such things, but...
Robert hasn't been listed as being dead, has he?
No.
But I just feel that "missing in action" is Army-speak for...
Dead?
No.
No, as a civil servant, I happen to know that the Ministry of Defense absolutely hate uncertainty of any kind.
If he were dead, they would simply say "dead."
Can you stop using that word, please?
Oh, I beg your pardon.
It's okay.
They say that they'll call when there's news.
But they don't, so I guess there isn't.
Come to the Yemen.
We're leaving tomorrow, just for a few days.
Geological studies, engineering surveys.
No.
We even have a team of archeologists checking we're not about to submerge the Ark of the Covenant, which would be unfortunate, you know.
No, I can't leave because there might be news and...
Well, then, you'll fly back on the sheikh's private jet immediately.
(HARRIET LAUGHS)
Why would he do that?
Because I asked him to.
Your services are very highly valued by the sheikh, and by me.
Uh, the project really can't do without you.
(SIGHS) Oh, who the hell cares?
Project?
I mean, it's fishing.
You know, who the hell cares?
Well, strangely enough, I do.
I mean, I know it's probably just a terrible folly, but, still, I can't help sometimes imagining that this crazy enterprise might just come off.
You know, with a bit of luck and with the right people.
And you, you are most definitely, most definitely one of the most rightest people that I've had the good fortune to come across.
If you'll forgive the grammatical inadequacies of that sentence.
HARRIET:
Do you sometimes think that maybe we're just part of a lavish practical joke?
FRED:
What do you mean?
Salmon, here?
Mmm.
FRED:
Yes, I'm beginning to suppose that.
(GOATS BLEATING)
(MAN SHOUTING IN ARABIC)
(MEN PRAYING IN ARABIC)
I don't know anyone that goes to church anymore.
Mmm.
I don't think I do, either.
On a Sunday, we go to Target.
You know, this gravel here is perfect for salmon to lay their eggs in between.
Who'd have thought that here in the middle of the Yemen, perfect spawning grounds for salmon?
(BOTH SIGHING)
(MEN CHATTING IN ARABIC)
Fred, look.
What?
FRED:
Oh, yes.
HARRIET:
Thank you.
FRED:
Thank you.
Harriet, the water.
It's beautiful.
It's cold.
The water in her well is cold.
Oh, my goodness.
It's really happening, Fred.
Oh, my goodness, it really is.
(MAN SHOUTING IN ARABIC)
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
SHEIKH:
Unbelievable.
These men, they say that by bringing water, life, to this desert,
I am bringing the Western ways to our land.
They say I have insulted God himself.
I say they are fools.
(SIGHS) A thousand apologies, my friends.
Please, this is not a way to introduce you to our great enterprise.
Look.
ls it not, uh, magnificent?
It's beautiful.
Certainly is.
Bloody amazing.
(HARRIET CHUCKLES)
Hello.
Hello.
(INAUDIBLE)
For the last time, Sugden, there is absolutely no way I can get you these fish.
Tom, this comes from the top.
The very top.
I don't care if God's taken up fly fishing.
Now, I suggest you make this work, Tom.
Is that a threat, Sugden?
These are difficult days, Tom.
Cuts.
Cuts everywhere.
I don't know.
ls the Environment Agency a frontline service?
Oh, that is a threat.
See it as an opportunity.
Well, then. (SIGHS) An opportunity.
Hilary, get me Matthew Sweet from Fly Fishing Monthly, will you?
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
HARRIET:
That's all I've been told, and so I...
Okay.
All right, then.
Well, please, please, please call me when...
Okay.
Bye.
I'm so sorry.
Did I wake you up?
No.
No, no.
Uh, news?
No.
No, I was just, um, leaving a message on Robert's phone which is ridiculous because he hasn't got his phone with him.
And I know that.
Just turning into a madwoman.
No.
No, when things get tricky in my life, I talk to my fish.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
I have a pond.
Talking to an answering machine is no madder than chatting to koi carp.
I just somehow wouldn't associate you with having a tricky life.
Well, it wouldn't do to talk about your emotions with a colleague, would it, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
No, I think...
I think things are beyond tricky, really.
They have been for some time.
Mary's in Geneva.
I'm here.
The koi carp are alone in Surrey.
We got married very young.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't really know things were hard.
No, don't apologize.
There's always hope.
For me and for you.
Do you know, I can't even remember what he looks like.
Not exactly.
But I'm stuck and...
I can't move on.
Does that make any sense?
Yes.
Totally.
I feel a bit like I've been stuck for years.
Yes, but you can move on.
Well, in...
I suppose in theory.
You should be happy, Fred.
(HARRIET SIGHS)
I knew you'd have a pond.
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
The traitor has had his chance.
You know what to do.
Do not fail us.
ANGUS ON TV:
I think the idea of taking Scottish salmon to a foreign country is absolutely absurd.
These fish have been running these rivers for tens of thousands of years.
I've fished the rivers of Scotland all my life.
Yes, Prime Minister.
It would appear that the gentle fisher folk are not so effing gentle after all.
...rape and pillage of our national rivers...
PATRICIA:
What, ditch the whole thing?
No.
No, no, no, Prime Minister.
No, we must just find the fish somewhere bloody else.
I mean...
Ooh!
Your turrets are blocking my reception.
Well, I'm terribly sorry about that, madam.
If you'd care to follow me, please.
SHEIKH:
Mrs. Maxwell.
(SIGHS) Pleasure to meet you.
It's an honor.
(GASPS) Ooh.
Happy birthday, Patricia.
Oh, yes, we could do with a few more like you in Cabinet.
Very good, Your Excellency.
I'm grateful, indeed, that you could spare some time for our little project.
Oh, yes.
Well, we have gone out on a bit of a limb for you, Your Excellency, but the Prime Minister does love his fishing.
Really?
Yes.
Rod's never out of his hand.
Anyway, down to business.
The fish.
The salmon.
We're not gonna get it out of British waters.
There's a bloody big fuss about it, as no doubt you've heard.
Don't know what it is about fishing.
Anyway, no-goer.
Yes, but I thought...
However,
I have solved your problem.
PATRICIA:
See?
There must be thousands in this one alone.
This guy's got four fish farms up and down the coast.
Stocks all the Tesco's.
Right under your nose.
These fish were bred for the dinner table.
It's barbaric.
They've never run in their lives.
Neither have their forebears for two generations.
Why would they run for us?
...tasting the difference in these salmon...
FRED:
We'd open the sluices and they would just drift off downstream never to be seen again.
Well, get a couple of days fishing out of it, then just re-stock or whatever the word is.
Seems to be no shortage of them.
FARM WORKER: ...in transit for the supermarkets.
SHEIKH:
These fish will never run.
They're just not right.
Not right?
Well, a fish is a fish is a fish, isn't it?
No.
You see, Mrs. Maxwell, I have a vision.
Tired, bloated pretenders are not part of this vision.
Well, unfortunately, Her Majesty's Government also has a vision, and that vision is farmed fish or no fish.
Then I must thank you for your precious time.
And decline.
No advisers, either.
Back at your desk on Monday, Fred.
Well, in that case, I resign.
PATRICIA:
Resignation accepted.
Thank you.
PATRICIA:
Pleasure.
SHEIKH:
So, this leaves us with what?
FRED:
Well, with no salmon.
We must have faith, Dr. Alfred.
Well, that's a very laudable sentiment, Your Excellency, but we're running out of time.
Can't catch faith with a fishing rod.
HARRIET:
Hello, Fred.
Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama!
(ESSAD SHOUTS IN ARABIC)
(EXCLAIMS) (GUNSHOT)
(MEN SHOUTING IN ARABIC)
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I didn't think he looked right, that man.
And he pulled out a gun!
Are you all right?
Yes.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Alfred.
Thank you very much.
Don't be silly.
Don't be silly.
It was only a cast, really.
A very good cast.
An essential cast, one might say.
(BOTH CHUCKLING) Yes, I suppose one might say that.
Here.
My God, Fred.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah. lt was very quick.
It was over in a flash, really.
How did you do that?
I did a right-handed snake roll.
Did I get him?
HARRIET:
Yes, it was extraordinary.
Are you all right?
Yes, thank you very much.
Please, continue your work as if nothing had happened.
Of course, of course.
I owe you my life.
Oh, no.
Please, come on.
Anyone would have...
This is not one of those British metaphors, Dr. Alfred.
The debt will be repaid.
Bye, now.
Goodbye.
Bye.
In response to the Right Honorable Member's question of the 7th of last month, the Ministry of Defense can now confirm that an engagement by British Special Forces against known terrorists did occur on the 13th of September.
The details of this operation are classified.
However, I am at liberty to say that serious casualties were incurred by the British forces.
I deeply regret to inform the House that there were no survivors.
An internal investigation is being carried out.
(HARRIET SOBBING)
(SOBBING)
Sorry to wake you up.
No, don't be.
It's just...
It's okay.
It's just...
I just never got the chance to really know him.
Mary?
Fred?
Oh, there you are.
I had no idea you were...
I got a day off and thought, "Why not surprise him?"
I've got this wonderful Swiss mountain Comté from a little shop round the corner in Geneva.
ls everything all right, Fred?
Where's your suit and tie?
Day off?
I resigned.
Don't be ridiculous.
You've resigned?
What about your pension?
It's final salary.
Well, the government pulled out of the salmon fishing project and we'd put a lot of time and energy into it.
I didn't want to walk away from that.
"We"?
Well, everyone involved.
I'm still being paid, if that's what you're worried about.
Fitzharris Price have been more than...
I might have known she'd be involved.
If you're referring to Harriet, we're working on the project together.
Of course she's involved.
Harriet?
What do you mean exactly by that, Mary?
I've seen her photograph on the Fitzharris Price website.
You're making a fool of yourself.
Now it's you that's being ridiculous.
Oh, am I?
I'm not the one abandoning a decent, highly respected job for a joke fishing project and a short-skirted office girl.
She's not an office girl.
What is she, then, Fred?
Hey?
Just what is she?
She's a colleague.
She's a very talented colleague and...
And?
And a friend!
She's just a friend!
Are you in love with her?
I've done nothing, Mary.
Uh, I have no expectations.
I didn't ask about your expectations.
I asked if you were in love with her.
This is a mid-life crisis.
It's textbook, it's pathetic.
I'm so sorry, Mary.
You'll be back, Fred.
Or you'll try.
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
You'd think a bloody scientist would know that much!
(ECHOING) Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
FRED:
We don't need native river fish.
We'll be all right with farmed salmon.
Oh.
I know.
I don't much like them, but...
Mmm.
Well, they will run.
I know it.
Oh, yes, Your Excellency.
Uh, despite our moral and philosophical objections, farmed salmon will run.
I'm absolutely sure of it.
You are tireless, Doctor.
You have uncovered some new research?
A new paper, perhaps?
No, I just know it.
You just know it.
I see.
Faith, Dr. Alfred.
Damn it.
Yes, all right, then, faith.
So?
They're alive.
(ALL SHOUTING)
CHARACTER ON TV:
Ow, that hurts!
(PHONE RINGS)
Sorry, sweetie.
MAN:
Mrs. Maxwell?
What?
Amazing news.
One of the officers presumed dead,
Captain Robert Mayers, has been found alive.
Oh, good.
Yes, we're very pleased.
Yes, very good.
It's very good news for the family.
And his girlfriend, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who else knows about this?
You're the first to know.
Right, keep it that way.
Total press embargo.
Do you understand?
Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
That, uh, salmon fishing thing.
ls that still happening?
As far as I'm aware.
It is?
Yes.
Yemen?
Yes.
Perfect.
Oh, yes, this is all coming together very nicely.
(INAUDIBLE)
(TYPING)
(PRAYING IN ARABIC)
SHEIKH:
I intended to create a small miracle.
Something to glorify God and bring our tribes together.
Sometimes I wonder if we haven't created something that glorifies man.
It is a very fine line.
Hubris, Dr. Alfred.
Hubris.
(CHUCKLES) It's nice here.
Beautiful.
You know, Fred, this project, it saved me.
I think.
You know, with everything that happened.
So those farmed fish had better run.
Oh, I believe they will.
You do?
Yes, I believe that it's in the very core of their being to head upstream even if they never have, even if the parent fish never have.
Look at this.
Look at that.
Mary said something about me.
She said that I was genetically programmed to return to a dull pedestrian life with her.
That it was in my DNA.
Do you think that you are?
No.
No, I belong here.
I always have done.
Harriet.
Yes.
I was wondering about you and me.
The theoretical possibility in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is a theoretical possibility.
Obviously.
Or salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Yes?
Yes.
I just need a little time.
Of course, of course.
All the time you want.
Thank you.
Mr. Foreign Secretary.
Brian Fleet.
The great fisherman.
The great...
Well, it has been a little while, to be honest.
A bit rusty, you know.
Some skills are never forgotten.
Please, follow this man to your tent.
I shall join you shortly.
What have you been saying?
Fishing's the last thing anyone's gonna be interested in, trust me.
Get ready for the photo op of a lifetime, Sonny Jim.
N-S-R.
No salmon required.
ls that, um, a Woolly Jones?
No, this is a new one I've invented.
ls it?
Mmm-hmm.
What's it called?
This one is called the Chetwode-Talbot Beauty.
That's very nice.
It's true.
You're not being funny?
No, I don't have a sense of humor, as you recall.
That is true.
Beautiful.
Yes, she is.
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)
Here.
Thank you.
Don't you think we should be doing something, Fred?
Preparing?
I am preparing.
HARRIET:
Well, for the whole thing, you know.
Everything's done, Harriet, it's fine.
Just relax.
Did you just...
Dr. Alfred Jones just told me to relax.
(SIGHS) What is the world coming to?
Oh, my God.
Harriet.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Right, Harriet and Robert... (JOURNALISTS CLAMORING)
Right, okay.
Shut up, hacks.
No military stuff.
It's classified.
Anyway, I don't think you'd understand it.
The only thing you need to know is that this man, Captain Mayers here, is a war hero.
(JOURNALISTS EXCLAIM) Human interest stuff only.
Sir.
Harriet, can you tell us how it feels?
(STAMMERING) lt feels like it's a...
It's a...
It's a shock, but it's wonderful.
Please can we have a kiss?
JOURNALISTS:
Go on.
Come on.
(JOURNALISTS EXCLAIMING)
I am sorry, my friend.
No.
No, it's, um...
It's a miracle.
Indeed.
Nevertheless, I'm sorry.
All right, gentlemen, gentlemen, I think that's all.
A little privacy for the couple, please.
I'd just like to say that the British government is proud to have played a small but significant part in this extraordinary reunion of Harriet and Captain Mayers.
BRIAN:
That's what we're here for.
This is strange.
Mmm.
Bad strange?
No, good strange.
Do you mind if we don't...
No, of course not.
There's no rush.
Will you just hold me?
How did you get caught up in this, H?
Salmon fishing out here?
It's ridiculous.
Well, you never know with the sheikh.
Hmm.
I expect there will be a six-star hotel and a golf course before you know it.
That's not his style at all.
(ROBERT CHUCKLES)
Don't you believe it.
He's gotta make his money back somehow.
They're no fools, these Arabs.
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
ROBERT:
You don't sleep, either?
No, not much.
Well...
At least there's no bloody journos around at this time, anyway.
You've been very good to Harriet, Fred.
I appreciate it.
I love her.
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah, she's great.
She's really great.
No.
I love her.
Oh.
Does she love you?
I don't know now.
Yesterday, you weren't alive.
Well, I apologize for not being dead in a ditch.
I don't think I can accept your apology.
ls that a joke?
(SIGHS)
Yes, yes, sort of.
I'm not...
I've never been very good at jokes.
It's all right, Robert.
Really.
It's all right.
(SHEIKH SPEAKING ARABIC)
The day has arrived.
Before the dam, this was a dry riverbed.
And now, as you all can see, we have water.
And today, we hope we shall discover the one missing thing.
So, thank you, one and all, for coming as not one of you, not even my dear self, knows if this curious experiment of mine will actually work.
It better had bloody work.
Doesn't matter if it works or not, dolly.
All that matters is you.
Fishing on Sky tonight with our war hero.
I haven't done this in years.
Oh, for God's sake.
There are 10,000 fish in there.
If you can't hook one of them, you can just flip off back to Transport.
My intention is to color this desert in green.
Make an agricultural industry for my people, and the sons and daughters of my people for generations to come.
Right on cue.
SHEIKH:
So here we are,
Muslims, Christians and the odd heathen.
We are all gathered here in an act of faith.
And why not?
And now, the moment that we are all waiting for, the fruits of all our efforts.
The moment of truth.
Open the sluices.
Where's it going?
It's going the wrong way.
It's heading downstream.
Wait a minute.
It's turned around.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
HARRIET:
Look, they're going upstream.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, my God, they're running.
Fred, look.
(EXCITED CHATTER)
(CROWD CHEERING)
Look!
(SQUEALS)
They're running, Fred!
They're running!
Oi, blondie.
Come down here, come on.
Come down here now.
Look, we ought to get a picture of him with the sheikh.
It's working, Your Excellency.
It is.
They are running upstream, look!
(SHEIKH LAUGHING)
Let's go fishing, Dr. Alfred.
Turn it on, dolly.
I need to get further out.
Oh, for God's sakes.
Come on, off you go!
Have you got that?
Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
But can we get them closer together?
God, I'll give it a go.
Robert, darling.
Can you come...
Can you turn around a bit?
I'm worried about what he's doing with his rod.
(CHATTER)
Lovely.
And, Brian, just a nice smile, that would be good.
Did you get that?
God, he's useless, isn't he?
More fun without waders, Dr. Alfred.
Yes. (CHUCKLES)
I think I caught one, Dr. Alfred.
It's a beauty, Your Excellency.
(GRUNTING)
(WATER RUMBLING)
Look out behind you!
Your Excellency, behind you!
(EXCLAIMS)
(PANICKED SHOUTING)
(ALL SCREAMING)
SHEIKH:
Step up.
(GROANS) No, you first!
I repay my debts, Dr. Alfred.
Okay.
I'll pull you up.
After...
Okay.
(GRUNTING)
Here, Your Excellency, hold on.
Here, come on.
(MEN PRAYING SOFTLY)
FRED:
We won't need these anymore.
HARRIET:
I just don't understand who would do this.
Why would they do this?
SHEIKH:
I know who.
And I know why.
Can't you find them?
Arrest them?
What for?
Justice.
I think these destroyers...
Bad men, certainly.
But I think perhaps they have a point.
I expected people to understand what we were doing here.
I expected them to see that it was really not about fishing at all.
(SIGHS) ln the end, I asked for too much.
Will you try again?
The question is "Will we try again?"
This was ours.
Yes, I think maybe Robert wants to go home.
So, I don't...
I don't know.
Does home call, Dr. Fred?
I don't really have a home anymore.
There was a moment when I had everything, but...
Well, now I don't know what to do.
When the time comes, you will know.
Well, until then.
Thank you.
Just gonna say goodbye to Fred.
Are you sure?
Sorry?
Listen, Harriet.
When I was in the desert, the only thing that kept me going was the thought of you.
You don't owe me anything.
I want you to understand that.
(SIGHS)
So, um...
We're going.
I'm so sorry, Fred.
It was an extraordinary idea.
It almost worked, too.
I wasn't talking about the project.
No, I'm not sure that I was.
I never meant to hurt you like this.
It's not your fault.
I don't know what to do.
I can't help you there, I'm afraid.
HARRIET:
Are you going to stay?
FRED:
Stay for what?
There's nothing here anymore.
Not you, not a single fish left in the river.
Well, someone's gonna have to make a move.
Good luck, Harriet.
Dr. Alfred, look!
(GASPS)
They're alive!
(EXCITED CHATTER)
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
I'm going to stay.
I want to start again.
I'll do it on my own if I have to.
(STAMMERING) I'll start small, though, this time.
A different approach.
Just a few fish to begin with.
Involve the local community more.
Make it their project, not ours.
That's the way to protect it.
Do you need an assistant, Dr. Jones?
Well, I suppose I will.
I'm sure the sheikh has somebody that...
An assistant?
A partner.
Yes, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
More than anything.

Dear Dr. Jones,
I act on behalf of a client with access to very substantial funds who has indicated a desire to sponsor a project to introduce salmon and the sport of salmon fishing into the Yemen.
I would like to seek a meeting with you to identify how this challenging project might be initiated and resourced.
I might add that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office supports the project as a symbol of Anglo-Yemeni cooperation.
Yours sincerely, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Ms.
Fitzharris Price Investment Consultants.
Night.
Have a good evening.
You, too.
Say hi to soldier boy.
We're just friends, you know.
We've only met a couple of times.
- Yeah, you tell me that on Monday.
- Shut up.
- Hello.
- Hi.
It's great to see you.
- Yes.
Me, too.
Sorry.
- Yes?
- Yes.
- You, too.
- No, "Yes" is a start, that's fine.
- Stop it, I'm so nervous.
Why are you nervous?
I don't know.
I'm trying to be very sophisticated and grown-up.
Right.
No, grown-up, absolutely.
Quite right, yeah.
- Harriet.
- Yes?
Last one to the restaurant pays.
What?
You bastard.
Dear Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, thank you for your e-mail.
As a fisheries specialist, permit me a word or two about salmon.
Migratory salmonoids require cool, well-oxygenated water in which to spawn.
In addition, in the early stages of the salmon's life cycle, a good supply of fly life indigenous to the northern European rivers is necessary for the juvenile salmon, or parr, to survive.
Some considerable distance from the Indian Ocean, or indeed the Red Sea, as I am sure you are aware, though apparently not the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
We conclude that conditions in the Yemen make this project unfeasible.
Fundamentally unfeasible.
Yes, yes.
Fundamentally unfeasible.
We therefore regret that we are unable to help you any further in this matter.
Yours, Alfred Jones, Doctor.
I've put duck liver pate in your sandwich.
That's lovely.
Righto.
I'm off to bed.
Already?
- Airport car's coming at 5:00.
- Righto.
I'll maybe have another wee pass at the caddis fly paper.
You could read it on the airplane.
Up to my ear in reports, darling.
I'll read it when I'm back.
Right, then.
Good night.
Oh, my God, I don't do this.
I don't do this.
No, I can tell.
I haven't done this in a really long time.
- Okay.
- I'm so shy.
- Okay.
No, I'll sleep on the sofa.
- No, I'm so shy.
Look, Harriet, I mean it.
I...
Shut up.
You were saying.
You're shy.
I am shy and quiet.
Like Hitler.
I'm serious.
Robert, I...
Don't do this and then forget me.
I just don't wanna be an army barracks joke in the morning.
Please be nice to me.
Harriet, I'm serious, too.
I mean it.
So if you want me to sleep on the sofa, then I'll...
If you say, Captain Mayers, one more time you'll sleep on the sofa, you'll bloody well sleep on the sofa.
Captain Robert Mayers, 3-6-4-7-7-2.
Maxwell.
Better be good.
Mrs. Maxwell, we have a situation.
- What?
- Code Red in Afghanistan.
Go to sleep.
Tell me that's not a mosque.
Well, it is a religious establishment...
- Of course it's a bloody mosque!
- Well, of course...
- What's up?
- Go to sleep.
- ...make this a joint operation.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The British have absolutely nothing to do with this whatsoever.
And I want every single man, woman, child and goat in Afghanistan to know that.
My God, I didn't think we could make the war in Afghanistan any less popular, but, hey, even I can be wrong.
We'll have Vera Lynn strapping on her suicide belt in sympathy next.
Bravo, the bloody Marines.
Right, you lot.
We need a good news story from the Middle East, a big one.
And we need it now.
You've got an hour, get on with it.
Good news, eh?
New girl band, Middle East tour.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Touch my body No, no...
Okay...
Maybe not.
No.
British trans-Arabian rally.
For God's sake.
Come on, come on.
Come up with something.
What's this?
A project to introduce salmon fishing to the Yemen.
Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Is that the best you puffed-up Oxbridge-educated moronic buffoons can come up with?
Yes?
Yes, Prime Minister.
Well, no, I'm working on it right now.
I think I may have come up with something that you'll like.
Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing.
Are you dollies trying to get me fired?
Well, here we go.
Fish it is.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Hello.
Mrs. Maxwell on line one, sir.
Busy.
She says it's urgent, sir.
Maxwell who?
The press officer to the Prime Minister, sir.
Patricia.
They haven't pensioned you off yet, then?
Listen, I got the heads-up from the FCO about this salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Fancy it?
- Well, I...
- We do.
Chasing a good news story out of the Middle East.
Anglo-Yemeni relations back on track.
Arab-Western cultural détente through the ancient sport of yanking poor sodding fish out of rivers.
What do you reckon?
Well, it's a bit of a long shot, to be honest.
Well, don't be honest.
Lunatic's an oil sheikh.
Got money pouring out of his arse.
Good friend of the West.
Good friend of the Party, too, so give it a go, eh, dolly?
Well, we'll certainly bend every sinew to the job, Patricia.
I'll set up a working party immediately.
- What?
- Hey!
Don't you "working party" me, you short-arsed little pen-pusher.
I did not say kick it into the long grass.
I said do it!
Yes, Patricia.
Right... away.
Mr. Jones?
Morning, Mr. Jones.
Good morning, Betty.
I trust you had a nice weekend.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Jones.
Mr. Sugden would like a word.
Would he indeed?
What do you think of that?
It's for the caddis fly report.
Need something racy for the cover.
Something to rev up the YouTube generation.
I know it's not quite what we would expect from a scientific paper, but we must keep up with the times, Mrs. Burnside.
Mr. Sugden asked to see you, Mr. Jones.
I'm not too sure that I don't have a picture of a caddis being eaten alive by a spider somewhere.
There it is.
That's a beauty.
What do you think about that for...
Good God.
Little too much, do you think?
No, not if you're making a horror film.
Look, this e-mail about the salmon thing.
Yes.
Did I miss April Fools' Day or something?
Did you like my little swipe at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wonks?
Yeah, well, I just had another e-mail from the FCO today.
Rattle their cage, did I?
Look, you wouldn't take a meeting with her, would you?
This Chetwode-Talbot woman.
She represents this Sheikh Muhammed bloke.
Why would I want to do that?
Why would I want to traipse across London to discuss that nonsense?
I've very important work to do here, as you can very well see.
Yeah, well, the FCO, in their infinite W, feel that a meeting on this is important business, too, Alfred.
Lord, the tendrils of this busybody government.
Dr. Jones, as your Operational Line Manager,
I am asking you with extreme prejudice to take a meeting with Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
I take it that's an order?
Take it how you wish.
Nazi.
Wanker.
Morning.
Dr. Jones?
Miss Chetwode-Talbot is expecting me.
Yes, it's a bit of a mouthful.
Do call me Harriet.
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Do you want to come with me?
Yes.
Do come in.
Please, sit down.
Yeah, anywhere you like.
Would you like tea or coffee?
No, thank you.
So...
Fitzharris Price represent the sheikh's assets in this country, including a number of estates in Scotland.
He's a very keen fisherman, so he asked us if we would...
- Water.
- Sorry?
Water, Miss Chetwode-Talbot.
H2O.
Do you want sparkling or still?
Not for me, for the fish.
Fish require water.
You are familiar with that concept?
Yes.
I am, yes.
So, to save us both a lot of time, let me keep this brief and simple.
Here it's very cold.
It rains a lot.
Here it's very hot.
It doesn't rain a lot.
Do you see the difference?
Well, you're pointing to Saudi Arabia, Dr. Jones, not the Yemen.
You seem to be deliberately missing the point.
With respect, not really.
You see, unlike Saudi Arabia, parts of the Yemen get up to 250 millimeters of rainfall a month in the wet season.
It gets the edge of the monsoon, you see.
And the dry season?
Well, interestingly, recent oil explorations have uncovered a number of very large freshwater aquifers, which could sort of recharge the wadi in the dry season using a dam.
I'm sure they could.
So, when he's built his dam, why don't you get back to me then?
Completed, couple of years ago.
Long-term plan is to irrigate thousands of acres of desert.
We could grow watermelons, maize, cotton.
Now you're going to tell me it isn't hot in the Yemen, too, aren't you?
Well, in the mountainous areas, the nighttime temperatures get down to well below 20 Celsius.
And, of course, I defer to your expert knowledge, Dr. Jones, but I do believe that Pacific salmon get as far south as California.
Temperatures are not too dissimilar there.
- Water.
- For the fish.
- No, for me.
- Of course.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Yes, Dr. Jones?
This is plainly ridiculous.
There's just no way that salmon can survive in those sort of environments.
If your sheikh wants to pour his money down the drain, why doesn't he buy himself a football club or something?
Look, Dr. Jones.
I don't really think it's my place to explain the sheikh's motivations.
But I will say this, that of all of our wealthy clients, he is different.
I would go so far as to describe him as a visionary man.
- A visionary?
- Yes, I know, it's not a very fashionable word, but if you decide to take this project with us, then you can judge for yourself when you meet him.
My line manager asked me to come here and take this meeting to discuss your project and that I have done.
I thank you for your time, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
I'll see myself out.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Did you get my e-mail?
Yes.
What did it say?
Took the meeting.
Waste of time, as predicted.
Now, if you don't mind, I'll get back to my work.
Dr. Jones.
What is this?
P45.
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't understand.
Well, a P45 is the official document given to an employee when his services are no longer required by his, or her, employer.
Yes, but, Bernard, this has got my...
Or you can sign this letter stating that you are delighted to assign yourself, exclusively, to the Yemeni salmon fishing project with immediate effect.
It's up to you.
But, Bernard, you know as well as I do this thing is a bloody joke.
There's no way you can get salmon that far up a...
Just there.
This is blackmail, Sugden.
This is a bloody outrage.
Fitzharris Price will be paying your salary while on secondment.
Almost double what it is now.
I'd say that's a bloody outrage.
Double?
Can I have time to think about this?
Nope.
- Can I borrow your pen?
- No.
It's my special one with the italic nib.
Hey.
Hold it, hold it.
Hold it.
Brian, what...
What have you got in bar seven?
I should have resigned.
You can't afford to resign.
Matter of principle.
I have a standing in the scientific community, Mary.
A reputation.
You have a mortgage.
Two, three, four.
Maybe I should resign.
We could have a baby.
Why not?
You could stay on at work and I could bring up the nipper.
I could take him to the park and to school.
I could take him fishing.
What do you think?
They're really losing the plot in Geneva.
One minute they're buying Euros, the next minute they can't ditch them fast enough for dollars.
They're panicking, and guess who they want to bail them out.
I can't imagine.
Say a command.
- Shut up.
- Say a command.
What were you shouting about back there?
Nothing.
Say a command.
Mar)'...
Oh, Lord.
Well, that should do you for a while.
Thank you, Mary.
Good night.
Night, dear.
Oh, Jesus.
Good morning.
Yes, Staff.
I've gotta go.
Now?
Yeah.
That was the call.
Sorry.
Is it Afghanistan?
It's somewhere sandy, that's for sure.
- I'll go get some tea.
- No, look...
- No, it's all right, Robert.
It's...
- No, no, come here.
Look, the last few weeks...
This is good.
Wonderful.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.
Will you wait for me?
Now go get that tea.
You bastard.
Well, firstly, we would need to trap 10,000 salmon from the North Sea, for the sake of argument, get them to the Yemen alive, don't ask me how, where they would be deposited in temperature and oxygen-controlled holding tanks built into a wadi
that would, hallelujah, open during the rainy season, allowing the salmon to migrate upstream for, say, 10 kilometers, which would allow your sheikh to hoick them out of the water to his heart's content.
Of course, until the dry season, when they will all
die.
Well, unless we feed the wadi all year round using the dam.
Of course.
Stupid idiot man.
Why not use precious water resources to support one man's sport fishing?
So, now that we have year-round water, why not build some gravel spawning grounds, breed the world's first Arabian salmon, and teach the clever fellows to migrate to the Indian Ocean...
Wonderful, wonderful idea.
Singing, "Step we gaily, here we go.
Heel for heel and toe for toe."
Rough cost?
Cost?
Cost.
Forty million.
No, 45...
- Fifty million.
- Dollars?
- Dollars.
- Dollars.
Or pounds.
Pounds.
At least.
So it's theoretically possible?
Well, it's theoretically possible in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is theoretically possible.
It's very impressive, Dr. Jones.
No, it's not.
It's nonsense.
Look, I just made it all up.
No, the drawing.
Real talent, if I might say so.
Excellent start.
So I suppose we should just crack on and get things started now?
You can't hold me to this.
I mean, these are just random ideas.
I mean, this is a sort of joke.
Well, I'm sure you wouldn't joke about a 50-million-pound project, Dr. Jones.
Not when you're in charge of it.
Well, the sheikh is so looking forward to meeting you, and he'll be back in the next couple of weeks.
So, in the meantime, is there anything else that I can do for you?
Well, as a matter of fact, there is.
Could you arrange a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
The one in China?
Is there another?
British Oxygen Company.
A meeting with them as well.
And then, what are those great big transport aircraft called?
The big Russian military...
Antonovs.
Find out about renting two of those, one for the fish and one to carry all the money that we're going to need.
When that's done, I'd be delighted to start working.
Good day, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good day, Dr. Jones.
Mary!
Up here.
Boy, did I put a hurricane up that Chetwode-Talbot woman.
You would have laughed.
I told her I wanted a meeting with the Three Gorges Dam team from...
Where are you going?
Geneva.
I told you.
You didn't say now.
Well, I am.
Tomorrow.
Well, how long are you going for?
Six weeks, to start with.
Six weeks?
There's no need to shout.
Six weeks, though, Mary.
This is a big chance for me.
I'll be heading up the whole operation.
Well, you could say "Congratulations."
Great.
Enough is enough.
It's job or marriage.
You've got to make a decision and make it now, God damn it.
There are planes, you know, Fred.
And I get Sundays off.
Mostly.
You can get all your horrible old fishing stuff out again.
Didn't even ask me.
Just went and did it.
I know.
I'm sorry.
It just suddenly seemed like the right decision.
Maybe for both of us.
Fred, I don't want to leave on bad terms.
No.
No.
I'll open a bottle of something fizzy.
Okay?
Reports are coming in from Afghanistan of a British soldier killed while on duty in Helmand Province.
An improvised explosive device detonated during a routine search in a local village.
This...
The Minister for Culture 's been photographed doing what?
Naked or clothed?
Boy or girl?
How old?
Jesus.
Well, at least she's legal.
Press statement from us saying that we're a party of policy not personality, concentrating on the real issues of getting this country back on track in times of economic hardship and not tabloid sensationalism, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Meanwhile, get the useless arse on the front page of every paper apologizing for being born, big spread in Hello!
with blonde forgiving wife and cute kids.
If they're not cute, find a horse or something.
Joshua!
Hood.
Don't you suck your teeth at me, young man.
I'm not one of your bitches from the Baltimore low-rises.
You feel me?
I'm your fucking mother!
Got to go.
Meeting.
Dear Dr. Jones, the sheikh has requested your company at his estate in Glen Tulloch to discuss the salmon project further.
Please advise which dates would suit you best.
Many thanks, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Fitzharris Price.
Mr. Sugden would like to see you in the canteen, sir.
Up his arse with a meter ruler.
Thanks, Betty.
- Which one is he?
- Over here.
Fred.
Can I introduce Patricia Maxwell?
She is the Prime Minister's press officer.
Hello.
Fifty million from Sheikh Muhammed thingammy.
It's the first-stage payment on research development for the salmon fishing project.
The PM's keeping a close eye on this one.
It's just what we need right now, a bit of Anglo-Arab news that isn't about things that explode.
I want to know, is it a goer?
Goer?
Well, look, the complexities.
I mean, I barely know even where to begin, but, well, just for starters, we would need 10,000 live salmon.
Is 10,000 salmon a lot?
Well, if they're to come from British waters, and I don't see where else they're gonna come from.
I mean, you would need the permission of the Environment Agency.
That's your job, Bernard.
Okay, so you get on to the EA and get this man his salmon.
- Miss Maxwell.
Ms.
- Mrs. Happily married.
Details in Who's Who.
Mrs. Maxwell, there are two million fishermen in the UK who are, I would say, unusually protective of...
How many?
- Two million.
- Two million?
- Yes.
- Bloody hell.
Two million out there waving their little rods around?
Are they the kind that vote our way?
They vote for those that best look after their fish, in my experience.
I bet they do, I bet they do.
Right, so, Prime Minister on the front cover of Fishy Weekly or whatever.
Best friend of the British fisherfolk.
Spearing a leaping salmon.
I like this.
I like it a lo'[.
They do have magazines, these people?
They can read?
Aye, the Angling Times, Trout and Salmon,
Coarse Fishing Monthly, Bassmania.
Bassmania?
Marvelous.
Marvelous.
That's marvelous.
This has just become a priority project.
Anything I can do, just give me a call.
Two million.
God, men, what a species.
I don't think she got the right end of the stick there.
Your call, I think, Bernard.
Ten thousand native Atlantic salmon on my desk by Friday, please.
Yeah, well, you'd just better come through on this, Jones.
It's been a long time since I was back.
- Yes?
- A long time.
You see?
- Is that where he lives?
- Yes.
He has many estates, but this one's his favorite.
- May I present Malcolm, the butler.
- Hello.
- This is Dr. Jones.
- Welcome to Glen Tulloch, sir.
His Excellency thought you might like to avail yourself of the fishing while you're waiting.
Thank you very much.
May I present Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama.
This is Dr. Jones.
It's a great pleasure to meet you, Your Excellency.
To meet the creator of the Woolly Jones, the pleasure's all mine, sir.
That's very kind.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, do you realize that for more than 10 years
I have fished with a Woolly Jones?
Really?
What's a Woolly Jones?
Dr. Jones invented a famous fly.
Well, it's a sentimental habit that some fly-tiers have of calling a fly after...
Anyway, I don't approve of that sort of thing normally, but...
Woolly Jones.
It's a great name.
A bloody good fly, that's for sure.
Please allow me to show you a delightful lie just around the corner.
Absolutely.
Lead on.
You think I'm mad?
- No, Your Excellency.
I...
- Of course you do.
I would question your judgment if you did not.
Though I have judgment enough to know that under there lies a fish much cleverer than I.
I'm a great admirer of the British for many reasons, but still there are mysteries to me.
The rich are frightened of the poor.
The poor are frightened of the rich.
And even your politicians, they try to sound like the people on the EastEnders.
A wonderful program, but still.
Yes, the great British class system.
Indeed.
But fishermen, I have noticed, they don't care whether I'm brown or white, rich or poor, wearing robes or waders.
All they care about is the fish, the river and the game we play.
For fishermen, the only virtues are patience, tolerance and humility.
I like this.
You are struck dumb by my naivety, Dr. Alfred.
No, you're on.
- What?
- You're on.
- This is a sign.
- A sign?
A sign that I should stop talking bollocks and fish.
Come here.
- Nicely done, sir.
- Thank you.
Very nicely done.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Hello, Dr. Jones.
Is that yours?
- The dress.
- Yes.
This is not mine.
It suits you very well.
Thank you.
They seem to know my size.
That not strike you as a wee bit sinister?
The idea of the sheikh's tailor tracking me across London with some kind of satellite measuring device?
They asked me for your size.
And I took a guess.
Well, for future reference,
I have a 32-inch waist, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
- Right.
- Not a 34.
No pies for me.
Note taken, sorry about that.
Thank you.
Ms. Harriet has told me of your marvelous plan.
Plan?
Well, not so much of a plan, really, as more of a feasibility study.
Theoretically possible, you said, Dr. Jones.
Theoretically.
Indeed.
It would be a miracle of God if it were to happen.
I'm more of a facts-and-figures man myself.
You're not a religious man?
No.
No, I'm not.
But you're a fisherman, Dr. Jones.
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
How many hours do you fish before you catch something?
Dozens?
Gosh, hundreds sometimes.
Is that a good use of your time for a facts-and-figures man?
But you persist in the wind and the rain and the cold with such poor odds of success.
Why?
Because you're a man of faith, Dr. Alfred.
And in the end, you are rewarded for your faith and constancy.
With a fish.
With due respect, fishing and religion are hardly the same thing, Your Excellency.
With equal respect,
I have to disagree.
A toast?
To faith.
And fish.
To faith and fish.
To faith and fish.
And science.
And science.
You're unhappy tonight, Ms. Harriet?
No.
I'm fine, really.
I have too many wives not to know when a woman is unhappy.
Though mine are not so quiet about it.
Robert, he's my boyfriend, has just been posted to Afghanistan.
Or somewhere.
I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.
For how long?
They don't really tell us things like that.
How worrying.
I just try not to think about it.
And you are married, Dr. Alfred?
Indeed.
It is kind of her to spare you.
My wife's actually working abroad at the moment in Geneva, so...
So you two have more in common than one might suppose.
I have put my feet in it.
Please forgive me.
Perfect moment to retire to bed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
You're welcome.
- Dr. Alfred.
- Your Excellency.
I know you have been persuaded to help us, but unless you do this with an open heart,
I don't think anything will come of it.
So, please, consider.
Of course.
I hope we meet again.
Dr. Jones.
Yes?
Well, I was just wondering what you thought.
Well, the sheikh's English has a certain tendency towards the mystical, don't you think?
But then, doolally as this entire enterprise clearly is,
I've had the most pleasant day I can remember having for quite a long time.
So, if the sheikh is paying, as it were, on we go.
Great.
Good night, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Good night, Dr. Jones.
It's been a pleasure.
Yes.
Have you any idea what an outcry there would be if the Environment Agency stripped British rivers of 10,000 salmon and shipped them off to the effing Yemen?
Well, how many can you spare?
None!
Christ, Bernard!
Anglers, they're obsessive crazies.
You think AI Qaeda are a threat, think again, mate.
I've seen a fly fisherman wade into a river and try and drown a canoeist just for passing by in a Day-Glo jacket.
You haven't got a hope in hell of getting these fish from British rivers.
- Yes?
- Dr. Jones.
Hello.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
How nice.
- Did we book a meeting?
- No.
You know how you said that you wanted a meeting with the hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam?
- Did I say that?
- Yes.
That might have been a little hasty.
- They're outside.
- Who?
The chief hydro-engineering team from the Three Gorges Dam.
Here?
I e-mailed them about the flow rate calculus, and I think there must have been some kind of...
My Mandarin is very rusty.
Bloody hell.
We are able to control the flow of water from the upstream dam.
But we are...
Well, we're concerned about the capability of the sandstone walls.
I mean, there's the possibility also of some flash-flood scenario.
Thank you very much.
My God, do you think we got away with it?
- Do you know, I think we did.
- I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
No, please don't apologize.
I think we've just found our engineers.
- Yes.
- I mean, should the project, of course, get that far.
Your Mandarin was much better than I expected.
- Thank you.
- Bernard Sugden, Head of Department.
Hello.
Alfred not bothering you too much, I hope?
No.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot from Fitzharris Price.
Hello.
Bet he doesn't even know your first name, does he?
So, who were all those little chippy-chappies?
Those are the engineers from the Three Gorges Dam.
What, the one in China?
- Is there another?
- Don't think there's another one.
Would have appreciated an introduction.
Bernard is the man who's responsible for acquiring our 10,000 native Atlantic salmon.
How's that coming along, Bernard?
Don't you worry about that, Fred.
It's all in hand.
Well, don't dilly-dally.
Our end is coming along.
- We're bang on schedule, in fact.
- Yes.
A debrief in the canteen, or has Fred brought in the famous sandwiches?
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot and I are going out for lunch, Bernard.
There's lots to discuss.
Clare, could you ask Betty to bring my bag?
Thank you.
Certainly, Dr. Jones.
Are you sure you won't have one?
At lunch time?
Dr. Jones, I haven't spoken a word of Mandarin for about four years, so I am celebrating even if you're not.
I only drink alcohol on the weekend.
And even then, only after 7:00.
No exceptions?
None that I can think of.
Well, yeah.
We got married on a Friday, but I think it was, as I recall, a bank holiday in Northern Ireland, so I allowed myself, I think, a glass on a technicality.
That was an attempt at a joke, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Right.
Good one.
Do you really think it's going extremely well?
- What?
- The project.
The project.
Well, it's utter nonsense, of course, naturally, the bagatelle of a man with more money than sense, but...
I haven't actually found anything to say that it couldn't work.
You know, theoretically, of course.
In theory.
Well, theoretically speaking, in theory it...
- We'll see, yes.
- Of course.
Actually, these are the companies that have bid for the contract to build the holding tanks at the downstream end of the wadi.
- Shall we go through these?
- Now?
Yes, we could go through them now.
Well, we could work and eat, no?
Yes, I...
Yes, all right, then.
- This one's from...
- Before that, cheers.
- Cheers.
- Very bad luck with water.
Some people think it's bad luck.
- EWB...
- Sorry.
Excuse me.
It's the barracks.
It's Robert.
- Sorry.
- No.
Go on.
- Hello.
- Go ahead.
Hello?
Yes?
What?
What?
Are you all right, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
He's missing in action.
What does that mean?
- Come upstairs and we'll get you your...
- No, I just need a minute.
Hello.
My name's Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Well, I only knew him for three weeks, but I am Robert's girlfriend.
I was wondering if you knew anything...
Of course.
Yes.
Sorry, Mrs. Mayers.
Yes, I...
Yes, of course.
Goodbye.
You've reached Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Leave a message after the beep.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, it's Dr. Jones here.
Please forgive me for calling you on your home number.
I was at something of a loss.
I realize that this has not been an easy week for you, but I was wondering when you might be coming back into the office.
I had a very productive meeting with the engineers from British Oxygen Company and, well, there's a lot of data coming in.
Really a considerable amount.
I'm sure I don't have to remind you that we are working to a deadline.
Time and tide, as I am sure you are aware, waits for no man.
Or woman.
Anyway, I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
Goodbye.
Can I come in?
Why?
Well, you might get cold.
- Very nice.
- What?
Your flat.
Very pleasant.
Look, I'm not...
I'm not coming into work, all right, because I need to stay here.
I need to be here in case there's news.
So, actually, anyone with a shred of understanding, or humanity, or simple feeling, who, frankly, wasn't suffering from some kind of Asperger's, would know that the last thing that I need
is your bullying little phone call asking me to come into work so that you can update me on fish.
You want to fill me in on fishing.
Well, Dr. Jones, you can take your work and you can shove it up your unfeeling arse.
I didn't come here to talk to you about work.
Then why are you here?
I made you a sandwich.
Why?
You're probably not eating.
Are you?
No.
You see, it's very important.
You must eat something.
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Here.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do because...
I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.
Call me Fred.
Just call me Fred.
- You're all right now?
- Yeah.
You all right?
- Sorry.
- No, don't.
Why don't I get a plate and we...
You can put this on a plate.
- Shall I do it?
- No, it's okay.
I'll do it.
I'm so sorry about what I said before.
That is just unforgivable.
The great thing about people with Asperger's is it's very difficult to hurt their feelings.
So it's all right, you can say whatever you like.
You don't have...
You know, I was upset.
And rightly so.
Look, I took the liberty of buying a wee bottle of wine.
Now, I hope you don't mind.
I know it's not the weekend, but this one goes very well with duck.
I'm not very hungry.
Harriet, you've got to try and eat...
Is it all right...
Is it all right for me to call you Harriet?
My father is...
He's ex-Army, so he's like very stiff upper lip and don't make a fuss about anything, but I'm more of a gusher.
I think that's his word for me, anyway.
My upper lip's never been very stiff, I'm afraid.
But you still have a boyfriend.
I mean, I don't know a great deal about such things, but...
Robert hasn't been listed as being dead, has he?
No.
But I just feel that "missing in action" is Army-speak for...
Dead?
No.
No, as a civil servant, I happen to know that the Ministry of Defense absolutely hate uncertainty of any kind.
If he were dead, they would simply say "dead."
Can you stop using that word, please?
- I beg your pardon.
- It's okay.
They say that they'll call when there's news.
But they don't, so I guess there isn't.
Come to the Yemen.
We're leaving tomorrow, just for a few days.
- Geological studies, engineering surveys.
- No.
We even have a team of archeologists checking we're not about to submerge the Ark of the Covenant, which would be unfortunate, you know.
No, I can't leave because there might be news and...
Well, then, you'll fly back on the sheikh's private jet immediately.
Why would he do that?
Because I asked him to.
Your services are very highly valued by the sheikh, and by me.
The project really can't do without you.
Who the hell cares?
Project?
I mean, it's fishing.
You know, who the hell cares?
Well, strangely enough, I do.
I mean, I know it's probably just a terrible folly, but, still, I can't help sometimes imagining that this crazy enterprise might just come off.
You know, with a bit of luck and with the right people.
And you, you are most definitely, most definitely one of the most rightest people that I've had the good fortune to come across.
If you'll forgive the grammatical inadequacies of that sentence.
Do you sometimes think that maybe we're just part of a lavish practical joke?
What do you mean?
Salmon, here?
Yes, I'm beginning to suppose that.
I don't know anyone that goes to church any more.
I don't think I do, either.
On a Sunday, we go to Target.
You know, this gravel here is perfect for salmon to lay their eggs in between.
Who'd have thought that here in the middle of the Yemen, perfect spawning grounds for salmon?
Fred, look.
What?
Yes.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Harriet, the water.
- It's beautiful.
- It's cold.
The water in her well is cold.
Oh, my goodness.
It's really happening, Fred.
Oh, my goodness, it really is.
Unbelievable.
These men, they say that by bringing water, life, to this desert,
I am bringing the Western ways to our land.
They say I have insulted God himself.
I say they are fools.
A thousand apologies, my friends.
Please, this is not a way to introduce you to our great enterprise.
Look.
Is it not magnificent?
It's beautiful.
Certainly is.
Bloody amazing.
- Hello.
- Hello.
For the last time, Sugden, there is absolutely no way I can get you these fish.
Tom, this comes from the top.
The very top.
I don't care if God's taken up fly fishing.
Now, I suggest you make this work, Tom.
Is that a threat, Sugden?
These are difficult days, Tom.
Cuts.
Cuts everywhere.
I don't know.
Ls the Environment Agency a frontline service?
That is a threat.
See it as an opportunity.
Well, then.
An opportunity.
Hilary, get me Matthew Sweet from Fly Fishing Monthly, will you?
That's all I've been told, and so I...
Okay.
All right, then.
Well, please, please, please call me when...
Okay.
Bye.
I'm so sorry.
Did I wake you up?
No.
No, no.
News?
No.
No, I was just leaving a message on Robert's phone which is ridiculous because he hasn't got his phone with him.
And I know that.
Just turning into a madwoman.
No.
No, when things get tricky in my life, I talk to my fish.
I have a pond.
Talking to an answering machine is no madder than chatting to koi carp.
I just somehow wouldn't associate you with having a tricky life.
Well, it wouldn't do to talk about your emotions with a colleague, would it, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?
No, I think...
I think things are beyond tricky, really.
They have been for some time.
Mary's in Geneva.
I'm here.
The koi carp are alone in Surrey.
We got married very young.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't really know things were hard.
No, don't apologize.
There's always hope.
For me and for you.
Do you know, I can't even remember what he looks like.
Not exactly.
But I'm stuck, and I can't move on.
Does that make any sense?
Yes.
Totally.
I feel a bit like I've been stuck for years.
Yes, but you can move on.
Well, I suppose in theory.
You should be happy, Fred.
I knew you'd have a pond.
The traitor has had his chance.
You know what to do.
Do not fail us.
I think the idea of taking Scottish salmon to a foreign country is absolutely absurd.
These fish have been running these rivers for tens of thousands of years.
I've fished the rivers of Scotland all my life.
Yes, Prime Minister.
It would appear that the gentle fisherfolk are not so effing gentle after all.
Rape and pillage of our national rivers...
What, ditch the whole thing?
No.
No, no, no, Prime Minister.
No, we must just find the fish somewhere bloody else.
Your turrets are blocking my reception.
Well, I'm terribly sorry about that, madam.
If you'd care to follow me, please.
Mrs. Maxwell.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- It's an honor.
Happy birthday, Patricia.
Yes, we could do with a few more like you in Cabinet.
Very good, Your Excellency.
I'm grateful, indeed, that you could spare some time for our little project.
Yes.
Well, we have gone out on a bit of a limb for you, Your Excellency, but the Prime Minister does love his fishing.
- Really?
- Yes.
Rod's never out of his hand.
Anyway, down to business.
The fish.
The salmon.
We're not gonna get it out of British waters.
There's a bloody big fuss about it, as no doubt you've heard.
Don't know what it is about fishing.
Anyway, no-goer.
- Yes, but I thought...
- However,
I have solved your problem.
See?
There must be thousands in this one alone.
This guy's got four fish farms up and down the coast.
Stocks all the Tescos.
Right under your nose.
These fish were bred for the dinner table.
It's barbaric.
They've never run in their lives.
Neither have their forebears for two generations.
Why would they run for us?
The difference in these salmon...
We'd open the sluices and they would just drift off downstream never to be seen again.
Well, get a couple of days fishing out of it, then just re-stock or whatever the word is.
Seems to be no shortage of them.
In transit for the supermarkets.
These fish will never run.
They're just not right.
Not right?
Well, a fish is a fish is a fish, isn't it?
No.
You see, Mrs. Maxwell, I have a vision.
Tired, bloated pretenders are not part of this vision.
Well, unfortunately, Her Majesty's Government also has a vision, and that vision is farmed fish or no fish.
Then I must thank you for your precious time.
And decline.
No advisers, either.
Back at your desk on Monday, Fred.
Well, in that case, I resign.
Resignation accepted.
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.
So, this leaves us with what?
Well, with no salmon.
We must have faith, Dr. Alfred.
Well, that's a very laudable sentiment, Your Excellency, but we're running out of time.
Can't catch faith with a fishing rod.
Hello, Fred.
Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I didn't think he looked right, that man.
And he pulled out a gun!
Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Alfred.
Thank you very much.
Don't be silly.
Don't be silly.
It was only a cast, really.
A very good cast.
An essential cast, one might say.
Yes, I suppose one might say that.
- Here.
- My God, Fred.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
It was very quick.
It was over in a flash, really.
How did you do that?
I did a right-handed snake roll.
Did I get him?
Yes, it was extraordinary.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you very much.
Please, continue your work as if nothing had happened.
Of course, of course.
I owe you my life.
No.
Please, come on.
Anyone would have...
This is not one of those British metaphors, Dr. Alfred.
The debt will be repaid.
- Bye, now.
- Goodbye.
Bye.
In response to the Right Honorable Member's question of the 7th of last month, the Ministry of Defense can now confirm that an engagement by British Special Forces against known terrorists did occur on the 13th of September.
The details of this operation are classified.
However, I am at liberty to say that serious casualties were incurred by the British forces.
I deeply regret to inform the House that there were no survivors.
An internal investigation is being carried out.
Sorry to wake you up.
- No, don't be.
- It's just...
It's okay.
It's just...
I just never got the chance to really know him.
Mary?
Fred?
There you are.
I had no idea you were...
I got a day off and thought, "Why not surprise him?"
I've got this wonderful Swiss mountain Comté from a little shop round the corner in Geneva.
Is everything all right, Fred?
Where's your suit and tie?
Day off?
I resigned.
Don't be ridiculous.
You've resigned?
What about your pension?
It's final salary.
Well, the government pulled out of the salmon fishing project and we'd put a lot of time and energy into it.
I didn't want to walk away from that.
Well?
Well, everyone involved.
I'm still being paid, if that's what you're worried about.
Fitzharris Price have been more than...
I might have known she'd be involved.
If you're referring to Harriet, we're working on the project together.
Of course she's involved.
- Harriet?
- What do you mean exactly by that, Mary?
I've seen her photograph on the Fitzharris Price website.
You're making a fool of yourself.
Now it's you that's being ridiculous.
Am I'.?
I'm not the one abandoning a decent, highly respected job for a joke fishing project and a short-skirted office girl.
- She's not an office girl.
- What is she, then, Fred?
Hey?
Just what is she?
She's a colleague.
- She's a very talented colleague and...
- And?
And a friend!
She's just a friend!
Are you in love with her?
I've done nothing, Mary.
I have no expectations.
I didn't ask about your expectations.
I asked if you were in love with her.
This is a mid-life crisis.
It's textbook, it's pathetic.
I'm so sorry, Mary.
You'll be back, Fred.
Or you'll try.
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
You'd think a bloody scientist would know that much!
Six months and you'll be begging to be taken back in.
It's in your DNA.
We don't need native river fish.
We'll be all right with farmed salmon.
I know.
I don't much like them, but...
Well, they will run.
I know it.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Despite our moral and philosophical objections, farmed salmon will run.
I'm absolutely sure of it.
You are tireless, Doctor.
You have uncovered some new research?
A new paper, perhaps?
No, I just know it.
You just know it.
I see.
Faith, Dr. Alfred.
Damn it.
Yes, all right, then, faith.
So?
They're alive.
That hurts!
Sorry, sweetie.
- Mrs. Maxwell?
- What?
Amazing news.
One of the officers presumed dead,
Captain Robert Mayers, has been found alive.
- Good.
- Yes, we're very pleased.
Yes, very good.
It's very good news for the family.
And his girlfriend, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who else knows about this?
You're the first to know.
Right, keep it that way.
Total press embargo.
Do you understand?
- Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
- That salmon fishing thing.
Is that still happening?
As far as I'm aware.
- It is?
- Yes.
- Yemen?
- Yes.
Perfect.
Yes, this is all coming together very nicely.
I intended to create a small miracle.
Something to glorify God and bring our tribes together.
Sometimes I wonder if we haven't created something that glorifies man.
It is a very fine line.
Hubris, Dr. Alfred.
Hubris.
- It's nice here.
- Beautiful.
You know, Fred, this project, it saved me.
I think.
You know, with everything that happened.
So those farmed fish had better run.
- I believe they will.
- You do?
Yes, I believe that it's in the very core of their being to head upstream even if they never have, even if the parent fish never have.
Look at this.
Look at that.
Mary said something about me.
She said that I was genetically programmed to return to a dull pedestrian life with her.
That it was in my DNA.
Do you think that you are?
No.
No, I belong here.
I always have done.
- Harriet.
- Yes.
I was wondering about you and me.
The theoretical possibility in the same way as a manned mission to Mars is a theoretical possibility.
Obviously.
Or salmon fishing in the Yemen.
Yes.
- Yes?
- Yes.
I just need a little time.
Of course, of course.
All the time you want.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Mr. Foreign Secretary.
- Brian Fleet.
The great fisherman.
The great...
Well, it has been a little while, to be honest.
A bit rusty, you know.
Some skills are never forgotten.
Please, follow this man to your tent.
I shall join you shortly.
What have you been saying?
Fishing's the last thing anyone's gonna be interested in, trust me.
Get ready for the photo op of a lifetime, Sonny Jim.
N-S-R.
No salmon required.
Is that a Woolly Jones?
No, this is a new one I've invented.
IS it?
What's it called?
This one is called the Chetwode-Talbot Beauty.
That's very nice.
It's true.
You're not being funny?
No, I don't have a sense of humor, as you recall.
That is true.
- Beautiful.
- Yes, she is.
Here.
Thank you.
Don't you think we should be doing something, Fred?
Preparing?
L am preparing...
Well, for the whole thing, you know.
Everything's done, Harriet, it's fine.
Just relax.
Did you just...
Dr. Alfred Jones just told me to relax.
What is the world coming to?
Oh, my God.
Harriet.
Right, Harriet and Robert...
Right, okay.
Shut up, hacks.
No military stuff.
It's classified.
Anyway, I don't think you'd understand it.
The only thing you need to know is that this man, Captain Mayers here, is a war hero.
Human interest stuff only.
Sir.
Harriet, can you tell us how it feels?
It feels like it's a...
It's a...
It's a shock, but it's wonderful.
Please can we have a kiss?
Go on.
Come on.
I am sorry, my friend.
No-No, it's...
It's a miracle.
Indeed.
Nevertheless, I'm sorry.
All right, gentlemen, gentlemen, I think that's all.
A little privacy for the couple, please.
I'd just like to say that the British government is proud to have played a small but significant part in this extraordinary reunion of Harriet and Captain Mayers.
That's what we're here for.
This is strange.
Bad strange?
No, good strange.
Do you mind if we don't...
No, of course not.
There's no rush.
Will you just hold me?
How did you get caught up in this, H?
Salmon fishing out here?
It's ridiculous.
Well, you never know with the sheikh.
I expect there will be a six-star hotel and a golf course before you know it.
That's not his style at all.
Don't you believe it.
He's gotta make his money back somehow.
They're no fools, these Arabs.
You don't sleep, either?
No, not much.
Well...
At least there's no bloody journos around at this time, anyway.
You've been very good to Harriet, Fred.
I appreciate it.
I love her.
Yeah, she's great.
She's really great.
No.
I love her.
Does she love you?
I don't know now.
Yesterday, you weren't alive.
Well, I apologize for not being dead in a ditch.
I don't think I can accept your apology.
Is that a joke?
Yes, yes, sort of.
I'm not...
I've never been very good at jokes.
It's all right, Robert.
Really.
It's all right.
The day has arrived.
Before the dam, this was a dry riverbed.
And now, as you all can see, we have water.
And today, we hope we shall discover the one missing thing.
So, thank you, one and all, for coming as not one of you, not even my dear self, knows if this curious experiment of mine will actually work.
It better had bloody work.
Doesn't matter if it works or not, dolly.
All that matters is you.
Fishing on Sky tonight with our war hero.
- I haven't done this in years.
- For God's sake.
There are 10,000 fish in there.
If you can't hook one of them, you can just flip off back to Transport.
My intention is to color this desert in green.
Make an agricultural industry for my people, and the sons and daughters of my people for generations to come.
- Right on cue.
- So here we are,
Muslims, Christians and the odd heathen.
We are all gathered here in an act of faith.
And why not?
And now, the moment that we are all waiting for, the fruits of all our efforts.
The moment of truth.
Open the sluices.
Where's it going?
It's going the wrong way.
It's heading downstream.
Wait a minute.
It's turned around.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
- Look, they're going upstream.
- Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, my God, they're running.
Fred, look.
Look!
- They're running, Fred!
- They're running!
Blondie.
Come down here, come on.
Come down here now.
Look, we ought to get a picture of him with the sheikh.
- It's working, Your Excellency.
- It is.
They are running upstream, look!
Let's go fishing, Dr. Alfred.
Turn it on, dolly.
I need to get further out.
For God's sakes.
Come on, off you go!
Have you got that?
Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
But can we get them closer together?
God, I'll give it a go.
Robert, darling.
Can you come...
Can you turn around a bit?
I'm worried about what he's doing with his rod.
Lovely.
And, Brian, just a nice smile, that would be good.
Did you get that?
God, he's useless, isn't he?
More fun without waders, Dr. Alfred.
Yes.
I think I caught one, Dr. Alfred.
It's a beauty, Your Excellency.
Look out behind you!
Your Excellency, behind you!
Step UP...
No, you first!
I repay my debts, Dr. Alfred.
- Okay.
I'll pull you up.
After...
- Okay.
Here, Your Excellency, hold on.
Here, come on.
We won't need these any more.
I just don't understand who would do this.
Why would they do this?
I know who.
And I know why.
Can't you find them?
Arrest them?
What for?
Justice.
Justice.
I think these destroyers...
Bad men, certainly.
But I think perhaps they have a point.
I expected people to understand what we were doing here.
I expected them to see that it was really not about fishing at all.
In the end, I asked for too much.
Will you try again?
The question is "Will we try again?"
This was ours.
Yes, I think maybe Robert wants to go home.
So, I don't...
I don't know.
Does home call, Dr. Fred?
I don't really have a home any more.
There was a moment when I had everything, but...
Well, now I don't know what to do.
When the time comes, you will know.
Well, until then.
Thank you.
Just gonna say goodbye to Fred.
Are you sure?
Sorry?
Listen, Harriet.
When I was in the desert, the only thing that kept me going was the thought of you.
You don't owe me anything.
I want you to understand that.
So...
We're going.
I'm so sorry, Fred.
It was an extraordinary idea.
It almost worked, too.
I wasn't talking about the project.
No, I'm not sure that I was.
I never meant to hurt you like this.
It's not your fault.
I don't know what to do.
I can't help you there, I'm afraid.
Are you going to stay?
Stay for what?
There's nothing here any more.
Not you, not a single fish left in the river.
Well, someone's gonna have to make a move.
Good luck, Harriet.
Dr. Alfred, look!
They're alive!
I'm going to stay.
I want to start again.
I'll do it on my own if I have to.
I'll start small, though, this time.
A different approach.
Just a few fish to begin with.
Involve the local community more.
Make it their project, not ours.
That's the way to protect it.
Do you need an assistant, Dr. Jones?
Well, I suppose I will.
I'm sure the sheikh has somebody that...
An assistant?
A partner.
A partner.
Yes, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.
More than anything.
DAD
Father of Four
- Back to nature
Just lift it for me.
I'll carry it the rest of the way.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I just need to get a grip.
Look, Bodil, our old fridge is on its way out.
- Come on.
- You can't carry it on your own.
- It is as light as a feather ...
- I have an idea, Bodil.
We'll never get it on the roof rack.
- Put it down on this, dad.
- Sure.
Come on, push!
That's just criminal!
Are you OK?
- Who's throwing refrigerators?
- Dad.
To take to Sweden.
Yes.
Let's fill the car.
A fridge in the forest?
We're taking it to the recycling centre.
I see. lt's going to be used again?
- Come with me.
- What for?
Let's pack.
As I'm not coming, I want you to have these.
Peter!
They're just the ones I was talking about!
- You are so nice!
- Watch out for those Swedish lads.
- They're into Danish girls.
- Cool!
Don't be silly!
You know you are the one I love!
- Uncle Anders, why the disguise?
- My name is not Uncle Anders.
My name is Cunning Bear.
I am a Boy Scout.
- Aren't you a bit old for that?
- Once a scout, always a scout.
Be prepared!
In nature's name!
DYB DYB DYB, DOB DOB DOB!
Just wait till you get to Annika's Wood!
- I love camping.
- As long as there's a loo.
- Is that all your kit?
- I have packed properly.
The boot is full, anyway.
The rest must go on the back seat.
What about us?
- Like this all the way to Sweden?
- Or fly tip the fridge ...
No, Ole, the fridge must be recycled.
I agree.
- Watch where you are going.
- Sorry.
Swedish currency ...
everything is tickety-boo.
- It doesn't seem so.
- You left this behind.
- Thank you.
- No trouble.
Got enough cold drinks for the trip?
We're taking it to Sweden for recycling.
- Obviously.
Have a good trip.
- Goodbye.
Why are we the only ones with a fridge on the roof?
Most people pay to have their old fridges taken away.
We're taking ours ourselves.
- We'd like to get rid of this.
- Are you from Denmark?
Welcome to Sweden.
The Swedish flag, bum titty bum.
Do the Swedes all dump their old fridges here?
In Sweden it's the law.
To protect the environment.
And this month you get an award made out of recycled materials.
- What did he say?
- There's a reward.
Exactly!
An MP3 player, a camera, or a clock radio.
Mie, you choose.
It was your idea.
Let me see ... we'll take the camera.
A good choice.
Lose the fridge and I'll bring the camera.
Our old fridge turns into a new camera!
Yes, it's cool.
Here it is.
Who's the lucky winner?
Thank you!
It is today Blow your cares away
Set off for the weekend No stress, all play
Me and you The others too
Deep into Sweden's Forests of Eden
Sunshine or rain The road's the same
A Swedish weekend's Sure to do you good
To the woods and sand Across lakes and land
We'll enjoy the country fresh and pure
Life is a pearl
When you set off to see the world
For the world is Really wiz lt comes closer When you are on the road
And if they say "Heysan!" We'll just say "Hi!"
Welcome to Annika's Nature Park
Blow me, we're here!
Look!
- Elk: the biggest creature here.
- That's a deer, dad.
All I'm saying is that the elk is the biggest creature here.
- You amaze me, dad.
- It's lovely here!
- Dad, I need a wee.
- Get out and enjoy the air.
Yes, it's fresh and pure.
Get back in, dad.
Yes, dad.
We're been going for more than ten hours.
There is someone out there.
Where?
Look!
An elk!
- It's a bear, dad.
- A real, live bear?
- They're dangerous.
- Yes, they eat people.
Get in or you'll end up as lunch.
It's an Elk.
I know what bears look like.
You're right!
But it looked like an elk.
Or were there two animals?
- You are dangerous company.
- Maybe it was someone dressed up.
- As a bear?
Come off it.
- Who'd do that in Sweden?
- I suppose this is it?
- I've never seen that hut before.
There wasn't a nature park last time we came.
- There's nobody here.
- Not a soul.
There's a goat though.
Hoppity hop!
Heysan, every man!
You are still the same little scaredy pants.
- Annika, is that you?
- It sure is!
How roligt to see you!
- Roligt ?
- It means "fun".
How roligt to see you!
- This is my cousin, Annika.
- What's your goat called?
Marcella.
And you must be Per?
Yes.
And this is Ole, Mie, Sis.
What cute kids you've got!
- How come you nearly speak Danish?
- Mum was Swedish, dad is Danish.
- Is he the one in a bear costume?
- I am sure it was a real bear.
You said it was an elk.
Lots ofweird things happen in the woods.
I'll show you your accommodation.
- Hip, hip, giddyap!
- Calm down, Per!
That's all right.
The wood is the best playground of all.
Yes, it's really rolig.
- Yuck!
A spider's web!
- Sis!
You are a thousand times the size of a spider.
- Come on, scaredy pants!
- Hey, I am a woodsman.
- A wasp!
- Dad, wasps are tiny!
You're a thousand times the size!
I'm all right.
No swimming unless you are with a grown-up.
No, no, the current is far too strong.
That's what I mean.
No swimming here.
- Can we cross the bridge?
- No, there are bears over there.
No bridge.
Not with a grown-up either.
- Isn't there anyone else here?
- No.
My park isn't popular.
- We're got it all to ourselves.
- Yes.
Did you hear that?
- It sounded like a big, strong bear.
- Can bears cross the bridge?
- Scaredy pants!
- Are you scared of bears, dad?
- You would be if you'd met one too.
- Have you met one, dad?
Yes, the time he got lost over there.
Remember?
- Did you get lost over there?
- Nothing happened.
- You never said!
- Just don't get lost out here.
OK, dad.
- Wasn't this a lake?
- Now it's a toxic swamp.
- Because people fly tip here.
- Who?
People who don't care about the countryside.
I hate them.
- How disgusting!
- It stinks.
- We used to swim here.
Remember?
- Yes.
Go on, have a dip!
We used to dive over there.
- No!
My phone!
- I'll rescue it.
- No.
Per!
It's poisonous!
- Don't!
- That phone's had it.
- Anyhow there's no signal here.
- Can the swamp really ruin stuff?
- Yes.
It's all that waste.
That's why we took our fridge to the centre.
Per?
How about lending a hand with the tent?
Sure.
- Now it's fine.
- Indeed it is.
It's lovely being so far away from everything.
- I wouldn't mind a toilet though.
- There is a phone.
I'd like to order a pizza for delivery to the woods in Sweden.
Ole, that is not a toy.
It's an emergency phone to my cabin.
- Only use it in emergencies.
- We don't want any of those.
This tent has a thermal ground sheet.
But dad, you said you'd be sleeping under the stars.
Yes, but the tent is for Uncle Anders.
He isn't a young man any more.
That's just criminal!
I must answer a call of nature.
- Sis, give me a hand.
- I really need the toilet.
Dig one.
Behind the bush.
- Bush?
- Nobody will see you.
- Excuse me!
- It'll be free in a moment.
Or you can dig your own if you really must.
- Something wrong?
- Uncle Anders on the loo.
Say no more.
Soon there will be silence
As the forest sleeps
Summer sings a cadence This vibe is for keeps
Beneath the starry sky ln the camp fire glow
Pleasure spins a sigh As we taste the air bare toed
Elks and bears and buzzing insects
Balmy scent the night perfects
Life in the Swedish forests ls so pure and fair
Because we are allowed to sleep ln the open air
- You want some DEET?
- I don't use chemicals.
They're ready ... there.
- Shall I carve?
- It'll only take a jiffy.
For you.
And you.
And you ...
Per ..
And Sis.
- Here!
- What did I do?
- I saw a mosquito.
- Thank you.
It brings back the old days around the camp fire.
- With your father, Gubben.
- Yes, how is he?
Very well thank you.
He was such an accomplished trap maker.
Not only for animals, eh, dad?
He called your dad a real sissy.
He hadn't the "damnedest idea", he always said.
- Dad's not a sissy.
- Thank you, Per.
- You'll love Gubben.
- Is he coming to your party?
I haven't seen him for a very long time.
- You haven't?
- No.
What was that?
Per?
Don't go into the woods on your own.
Per?
- What's the idea?
- They dropped their fridge.
We'd better stop them.
Best not stand there.
What the hell are you doing?
I nearly ran you down!
You dropped your fridge.
- What the hell are you on about?
- They are Danish.
Danish?
Nasty.
What are they doing here?
- Annika?
- Yes, hi.
- Do you know them?
- They are my Danish relatives.
They've come for the weekend.
- This is Rikard.
- Hello.
- He is Danish and lives in Sweden.
- Hi, beautiful.
You're tasty.
- So we dropped something?
- Yes, your fridge.
Down there.
What a shame!
Carl-Åke, you are so careless.
Need a hand?
- We'll manage, right?
- Damn it, Rikard.
- Thanks for your help.
- Any time.
I'll see you at the midsummer party.
- I am not so sure.
- I am, baby.
Annika!
Go on ahead, I need to talk to Rikard.
What trevlig relatives you've got!
- Leave them alone.
- If you stick to our deal.
- Can I trust you though?
- Have I touched your papa lately?
No.
Keep quiet about the money I make fly tipping fridges in the wood.
And we'll leave that one right there.
Right?
I suppose so.
Goodbye.
- Are you comfy, dad?
- You are very brave.
Any man of nature sleeps beneath the stars.
- Sleep tight, dad!
- You, too.
- Sleep tight, dad!
- Good night!
Good night!
Why didn't Annika shout at those men?
They dropped the fridge by accident.
- Rikard seems a bit weird.
- Annika seems weirder.
Imagine!
Living in the woods with a goat!
Shhh!
Did you hear that?
I think there's an animal outside.
Can you hear it?
- Now I can.
- Ready?
I hope it's not a bear.
- Stop it!
- It isn't funny!
- You are so horrid!
- For goodness sake!
Go back to bed.
We're getting up early.
Nice one, Per.
- Good morning, Uncle Anders!
- Good morning!
- Look, a toad!
- There are lots ofwild creatures.
Good morning, children.
How did you sleep?
- Really well.
And you?
- Like a log.
Dad's right.
You sleep fantastically out here.
- Where is dad?
- He ... is in the tent.
- Oh?
- He snuck inside in the night.
- Isn't he going to get up?
- Just try to wake him!
What a sissy!
I know how to wake him up.
There's an animal!
You certainly know how to ginger up your dad.
I've got an animal down me.
- Per!
- It's only a toad.
- Good morning crew!
- Good morning!
Where is Per?
Per?
Where are you?
It is Annika's birthday, Happy birthday, happy birthday
Listen to Us whistle for her
- Happy birthday!
- You are so kind!
Dad, stand next to her so I can get a photo of you.
Smile!
I have a map.
Take it with you when you go hiking.
I know the woods like the back of my hand.
- Let's take it anyway.
- No, thank you.
- Would you like some coffee?
- I could do with a cup.
- How nice!
- Yes.
I could murder a caffe latte.
Marcella?
Come to Annika!
Fine.
There.
Pass your cup.
A forest latte.
Thanks.
You're going to drink it?
!
It tastes absolutely perfect.
There is nothing like a morning swim in a Swedish lake, eh, Sis?
- I'll give it a miss.
- Last one in is a sissy!
Wait for me!
- Dad's a sissy.
- No, Uncle Anders is.
That's just criminal!
- Do come in, Sis!
- The water's lovely.
- And there aren't many creatures.
- No way.
I could have stayed in that lake all day.
- Shall we go back tomorrow?
- Of course.
Are you hungry?
- Yes.
- We can find our lunch here.
- Such as?
- All kinds of things.
Mushrooms, berries, leaves.
Look, a delicious leaf.
Stop!
Stop everyone!
Did you just taste that?
- It has made my throat itch.
- It's poisonous.
- You said we could eat anything.
- We had better hurry back.
- I know a shortcut.
- Let's stick to the path.
I know the wood.
That way.
- Drink plenty.
- I'm feeling better now.
- How come you know the wood?
- Annika and I played here.
We ate berries and climbed trees.
I can't get lost here.
It was the rest of us who had to look for you.
But you sure knew how to cry for help ...
Wait ...
- Let me see ...
- Fortunately we have ... this.
- What is it?
- A compass.
With a compass you always know which direction to take.
The needle always points north.
Our camp is south.
The lake is to the east ...
In that direction.
May I try?
If the camp is to the south, why are we heading west?
- It's a shortcut.
- A detour, more like.
- We should've brought the map.
- Maps are for the old and feeble.
- Dad?
- Dad's walked into a trap!
- I've got tabs on it.
- A Gubben masterpiece, I'd say.
I can see everything from here.
That's the direction.
We'd better cut you down first.
- There's a man!
- He looks like Annika's dad.
- It is Gubben.
- The funny guy?
- Look at that fur!
- Perhaps he shot a bear.
- It looks like a costume.
- Perhaps that's whom we saw.
No, that was a real bear, I'm sure.
Let's ask him.
Hey, Gubben!
Do you remember us?
Surely you remember me?
It's me!
Uncle Anders!
What do you use the fur for?
Nothing.
Why have you kept it, then?
We've come all the way from Denmark to celebrate Annika's birthday.
I expect You are going to the party?
I don't go to parties.
My dad always goes to my birthday parties.
Beat it!
Go away!
Go away!
Leave me in peace!
- Gubben had completely changed.
- No, he wasn't any fun at all.
- I don't understand either.
- He was that bear.
- But why?
- He's old, that's all.
Imagine that anyone can grow so weird with age.
Don't forget, we're celebrating Annika's 50th birthday.
- Hello!
Have you had a good day?
- Are those your party clothes?
These?
Why?
Give me a moment.
Come with me.
Yes, come on!
Ten minutes!
Heysan everyone!
Welcome to the midsummer feast!
- Thank you.
- How lovely you look tonight!
- What are they up to?
- Raising the pole.
I want to help!
Now the midsummer dance can begin!
How lucky for you that today is your birthday!
This is from us.
- You shouldn't have!
- Of course we should!
How sweet of you!
How lovely!
Thank you!
It's going to be a splendid evening.
Just like last time.
Look!
- It's Gubben!
- He's come after all!
- You met him?
- In the woods.
We invited him.
- You should have told me.
- Aren't you pleased?
Yes, but ...
Of course I am.
- Why doesn't he come over?
- Shall I fetch him?
No, he won't come to the party.
- My father and I fell out long ago.
- Why?
My father thinks people should be kept out of the woods.
- Why does he think like that?
- Because people spoil the woods.
- Some do.
But not everyone.
- Gubben is an eccentric.
- Why notjust stop the few?
- It isn't that easy.
Well?
is this party any good?
Are there any nice bits of skirt?
Carl-Åke, time to dance.
You look beautiful.
Come and dance.
- I had no idea you could dance.
- Oh?
I have many hidden talents.
You and me, we're the perfect couple.
I don't think so.
- What are they talking about?
- I don't know.
Let me dump stuff without any bother.
- We'll split the takings.
- Never!
I only keep quiet in case you harm my father.
Think about it while I say hello to your relatives.
Leave them alone!
- Time for a dance.
- Let go of me!
- I thought you liked me.
- That will do!
We're just having a dance.
- Let go of my daughter!
- She's tasty.
Show him how we dance!
I don't remember them being like that.
Dad, are you all right?
- What's going on?
- We're showing then how to dance.
- They're molesting us.
- Sorry, it was an accident.
Was that your thanks because we helped you?
- Helped them?
- They dropped their fridge.
- A fridge?
In the woods?
- It's nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Nothing at all.
- Rikard, your company is not wanted.
- It's a lousy party anyway.
If I catch you I'll lock you up.
Sure, you old plod.
- Come on, lads.
- Lousy party.
Who is that youth?
He couldn't make a life in Denmark.
- What did the policeman say?
- He wants to jail Rikard.
He thinks Rikard is the one dumping the fridges.
Sorry!
It was an accident!
Stand still so Mie can take that photo!
- Can we go in now?
- OK, then.
Last man in is a sissy!
10. 20. 30. 40, 50 ...
- There's something in the water.
- What is it?
- Yuck!
- It stings!
It's coming from over there.
It's Rikard and his friends.
Now they're destroying this lake too.
They're paid to take the fridges for recycling but theyjust dump them.
That policeman should see this.
... Per?
Where are you going?
To get the camera.
Mie, you'd better do it.
Mie, what are you doing?
I'll have to get closer to see their faces.
They are taking photos of us!
- Let's get out of here.
- We've got proof now.
Yes, come on.
Wait for me!
We must get hold of that camera.
- What will the police do?
- Lock them all up.
- What's that noise?
- It must be them.
- They want the camera.
- That's just criminal!
- Can you see them?
- We'll catch them, don't worry.
- Look out!
- Into the woods!
- There they are!
- Run them down!
Wait for me!
- Uncle Anders has fallen over.
- We must help him.
- Any harm done?
- I can't tell.
- We're trapped!
- The bridge!
- Annika said no!
- We've no choice.
Hurry!
Wait!
Run, dad!
Come on!
Wait.
I have a better idea.
- Well done, Mie.
- Get the cable shears.
Well done, Sis.
Hurry, dad!
- Hurry, Uncle Anders!
- I am doing my best.
Have a nice walk!
- What about the camera?
- They'll never get back from there.
- How will we get back?
- There must be another bridge.
But where?
We have no map.
Yes, we have.
You said maps were for the old and feeble.
Oh, you've been peeking!
That way.
We've been walking for over two hours.
- Let me see ...
- Good you brought the map.
- There should be a bridge now.
- You've said that three times.
I am starving.
We have to go easy on the rations.
What's that?
There used to be a bridge.
And it's broken too.
I don't believe it.
What does that sign say?
It says there are wild bears here.
- I hope we don't meet them.
- Let's get out of here.
Good thinking.
We must camp for the night in the woods.
- Now?
- We haven't got any tents.
- We'll sleep under the stars.
- The sign says bears.
Let's call for help ...
Yes, let's.
Help!
Help ...!
This is a good spot.
With the rocks for shelter.
It looks like a snoozing bear.
Don't you think?
- There are bones.
- Human?
No, just a deer.
- You really want to sleep here?
- It's the safest place.
- Shall we?
- OK.
- No, we must find another spot.
- Dad, we agreed.
It's much too dangerous.
- Scaredy pants!
What's up now?
- We must find another spot.
It'll be too dark soon.
We'll build a fire.
For warmth and comfort.
- And to keep the animals at bay.
- The matches are damp.
Such modern fripperies!
No, watch this, my dears.
- You're so clever!
- Like they did in ancient times.
- When you were young?
- No, thousands of years ago.
But it still works.
Fan the flames!
- It will burn all night.
- Are there any sandwiches left?
- Yes ...
- Dad, want one?
I have lost my appetite.
- Anyone else?
- Yes, please.
Eat up.
If it's not enough, we can boil up the bones for soup.
I'm going to keep mine till tomorrow.
And the soup would be horrible.
- We'll never forget this.
- How right you are!
Tomorrow we'll give the photos to the police.
But we must keep the camera dry.
This is waterproof.
Good thinking, Per!
Tell us about the time you got lost.
When Annika and I were kids we used to play hide and seek.
One day I hid on Bear Rock.
Annika couldn't find me.
She gave up and went home.
- What then?
- Suddenly it got dark.
I didn't dare to go home on my own.
I was only ten.
I had to stay out here all alone.
All night.
- That wasn't too bad.
- It was.
The bear came.
- While you were here?
- Yes.
It didn't attack me.
But it lay down over there.
- What did you do?
- I hoped that it would go away.
It didn't go till first light.
I hadn't slept a wink.
- How did you get home?
- Gubben found me.
How about a lullaby?
Not now, uncle.
Very well.
We'll keep it for the morning.
What if the bear comes?
Wild animals are afraid of fire.
You can sleep soundly.
I'll take first watch.
Go home!
Go away!
You've been fed!
Dad, what are you doing with the backpack?
Have you eaten all the sandwiches?
No.
The bear took them.
- The bear?
- Was it here?
Yes!
A big bear came while you were asleep.
- Here?
- It was sniffing at your arm!
- I scared it away.
- How?
I picked a stick up and went ...
And it walked off.
Stop trying to pull our legs!
It's true!
There was a real, live bear!
- You were dreaming.
- We know this is hard for you.
We can share myjuice.
I don't think that will be necessary.
- They are good.
- Delicious.
May we borrow your ear rings, Sis?
To fish with?
- They'll make perfect hooks.
- You must be crazy!
They were from Peter!
Would you rather starve?
That looks like a boat.
I've got a bite!
Nice!
The ear ring works perfectly.
- Sis?
I'd forgotten these.
- No, thanks.
- A cup of coffee?
- That sounds delightful.
This is the best cup of coffee I have ever had.
Why are you so cheerful?
We're lost!
I am so happy I was able to see that bear off.
Let's stay here forever!
- Count me in!
- We've got work and school.
- Go on, dad!
- We can't get back anyway.
Ifwe had a boat we could sail across.
You are a genius, Per.
Why didn't you think of it before?
- We'll build a raft.
- We can't.
We'll tie those logs together.
I have printed a photo of them.
Here ... thanks for your help, lngema.
It's been on the radio but be prepared for the worst.
Yes.
The raft is ready.
Ole, stop it from being snatched away.
This is the last bag.
And the camera.
Tickets, please!
All aboard!
Look!
- What?
- The bear is right there.
- See?
- You were right!
A real, live bear!
Dad?
No!
- You'll have to scare it away!
- No time for that.
Dad!
- It's coming to eat us!
- Come on, dad!
What now?
That.
Dad!
He'll never do it.
There.
The camera!
Lie down!
A waterfall!
- Hold on tight!
- You bet!
Don't be frightened, dad.
No!
Jump!
I hope the camera didn't get wet.
- It's all right.
- We must go for help.
- I can't. I am too exhausted.
- Hop onto my back.
Come on.
Climb onto my back.
Are you holding tight?
A path at last.
Now we just need to know which way to go.
- Why are there no signs?
- Look!
Oh, right.
So it's that way.
I hope the others are all right.
We must fetch help.
Oh, no!
That's all we need!
- Isn't that the compass?
- Yes.
- Do you know how to use it?
- Yes.
It says it's that way.
South.
You've turned into a really good scout.
Well done, Per!
- The camp!
- At last!
- What's happened?
- I bet it was Rikard.
Bodil!
- Hello?
- Who's that?
- Who are you?
- Can I speak to Annika?
She's busy ...
Can I take a message?
Tell her we need help.
- And we have photos ofthe gang.
- Where are you?
- At the campsite.
- Stay there.
- We'll get help.
- OK, thank you.
It's Rikard.
He wants your camera.
Annika!
What have you done to her?
- Idiot!
- But she bit me.
Annika!
Hello?
There you are!
How did you get here?
- Gubben has a secret path.
- He is amazing.
- Thanks for your help.
- I've felt bad ever since you came.
- Why?
- I thought you'd be like Rikard.
- So I tried to scare you away.
- So Per was right.
- It was a bear in disguise!
- Now I understand your behaviour.
But now I know we're on the same side.
Rikard and his gang are coming to steal the camera.
- Have you got the camera?
- Yes.
Look!
If Rikard is to be stopped, we'll have to do it.
Right?
I remember you as a sissy.
You seem to have grown out of it.
- We can't fight them!
- Gubben, will you help us?
Of course.
Our family sticks together.
- I'm not going to tell you.
- Shut up.
- I am not scared of you.
- Yes, you are.
You're the one who is scared.
You have gone too far now.
Carl-Åke, we'll hide her in the cupboard.
You know who's strongest.
What the devil is this?
Oh, dear, the telephone cable just broke.
Come on, lads.
If you behave I'll buy you all a drink tonight.
Oh, one of those, eh, dad?
They're coming.
Are you ready?
They've got away.
No.
I don't think so.
I think they're hiding.
I know you are there.
Hand over the camera and we'll let you go.
Hurry up!
The camera!
So we can all get off home!
Ouch!
Where did that come from?
- Come and get it if you dare!
- Find them!
I want those Danish devils now!
Get them!
What the hell was that?
It sounded exactly like Peter.
Damn it, it IS Peter!
The boulders!
What the hell is going on?
Come on!
Marcella!
Marcella!
Come to Annika!
Marcella!
There you are!
Come here!
Good girl!
They've taken the camera!
Stop them!
You must help to release Annika.
That's right.
I'll be free in a jiffy.
- Now they can't prove anything.
- We're out of here.
We're stuck.
Push!
- They're escaping.
- They're stuck in Uncle Anders' loo.
Shit!
Damn it, it is shit!
We've got to get the camera.
Wait!
Wait for me!
Rikard, wait for me!
- Move!
- That damned family!
They must not get hold of this camera.
Goodbye, little camera!
Smile!
The evidence.
- You've done my job for me.
- You beat them all!
It was nothing special.
- Hadn't we better help them?
- Let them stew.
They deserve it.
Help us!
We'll help you if you promise never to fly tip again.
- A taste of their own medicine.
- Grab the rope.
Thanks for letting me borrow it.
Keep it, Per.
We'll need you to find the way home for us.
- Won't we?
- Yes, we needed all your kit.
- Why?
- For you.
- It's too much.
- I am so happy you stayed to fight.
If you'd come before, we'd never have had this trouble.
Have you seen our new staff?
Rikard would rather do community service here than go to prison.
- What did he say?
- This is better than prison.
They messed up the woods and now they are cleaning up.
What's next?
Cleaning the stream or going to the dump?
That's up to you.
The stream.
- Drive carefully.
- We will.
We must be going.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for having us, though it didn't turn out as we expected!
It was much more fun.
Any more criminals, just let us know.
- It's just criminal!
- My words exactly.
Look, dad, the bear!
Are you still afraid of it?
Not after this weekend.
Let's go.
In you get.
Goodbye!
Have a safe trip back to Denmark!
Drive carefully!
Look!
Our new fridge has come!
He hasn't spotted us yet.
- How will he react?
- What if we startle him?
- That's the whole idea, Sis.
- Nobody will get hurt.
Go for it, dad.
Dad!
Wasn't that funny, dad?
Yes.
Really funny.

Don't show your face around here again
Or I might kill you
Korea's hero, Ki-jung Sohn won an Olympic gold medal!
Rejoice!
MAY, 1938, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Why do you have sandbags strapped on?
Are you a marathon runner?
Korea's luck in the marathon stops with Ki-jung Sohn
A Korean man will never be an Olympic victor again
Koreans are banned from Olympics 'cause Sohn covered the Japanese flag?
If you were a bomb, I'd run straight into the Athletics Association
Marathon running is a science demanding concentration and fighting spirit
I'll prove it once and for all at the Olympic tryouts
Can you go any faster?
You might regret it
I'll pay double if you get there in 30 minutes
Triple for 20 minutes
Hold on tight
Your victory in the tryouts is a given
What is your goal in the Olympics?
I'll win the gold and set a new record
What a laugh in honor of our great empire!
Look out!
Look out!
Let's go!
Coming through!
To a marathon gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics!
Cheers!
Cheers!
You're quite the runner
Here you are
Double would've been fine
Opportunities come to those who don't give up
Jun-shik Kim
Jun-shik!
Are you okay?
Isn't that...
Are you all so happy over half of a race?
I'm Ki-jung Sohn
Ki-jung Soho's in Japan
Wanna bet?
If I win, I get to marry your sister
Hurry
You say Japan and Korea are one yet you ban Koreans from tryouts?
Are you claiming the Athletics Association is unjust?
Your comment, Mr. Chairman?
The board has decided
If a Japanese runner will win anyways, what's the problem?
It'll be boring for Hasegawa without Jun-shik Kim
I think Jun-shik Kim shouldn't be in the discussion see!
Jun-shik Kim?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim, what have you been up to?
What are your thoughts on the ban on Korean runners?
Are you still training?
How much do you train each day?
Your comments, please
Mr. Hasegawa?
Are you confident you'll win even if Jun-shik Kim enters?
You think he stands a chance against me?
But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better than yours?
That was in the past
You think a mere rickshaw driver can beat a well-trained marathoner?
If you could enter, are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?
How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?
I'd be grateful just to enter the race
Here is your acceptance letter from Berlin Medical University
Sign it
The marathon is more important to me than my studies
This is the most important period in your life
Focus on your studies
Our men are sacrificing their lives to build a Greater East Asia
I don't want to be a coward who runs away from war
War is futile
You are insulting Grandfather
Tatsuo, watch what you say
Think of the people before your country
That's the way of a doctor
Then I must treat the Korean people who killed my grandfather?
Even if it kills me, I'll never do that
The picture is missing from the frame in my room
Jong-dae!
Why you
Why would someone steal a picture of all things?
It should be around somewhere
Anyway, I hope you can enter the tryouts
Father will be so happy
Don't get your hopes up Can't trust the Japs
Get more firewood The fire's dying
Please?
It's so pretty
How do I look?
Eun-soo
I think you're the prettiest girl in all of Asia
OLYMPIC TRYOUTS ENTRY FORM
Please win and bring hope to Korea again
I can really enter the race?
Show them how scary a mere rickshaw driver can be!
Jun-shik
Listen carefully
The man in front of Jun-shik is Ki-jung Sohn
Then, you must be holding the Olympic tryouts entry form
If I'm right, hold it up high!
Yes!
Let me see!
Yes!
Sir!
Sir!
Jun-shik!
Min-woo!
Everyone!
Korea's best marathoner, Jun-shik Kim, will run the marathon again!
Hurray for Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik Kim!
Get the rice cake kings ate!
Rice cakes here!
Here you are
Father picked it out himself The best pair there is
Promise you'll win the race today?
Tatsuo
Your father will be here soon!
Look
Let's relieve all our Korean folks' heartaches today!
Jun-shik Kim!
Runners to the starting line
Jun-shik Kim!
You can do it!
And they're off!
Tatsuo!
Go, Jun-shik
Tatsuo, go get 'em!
Hasegawa!
Faster!
Faster!
Jun-shik, you're half way there!
Don't mind Jun-shik Kim
Hasegawa!
Spurt ahead!
Spurt ahead!
Hasegawa!
The runners will come into the stadium any minute!
Why are you so late?
A surgery took long
What a tense moment!
There!
The runners can be finally seen!
Who is the first runner coming in?
Who will it be?
As expected, it's Hasegawa with Kimura behind him!
What?
There's another runner!
It's Jun-shik Kim!
You can do it
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim!
Go, Jun-shik!
Kimura!
Kimura!
Hey!
What's that bastard doing!
Be careful Jun-shik!
That bastard
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
The rickshaw won!
Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
The last runner is coming in!
It's a dream come true!
The medals will be awarded soon
I knew you could do it!
Ladies and gentlemen, the results will now be announced
The winner of All Japan Olympic Marathon Tryouts is
Hasegawa Tatsuo!
Second is number 13, Ando!
Third is number 18, Kimura!
Will the three runners come up to the victory stand?
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura Please come to the victory stand
Jun-shik Kim was first!
Jun-shik Kim!
Spectators, please calm down and be seated
Jun-shik Kim has been disqualified for blocking Kimura's way
Disqualified?
How!
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
Is this why you let me enter?
Go back.
Didn't you hear you've been disqualified?
You should've run fair and square
Fair and square?
Crazy bastards
Try Saying it again!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Damn bastards!
Jong-dae!
Hasegawa!
Please come up to the victory stand, immediately!

JULY, 1939, NOMONHAN, MONGOLIAN BORDERLAND
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
Jun-shik!
You okay?
That Way!
Concentrate!
Get up there!
Retreat!
Min-woo!
You okay?
It's me, Jun-shik
Wake up!
Shit.
I should've fought for independence instead
Who would've guessed we'd end up fighting for the Japs here?
Our damn fortunes
I'm starving to death
You're hungry 24 hours a day
Grow up will you?
Hey!
Hurry up!
Lazy Korean fools!
Yes, sir
Let's hurry
Hope you get shot down dead
He's really dead?
Choon-bok!
Your butt!
What?
Where's it coming from?
I almost got my head blown off
The broken wall at 1 o'clock
I heard the 1st regiment got attacked, too.
It's him
Just our damn luck
Jong-dae!
Cover me
No!
Stay back, Jun-shik!
Cover him!
Choon-bok!
Cover him!
Don't move!
Are you okay Jun-shik?
It's great you shot down just Japs, but Neda's gonna kill us
She killed so many
Hey!
Don't hog all the food!
Give me some
Don't slobber over it!
Give me some!
This is you?
You keep eating I'll look at this
Fine, I'll show you Let me see first
Not that sexy
She's crying
Cuz you took her picture
No, it's cuz you ate all her beef jerky
Fools.
Why'd you make her cry?
The bullets happened to swerve and hit only Japanese soldiers?
Did the bitch smell your Kimchi breath?
Talk, you fools!
Speak, you bastards!
Who sent you here!
Say it!
I'm Shirai from Hailaer
You raped my mother before my father, and raped me, too
Listen!
There are many like me in China
China will never lose to you!
I will never forgive!
Never!
What?
What are you saying?
Tell me!
Why did the bullets fly past you Korean rubbish!
Speak, you bastards!
Damn it!
Stop it!
I said no speaking Korean!
Enough
Stop
That won't bring back the dead!
Go back to your work places
What's all this?
Who's coming?
Colonel
I'm Colonel Takakura
Company, halt!
Attention!
What?
Why's that bastard here?
Colonel Hasegawa, what brings you here?
Private Takakura ever drive past honorable Imperial soldiers' corpses?
Mukai!
Yes, sir
First!
For shamefully ordering a retreat, you're demoted to private as of today
Second
Private Takakura will prove loyalty to our Emperor and commit hara-kiri!
Be thankful our Emperor granted you an honorable death!
Long live our Emperor!
Handle the deceased with due respect
Yes, sir
Remember, after feeding off corpses, crows can come and gouge out your eyes
I'm Hasegawa Tatsuo
I came here to demolish Soviet tanks!
I'll show them true power of the Imperial army!
When out of bullets, Imperial soldiers must charge with bayonets!
If bayonets are broken, we must fight with bare hands!
Imperial soldiers do not leave the battlefield till death!
Understood!
Yes, sir
We either win or die
First!
We'll build a pontoon bridge over Khalkhin River within 48 hours
Second!
We'll form a special suicide unit of 50 men to demolish tanks
All officers will stand with me at the vanguard of the special unit!
Mukai!
Yes, sir!
Write up the list and have it on my desk by tomorrow
Dismissed!
Dismissed!
I'm sorry about your picture I glued it together
Take it
I have a sister like you back home
My name is Jun-shik Kim
Thank you
'Shei-shei ni'?
The sun's going down!
Hurry up, you bastards!
Stop dawdling!
Hurry up!
Work harder!
When the sun goes down, it's over!
Squad 9!
Damn slow Korean dogs!
Build this in 2 days?
He's insane!
They worked us from dawn!
Where's the food!
Stop talking about food!
You're making me hungry
Choon-bok?
What's 'Shei-shei ni'?
Learning Chinese?
Why do you keep asking?
Just tell me
It means thank you
Stop working!
Attention!
At ease
I heard Tatsuo was your marathon rival
He didn't stand a chance
Jun-shik's way better!
Come out!
Keep that in your mouth and come out!
Choon-bok Hwang!
Come out faster than a bullet, or you'll drink all the water here!
Repeat after me
I'm a barbarian
I'm a barbarian
I'm a Korean
I'm a Korean I'm a Korean
Repeat that, keep the fish in, and do squats till sundown!
Begin!
Catching fish on duty or running during bedtime!
You think this is a playground?
Make sure everything gets incinerated
Yes, sir!
No!
How dare you!
Not my running shoes!
Oh, is that so?
If you wanna run, do it barefoot
Where are you going, fool!
Damn bastards!
How many more beatings you need!
Korean dog!
No!
Gwang-choon?
This side's sinking
What?
There's a screw lose
Who unscrewed this?
It was there before
Squad 9!
Step forward
If we went on like this tomorrow, what would've happened?
From now on, the engineering unit will fix up Squad 9's area
Squad 9 will hold the faulty plank on their heads
And return to the base before sundown
The best marathoner will be leading you
The plank must be leveled!
Keep it leveled!
Noda, the bastard!
Save your breath
Just walk, Jun-shik We'll hold up the plank
Don't worry
If you hurt your knee, it's over!
Listen!
Keep it leveled!
One!
Two!
How is it?
Cool enough for you Squad 9 sluggards!
Jong-dae Lee!
Yes, sir
Jun-shik Kim!
Yes, sir
Why're they calling us this time?
Attention!
The 50 soldiers called will fight in tomorrow's attack
On a special suicide mission with me
What did he say?
Suicide?
Us?
We will carry bombs and demolish enemy tanks at dawn
Fight like Imperial soldiers and die with honor
I'll kill anyone Who dares retreat
Koreans should be honored to be included in this heroic mission
I'm not taking part in this operation
Oh, really?
For what reason?
The Korean soldiers and I didn't volunteer we cannot consent to a mission that demands death
Your permission to shoot, sir!
Dare disobey me?
All Koreans here, including our squad, think the same
I'll ask again Are you disobeying me?
This is insane
Execute him with the other POWs!
Before we march out tomorrow
Have fun on your last night
Stupid bastards!
Are you okay?
I'll be executed at dawn
Like this
The Japanese are evil
Korea and China are foolish
I'm not afraid to die
I'm just mad I couldn't kill more Japanese fools
If I could, I'd get more revenge
I'd kill them all!
Jun-shik?
What are you doing?
If we're gonna die like dogs, might as well save Jun-shik!
Hurry UP
Hurry!
Shirai
Why her?
Pull her out!
Why?
At a time like this
It's coming!
Run!
Run!
Get down!
Jun-shik!
Let's head to the bridge and go south on Khalkin River to cross the border
Where's Min-woo?
We're the only ones going?
He's out on a job with Noda
We can't take all 100 Koreans with us
Let's hurry We don't have time
Come on
Jun-shik!
Get on
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
What's that?
It's an attack!
We could've gotten killed, too
Damn Japs!
Good for them!

Come on, Jun-shik!
Hurry UP!
What's going on?
Soviet tanks are coming!
Grab the oar!
Tanks?
Get on!
Jun-shik!
The tanks are coming!
Get on!
Go ahead without me
What did you say?
What the hell are you doing!
Crazy?
Get on, Jun-shik!
Come on!
Let's all survive and meet again!
Come with us!
Jun-shik!
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Just get on!
If you go back, you're dead, too!
Come back!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik!

It's an attack!
Don't come!
It's an attack, sir!
Get ready for battle!
Block off the front with trucks!
Move the trucks up front!
The rest to the first line of defense!
To the first line of defense!
Defend the first line of defense!
To the first line of defense!
Charge!
Scatter!

Min-woo!

Min-woo
Min-woo
Fools!
Imperial soldier don't retreat!
How dare you run away!
Charge!
Don't show your back to the enemy!
Charge!
Charge!
Don't back down!
Don't run!
Fight!
Charge!
Tatsuo!
Want to get everyone killed?
If you want to die, do it alone!
We're not dying like dogs!
Order the retreat!
Imperial soldiers must charge ahead even as ghosts!
Enough with the Imperial soldiers!
Order the retreat!
Colonel!
Here's your chance to die honorably as an Imperial soldier!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Where are we going?
Can we make it back home?
Move it!
You bastards!
CHITA
OMSK
PERM
FEBRUARY, 1940, KUNGURSK, SOVIET UNION PRISONER OF WAR CAMP
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
As proof you'll carry out the oath
The leader of you Japanese dogs,
Hasegawa Tatsuo, must step on your national flag
We're not labors or criminals, but proud Imperial soldiers!
You have no right to force us to reform!
Imperial Japan will not abandon you!
Keep your dignity till the day you return and fight with honor!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Hurry up!
Move it!
Colonel!
Don't fall asleep, sir!
Shut up, fool!
Keep moving!
Hurry up!
You yellow bastards!
You slow sluggards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Hurry!
Line up, you bastards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Choon-bok!
Gwang-choon!
Jun-shik!
I thought you were dead!
What a relief you're all alive
Where's Jong-dae?
Jong-dae's here, but
Attention!
This is Anton, your supervisor
I'm Anton
If Area 3 doesn't shape up, it'll be hard to stay alive here
Officers or soldiers,
I won't tolerate anyone slacking on the job!
Each group leader, take 20 new POWs and go to your work areas!
Go!
Jong-dae!
Jun-shik!
You're alive!
I was so worried I'd never see you again
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
When did you get here?
About two months ago
I rule here
Nothing for you to worry about now
Korean dog!
Jong-dae Lee!
I didn't like the way you were talking
I'm sorry...
Thought I'd say that?
You damn Jap!
Dare call me a Korean dog?
Give me that
Still think I'm a damn soldier under you?
You stupid son of a bitch!
This isn't Kyung-sung or Nomonhan!
This is the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
I'm the colonel here!
And I'm the king!
Got that?
You got that, fool?
You got that, fool?
Got that, you damn Japs!
Colonel
Wake up, sir!
Noda
If you wanna stay alive, stay out of my sight
Hey!
So damn cold
If we don't warm him up, He'll die
Please move
Who cares?
That bastard's not even worth stomping on
I beg you Make room for him, please
Try saving him, then
It probably won't work
What are you doing!
We have to save the Colonel!
Mukai!
If he's a goner, bring him to the incinerator
No use watching him die Let's go
Jun-shik, have a drink
Look at that
If you get frostbitten here, you end up being firewood like him
This is the warmest place in the whole camp
Your legs are your life Take good care of 'em
I like it here No Japs calling me a Korean dog
We should go back when the war's over
I'm not
There's nothing but pulling a rickshaw there
Having a drink reminds me of home
Eun-soo's probably fine, right?
I miss her
All stand!
Starting the day without bowing towards our Emperor is contemptible
There is no exception here!
Get up!
No need.
Keep eating
It's an order!
Crazy bastard
Everyone stand!
Now!
Private Jun-shik Kim!
Get up!
Private Kim!
We're no longer your subordinates
We were unjustly dragged and forced to become Imperial soldiers
As the Soviets can't demand reform, you have no right to force us to bow
Remember
From now on, I'm not Private Jun-shik Kim but the Korean marathoner Jun-shik Kim!
Crazy fool!
You want to die!
You're the crazy one who killed hundreds of soldiers!
Commit hara-kiri like Colonel Takakura!
Bastard!
Since you have the energy to fight, guess you're not hungry enough
Grudges between a Korean and a Japanese, huh?
You got your wish
Fight till one of you dies!
Kill him, Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
One of us should've died
Today's the day
Colonel!
Kill me, Korean dog!
Kill him!
LOGGING AREA 3
Hold it up right!
Hurry up and do it!
Stop slacking off!
When did this happen?
It's okay, Jun-shik
Don't
It's okay
Hold still
Germany invaded the Soviet Union
The Soviets may speed up exchanging POWs to reinforce their army
Number 1277!
He's one of your men
Anton!
Go catch him!
Yes, sir!
It's time for frosebite examination
Where's Choon-bok?
Take him away
Let me go!
Gwang-choon!
No!
No!
Drag him out!
I'm fine!
I can still work, sir!
Tell 'em Jun-shik!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Help!
Gwang-choon!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Jun-shik!
Help!
Let go!
Gwang-choon!
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You're not hiding in here, are you?
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You son of a bitch!
Shut up!
Come out, pal!
Come out!
You wanna die?
I was starving
Put the bread down and come out now
What do we do?
Who's there?
How dare you steal, you bastard!
He's the one
He's the thief!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
Please Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
A rat sneaked into our food storage today
Luckily we caught him, thanks to comrade Anton
As you know, stealing is punishable by death
Jong-dae!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
I'm scared!
Tell 'em I didn't eat the bread!
Jong-dae!
Execute him!
Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Make it back home alive!
Is it because of this?
This is more important than a friend's life?
This is who you really are?
Call yourself human?
Yeah, I'm not human
I'm not the Jong-dae you know!
I'm Anton!
I'm Anton, you bastard!
Call me Anton from now on!
Got that!
How long do you think this armband will protect you?
How could you do that to Choon-bok?
What do you know?
You don't know anything!
Shut up and stay out of my life
Do you know that Gwang-choon died?
He's probably nothing but ashes by now
If you pull that again in front of them, I'll kill you
Your emperor abandoned you
How dare you speak of our Emperor!
POW repatriation has been denied
We showed mercy on you, but the Japanese refused
They're battling Americans in the Pacific and have no interest in you
You expect me to believe that?
Imperial soldiers are sons of the Emperor
A father does not abandon his son
That's what you want to believe
You na?
ve, poor, abandoned son
You will also face death in the incinerator here
It's a Kokeshi
Is your hometown Yamagata?
You're good
You know, sir?
Have you been there?
My grandfather took me there when I was young
It's a beautiful place
I grew up there my whole life
My family ran a carpentry shop for generations
When I go back, I want to be a great carpenter like my father
Do you know why I chose to be your adjutant for Nomonhan, sir?
Because I saw your firm conviction for our country in your eyes
Conviction
Son of a bitch!
Tsukamoto!
You okay?
Wake up!
I go easy on you, you cripple, and for what!
Jong-dae!
We're doing our best, too!
Your best?
I'll show you my best in beating!
You son of a bitch!
You call that your best!
You bastards!
This is the best!
Jong-dae!
It's Anton, fool!
He's dead
Lieutenant!
What?
Never seen a man die before?
Get back to work, you bastards!
Work, you fools!
Get back to work now!
You fools never listen!
Damn Jap!
How dare you!
Stop it!
I told you to stay out of my way!
Dam Jap!
I gotta beat it into your head?
You bastards!
Damn Jap!
You son of bitch!
Jong-dae Lee!
Bastards!
Back to your posts!
There is no mercy for those who started the riot!
Begin the executions!
It's an urgent telegram, sir
Grab a uniform!
Change into now!
Germany has declared war against us
Comrade Stalin has given you too, your final calling
The choice is yours
Those who want to convert may wear Soviet army uniforms
Go get the uniforms!
Hurry!
Yes, sir
Hurry up and put it on!
Anton
This is a great opportunity for you
I hope you come back victorious
Long live the Soviet Union!
Good luck!
Comrade!
Please give them a chance, too
Let them go!
Thank you, sir!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurry up and put it on!
Hasegawa Tatsuo
This is your last chance
I'll say it one more time Put it on
Let's give it a good shot
It's better than freezing to death
Right, Jun-shik?
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Bastards
The Soviet army uniform suits our colonel so well, doesn't it?
DECEMBER, 1941 ZHEDOVSK, SOVIET UNION
Get off!
Get off, now!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Get off!
Move it!
This will be a grave for the Germans' today!
Thank you, sir!
Show the cowardly Germans the valor of the Soviet army!
It's mine!
Charge!
Attack!
Charge!
Charge!
Attack!
Charge!
Fire!

Let go, you bastard!
What?
You wanna live, too?
I do, too!
I'm not dying here!
You die!
You die!
Tatsuo!
Move it!
Move it!
Charge!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Damn bastards!
No bullets!
Jong-dae!
Let's run!
This is dying like dogs!
It may be for you, but not me!
Charge!
You don't have any more bullets!
Charge!
Charge!
There is no retreat!
Jong-dae!
Come back!
Don't run away!
Come back!
There is no retreat!
Charge!

Attack!
There is no retreat!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
What's with my goddamned life
Shit, I wanted to live it up
I'm so sorry, Jun-shik
Jong-dae
I want to see Eun-soo
I miss Eun-soo
Jun-shik
No, Jun-shik
Stay right here
Don't go out there
Charge!
There is no retreat!
I'll kill anyone who tries to run!
Charge ahead!
Attack!
Fools!
Attack!
Don't show your back to the enemy!
Charge!
Attack!
You'll need it to make it over the mountains
Where do you plan to go?
To German territory
I hope we're going the right way
I hope the snow stops
Even if we make it to German territory it won't be easy to make it back home
You don't have to come, if you don't want to
Back then
Why didn't you kill me?
Tatsuo!
Wake up!
I'll go find some medicine
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
I'll be right back
Help!
Help me!
I'm a Japanese soldier My friend's in danger
What's he saying?
I'm a Japanese soldier We're on the same side!
Take him away!
I'm a Japanese soldier, not a POW!
Let go!
You bastard!
Help me!
A man is dying!
Please!
Take him away, now!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Search every corner
You go up that way I'll go this way
3 YEARS LATER
There's word that the Allied Forces will invade Nord-Pas-de-Calais
Then we hit the jackpot getting stationed in Normandy
If Germany loses, aren't we all dead anyways?
Think they'll take us back?
We'd be lucky if they don't call us traitors and shoot us
That's why we should run away
You said you'll run for 2 years now
I'm going for sure this time
I heard from a man in another unit
There's a secret merchant ship to Jamaica at Cherbourg Harbor
How'll you get there?
Swim?
If you get caught trying to run, you'll be shot!
Wanna make a bet?
I bet 50 marks you can't run away
Bet 100 marks, stupid
Bet even your boots, you pig
May, 1944, NORMANDY, FRANCE will build additional defense walls and defense lines in the Atlantic
From tomorrow, you will build defense walls on the shore with unit 795
Our job is to build the defense encampment on Normandy hill
March forward!
Hurry up!
Squad 3!
Unit 2!
Go to barracks 14!
HEY
Shouldn't you give up looking for your Korean friend?
You're the only Asian here
That guy's so lucky
He gets to go in and out of base at will
Tatsuo!
Aren't you coming in?
Let's go
Go ahead I'll rest here for a sec
See ya later, then
I thought you might be dead
But you're here in the Eastern battalion
When did you come to Normandy?
Jun-shik?
Did you say something?
Can you repeat it?
Tatsuo!
It's more comfortable this way
I can't hear gunshots or screams
It's over
Let's play soccer
Tatsuo!
We're going to play against Squad 8!
Man, they're fast
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I lost cuz my rubber shoes fell off,
But I was happy to have a new running mate
We came much too far
How long will it take to run home from here?
More than a year, right?
We know the Allied forces will attack Nord-Pas-de-Calais
The Eastern battalion will all be sent to Nord-Pas-de-Calais!
You will all be reborn as true German soldiers!
Pack up your gear
We move out at 09:00 hours tomorrow!
Dismissed!
We're all dead I thought we'd be safe in Normandy
What's going on?
We're being transferred
It's nothing
Sending us to battle but feeding us this rubbish
I thought we'd get wine and steak when we came to France
Damn
Karim
I'm going to Cherbourg at dawn
Are you crazy?
I got the contact info from Roman ls Roman going?
That liar
How will you get there?
The food truck always leaves at dawn
We gotta go when you're on watch
Think it over If you get caught, you're dead
Is it cuz of your friend?
Fine
I'll see you at dawn
We're not going to Nord-Pas-de-Calais
We're going to Cherbourg
Cherbourg?
A ship there will take us home
Jun-shik
Let's go home where your sister and father are
Can we really make it home?
We could get killed on the way
Still, we can't die here
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Tatsuo!
Those aren't planes, are they?
Tatsuo!

Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Stay there!
I'll come to you!
Wait for me!
Hurry!
It's an attack!
Prepare for battle!
The Allied Forces have attacked!
To your battle positions!
Hurry and grab the machine gun!
Grab it!
Everyone to your battle positions!
Move it!

Fire!
Fire!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Are you okay?
Let's get out of here, now!
Grab the machine gun!
Now!
Hurry up, you fools!
Can't you see the enemy!
Reload and fire, now!
Allied forces attacked!
Send re-inforcements!
Let's run for it
Don't lag behind
You'll be watching my back as you run
Are you okay?
This won't kill me Let's go!
Jun-shik
Come on!
We have to get home!
Tatsuo
Are you okay?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
You're Jun-shik Kim from now on
If you say you're Japanese, they might kill you
Say you were dragged here and forced into the Eastern battalion
Jun-shik!
Wake up!
I have no regrets
Though I couldn't achieve my dream
You can't go like this!
Let's go home and run together!
Jun-shik
I wanted to run again when I go back home
Promise you'll make it back alive
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I was happy to have a new running mate
Ready, go!
Hope You Enjoyed!
:) ...Pirata-Tuga,TuGAZx...
JULY, 1948, LONDON, ENGLAND
MARCH, 1928, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Isn't the air nice, Tatsuo?
You'll get used to it here soon
I'm sure you'll make good friends here
It's Jun-shik!
I'm faster than a car!
Grandpa!
You show the signs of a great Imperial soldier already
Welcome, my boy
How've you been, Father?
Greet them
He's the new, young master
Jun-shik Kim, sir
I'm Eun-soo Kim, sir
Great, Tatsuo.
You have a new friend your age
Tatsuo runs well.
Like you.
My brother's the best runner in Kyung-sung, sir
I'm the best in Tokyo
No match for a country boy
Wanna race me?
Ready
Go!
HASEGAWA TATSUO WINS NATIONAL MARATHONS AGAIN!
KIM JUN-SHIK WINS!
Congratulations
Good job chasing behind me
Must be your damn lucky day
Let's applaud Hasegawa Tatsuo who won the national high school marathon and brought great honor to Imperial Japan
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
This is my grandson, Tatsuo
You must be very proud
I expect a lot from you
It's a gift from the Japanese Minister of Defense
Open it
Yes, sir
Give me that!
Get away!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Father!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Do something!
Father, please!
Do something!
You're a doctor who saves lives!
Why aren't you doing anything?
You killed him!
No.
You killed him!
No
Bring my grandfather back!
Let go!
He didn't kill anyone!
You bastards killed him!
Jun-shik!
Bring my grandfather back!
No!
No!
I didn't do it!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Jun-shik!
Daddy!
Father!
Bring my grandfather back!
Father!
Jun-shik
Let go!
Father!
Father.
Daddy...
Daddy
Don't show your face around here again
Or I might kill you
Korea's hero, Ki-jung Sohn won an Olympic gold medal!
Rejoice!
MAY, 1938, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Why do you have sandbags strapped on?
Are you a marathon runner?
Korea's luck in the marathon stops with Ki-jung Sohn
A Korean man will never be an Olympic victor again
Koreans are banned from Olympics 'cause Sohn covered the Japanese flag?
If you were a bomb, I'd run straight into the Athletics Association
Marathon running is a science demanding concentration and fighting spirit
I'll prove it once and for all at the Olympic tryouts
Can you go any faster?
You might regret it
I'll pay double if you get there in 30 minutes
Triple for 20 minutes
Hold on tight
Your victory in the tryouts is a given
What is your goal in the Olympics?
I'll win the gold and set a new record
What a laugh in honor of our great empire!
Look out!
Look out!
Let's go!
Coming through!
To a marathon gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics!
Cheers!
Cheers!
You're quite the runner
Here you are
Double would've been fine
Opportunities come to those who don't give up
Jun-shik Kim
Jun-shik!
Are you okay?
Isn't that...
Are you all so happy over half of a race?
I'm Ki-jung Sohn
Ki-jung Soho's in Japan
Wanna bet?
If I win, I get to marry your sister
Hurry
You say Japan and Korea are one yet you ban Koreans from tryouts?
Are you claiming the Athletics Association is unjust?
Your comment, Mr. Chairman?
The board has decided
If a Japanese runner will win anyways, what's the problem?
It'll be boring for Hasegawa without Jun-shik Kim
I think Jun-shik Kim shouldn't be in the discussion
See!
Jun-shik Kim?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim, what have you been up to?
What are your thoughts on the ban on Korean runners?
Are you still training?
How much do you train each day?
Your comments, please
Mr. Hasegawa?
Are you confident you'll win even if Jun-shik Kim enters?
You think he stands a chance against me?
But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better than yours?
That was in the past
You think a mere rickshaw driver can beat a well-trained marathoner?
If you could enter, are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?
How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?
I'd be grateful just to enter the race
Here is your acceptance letter from Berlin Medical University
Sign it
The marathon is more important to me than my studies
This is the most important period in your life
Focus on your studies
Our men are sacrificing their lives to build a Greater East Asia
I don't want to be a coward who runs away from war
War is futile
You are insulting Grandfather
Tatsuo, watch what you say
Think of the people before your country
That's the way of a doctor
Then I must treat the Korean people who killed my grandfather?
Even if it kills me, I'll never do that
The picture is missing from the frame in my room
Jong-dae!
Why you
Why would someone steal a picture of all things?
It should be around somewhere
Anyway, I hope you can enter the tryouts
Father will be so happy
Don't get your hopes up Can't trust the Japs
Get more firewood.
The fire's dying.
Please?
It's so pretty
How do I look?
Eun-soo
I think you're the prettiest girl in all of Asia
OLYMPIC TRYOUTS ENTRY FORM
Please win and bring hope to Korea again
I can really enter the race?
Show them how scary a mere rickshaw driver can be!
Jun-shik
Listen carefully
The man in front of Jun-shik is Ki-jung Sohn
Then, you must be holding the Olympic tryouts entry form
If I'm right, hold it up high!
Yes!
Let me see!
Yes!

The runners will come into the stadium any minute!
Why are you so late?
A surgery took long
What a tense moment!
There!
The runners can be finally seen!
Who is the first runner coming in?
Who will it be?
As expected, it's Hasegawa with Kimura behind him!
What?
There's another runner!
It's Jun-shik Kim!
You can do it
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim!
Go, Jun-shik!

The rickshaw won!

Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura.
Please come to the victory stand
Jun-shik Kim was first!
Jun-shik Kim!
Spectators, please calm down and be seated
Jun-shik Kim has been disqualified for blocking Kimura's way
Disqualified?
How!
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
Is this why you let me enter?
Go back.
Didn't you hear you've been disqualified?
You should've run fair and square
Fair and square?
Crazy bastards
Try saying it again!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Damn bastards!
Jong-dae!
Hasegawa!
Please come up to the victory stand, immediately!

JULY, 1939, NOMONHAN, MONGOLIAN BORDERLAND
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
Jun-shik!
You okay?
That Way!
Concentrate!
Get up there!
Retreat!
Min-woo!
You okay?
It's me, Jun-shik
Wake up!
Shit.
I should've fought for independence instead
Who would've guessed we'd end up fighting for the Japs here?
Our damn fortunes
I'm starving to death
You're hungry 24 hours a day
Grow up will you?
Hey!
Hurry up!
Lazy Korean fools!
Yes, sir
Let's hurry
Hope you get shot down dead
He's really dead?
Choon-bok!
Your butt!
What?
Where's it coming from?
I almost got my head blown off
The broken wall at 1 o'clock
I heard the 1st regiment got attacked, too.
It's him
Just our damn luck
Jong-dae!
Cover me
No!
Stay back, Jun-shik!
Cover him!
Choon-bok!
Cover him!
Don't move!
Are you okay Jun-shik?
It's great you shot down just Japs, but Neda's gonna kill us
She killed so many
Hey!
Don't hog all the food!
Give me some
Don't slobber over it!
Give me some!
This is you?
You keep eating I'll look at this
Fine, I'll show you Let me see first
Not that sexy
She's crying
Cuz you took her picture
No, it's cuz you ate all her beef jerky
Fools.
Why'd you make her cry?
The bullets happened to swerve and hit only Japanese soldiers?
Did the bitch smell your Kimchi breath?
Talk, you fools!
Speak, you bastards!
Who sent you here!
Say it!
I'm Shirai from Hailaer
You raped my mother before my father, and raped me, too
Listen!
There are many like me in China
China will never lose to you!
I will never forgive!
Never!
What?
What are you saying?
Tell me!
Why did the bullets fly past you Korean rubbish!
Speak, you bastards!
Damn it!
Stop it!
I said no speaking Korean!
Enough
Stop
That won't bring back the dead!
Go back to your work places
What's all this?
Who's coming?
Colonel
I'm Colonel Takakura
Company, halt!
Attention!
What?
Why's that bastard here?
Colonel Hasegawa, what brings you here?
Private Takakura
Ever drive past honorable Imperial soldiers' corpses?
Mukai!
Yes, sir
First!
For shamefully ordering a retreat, you're demoted to private as of today
Second
Private Takakura will prove loyalty to our Emperor and commit hara-kiri!
Be thankful our Emperor granted you an honorable death!
Long live our Emperor!
Handle the deceased with due respect
Yes, sir
Remember, after feeding off corpses, crows can come and gouge out your eyes
I'm Hasegawa Tatsuo
I came here to demolish Soviet tanks!
I'll show them true power of the Imperial army!
When out of bullets, Imperial soldiers must charge with bayonets!
If bayonets are broken, we must fight with bare hands!
Imperial soldiers do not leave the battlefield till death!
Understood!
Yes, sir
We either win or die
First!
We'll build a pontoon bridge over Khalkhin River within 48 hours
Second!
We'll form a special suicide unit of 50 men to demolish tanks
All officers will stand with me at the vanguard of the special unit!
Mukai!
Yes, sir!
Write up the list and have it on my desk by tomorrow
Dismissed!
Dismissed!
I'm sorry about your picture I glued it together
Take it
I have a sister like you back home
My name is Jun-shik Kim
Thank you
'Shei-shei ni'?
The sun's going down!
Hurry up, you bastards!
Stop dawdling!
Hurry up!
Work harder!
When the sun goes down, it's over!
Squad 9!
Damn slow Korean dogs!
Build this in 2 days?
He's insane!
They worked us from dawn!
Where's the food!
Stop talking about food!
You're making me hungry
Choon-bok?
What's 'Shei-shei ni'?
Learning Chinese?
Why do you keep asking?
Just tell me
It means thank you
Stop working!
Attention!
At ease
I heard Tatsuo was your marathon rival
He didn't stand a chance
Jun-shik's way better!
Come out!
Keep that in your mouth and come out!
Choon-bok Hwang!
Come out faster than a bullet, or you'll drink all the water here!
Repeat after me
I'm a barbarian
I'm a barbarian
I'm a Korean
I'm a Korean I'm a Korean
Repeat that, keep the fish in, and do squats till sundown!
Begin!
Catching fish on duty or running during bedtime!
You think this is a playground?
Make sure everything gets incinerated
Yes, sir!
No!
How dare you!
Not my running shoes!
Oh, is that so?
If you wanna run, do it barefoot
Where are you going, fool!
Damn bastards!
How many more beatings you need!
Korean dog!
No!
Gwang-choon?
This side's sinking
What?
There's a screw lose
Who unscrewed this?
It was there before
Squad 9!
Step forward
If we went on like this tomorrow, what would've happened?
From now on, the engineering unit will fix up Squad 9's area
Squad 9 will hold the faulty plank on their heads
And return to the base before sundown
The best marathoner will be leading you
The plank must be leveled!
Keep it leveled!
Noda, the bastard!
Save your breath
Just walk, Jun-shik We'll hold up the plank
Don't worry
If you hurt your knee, it's over!
Listen!
Keep it leveled!
One!
Two!
How is it?
Cool enough for you Squad 9 sluggards!
Jong-dae Lee!
Yes, sir
Jun-shik Kim!
Yes, sir
Why are they calling us this time?
Attention!
The 50 soldiers called will fight in tomorrow's attack
On a special suicide mission with me
What did he say?
Suicide?
Us?
We will carry bombs and demolish enemy tanks at dawn
Fight like Imperial soldiers and die with honor
I'll kill anyone Who dares retreat
Koreans should be honored to be included in this heroic mission
I'm not taking part in this operation
Oh, really?
For what reason?
The Korean soldiers and I didn't volunteer we cannot consent to a mission that demands death
Your permission to shoot, sir!
Dare disobey me?
All Koreans here, including our squad, think the same
I'll ask again.
Are you disobeying me?
This is insane
Execute him with the other POWs!
Before we march out tomorrow
Have fun on your last night
Stupid bastards!
Are you okay?
I'll be executed at dawn
Like this
The Japanese are evil
Korea and China are foolish
I'm not afraid to die
I'm just mad I couldn't kill more Japanese fools
If I could, I'd get more revenge
I'd kill them all!
Jun-shik?
What are you doing?
If we're gonna die like dogs, might as well save Jun-shik!
Hurry up
Hurry!
Shirai
Why her?
Pull her out!
Why?
At a time like this
It's coming!
Run!
Run!
Get down!
Jun-shik!
Let's head to the bridge and go south on Khalkin River to cross the border
Where's Min-woo?
We're the only ones going?
He's out on a job with Noda
We can't take all 100 Koreans with us
Let's hurry We don't have time
Come on
Jun-shik!
Get on
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
What's that?
It's an attack!
We could've gotten killed, too
Damn Japs!
Good for them!
Let's go!
Come on, Jun-shik!
Hurry up!
What's going on?
Soviet tanks are coming!
Grab the oar!
Tanks?
Get on!
Jun-shik!
The tanks are coming!
Get on!
Go ahead without me
What did you say?
What the hell are you doing!
Crazy?
Get on, Jun-shik!
Come on!
Let's all survive and meet again!
Come with us!
Jun-shik!
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Just get on!
If you go back, you're dead, too!
Come back!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Shirai!
Watch out!
Watch out!
Shirai is an ace shooter
Shirai!
Shirai!
Shirai!
Shirai!
Shirai!
Hurry.
Go save your friends
Thank you
Stop!
Don't come!
Stop!
Don't come!
It's an attack!
Don't come!
It's an attack, sir!
Get ready for battle!
Block off the front with trucks!
Move the trucks up front!
The rest to the first line of defense!
To the first line of defense!
Defend the first line of defense!
To the first line of defense!
Charge!
Scatter!
Scatter!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live our Emperor!
Listen!
Die bravely like a special suicide unit member!
You son of a bitch!
Min-woo!
It's okay
You go and die bravely!
Min-woo!
Help me
Min-woo
Min-woo
Fools!
Imperial soldier don't retreat!
How dare you run away!
Charge!
Don't show your back to the enemy!
Charge!
Charge!
Don't back down!
Don't run!
Fight!
Charge!
Tatsuo!
Want to get everyone killed?
If you want to die, do it alone!
We're not dying like dogs!
Order the retreat!
Imperial soldiers must charge ahead even as ghosts!
Enough with the Imperial soldiers!
Order the retreat!
Colonel!
Here's your chance to die honorably as an Imperial soldier!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Where are we going?
Can we make it back home?
Move it!
You bastards!
CHITA
OMSK
PERM
FEBRUARY, 1940, KUNGURSK, SOVIET UNION PRISONER OF WAR CAMP
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
As proof you'll carry out the oath
The leader of you Japanese dogs,
Hasegawa Tatsuo, must step on your national flag
We're not labors or criminals, but proud Imperial soldiers!
You have no right to force us to reform!
Imperial Japan will not abandon you!
Keep your dignity till the day you return and fight with honor!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Hurry up!
Move it!
Colonel!
Don't fall asleep, sir!
Shut up, fool!
Keep moving!
Hurry up!
You yellow bastards!
You slow sluggards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Hurry!
Line up, you bastards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Choon-bok!
Gwang-choon!
Jun-shik!
I thought you were dead!
What a relief you're all alive
Where's Jong-dae?
Jong-dae's here, but
Attention!
This is Anton, your supervisor
I'm Anton
If Area 3 doesn't shape up, it'll be hard to stay alive here
Officers or soldiers,
I won't tolerate anyone slacking on the job!
Each group leader, take 20 new POWs and go to your work areas!
Go!
Jong-dae!
Jun-shik!
You're alive!
I was so worried I'd never see you again
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
When did you get here?
About two months ago
I rule here
Nothing for you to worry about now
Korean dog!
Jong-dae Lee!
I didn't like the way you were talking
I'm sorry...
Thought I'd say that?
You damn Jap!
Dare call me a Korean dog?
Give me that
Still think I'm a damn soldier under you?
You stupid son of a bitch!
This isn't Kyung-sung or Nomonhan!
This is the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
I'm the colonel here!
And I'm the king!
Got that?
You got that, fool?
You got that, fool?
Got that, you damn Japs!
Colonel
Wake up, sir!
Noda
If you wanna stay alive, stay out of my sight
Hey!
So damn cold
If we don't warm him up, He'll die
Please move
Who cares?
That bastard's not even worth stomping on
I beg you.
Make room for him, please
Try saving him, then
It probably won't work
What are you doing!
We have to save the Colonel!
Mukai!
If he's a goner, bring him to the incinerator
No use watching him die Let's go
Jun-shik, have a drink
Look at that
If you get frostbitten here, you end up being firewood like him
This is the warmest place in the whole camp
Your legs are your life Take good care of 'em
I like it here No Japs calling me a Korean dog
We should go back when the war's over
I'm not
There's nothing but pulling a rickshaw there
Having a drink reminds me of home
Eun-soo's probably fine, right?
I miss her
All stand!
Starting the day without bowing towards our Emperor is contemptible
There is no exception here!
Get up!
No need.
Keep eating
It's an order!
Crazy bastard
Everyone stand!
Now!
Private Jun-shik Kim!
Get up!
Private Kim!
We're no longer your subordinates
We were unjustly dragged and forced to become Imperial soldiers
As the Soviets can't demand reform, you have no right to force us to bow
Remember
From now on, I'm not Private Jun-shik Kim but the Korean marathoner Jun-shik Kim!
Crazy fool!
You want to die!
You're the crazy one who killed hundreds of soldiers!
Commit hara-kiri like Colonel Takakura!
Bastard!
Since you have the energy to fight, guess you're not hungry enough
Grudges between a Korean and a Japanese, huh?
You got your wish
Fight till one of you dies!
Kill him, Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
One of us should've died
Today's the day
Colonel!
Kill me, Korean dog!
Kill him!
LOGGING AREA 3
Hold it up right!
Hurry up and do it!
Stop slacking off!
When did this happen?
It's okay, Jun-shik
Don't
It's okay
Hold still
Germany invaded the Soviet Union
The Soviets may speed up exchanging POWs to reinforce their army
Number 1277!
He's one of your men
Anton!
Go catch him!
Yes, sir!
It's time for frostbite examination
Where's Choon-bok?
Take him away
Let me go!
Gwang-choon!
No!
No!
Drag him out!
I'm fine!
I can still work, sir!
Tell 'em Jun-shik!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Help!
Gwang-choon!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Jun-shik!
Help!
Let go!
Gwang-choon!
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You're not hiding in here, are you?
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You son of a bitch!
Shut up!
Come out, pal!
Come out!
You wanna die?
I was starving
Put the bread down and come out now
What do we do?
Who's there?
How dare you steal, you bastard!
He's the one
He's the thief!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
Please Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
A rat sneaked into our food storage today
Luckily we caught him, thanks to comrade Anton
As you know, stealing is punishable by death
Jong-dae!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
I'm scared!
Tell 'em I didn't eat the bread!
Jong-dae!
Execute him!
Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Make it back home alive!
Is it because of this?
This is more important than a friend's life?
This is who you really are?
Call yourself human?
Yeah, I'm not human
I'm not the Jong-dae you know!
I'm Anton!
I'm Anton, you bastard!
Call me Anton from now on!
Got that!
How long do you think this armband will protect you?
How could you do that to Choon-bok?
What do you know?
You don't know anything!
Shut up and stay out of my life
Do you know that Gwang-choon died?
He's probably nothing but ashes by now
If you pull that again in front of them, I'll kill you
Your emperor abandoned you
How dare you speak of our Emperor!
POW repatriation has been denied
We showed mercy on you, but the Japanese refused
They're battling Americans in the Pacific and have no interest in you
You expect me to believe that?
Imperial soldiers are sons of the Emperor
A father does not abandon his son
That's what you want to believe
You naive, poor, abandoned son
You will also face death in the incinerator here
It's a Kokeshi
Is your hometown Yamagata?
You're good
You know, sir?
Have you been there?
My grandfather took me there when I was young
It's a beautiful place
I grew up there my whole life
My family ran a carpentry shop for generations
When I go back, I want to be a great carpenter like my father
Do you know why I chose to be your adjutant for Nomonhan, sir?
Because I saw your firm conviction for our country in your eyes
Conviction
Son of a bitch!
Tsukamoto!
You okay?
Wake up!
I go easy on you, you cripple, and for what!
Jong-dae!
We're doing our best, too!
Your best?
I'll show you my best in beating!
You son of a bitch!
You call that your best!
You bastards!
This is the best!
Jong-dae!
It's Anton, fool!
He's dead
Lieutenant!
What?
Never seen a man die before?
Get back to work, you bastards!
Work, you fools!
Get back to work now!
You fools never listen!
Damn Jap!
How dare you!
Stop it!
I told you to stay out of my way!
Dam Jap!
I gotta beat it into your head?
You bastards!
Damn Jap!
You son of bitch!
Jong-dae Lee!
Bastards!
Back to your posts!
There is no mercy for those who started the riot!
Begin the executions!
It's an urgent telegram, sir
Grab a uniform!
Change into now!
Germany has declared war against us
Comrade Stalin has given you too, your final calling
The choice is yours
Those who want to convert may wear Soviet army uniforms
Go get the uniforms!
Hurry!
Yes, sir
Hurry up and put it on!
Anton
This is a great opportunity for you
I hope you come back victorious
Long live the Soviet Union!
Good luck!
Comrade!
Please give them a chance, too
Let them go!
Thank you, sir!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurry up and put it on!
Hasegawa Tatsuo
This is your last chance
I'll say it one more time Put it on
Let's give it a good shot
It's better than freezing to death
Right, Jun-shik?
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Bastards
The Soviet army uniform suits our colonel so well, doesn't it?
DECEMBER, 1941 ZHEDOVSK, SOVIET UNION
Get off!
Get off, now!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Get off!
Move it!
This will be a grave for the Germans' today!
Thank you, sir!
Show the cowardly Germans the valor of the Soviet army!
It's mine!
Charge!
Attack!
Charge!
Charge!
Attack!
Charge!
Fire!
Charge!
Let go, you bastard!
What?
You wanna live, too?
I do, too!
I'm not dying here!
You die!
You die!
Tatsuo!
Move it!
Move it!
Charge!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Damn bastards!
No bullets!
Jong-dae!
Let's run!
This is dying like dogs!
It may be for you, but not me!
Charge!
You don't have any more bullets!
Charge!
Charge!
There is no retreat!
Jong-dae!
Come back!
Don't run away!
Come back!
There is no retreat!
Charge!
Charge!
Attack!
There is no retreat!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
What's with my goddamned life
Shit, I wanted to live it up
I'm so sorry, Jun-shik
Jong-dae
I want to see Eun-soo
I miss Eun-soo
Jun-shik
No, Jun-shik
Stay right here
Don't go out there
Charge!
There is no retreat!
I'll kill anyone who tries to run!
Charge ahead!
Attack!
Fools!
Attack!
Don't show your back to the enemy!
Charge!
Attack!
You'll need it to make it over the mountains
Where do you plan to go?
To German territory
I hope we're going the right way
I hope the snow stops
Even if we make it to German territory it won't be easy to make it back home
You don't have to come, if you don't want to
Back then
Why didn't you kill me?
Tatsuo!
Wake up!
I'll go find some medicine
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
I'll be right back
Help!
Help me!
I'm a Japanese soldier My friend's in danger
What's he saying?
I'm a Japanese soldier We're on the same side!
Take him away!
I'm a Japanese soldier, not a POW!
Let go!
You bastard!
Help me!
A man is dying!
Please!
Take him away, now!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Search every corner
You go up that way I'll go this way
3 YEARS LATER
There's word that the Allied Forces will invade Nord-Pas-de-Calais
Then we hit the jackpot getting stationed in Normandy
If Germany loses, aren't we all dead anyways?
Think they'll take us back?
We'd be lucky if they don't call us traitors and shoot us
That's why we should run away
You said you'll run for 2 years now
I'm going for sure this time
I heard from a man in another unit
There's a secret merchant ship to Jamaica at Cherbourg Harbor
How'll you get there?
Swim?
If you get caught trying to run, you'll be shot!

March forward!
Hurry up!
Squad 3!

HEY
Shouldn't you give up looking for your Korean friend?
You're the only Asian here
That guy's so lucky
He gets to go in and out of base at will
Tatsuo!
Aren't you coming in?
Let's go
Go ahead I'll rest here for a sec
See ya later, then
I thought you might be dead
But you're here in the Eastern battalion
When did you come to Normandy?
Jun-shik?
Did you say something?
Can you repeat it?
Tatsuo!
It's more comfortable this way
I can't hear gunshots or screams
It's over
Let's play soccer
Tatsuo!
We're going to play against Squad 8!
Man, they're fast
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I lost cuz my rubber shoes fell off,
But I was happy to have a new running mate
We came much too far
How long will it take to run home from here?
More than a year, right?
We know the Allied forces will attack Nord-Pas-de-Calais
The Eastern battalion will all be sent to Nord-Pas-de-Calais!
You will all be reborn as true German soldiers!
Pack up your gear
We move out at 09:00 hours tomorrow!
Dismissed!
We're all dead I thought we'd be safe in Normandy
What's going on?
We're being transferred
It's nothing
Sending us to battle but feeding us this rubbish
I thought we'd get wine and steak when we came to France
Damn
Karim
I'm going to Cherbourg at dawn
Are you crazy?
I got the contact info from Roman
Is Roman going?
That liar
How will you get there?
The food truck always leaves at dawn
We gotta go when you're on watch
Think it over If you get caught, you're dead
Is it cuz of your friend?
Fine
I'll see you at dawn
We're not going to Nord-Pas-de-Calais
We're going to Cherbourg
Cherbourg?
A ship there will take us home
Jun-shik
Let's go home where your sister and father are
Can we really make it home?
We could get killed on the way
Still, we can't die here
Karim!
Karim!

Allied forces attacked!

Are you okay?
This won't kill me Let's go!
Jun-shik
Come on!
We have to get home!
Tatsuo
Are you okay?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
You're Jun-shik Kim from now on
If you say you're Japanese, they might kill you
Say you were dragged here and forced into the Eastern battalion
Jun-shik!
Wake up!
I have no regrets
Though I couldn't achieve my dream
You can't go like this!
Let's go home and run together!
Jun-shik
I wanted to run again when I go back home
Promise you'll make it back alive
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I was happy to have a new running mate
Ready, go!
JULY, 1948, LONDON, ENGLAND
MARCH, 1928, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Isn't the air nice, Tatsuo?
You'll get used to it here soon
I'm sure you'll make good friends here
It's Jun-shik!
I'm faster than a car!
Grandpa!
You show the signs of a great Imperial soldier already
Welcome, my boy
How've you been, Father?
Greet them
He's the new, young master
Jun-shik Kim, sir
I'm Eun-soo Kim, sir
Great, Tatsuo You have a new friend your age
Tatsuo runs well.
Like you
My brother's the best runner in Kyung-sung, sir
I'm the best in Tokyo
No match for a country boy
Wanna race me?
Ready
Go!
HASEGAWA TATSUO WINS NATIONAL MARATHONS AGAIN!
KIM JUN-SHIK WINS!
Congratulations
Good job chasing behind me
Must be your damn lucky day
Let's applaud Hasegawa Tatsuo who won the national high school marathon and brought great honor to Imperial Japan
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
This is my grandson, Tatsuo
You must be very proud
I expect a lot from you
It's a gift from the Japanese Minister of Defense
Open it
Yes, sir
Give me that!
Get away!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Father!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Do something!
Father, please!
Do something!
You're a doctor who saves lives!
Why aren't you doing anything?
You killed him!
No
You killed him!
No
Bring my grandfather back!
Let go!
He didn't kill anyone!
You bastards killed him!
Jun-shik!
Bring my grandfather back!
No!
No!
I didn't do it!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Jun-shik!
Daddy!
Father!
Bring my grandfather back!
Father!
Jun-shik
Let go!
Father!
Father Daddy...
Daddy
Don't show your face around here again
Or I might kill you
Korea's hero, Ki-jung Sohn won an Olympic gold medal!
Rejoice!
MAY, 1938, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Why do you have sandbags strapped on?
Are you a marathon runner?
Korea's luck in the marathon stops with Ki-jung Sohn
A Korean man will never be an Olympic victor again
Koreans are banned from Olympics 'cause Sohn covered the Japanese flag?
If you were a bomb, I'd run straight into the Athletics Association
Marathon running is a science demanding concentration and fighting spirit
I'll prove it once and for all at the Olympic tryouts
Can you go any faster?
You might regret it
I'll pay double if you get there in 30 minutes
Triple for 20 minutes
Hold on tight
Your victory in the tryouts is a given
What is your goal in the Olympics?
I'll win the gold and set a new record
What a laugh in honor of our great empire!
Look out!
Look out!
Let's go!
Coming through!
To a marathon gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics!
Cheers!
Cheers!
You're quite the runner
Here you are
Double would've been fine
Opportunities come to those who don't give up
Jun-shik Kim
Jun-shik!
Are you okay?
Isn't that...
Are you all so happy over half of a race?
I'm Ki-jung Sohn
Ki-jung Soho's in Japan
Wanna bet?
If I win, I get to marry your sister
Hurry
You say Japan and Korea are one yet you ban Koreans from tryouts?
Are you claiming the Athletics Association is unjust?
Your comment, Mr. Chairman?
The board has decided
If a Japanese runner will win anyways, what's the problem?
It'll be boring for Hasegawa without Jun-shik Kim
I think Jun-shik Kim shouldn't be in the discussion see!
Jun-shik Kim?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim, what have you been up to?
What are your thoughts on the ban on Korean runners?
Are you still training?
How much do you train each day?
Your comments, please
Mr. Hasegawa?
Are you confident you'll win even if Jun-shik Kim enters?
You think he stands a chance against me?
But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better than yours?
That was in the past
You think a mere rickshaw driver can beat a well-trained marathoner?
If you could enter, are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?
How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?
I'd be grateful just to enter the race
Here is your acceptance letter from Berlin Medical University
Sign it
The marathon is more important to me than my studies
This is the most important period in your life
Focus on your studies
Our men are sacrificing their lives to build a Greater East Asia
I don't want to be a coward who runs away from war
War is futile
You are insulting Grandfather
Tatsuo, watch what you say
Think of the people before your country
That's the way of a doctor
Then I must treat the Korean people who killed my grandfather?
Even if it kills me, I'll never do that
The picture is missing from the frame in my room
Jong-dae!
Why you
Why would someone steal a picture of all things?
It should be around somewhere
Anyway, I hope you can enter the tryouts
Father will be so happy
Don't get your hopes up Can't trust the Japs
Get more firewood The fire's dying
Please?
It's so pretty
How do I look?
Eun-soo
I think you're the prettiest girl in all of Asia
OLYMPIC TRYOUTS ENTRY FORM
Please win and bring hope to Korea again
I can really enter the race?
Show them how scary a mere rickshaw driver can be!
Jun-shik
Listen carefully
The man in front of Jun-shik is Ki-jung Sohn
Then, you must be holding the Olympic tryouts entry form
If I'm right, hold it up high!
Yes!
Let me see!
Yes!
Sir!
Sir!
Jun-shik!
Min-woo!
Everyone!
Korea's best marathoner, Jun-shik Kim, will run the marathon again!
Hurray for Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik Kim!
Get the rice cake kings ate!
Rice cakes here!
Here you are

Don't mind Jun-shik Kim
Hasegawa!
Spurt ahead!
Spurt ahead!
Hasegawa!
The runners will come into the stadium any minute!
Why are you so late?
A surgery took long
What a tense moment!
There!
The runners can be finally seen!
Who is the first runner coming in?
Who will it be?
As expected, it's Hasegawa with Kimura behind him!
What?
There's another runner!
It's Jun-shik Kim!
You can do it
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim!
Go, Jun-shik!

Jun-shik!
The rickshaw won!
Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
The last runner is coming in!
It's a dream come true!
The medals will be awarded soon
I knew you could do it!
Ladies and gentlemen, the results will now be announced
The winner of All Japan Olympic Marathon Tryouts is
Hasegawa Tatsuo!
Second is number 13, Ando!
Third is number 18, Kimura!
Will the three runners come up to the victory stand?
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura Please come to the victory stand
Jun-shik Kim was first!
Jun-shik Kim!
Spectators, please calm down and be seated
Jun-shik Kim has been disqualified for blocking Kimura's way
Disqualified?
How!
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
Is this why you let me enter?
Go back.
Didn't you hear you've been disqualified?
You should've run fair and square
Fair and square?
Crazy bastards

Jong-dae!

JULY, 1939, NOMONHAN, MONGOLIAN BORDERLAND
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
Jun-shik!
You okay?
That Way!
Concentrate!
Get up there!
Retreat!
Min-woo!
You okay?
It's me, Jun-shik
Wake up!
Shit.
I should've fought for independence instead
Who would've guessed we'd end up fighting for the Japs here?
Our damn fortunes
I'm starving to death
You're hungry 24 hours a day
Grow up will you?
Hey!
Hurry up!
Lazy Korean fools!
Yes, sir
Let's hurry
Hope you get shot down dead
He's really dead?
Choon-bok!
Your butt!
What?
Where's it coming from?
I almost got my head blown off
The broken wall at 1 o'clock
I heard the 1st regiment got attacked, too.
It's him
Just our damn luck
Jong-dae!
Cover me
No!
Stay back, Jun-shik!
Cover him!
Choon-bok!
Cover him!
Don't move!
Are you okay Jun-shik?
It's great you shot down just Japs, but Neda's gonna kill us
She killed so many
Hey!
Don't hog all the food!
Give me some
Don't slobber over it!
Give me some!
This is you?
You keep eating I'll look at this
Fine, I'll show you Let me see first
Not that sexy
She's crying
Cuz you took her picture
No, it's cuz you ate all her beef jerky
Fools.
Why'd you make her cry?
The bullets happened to swerve and hit only Japanese soldiers?
Did the bitch smell your Kimchi breath?
Talk, you fools!
Speak, you bastards!
Who sent you here!
Say it!
I'm Shirai from Hailaer
You raped my mother before my father, and raped me, too
Listen!
There are many like me in China
China will never lose to you!
I will never forgive!
Never!
What?
What are you saying?
Tell me!
Why did the bullets fly past you Korean rubbish!
Speak, you bastards!
Damn it!
Stop it!
I said no speaking Korean!
Enough
Stop
That won't bring back the dead!
Go back to your work places
What's all this?
Who's coming?
Colonel
I'm Colonel Takakura
Company, halt!
Attention!
What?
Why's that bastard here?
Colonel Hasegawa, what brings you here?
Private Takakura ever drive past honorable Imperial soldiers' corpses?
Mukai!
Yes, sir
First!
For shamefully ordering a retreat, you're demoted to private as of today
Second
Private Takakura will prove loyalty to our Emperor and commit hara-kiri!
Be thankful our Emperor granted you an honorable death!
Long live our Emperor!
Handle the deceased with due respect
Yes, sir
Remember, after feeding off corpses, crows can come and gouge out your eyes
I'm Hasegawa Tatsuo
I came here to demolish Soviet tanks!
I'll show them true power of the Imperial army!
When out of bullets, Imperial soldiers must charge with bayonets!
If bayonets are broken, we must fight with bare hands!
Imperial soldiers do not leave the battlefield till death!
Understood!
Yes, sir
We either win or die
First!
We'll build a pontoon bridge over Khalkhin River within 48 hours
Second!
We'll form a special suicide unit of 50 men to demolish tanks
All officers will stand with me at the vanguard of the special unit!
Mukai!
Yes, sir!
Write up the list and have it on my desk by tomorrow
Dismissed!
Dismissed!
I'm sorry about your picture I glued it together
Take it
I have a sister like you back home
My name is Jun-shik Kim
Thank you
'Shei-shei ni'?
The sun's going down!
Hurry up, you bastards!
Stop dawdling!
Hurry up!
Work harder!
When the sun goes down, it's over!
Squad 9!
Damn slow Korean dogs!
Build this in 2 days?
He's insane!
They worked us from dawn!
Where's the food!
Stop talking about food!
You're making me hungry
Choon-bok?
What's 'Shei-shei ni'?
Learning Chinese?
Why do you keep asking?
Just tell me
It means thank you
Stop working!
Attention!
At ease
I heard Tatsuo was your marathon rival
He didn't stand a chance
Jun-shik's way better!
Come out!
Keep that in your mouth and come out!
Choon-bok Hwang!
Come out faster than a bullet, or you'll drink all the water here!
Repeat after me
I'm a barbarian
I'm a barbarian
I'm a Korean
I'm a Korean I'm a Korean
Repeat that, keep the fish in, and do squats till sundown!
Begin!
Catching fish on duty or running during bedtime!
You think this is a playground?
Make sure everything gets incinerated
Yes, sir!
No!
How dare you!
Not my running shoes!
Oh, is that so?
If you wanna run, do it barefoot
Where are you going, fool!
Damn bastards!
How many more beatings you need!
Korean dog!
No!
Gwang-choon?
This side's sinking
What?
There's a screw lose
Who unscrewed this?
It was there before
Squad 9!
Step forward
If we went on like this tomorrow, what would've happened?
From now on, the engineering unit will fix up Squad 9's area
Squad 9 will hold the faulty plank on their heads
And return to the base before sundown
The best marathoner will be leading you
The plank must be leveled!
Keep it leveled!
Noda, the bastard!
Save your breath
Just walk, Jun-shik We'll hold up the plank
Don't worry
If you hurt your knee, it's over!
Listen!
Keep it leveled!
One!
Two!
How is it?
Cool enough for you Squad 9 sluggards!
Jong-dae Lee!
Yes, sir
Jun-shik Kim!
Yes, sir
Why're they calling us this time?
Attention!
The 50 soldiers called will fight in tomorrow's attack
On a special suicide mission with me
What did he say?
Suicide?
Us?
We will carry bombs and demolish enemy tanks at dawn
Fight like Imperial soldiers and die with honor
I'll kill anyone Who dares retreat
Koreans should be honored to be included in this heroic mission
I'm not taking part in this operation
Oh, really?
For what reason?
The Korean soldiers and I didn't volunteer we cannot consent to a mission that demands death
Your permission to shoot, sir!
Dare disobey me?
All Koreans here, including our squad, think the same
I'll ask again Are you disobeying me?
This is insane
Execute him with the other POWs!
Before we march out tomorrow
Have fun on your last night
Stupid bastards!
Are you okay?
I'll be executed at dawn
Like this
The Japanese are evil
Korea and China are foolish
I'm not afraid to die
I'm just mad I couldn't kill more Japanese fools
If I could, I'd get more revenge
I'd kill them all!
Jun-shik?
What are you doing?
If we're gonna die like dogs, might as well save Jun-shik!
Hurry UP
Hurry!
Shirai
Why her?
Pull her out!
Why?
At a time like this
It's coming!
Run!
Run!
Get down!
Jun-shik!
Let's head to the bridge and go south on Khalkin River to cross the border
Where's Min-woo?
We're the only ones going?

FEBRUARY, 1940, KUNGURSK, SOVIET UNION PRISONER OF WAR CAMP
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
As proof you'll carry out the oath
The leader of you Japanese dogs,
Hasegawa Tatsuo, must step on your national flag
We're not labors or criminals, but proud Imperial soldiers!
You have no right to force us to reform!
Imperial Japan will not abandon you!
Keep your dignity till the day you return and fight with honor!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Hurry up!
Move it!
Colonel!
Don't fall asleep, sir!
Shut up, fool!
Keep moving!
Hurry up!
You yellow bastards!
You slow sluggards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Hurry!
Line up, you bastards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Choon-bok!
Gwang-choon!
Jun-shik!
I thought you were dead!
What a relief you're all alive
Where's Jong-dae?
Jong-dae's here, but
Attention!
This is Anton, your supervisor
I'm Anton
If Area 3 doesn't shape up, it'll be hard to stay alive here
Officers or soldiers,
I won't tolerate anyone slacking on the job!
Each group leader, take 20 new POWs and go to your work areas!
Go!
Jong-dae!
Jun-shik!
You're alive!
I was so worried I'd never see you again
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
When did you get here?
About two months ago
I rule here
Nothing for you to worry about now
Korean dog!
Jong-dae Lee!
I didn't like the way you were talking
I'm sorry...
Thought I'd say that?
You damn Jap!
Dare call me a Korean dog?
Give me that
Still think I'm a damn soldier under you?
You stupid son of a bitch!
This isn't Kyung-sung or Nomonhan!
This is the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
I'm the colonel here!
And I'm the king!
Got that?
You got that, fool?
You got that, fool?
Got that, you damn Japs!
Colonel
Wake up, sir!
Noda
If you wanna stay alive, stay out of my sight
Hey!
So damn cold
If we don't warm him up, He'll die
Please move
Who cares?
That bastard's not even worth stomping on
I beg you Make room for him, please
Try saving him, then
It probably won't work
What are you doing!
We have to save the Colonel!
Mukai!
If he's a goner, bring him to the incinerator
No use watching him die Let's go
Jun-shik, have a drink
Look at that
If you get frostbitten here, you end up being firewood like him
This is the warmest place in the whole camp
Your legs are your life Take good care of 'em
I like it here No Japs calling me a Korean dog
We should go back when the war's over
I'm not
There's nothing but pulling a rickshaw there
Having a drink reminds me of home
Eun-soo's probably fine, right?
I miss her
All stand!
Starting the day without bowing towards our Emperor is contemptible
There is no exception here!
Get up!
No need.
Keep eating
It's an order!
Crazy bastard
Everyone stand!
Now!
Private Jun-shik Kim!
Get up!
Private Kim!
We're no longer your subordinates
We were unjustly dragged and forced to become Imperial soldiers
As the Soviets can't demand reform, you have no right to force us to bow
Remember
From now on, I'm not Private Jun-shik Kim but the Korean marathoner Jun-shik Kim!
Crazy fool!
You want to die!
You're the crazy one who killed hundreds of soldiers!
Commit hara-kiri like Colonel Takakura!
Bastard!
Since you have the energy to fight, guess you're not hungry enough
Grudges between a Korean and a Japanese, huh?
You got your wish
Fight till one of you dies!
Kill him, Jun-shik!
Hurry!

Hurry up and do it!
Stop slacking off!
When did this happen?
It's okay, Jun-shik
Don't
It's okay
Hold still
Germany invaded the Soviet Union
The Soviets may speed up exchanging POWs to reinforce their army
Number 1277!
He's one of your men
Anton!
Go catch him!

It's time for frosebite examination
Where's Choon-bok?

No!
Drag him out!
I'm fine!
I can still work, sir!
Tell 'em Jun-shik!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Help!
Gwang-choon!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Jun-shik!
Help!
Let go!
Gwang-choon!
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You're not hiding in here, are you?
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You son of a bitch!
Shut up!
Come out, pal!
Come out!
You wanna die?
I was starving
Put the bread down and come out now
What do we do?
Who's there?
How dare you steal, you bastard!
He's the one
He's the thief!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
Please Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
A rat sneaked into our food storage today
Luckily we caught him, thanks to comrade Anton
As you know, stealing is punishable by death
Jong-dae!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
I'm scared!
Tell 'em I didn't eat the bread!
Jong-dae!
Execute him!
Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Make it back home alive!
Is it because of this?
This is more important than a friend's life?
This is who you really are?
Call yourself human?
Yeah, I'm not human
I'm not the Jong-dae you know!
I'm Anton!
I'm Anton, you bastard!
Call me Anton from now on!
Got that!
How long do you think this armband will protect you?
How could you do that to Choon-bok?
What do you know?
You don't know anything!
Shut up and stay out of my life
Do you know that Gwang-choon died?
He's probably nothing but ashes by now
If you pull that again in front of them, I'll kill you
Your emperor abandoned you
How dare you speak of our Emperor!
POW repatriation has been denied
We showed mercy on you, but the Japanese refused
They're battling Americans in the Pacific and have no interest in you
You expect me to believe that?
Imperial soldiers are sons of the Emperor
A father does not abandon his son
That's what you want to believe
You na?
ve, poor, abandoned son
You will also face death in the incinerator here
It's a Kokeshi
Is your hometown Yamagata?
You're good
You know, sir?
Have you been there?
My grandfather took me there when I was young
It's a beautiful place
I grew up there my whole life
My family ran a carpentry shop for generations
When I go back, I want to be a great carpenter like my father
Do you know why I chose to be your adjutant for Nomonhan, sir?
Because I saw your firm conviction for our country in your eyes
Conviction
Son of a bitch!
Tsukamoto!
You okay?
Wake up!
I go easy on you, you cripple, and for what!
Jong-dae!
We're doing our best, too!
Your best?
I'll show you my best in beating!
You son of a bitch!
You call that your best!
You bastards!
This is the best!
Jong-dae!
It's Anton, fool!
He's dead
Lieutenant!
What?
Never seen a man die before?
Get back to work, you bastards!
Work, you fools!
Get back to work now!
You fools never listen!
Damn Jap!
How dare you!
Stop it!
I told you to stay out of my way!
Dam Jap!
I gotta beat it into your head?
You bastards!
Damn Jap!
You son of bitch!
Jong-dae Lee!
Bastards!
Back to your posts!
There is no mercy for those who started the riot!
Begin the executions!
It's an urgent telegram, sir
Grab a uniform!
Change into now!
Germany has declared war against us
Comrade Stalin has given you too, your final calling
The choice is yours
Those who want to convert may wear Soviet army uniforms
Go get the uniforms!
Hurry!
Yes, sir
Hurry up and put it on!
Anton
This is a great opportunity for you
I hope you come back victorious
Long live the Soviet Union!
Good luck!
Comrade!
Please give them a chance, too
Let them go!
Thank you, sir!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurry up and put it on!
Hasegawa Tatsuo
This is your last chance
I'll say it one more time Put it on
Let's give it a good shot
It's better than freezing to death
Right, Jun-shik?
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Bastards
The Soviet army uniform suits our colonel so well, doesn't it?
DECEMBER, 1941 ZHEDOVSK, SOVIET UNION
Get off!
Get off, now!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Get off!
Move it!
This will be a grave for the Germans' today!
Thank you, sir!
Show the cowardly Germans the valor of the Soviet army!
It's mine!
Charge!
Attack!
Charge!
Charge!
Attack!
Charge!
Fire!
Charge!
Let go, you bastard!
What?
You wanna live, too?
I do, too!
I'm not dying here!
You die!
You die!
Tatsuo!
Move it!
Move it!
Charge!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Damn bastards!
No bullets!
Jong-dae!
Let's run!
This is dying like dogs!
It may be for you, but not me!
Charge!
You don't have any more bullets!
Charge!
Charge!
There is no retreat!
Jong-dae!
Come back!
Don't run away!
Come back!
There is no retreat!
Charge!
Charge!
Attack!
There is no retreat!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
What's with my goddamned life
Shit, I wanted to live it up
I'm so sorry, Jun-shik
Jong-dae
I want to see Eun-soo
I miss Eun-soo
Jun-shik
No, Jun-shik
Stay right here
Don't go out there
Charge!
There is no retreat!
I'll kill anyone who tries to run!
Charge ahead!
Attack!
Fools!
Attack!
Don't show your back to the enemy!
Charge!
Attack!
You'll need it to make it over the mountains
Where do you plan to go?
To German territory
I hope we're going the right way
I hope the snow stops
Even if we make it to German territory it won't be easy to make it back home
You don't have to come, if you don't want to
Back then
Why didn't you kill me?
Tatsuo!
Wake up!
I'll go find some medicine
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
I'll be right back
Help!
Help me!
I'm a Japanese soldier My friend's in danger
What's he saying?
I'm a Japanese soldier We're on the same side!
Take him away!
I'm a Japanese soldier, not a POW!
Let go!
You bastard!
Help me!
A man is dying!
Please!
Take him away, now!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Search every corner
You go up that way I'll go this way
3 YEARS LATER
There's word that the Allied Forces will invade Nord-Pas-de-Calais
Then we hit the jackpot getting stationed in Normandy
If Germany loses, aren't we all dead anyways?
Think they'll take us back?
We'd be lucky if they don't call us traitors and shoot us
That's why we should run away
You said you'll run for 2 years now
I'm going for sure this time
I heard from a man in another unit
There's a secret merchant ship to Jamaica at Cherbourg Harbor
How'll you get there?
Swim?
If you get caught trying to run, you'll be shot!
Wanna make a bet?
I bet 50 marks you can't run away
Bet 100 marks, stupid
Bet even your boots, you pig
May, 1944, NORMANDY, FRANCE will build additional defense walls and defense lines in the Atlantic
From tomorrow, you will build defense walls on the shore with unit 795
Our job is to build the defense encampment on Normandy hill
March forward!
Hurry up!
Squad 3!
Unit 2!
Go to barracks 14!
HEY
Shouldn't you give up looking for your Korean friend?
You're the only Asian here
That guy's so lucky
He gets to go in and out of base at will
Tatsuo!
Aren't you coming in?
Let's go
Go ahead I'll rest here for a sec
See ya later, then
I thought you might be dead
But you're here in the Eastern battalion
When did you come to Normandy?
Jun-shik?
Did you say something?
Can you repeat it?
Tatsuo!
It's more comfortable this way
I can't hear gunshots or screams
It's over
Let's play soccer
Tatsuo!
We're going to play against Squad 8!
Man, they're fast
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I lost cuz my rubber shoes fell off,
But I was happy to have a new running mate
We came much too far
How long will it take to run home from here?
More than a year, right?
We know the Allied forces will attack Nord-Pas-de-Calais
The Eastern battalion will all be sent to Nord-Pas-de-Calais!
You will all be reborn as true German soldiers!
Pack up your gear
We move out at 09:00 hours tomorrow!
Dismissed!
We're all dead I thought we'd be safe in Normandy
What's going on?
We're being transferred
It's nothing
Sending us to battle but feeding us this rubbish
I thought we'd get wine and steak when we came to France
Damn
Karim
I'm going to Cherbourg at dawn
Are you crazy?
I got the contact info from Roman ls Roman going?
That liar
How will you get there?
The food truck always leaves at dawn
We gotta go when you're on watch
Think it over If you get caught, you're dead
Is it cuz of your friend?
Fine
I'll see you at dawn
We're not going to Nord-Pas-de-Calais
We're going to Cherbourg
Cherbourg?
A ship there will take us home
Jun-shik
Let's go home where your sister and father are
Can we really make it home?
We could get killed on the way
Still, we can't die here
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Tatsuo!
Those aren't planes, are they?
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Stay there!
I'll come to you!
Wait for me!
Hurry!
It's an attack!
Prepare for battle!
The Allied Forces have attacked!
To your battle positions!
Hurry and grab the machine gun!
Grab it!
Everyone to your battle positions!
Move it!
Move it!
Fire!
Fire!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Are you okay?
Let's get out of here, now!
Grab the machine gun!
Now!
Hurry up, you fools!
Can't you see the enemy!
Reload and fire, now!
Allied forces attacked!
Send re-inforcements!
Let's run for it
Don't lag behind
You'll be watching my back as you run
Are you okay?
This won't kill me Let's go!
Jun-shik
Come on!
We have to get home!
Tatsuo
Are you okay?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
You're Jun-shik Kim from now on
If you say you're Japanese, they might kill you
Say you were dragged here and forced into the Eastern battalion
Jun-shik!
Wake up!
I have no regrets
Though I couldn't achieve my dream
You can't go like this!
Let's go home and run together!
Jun-shik
I wanted to run again when I go back home
Promise you'll make it back alive
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I was happy to have a new running mate
Ready, go!
brought to You by falang01
JULY, 1948, LONDON, ENGLAND
MARCH, 1928, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Isn't the air nice, Tatsuo?
You'll get used to it here soon
I'm sure you'll make good friends here
It's Jun-shik!
I'm faster than a car!
Grandpa!
You show the signs of a great Imperial soldier already
Welcome, my boy
How've you been, Father?
Greet them
He's the new, young master
Jun-shik Kim, sir
I'm Eun-soo Kim, sir
Great, Tatsuo You have a new friend your age
Tatsuo runs well.
Like you
My brother's the best runner in Kyung-sung, sir
I'm the best in Tokyo
No match for a country boy
Wanna race me?
Ready
Go!
HASEGAWA TATSUO WINS NATIONAL MARATHONS AGAIN!
KIM JUN-SHIK WINS!
Congratulations
Good job chasing behind me
Must be your damn lucky day
Let's applaud Hasegawa Tatsuo who won the national high school marathon and brought great honor to Imperial Japan
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
This is my grandson, Tatsuo
You must be very proud
I expect a lot from you
It's a gift from the Japanese Minister of Defense
Open it
Yes, sir
Give me that!
Get away!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Father!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Do something!
Father, please!
Do something!
You're a doctor who saves lives!
Why aren't you doing anything?
You killed him!
No
You killed him!
No
Bring my grandfather back!
Let go!
He didn't kill anyone!
You bastards killed him!
Jun-shik!
Bring my grandfather back!
No!
No!
I didn't do it!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Jun-shik!
Daddy!
Father!
Bring my grandfather back!
Father!
Jun-shik
Let go!
Father!
Father Daddy...
Daddy
Don't show your face around here again
Or I might kill you
Korea's hero, Ki-jung Sohn won an Olympic gold medal!
Rejoice!
MAY, 1938, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Why do you have sandbags strapped on?
Are you a marathon runner?
Korea's luck in the marathon stops with Ki-jung Sohn
A Korean man will never be an Olympic victor again
Koreans are banned from Olympics 'cause Sohn covered the Japanese flag?
If you were a bomb, I'd run straight into the Athletics Association
Marathon running is a science demanding concentration and fighting spirit
I'll prove it once and for all at the Olympic tryouts
Can you go any faster?
You might regret it
I'll pay double if you get there in 30 minutes
Triple for 20 minutes
Hold on tight
Your victory in the tryouts is a given
What is your goal in the Olympics?
I'll win the gold and set a new record
What a laugh in honor of our great empire!
Look out!
Look out!
Let's go!
Coming through!
To a marathon gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics!
Cheers!
Cheers!
You're quite the runner
Here you are
Double would've been fine
Opportunities come to those who don't give up
Jun-shik Kim
Jun-shik!
Are you okay?
Isn't that...
Are you all so happy over half of a race?
I'm Ki-jung Sohn
Ki-jung Sohn's in Japan
Wanna bet?
If I win, I get to marry your sister
Hurry
You say Japan and Korea are one yet you ban Koreans from tryouts?
Are you claiming the Athletics Association is unjust?
Your comment, Mr. Chairman?
The board has decided
If a Japanese runner will win anyways, what's the problem?
It'll be boring for Hasegawa without Jun-shik Kim
I think Jun-shik Kim shouldn't be in the discussion
See!
Jun-shik Kim?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim, what have you been up to?
What are your thoughts on the ban on Korean runners?
Are you still training?
How much do you train each day?
Your comments, please
Mr. Hasegawa?
Are you confident you'll win even if Jun-shik Kim enters?
You think he stands a chance against me?
But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better than yours?
That was in the past
You think a mere rickshaw driver can beat a well-trained marathoner?
If you could enter, are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?
How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?
I'd be grateful just to enter the race
Here is your acceptance letter from Berlin Medical University
Sign it
The marathon is more important to me than my studies
This is the most important period in your life
Focus on your studies
Our men are sacrificing their lives to build a Greater East Asia
I don't want to be a coward who runs away from war
War is futile
You are insulting Grandfather
Tatsuo, watch what you say
Think of the people before your country
That's the way of a doctor
Then I must treat the Korean people who killed my grandfather?
Even if it kills me, I'll never do that
The picture is missing from the frame in my room
Jong-dae!
Why you
Why would someone steal a picture of all things?
It should be around somewhere
Anyway, I hope you can enter the tryouts
Father will be so happy
Don't get your hopes up Can't trust the Japs
Get more firewood The fire's dying
Please?
It's so pretty
How do I look?
Eun-soo
I think you're the prettiest girl in all of Asia
OLYMPIC TRYOUTS ENTRY FORM
Please win and bring hope to Korea again
I can really enter the race?
Show them how scary a mere rickshaw driver can be!
Jun-shik
Listen carefully
The man in front of Jun-shik is Ki-jung Sohn
Then, you must be holding the Olympic tryouts entry form
If I'm right, hold it up high!
Yes!
Let me see!
Yes!
Sir!
Sir!
Jun-shik!
Min-woo!
Everyone!
Korea's best marathoner, Jun-shik Kim, will run the marathon again!
Hurray for Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik Kim!
Get the rice cake kings ate!
Rice cakes here!
Here you are
Father picked it out himself The best pair there is
Promise you'll win the race today?
Tatsuo
Your father will be here soon!
Look
Let's relieve all our Korean folks' heartaches today!
Jun-shik Kim!
Runners to the starting line
Jun-shik Kim!
You can do it!
And they're off!
Tatsuo!
Go, Jun-shik
Tatsuo, go get 'em!
Hasegawa!
Faster!
Faster!
Jun-shik, you're half way there!
Don't mind Jun-shik Kim
Hasegawa!
Spurt ahead!
Spurt ahead!
Hasegawa!
The runners will come into the stadium any minute!
Why are you so late?
A surgery took long
What a tense moment!
There!
The runners can be finally seen!
Who is the first runner coming in?
Who will it be?
As expected, it's Hasegawa with Kimura behind him!
What?
There's another runner!
It's Jun-shik Kim!
You can do it
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim!
Go, Jun-shik!
Kimura!
Kimura!
Hey!
What's that bastard doing!
Be careful Jun-shik!
That bastard
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
The rickshaw won!
Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
The last runner is coming in!
It's a dream come true!
The medals will be awarded soon
I knew you could do it!
Ladies and gentlemen, the results will now be announced
The winner of All Japan Olympic Marathon Tryouts is
Hasegawa Tatsuo!
Second is number 13, Ando!
Third is number 18, Kimura!
Will the three runners come up to the victory stand?
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura Please come to the victory stand
Jun-shik Kim was first!
Jun-shik Kim!
Spectators, please calm down and be seated
Jun-shik Kim has been disqualified for blocking Kimura's way
Disqualified?
How!
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
Is this why you let me enter?
Go back.
Didn't you hear you've been disqualified?
You should've run fair and square
Fair and square?
Crazy bastards
Try saying it again!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Damn bastards!
Jong-dae!
Hasegawa!
Please come up to the victory stand, immediately!
The winner of the Olympic tryouts is Jun-shik Kim!
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura!
Please come up, immediately!
You bastards cheated first!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
This court has decided on the following sentence
Based on section 4 of the legal code, all accomplices of the riot will become Imperial soldiers and swear allegiance to the Emperor
Mother!
Mother!

Father!
Father!
Jun-shik!
Soldiers must behave with decorum Soldiers must behave with decorum
Stop mumbling!
Soldiers must always improve their battle skills
I don't believe this
Soldiers must always improve their battle skills
Soldiers must serve with utmost loyalty
Soldiers must serve with utmost loyalty
Soldiers must always be frugal Soldiers must always be frugal
Frugal
JULY, 1939, NOMONHAN, MONGOLlAN BORDERLAND
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
Jun-shik!
You okay?
That way!
Concentrate!
Get up there!
Retreat!
Min-woo!
You okay?
It's me, Jun-shik
Wake up!
Shit.
I should've fought for independence instead
Who would've guessed we'd end up fighting for the Japs here?
Our damn fortunes
I'm starving to death
You're hungry 24 hours a day
Grow up will you?
Hey!
Hurry up!
Lazy Korean fools!
Yes, sir
Let's hurry
Hope you get shot down dead
He's really dead?
Choon-bok!
Your butt!
What?
Where's it coming from?
I almost got my head blown off
The broken wall at 1 o'clock
I heard the 1st regiment got attacked, too.
It's him
Just our damn luck
Jong-dae!
Cover me
No!
Stay back, Jun-shik!
Cover him!
Choon-bok!
Cover him!
Don't move!
Are you okay Jun-shik?
It's great you shot down just Japs, but Noda's gonna kill us
She killed so many
Hey!
Don't hog all the food!
Give me some
Don't slobber over it!
Give me some!
This is you?
You keep eating I'll look at this
Fine, I'll show you Let me see first
Not that sexy
She's crying
Cuz you took her picture
No, it's cuz you ate all her beef jerky
Fools.
Why'd you make her cry?
The bullets happened to swerve and hit only Japanese soldiers?
Did the bitch smell your Kimchi breath?
Talk, you fools!
Speak, you bastards!
Who sent you here!
Say it!
I'm Shirai from Hailaer
You raped my mother before my father, and raped me, too
Listen!
There are many like me in China
China will never lose to you!
I will never forgive!
Never!
What?
What are you saying?
Tell me!
Why did the bullets fly past you Korean rubbish!
Speak, you bastards!
Damn it!
Stop it!
I said no speaking Korean!
Enough
Stop
That won't bring back the dead!
Go back to your work places
What's all this?
Who's coming?
Colonel
I'm Colonel Takakura
Company, halt!
Attention!
What?
Why's that bastard here?
Colonel Hasegawa, what brings you here?
Private Takakura ever drive past honorable Imperial soldiers' corpses?
Mukai!
Yes, sir
First!
For shamefully ordering a retreat, you're demoted to private as of today
Second
Private Takakura will prove loyalty to our Emperor and commit hara-kiri!
Be thankful our Emperor granted you an honorable death!
Long live our Emperor!
Handle the deceased with due respect
Yes, sir
Remember, after feeding off corpses, crows can come and gouge out your eyes
I'm Hasegawa Tatsuo
I came here to demolish Soviet tanks!
I'll show them true power of the Imperial army!
When out of bullets, Imperial soldiers must charge with bayonets!
If bayonets are broken, we must fight with bare hands!
Imperial soldiers do not leave the battlefield till death!
Understood!
Yes, sir
We either win or die
First!
We'll build a pontoon bridge over Khalkhin River within 48 hours
Second!
We'll form a special suicide unit of 50 men to demolish tanks
All officers will stand with me at the vanguard of the special unit!
Mukai!
Yes, sir!
Write up the list and have it on my desk by tomorrow
Dismissed!
Dismissed!
I'm sorry about your picture I glued it together
Take it
I have a sister like you back home
My name is Jun-shik Kim
Thank you
'Shei-shei ni'?
The sun's going down!
Hurry up, you bastards!
Stop dawdling!
Hurry up!
Work harder!
When the sun goes down, it's over!
Squad 9!
Damn slow Korean dogs!
Build this in 2 days?
He's insane!
They worked us from dawn!
Where's the food!
Stop talking about food!
You're making me hungry
Choon-bok?
What's 'Shei-shei ni'?
Learning Chinese?
Why do you keep asking?
Just tell me
It means thank you
Stop working!
Attention!
At ease
I heard Tatsuo was your marathon rival
He didn't stand a chance
Jun-shik's way better!
Come out!
Keep that in your mouth and come out!
Choon-bok Hwang!
Come out faster than a bullet, or you'll drink all the water here!
Repeat after me
I'm a barbarian
I'm a barbarian
I'm a Korean
I'm a Korean I'm a Korean
Repeat that, keep the fish in, and do squats till sundown!
Begin!
Catching fish on duty or running during bedtime!
You think this is a playground?
Make sure everything gets incinerated
Yes, sir!
No!
How dare you!
Not my running shoes!
Oh, is that so?
If you wanna run, do it barefoot
Where are you going, fool!
Damn bastards!
How many more beatings you need!
Korean dog!
No!
Gwang-choon?
This side's sinking
What?
There's a screw lose
Who unscrewed this?
It was there before
Squad 9!
Step forward
If we went on like this tomorrow, what would've happened?
From now on, the engineering unit will fix up Squad 9's area
Squad 9 will hold the faulty plank on their heads
And return to the base before sundown
The best marathoner will be leading you
The plank must be leveled!
Keep it leveled!
Noda, the bastard!
Save your breath
Just walk, Jun-shik We'll hold up the plank
Don't worry
If you hurt your knee, it's over!
Listen!
Keep it leveled!
One!
Two!
How is it?
Cool enough for you Squad 9 sluggards!
Jong-dae Lee!
Yes, sir
Jun-shik Kim!
Yes, sir
Why're they calling us this time?
Attention!
The 50 soldiers called will fight in tomorrow's attack
On a special suicide mission with me
What did he say?
Suicide?
Us?
We will carry bombs and demolish enemy tanks at dawn
Fight like Imperial soldiers and die with honor
I'll kill anyone Who dares retreat
Koreans should be honored to be included in this heroic mission
I'm not taking part in this operation
Oh, really?
For what reason?
The Korean soldiers and I didn't volunteer we cannot consent to a mission that demands death
Your permission to shoot, sir!
Dare disobey me?
All Koreans here, including our squad, think the same
I'll ask again Are you disobeying me?
This is insane
Execute him with the other POWs!
Before we march out tomorrow
Have fun on your last night
Stupid bastards!
Are you okay?
I'll be executed at dawn
Like this
The Japanese are evil
Korea and China are foolish
I'm not afraid to die
I'm just mad I couldn't kill more Japanese fools
If I could, I'd get more revenge
I'd kill them all!
Jun-shik?
What are you doing?
If we're gonna die like dogs, might as well save Jun-shik!
Hurry up
Hurry!
Shirai
Why her?
Pull her out!
Why?
At a time like this
It's coming!

Fight!

Tatsuo!
Want to get everyone killed?
If you want to die, do it alone!
We're not dying like dogs!
Order the retreat!
Imperial soldiers must charge ahead even as ghosts!
Enough with the Imperial soldiers!
Order the retreat!
Colonel!
Here's your chance to die honorably as an Imperial soldier!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Where are we going?
Can we make it back home?
Move it!
You bastards!
CHITA
OMSK
PERM
FEBRUARY, 1940, KUNGURSK, SOVIET UNION PRISONER OF WAR CAMP
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
As proof you'll carry out the oath
The leader of you Japanese dogs,
Hasegawa Tatsuo, must step on your national flag
We're not labors or criminals, but proud Imperial soldiers!
You have no right to force us to reform!
Imperial Japan will not abandon you!
Keep your dignity till the day you return and fight with honor!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Hurry up!
Move it!
Colonel!
Don't fall asleep, sir!
Shut up, fool!
Keep moving!
Hurry up!
You yellow bastards!
You slow sluggards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Hurry!
Line up, you bastards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Choon-bok!
Gwang-choon!
Jun-shik!
I thought you were dead!
What a relief you're all alive
Where's Jong-dae?
Jong-dae's here, but
Attention!
This is Anton, your supervisor
I'm Anton
If Area 3 doesn't shape up, it'll be hard to stay alive here
Officers or soldiers,
I won't tolerate anyone slacking on the job!
Each group leader, take 20 new POWs and go to your work areas!
Go!
Jong-dae!
Jun-shik!
You're alive!
I was so worried I'd never see you again
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
When did you get here?
About two months ago
I rule here
Nothing for you to worry about now
Korean dog!
Jong-dae Lee!
I didn't like the way you were talking
I'm sorry...
Thought I'd say that?
You damn Jap!
Dare call me a Korean dog?
Give me that
Still think I'm a damn soldier under you?
You stupid son of a bitch!
This isn't Kyung-sung or Nomonhan!
This is the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
I'm the colonel here!
And I'm the king!
Got that?
You got that, fool?
You got that, fool?
Got that, you damn Japs!
Colonel
Wake up, sir!
Noda
If you wanna stay alive, stay out of my sight
Hey!
So damn cold
If we don't warm him up, He'll die
Please move
Who cares?
That bastard's not even worth stomping on
I beg you Make room for him, please
Try saving him, then
It probably won't work
What are you doing!
We have to save the Colonel!
Mukai!
If he's a goner, bring him to the incinerator
No use watching him die Let's go
Jun-shik, have a drink
Look at that
If you get frostbitten here, you end up being firewood like him
This is the warmest place in the whole camp
Your legs are your life Take good care of 'em
I like it here No Japs calling me a Korean dog
We should go back when the war's over
I'm not
There's nothing but pulling a rickshaw there
Having a drink reminds me of home
Eun-soo's probably fine, right?
I miss her
All stand!
Starting the day without bowing towards our Emperor is contemptible
There is no exception here!
Get up!
No need.
Keep eating
It's an order!
Crazy bastard
Everyone stand!
Now!
Private Jun-shik Kim!
Get up!
Private Kim!
We're no longer your subordinates
We were unjustly dragged and forced to become Imperial soldiers
As the Soviets can't demand reform, you have no right to force us to bow
Remember
From now on, I'm not Private Jun-shik Kim but the Korean marathoner Jun-shik Kim!
Crazy fool!
You want to die!
You're the crazy one who killed hundreds of soldiers!
Commit hara-kiri like Colonel Takakura!
Bastard!
Since you have the energy to fight, guess you're not hungry enough
Grudges between a Korean and a Japanese, huh?
You got your wish
Fight till one of you dies!
Kill him, Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
One of us should've died
Today's the day
Colonel!
Kill me, Korean dog!
Kill him!
LOGGING AREA 3
Hold it up right!
Hurry up and do it!
Stop slacking off!
When did this happen?
It's okay, Jun-shik
Don't
It's okay
Hold still
Germany invaded the Soviet Union
The Soviets may speed up exchanging POWs to reinforce their army
Number 1277!
He's one of your men
Anton!
Go catch him!
Yes, sir!
It's time for frosebite examination
Where's Choon-bok?
Take him away
Let me go!
Gwang-choon!
No!
No!
Drag him out!
I'm fine!
I can still work, sir!
Tell 'em Jun-shik!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Help!
Gwang-choon!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Jun-shik!
Help!
Let go!
Gwang-choon!
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You're not hiding in here, are you?
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You son of a bitch!
Shut up!
Come out, pal!
Come out!
You wanna die?
I was starving
Put the bread down and come out now
What do we do?
Who's there?
How dare you steal, you bastard!
He's the one
He's the thief!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
Please Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
A rat sneaked into our food storage today
Luckily we caught him, thanks to comrade Anton
As you know, stealing is punishable by death
Jong-dae!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
I'm scared!
Tell 'em I didn't eat the bread!
Jong-dae!
Execute him!
Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Make it back home alive!
Is it because of this?
This is more important than a friend's life?
This is who you really are?
Call yourself human?
Yeah, I'm not human
I'm not the Jong-dae you know!
I'm Anton!
I'm Anton, you bastard!
Call me Anton from now on!
Got that!
How long do you think this armband will protect you?
How could you do that to Choon-bok?
What do you know?
You don't know anything!
Shut up and stay out of my life
Do you know that Gwang-choon died?
He's probably nothing but ashes by now
If you pull that again in front of them, I'll kill you
Your emperor abandoned you
How dare you speak of our Emperor!
POW repatriation has been denied
We showed mercy on you, but the Japanese refused
They're battling Americans in the Pacific and have no interest in you
You expect me to believe that?
Imperial soldiers are sons of the Emperor
A father does not abandon his son
That's what you want to believe
You've poor abandoned son
You will also face death in the incinerator here
It's a Kokeshi
Is your hometown Yamagata?
You're good
You know, sir?
Have you been there?
My grandfather took me there when I was young
It's a beautiful place
I grew up there my whole life
My family ran a carpentry shop for generations
When I go back, I want to be a great carpenter like my father
Do you know why I chose to be your adjutant for Nomonhan, sir?
Because I saw your firm conviction for our country in your eyes
Conviction
Son of a bitch!
Tsukamoto!
You okay?
Wake up!
I go easy on you, you cripple, and for what!
Jong-dae!
We're doing our best, too!
Your best?
I'll show you my best in beating!
You son of a bitch!
You call that your best!
You bastards!
This is the best!
Jong-dae!
It's Anton, fool!
He's dead
Lieutenant!
What?
Never seen a man die before?
Get back to work, you bastards!
Work, you fools!
Get back to work now!
You fools never listen!
Damn Jap!
How dare you!
Stop it!
I told you to stay out of my way!
Dam Jap!
I gotta beat it into your head?
You bastards!
Damn Jap!
You son of bitch!
Jong-dae Lee!
Bastards!
Back to your posts!
There is no mercy for those who started the riot!
Begin the executions!
It's an urgent telegram, sir
Grab a uniform!
Change into now!
Germany has declared war against us
Comrade Stalin has given you too, your final calling
The choice is yours
Those who want to convert may wear Soviet army uniforms
Go get the uniforms!
Hurry!
Yes, sir
Hurry up and put it on!
Anton
This is a great opportunity for you
I hope you come back victorious
Long live the Soviet Union!
Good luck!
Comrade!
Please give them a chance, too
Let them go!
Thank you, sir!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurry up and put it on!
Hasegawa Tatsuo
This is your last chance
I'll say it one more time Put it on
Let's give it a good shot
It's better than freezing to death
Right, Jun-shik?
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Bastards
The Soviet army uniform suits our colonel so well, doesn't it?
DECEMBER, 1941 ZHEDOVSK, SOVIET UNION
Get off!
Get off, now!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Get off!
Move it!
This will be a grave for the Germans' today!
Thank you, sir!
Show the cowardly Germans the valor of the Soviet army!
It's mine!
Charge!
Attack!
Charge!

Attack!
Charge!
Fire!

Let go, you bastard!
What?
You wanna live, too?
I do, too!
I'm not dying here!
You die!
You die!
Tatsuo!
Move it!
Move it!
Charge!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Damn bastards!
No bullets!
Jong-dae!
Let's run!
This is dying like dogs!
It may be for you, but not me!
Charge!
You don't have any more bullets!
Charge!
Charge!
There is no retreat!
Jong-dae!
Come back!
Don't run away!
Come back!
There is no retreat!
Charge!
Charge!
Attack!
There is no retreat!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
What's with my goddamned life
Shit, I wanted to live it up
I'm so sorry, Jun-shik
Jong-dae
I want to see Eun-soo
I miss Eun-soo
Jun-shik
No, Jun-shik
Stay right here
Don't go out there
Charge!
There is no retreat!
I'll kill anyone who tries to run!
Charge ahead!
Attack!
Fools!
Attack!
Don't show your back to the enemy!
Charge!
Attack!
You'll need it to make it over the mountains
Where do you plan to go?
To German territory
I hope we're going the right way
I hope the snow stops
Even if we make it to German territory it won't be easy to make it back home
You don't have to come, if you don't want to
Back then
Why didn't you kill me?
Tatsuo!
Wake up!
I'll go find some medicine
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
I'll be right back
Help!
Help me!
I'm a Japanese soldier My friend's in danger
What's he saying?
I'm a Japanese soldier We're on the same side!
Take him away!
I'm a Japanese soldier, not a POW!
Let go!
You bastard!
Help me!
A man is dying!
Please!
Take him away, now!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Search every corner
You go up that way I'll go this way 3 YEARS LATER
There's word that the Allied Forces will invade Nord-Pas-de-Calais
Then we hit the jackpot getting stationed in Normandy
If Germany loses, aren't we all dead anyways?
Think they'll take us back?
We'd be lucky if they don't call us traitors and shoot us
That's why we should run away
You said you'll run for 2 years now
I'm going for sure this time
I heard from a man in another unit
There's a secret merchant ship to Jamaica at Cherbourg Harbor
How'll you get there?
Swim?
If you get caught trying to run, you'll be shot!
Wanna make a bet?
I bet 50 marks you can't run away
Bet 100 marks, stupid
Bet even your boots, you pig
May, 1944, NORMANDY, FRANCE will build additional defense walls and defense lines in the Atlantic
From tomorrow, you will build defense walls on the shore with unit 795
Our job is to build the defense encampment on Normandy hill
March forward!
Hurry up!
Squad 3!
Unit 2!
Go to barracks 14!
Hey
Shouldn't you give up looking for your Korean friend?
You're the only Asian here
That guy's so lucky
He gets to go in and out of base at will
Tatsuo!
Aren't you coming in?
Let's go
Go ahead I'll rest here for a sec
See ya later, then
I thought you might be dead
But you're here in the Eastern battalion
When did you come to Normandy?
Jun-shik?
Did you say something?
Can you repeat it?
Tatsuo!
It's more comfortable this way
I can't hear gunshots or screams
It's over
Let's play soccer
Tatsuo!
We're going to play against Squad 8!
Man, they're fast
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I lost cuz my rubber shoes fell off,
But I was happy to have a new running mate
We came much too far
How long will it take to run home from here?
More than a year, right?
We know the Allied forces will attack Nord-Pas-de-Calais
The Eastern battalion will all be sent to Nord-Pas-de-Calais!
You will all be reborn as true German soldiers!
Pack up your gear
We move out at 09:00 hours tomorrow!
Dismissed!
We're all dead I thought we'd be safe in Normandy
What's going on?
We're being transferred
It's nothing
Sending us to battle but feeding us this rubbish
I thought we'd get wine and steak when we came to France
Damn
Karim
I'm going to Cherbourg at dawn
Are you crazy?
I got the contact info from Roman
Is Roman going?
That liar
How will you get there?
The food truck always leaves at dawn
We gotta go when you're on watch
Think it over If you get caught, you're dead
Is it cuz of your friend?
Fine
I'll see you at dawn
We're not going to Nord-Pas-de-Calais
We're going to Cherbourg
Cherbourg?
A ship there will take us home
Jun-shik
Let's go home where your sister and father are
Can we really make it home?
We could get killed on the way
Still, we can't die here
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Tatsuo!
Those aren't planes, are they?
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Stay there!
I'll come to you!
Wait for me!
hurry!
It's an attack!
Prepare for battle!
The Allied Forces have attacked!
To your battle positions!
Hurry and grab the machine gun!
Grab it!
Everyone to your battle positions!
Move it!
Move it!
Fire!
Fire!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Are you okay?
Let's get out of here, now!
Grab the machine gun!
Now!
Hurry up, you fools!
Can't you see the enemy!
Reload and fire, now!
Allied forces attacked!
Send re-inforcements!
Let's run for it
Don't lag behind
You'll be watching my back as you run
Are you okay?
This won't kill me Let's go!
Jun-shik
Come on!
We have to get home!
Tatsuo
Are you okay?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
You're Jun-shik Kim from now on
If you say you're Japanese, they might kill you
Say you were dragged here and forced into the Eastern battalion
Jun-shik!
Wake up!
I have no regrets
Though I couldn't achieve my dream
You can't go like this!
Let's go home and run together!
Jun-shik
I wanted to run again when I go back home
Promise you'll make it back alive
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I was happy to have a new running mate
Ready, go!
JULY, 1948, LONDON, ENGLAND
MARCH, 1928, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Isn't the air nice, Tatsuo?
You'll get used to it here soon
I'm sure you'll make good friends here
It's Jun-shik!
I'm faster than a car!
Grandpa!
You show the signs of a great Imperial soldier already
Welcome, my boy
How've you been, Father?
Greet them
He's the new, young master
Jun-shik Kim, sir
I'm Eun-soo Kim, sir
Great, Tatsuo.
You have a new friend your age
Tatsuo runs well.
Like you.
My brother's the best runner in Kyung-sung, sir
I'm the best in Tokyo
No match for a country boy
Wanna race me?
Ready
Go!
HASEGAWA TATSUO WINS NATIONAL MARATHONS AGAIN!
KIM JUN-SHIK WINS!
Congratulations
Good job chasing behind me
Must be your damn lucky day
Let's applaud Hasegawa Tatsuo who won the national high school marathon and brought great honor to Imperial Japan
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
This is my grandson, Tatsuo
You must be very proud
I expect a lot from you
It's a gift from the Japanese Minister of Defense
Open it
Yes, sir
Give me that!
Get away!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Father!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Do something!
Father, please!
Do something!
You're a doctor who saves lives!
Why aren't you doing anything?
You killed him!
No.
You killed him!
No
Bring my grandfather back!
Let go!
He didn't kill anyone!
You bastards killed him!
Jun-shik!
Bring my grandfather back!
No!
No!
I didn't do it!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Jun-shik!
Daddy!
Father!
Bring my grandfather back!
Father!
Jun-shik
Let go!
Father!
Father.
Daddy...
Daddy
Don't show your face around here again
Or I might kill you
Korea's hero, Ki-jung Sohn won an Olympic gold medal!
Rejoice!
MAY, 1938, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Why do you have sandbags strapped on?
Are you a marathon runner?
Korea's luck in the marathon stops with Ki-jung Sohn
A Korean man will never be an Olympic victor again
Koreans are banned from Olympics 'cause Sohn covered the Japanese flag?
If you were a bomb, I'd run straight into the Athletics Association
Marathon running is a science demanding concentration and fighting spirit
I'll prove it once and for all at the Olympic tryouts
Can you go any faster?
You might regret it
I'll pay double if you get there in 30 minutes
Triple for 20 minutes
Hold on tight
Your victory in the tryouts is a given
What is your goal in the Olympics?
I'll win the gold and set a new record
What a laugh in honor of our great empire!
Look out!
Look out!
Let's go!
Coming through!
To a marathon gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics!
Cheers!
Cheers!
You're quite the runner
Here you are
Double would've been fine
Opportunities come to those who don't give up
Jun-shik Kim
Jun-shik!
Are you okay?
Isn't that...
Are you all so happy over half of a race?
I'm Ki-jung Sohn
Ki-jung Soho's in Japan
Wanna bet?
If I win, I get to marry your sister
Hurry
You say Japan and Korea are one yet you ban Koreans from tryouts?
Are you claiming the Athletics Association is unjust?
Your comment, Mr. Chairman?
The board has decided
If a Japanese runner will win anyways, what's the problem?
It'll be boring for Hasegawa without Jun-shik Kim
I think Jun-shik Kim shouldn't be in the discussion
See!
Jun-shik Kim?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim, what have you been up to?
What are your thoughts on the ban on Korean runners?
Are you still training?
How much do you train each day?
Your comments, please
Mr. Hasegawa?
Are you confident you'll win even if Jun-shik Kim enters?
You think he stands a chance against me?
But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better than yours?
That was in the past
You think a mere rickshaw driver can beat a well-trained marathoner?
If you could enter, are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?
How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?
I'd be grateful just to enter the race
Here is your acceptance letter from Berlin Medical University
Sign it
The marathon is more important to me than my studies
This is the most important period in your life
Focus on your studies
Our men are sacrificing their lives to build a Greater East Asia
I don't want to be a coward who runs away from war
War is futile
You are insulting Grandfather
Tatsuo, watch what you say
Think of the people before your country
That's the way of a doctor
Then I must treat the Korean people who killed my grandfather?
Even if it kills me, I'll never do that
The picture is missing from the frame in my room
Jong-dae!
Why you
Why would someone steal a picture of all things?
It should be around somewhere
Anyway, I hope you can enter the tryouts
Father will be so happy
Don't get your hopes up Can't trust the Japs
Get more firewood.
The fire's dying.
Please?
It's so pretty
How do I look?
Eun-soo
I think you're the prettiest girl in all of Asia
OLYMPIC TRYOUTS ENTRY FORM
Please win and bring hope to Korea again
I can really enter the race?
Show them how scary a mere rickshaw driver can be!
Jun-shik
Listen carefully
The man in front of Jun-shik is Ki-jung Sohn
Then, you must be holding the Olympic tryouts entry form
If I'm right, hold it up high!
Yes!
Let me see!
Yes!
Sir!
Sir!
Jun-shik!
Min-woo!
Everyone!
Korea's best marathoner, Jun-shik Kim, will run the marathon again!
Hurray for Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik Kim!
Get the rice cake kings ate!
Rice cakes here!
Here you are
Father picked it out himself The best pair there is
Promise you'll win the race today?
Tatsuo
Your father will be here soon!
Look
Let's relieve all our Korean folks' heartaches today!
Jun-shik Kim!
Runners to the starting line
Jun-shik Kim!
You can do it!
And they're off!
Tatsuo!
Go, Jun-shik
Tatsuo, go get 'em!
Hasegawa!
Faster!
Faster!
Jun-shik, you're half way there!
Don't mind Jun-shik Kim
Hasegawa!
Spurt ahead!
Spurt ahead!
Hasegawa!
The runners will come into the stadium any minute!
Why are you so late?
A surgery took long
What a tense moment!
There!
The runners can be finally seen!
Who is the first runner coming in?
Who will it be?
As expected, it's Hasegawa with Kimura behind him!
What?
There's another runner!
It's Jun-shik Kim!
You can do it
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim!
Go, Jun-shik!
Kimura!
Kimura!
Hey!
What's that bastard doing!
Be careful Jun-shik!
That bastard
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
The rickshaw won!
Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
The last runner is coming in!
It's a dream come true!
The medals will be awarded soon
I knew you could do it!
Ladies and gentlemen, the results will now be announced
The winner of All Japan Olympic Marathon Tryouts is
Hasegawa Tatsuo!
Second is number 13, Ando!
Third is number 18, Kimura!
Will the three runners come up to the victory stand?
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura.
Please come to the victory stand
Jun-shik Kim was first!
Jun-shik Kim!
Spectators, please calm down and be seated
Jun-shik Kim has been disqualified for blocking Kimura's way
Disqualified?
How!
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
Is this why you let me enter?
Go back.
Didn't you hear you've been disqualified?
You should've run fair and square
Fair and square?
Crazy bastards
Try saying it again!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Damn bastards!
Jong-dae!
Hasegawa!
Please come up to the victory stand, immediately!
The winner of the Olympic tryouts is Jun-shik Kim!
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura!
Please come up, immediately!
You bastards cheated first!
Tatsuo!

JULY, 1939, NOMONHAN, MONGOLIAN BORDERLAND
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
Jun-shik!
You okay?
That Way!
Concentrate!
Get up there!
Retreat!
Min-woo!
You okay?
It's me, Jun-shik
Wake up!
Shit.
I should've fought for independence instead
Who would've guessed we'd end up fighting for the Japs here?
Our damn fortunes
I'm starving to death
You're hungry 24 hours a day
Grow up will you?
Hey!
Hurry up!
Lazy Korean fools!
Yes, sir
Let's hurry
Hope you get shot down dead
He's really dead?
Choon-bok!
Your butt!
What?
Where's it coming from?
I almost got my head blown off
The broken wall at 1 o'clock
I heard the 1st regiment got attacked, too.
It's him
Just our damn luck
Jong-dae!
Cover me
No!
Stay back, Jun-shik!
Cover him!
Choon-bok!
Cover him!
Don't move!
Are you okay Jun-shik?
It's great you shot down just Japs, but Neda's gonna kill us
She killed so many
Hey!
Don't hog all the food!
Give me some
Don't slobber over it!
Give me some!
This is you?
You keep eating I'll look at this
Fine, I'll show you Let me see first
Not that sexy
She's crying
Cuz you took her picture
No, it's cuz you ate all her beef jerky
Fools.
Why'd you make her cry?
The bullets happened to swerve and hit only Japanese soldiers?
Did the bitch smell your Kimchi breath?
Talk, you fools!
Speak, you bastards!
Who sent you here!
Say it!
I'm Shirai from Hailaer
You raped my mother before my father, and raped me, too
Listen!
There are many like me in China
China will never lose to you!
I will never forgive!
Never!
What?
What are you saying?
Tell me!
Why did the bullets fly past you Korean rubbish!
Speak, you bastards!
Damn it!
Stop it!
I said no speaking Korean!
Enough
Stop
That won't bring back the dead!
Go back to your work places
What's all this?
Who's coming?
Colonel
I'm Colonel Takakura
Company, halt!
Attention!
What?
Why's that bastard here?
Colonel Hasegawa, what brings you here?
Private Takakura
Ever drive past honorable Imperial soldiers' corpses?
Mukai!
Yes, sir
First!
For shamefully ordering a retreat, you're demoted to private as of today
Second
Private Takakura will prove loyalty to our Emperor and commit hara-kiri!
Be thankful our Emperor granted you an honorable death!
Long live our Emperor!
Handle the deceased with due respect
Yes, sir
Remember, after feeding off corpses, crows can come and gouge out your eyes
I'm Hasegawa Tatsuo
I came here to demolish Soviet tanks!
I'll show them true power of the Imperial army!
When out of bullets, Imperial soldiers must charge with bayonets!
If bayonets are broken, we must fight with bare hands!
Imperial soldiers do not leave the battlefield till death!
Understood!
Yes, sir
We either win or die
First!
We'll build a pontoon bridge over Khalkhin River within 48 hours
Second!
We'll form a special suicide unit of 50 men to demolish tanks
All officers will stand with me at the vanguard of the special unit!
Mukai!
Yes, sir!
Write up the list and have it on my desk by tomorrow
Dismissed!
Dismissed!
I'm sorry about your picture I glued it together
Take it
I have a sister like you back home
My name is Jun-shik Kim
Thank you
'Shei-shei ni'?
The sun's going down!
Hurry up, you bastards!
Stop dawdling!
Hurry up!
Work harder!
When the sun goes down, it's over!
Squad 9!
Damn slow Korean dogs!
Build this in 2 days?
He's insane!
They worked us from dawn!
Where's the food!
Stop talking about food!
You're making me hungry
Choon-bok?
What's 'Shei-shei ni'?
Learning Chinese?
Why do you keep asking?
Just tell me
It means thank you
Stop working!
Attention!
At ease
I heard Tatsuo was your marathon rival
He didn't stand a chance
Jun-shik's way better!
Come out!
Keep that in your mouth and come out!
Choon-bok Hwang!
Come out faster than a bullet, or you'll drink all the water here!
Repeat after me
I'm a barbarian
I'm a barbarian
I'm a Korean
I'm a Korean I'm a Korean
Repeat that, keep the fish in, and do squats till sundown!
Begin!
Catching fish on duty or running during bedtime!
You think this is a playground?
Make sure everything gets incinerated
Yes, sir!
No!
How dare you!
Not my running shoes!
Oh, is that so?
If you wanna run, do it barefoot
Where are you going, fool!
Damn bastards!
How many more beatings you need!
Korean dog!
No!
Gwang-choon?
This side's sinking
What?
There's a screw lose
Who unscrewed this?
It was there before
Squad 9!
Step forward
If we went on like this tomorrow, what would've happened?
From now on, the engineering unit will fix up Squad 9's area
Squad 9 will hold the faulty plank on their heads
And return to the base before sundown
The best marathoner will be leading you
The plank must be leveled!
Keep it leveled!
Noda, the bastard!
Save your breath
Just walk, Jun-shik We'll hold up the plank
Don't worry
If you hurt your knee, it's over!
Listen!
Keep it leveled!
One!
Two!
How is it?
Cool enough for you Squad 9 sluggards!
Jong-dae Lee!
Yes, sir
Jun-shik Kim!
Yes, sir
Why are they calling us this time?
Attention!
The 50 soldiers called will fight in tomorrow's attack
On a special suicide mission with me
What did he say?
Suicide?
Us?
We will carry bombs and demolish enemy tanks at dawn
Fight like Imperial soldiers and die with honor
I'll kill anyone Who dares retreat
Koreans should be honored to be included in this heroic mission
I'm not taking part in this operation
Oh, really?
For what reason?
The Korean soldiers and I didn't volunteer we cannot consent to a mission that demands death
Your permission to shoot, sir!
Dare disobey me?
All Koreans here, including our squad, think the same
I'll ask again.
Are you disobeying me?
This is insane
Execute him with the other POWs!
Before we march out tomorrow
Have fun on your last night
Stupid bastards!
Are you okay?
I'll be executed at dawn
Like this
The Japanese are evil
Korea and China are foolish
I'm not afraid to die
I'm just mad I couldn't kill more Japanese fools
If I could, I'd get more revenge
I'd kill them all!
Jun-shik?
What are you doing?
If we're gonna die like dogs, might as well save Jun-shik!
Hurry up
Hurry!
Shirai
Why her?
Pull her out!
Why?
At a time like this
It's coming!
Run!
Run!
Get down!
Jun-shik!
Let's head to the bridge and go south on Khalkin River to cross the border
Where's Min-woo?
We're the only ones going?
He's out on a job with Noda
We can't take all 100 Koreans with us
Let's hurry We don't have time
Come on
Jun-shik!
Get on
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
What's that?
It's an attack!
We could've gotten killed, too
Damn Japs!
Good for them!
Let's go!
Come on, Jun-shik!
Hurry up!
What's going on?
Soviet tanks are coming!
Grab the oar!
Tanks?
Get on!
Jun-shik!
The tanks are coming!
Get on!
Go ahead without me
What did you say?
What the hell are you doing!
Crazy?
Get on, Jun-shik!
Come on!
Let's all survive and meet again!
Come with us!
Jun-shik!
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Just get on!
If you go back, you're dead, too!
Come back!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!

It's an attack!
Don't come!
It's an attack, sir!

Block off the front with trucks!
Move the trucks up front!
The rest to the first line of defense!
To the first line of defense!
Defend the first line of defense!
To the first line of defense!
Charge!
Scatter!

Long live our Emperor!

You go and die bravely!
Min-woo!
Help me
Min-woo
Min-woo
Fools!
Imperial soldier don't retreat!
How dare you run away!
Charge!
Don't show your back to the enemy!
Charge!
Charge!
Don't back down!
Don't run!
Fight!
Charge!
Tatsuo!
Want to get everyone killed?
If you want to die, do it alone!
We're not dying like dogs!
Order the retreat!
Imperial soldiers must charge ahead even as ghosts!
Enough with the Imperial soldiers!
Order the retreat!
Colonel!
Here's your chance to die honorably as an Imperial soldier!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Where are we going?
Can we make it back home?
Move it!
You bastards!
CHITA
OMSK
PERM
FEBRUARY, 1940, KUNGURSK, SOVIET UNION PRISONER OF WAR CAMP
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
As proof you'll carry out the oath
The leader of you Japanese dogs,
Hasegawa Tatsuo, must step on your national flag
We're not labors or criminals, but proud Imperial soldiers!
You have no right to force us to reform!
Imperial Japan will not abandon you!
Keep your dignity till the day you return and fight with honor!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Hurry up!
Move it!
Colonel!
Don't fall asleep, sir!
Shut up, fool!
Keep moving!
Hurry up!
You yellow bastards!
You slow sluggards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Hurry!
Line up, you bastards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Choon-bok!
Gwang-choon!
Jun-shik!
I thought you were dead!
What a relief you're all alive
Where's Jong-dae?
Jong-dae's here, but
Attention!
This is Anton, your supervisor
I'm Anton
If Area 3 doesn't shape up, it'll be hard to stay alive here
Officers or soldiers,
I won't tolerate anyone slacking on the job!
Each group leader, take 20 new POWs and go to your work areas!
Go!
Jong-dae!
Jun-shik!
You're alive!
I was so worried I'd never see you again
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
When did you get here?
About two months ago
I rule here
Nothing for you to worry about now
Korean dog!
Jong-dae Lee!
I didn't like the way you were talking
I'm sorry...
Thought I'd say that?
You damn Jap!
Dare call me a Korean dog?
Give me that
Still think I'm a damn soldier under you?
You stupid son of a bitch!
This isn't Kyung-sung or Nomonhan!
This is the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
I'm the colonel here!
And I'm the king!
Got that?
You got that, fool?
You got that, fool?
Got that, you damn Japs!
Colonel
Wake up, sir!
Noda
If you wanna stay alive, stay out of my sight
Hey!
So damn cold
If we don't warm him up, He'll die
Please move
Who cares?
That bastard's not even worth stomping on
I beg you.
Make room for him, please
Try saving him, then
It probably won't work
What are you doing!
We have to save the Colonel!
Mukai!
If he's a goner, bring him to the incinerator
No use watching him die Let's go
Jun-shik, have a drink
Look at that
If you get frostbitten here, you end up being firewood like him
This is the warmest place in the whole camp
Your legs are your life Take good care of 'em
I like it here No Japs calling me a Korean dog
We should go back when the war's over
I'm not
There's nothing but pulling a rickshaw there
Having a drink reminds me of home
Eun-soo's probably fine, right?
I miss her
All stand!
Starting the day without bowing towards our Emperor is contemptible
There is no exception here!
Get up!
No need.
Keep eating
It's an order!
Crazy bastard
Everyone stand!
Now!
Private Jun-shik Kim!
Get up!
Private Kim!
We're no longer your subordinates
We were unjustly dragged and forced to become Imperial soldiers
As the Soviets can't demand reform, you have no right to force us to bow
Remember
From now on, I'm not Private Jun-shik Kim but the Korean marathoner Jun-shik Kim!
Crazy fool!
You want to die!
You're the crazy one who killed hundreds of soldiers!
Commit hara-kiri like Colonel Takakura!
Bastard!
Since you have the energy to fight, guess you're not hungry enough
Grudges between a Korean and a Japanese, huh?
You got your wish
Fight till one of you dies!
Kill him, Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
One of us should've died
Today's the day
Colonel!
Kill me, Korean dog!
Kill him!
LOGGING AREA 3
Hold it up right!
Hurry up and do it!
Stop slacking off!
When did this happen?
It's okay, Jun-shik
Don't
It's okay
Hold still
Germany invaded the Soviet Union
The Soviets may speed up exchanging POWs to reinforce their army
Number 1277!
He's one of your men
Anton!
Go catch him!
Yes, sir!
It's time for frostbite examination
Where's Choon-bok?
Take him away
Let me go!
Gwang-choon!
No!
No!
Drag him out!
I'm fine!
I can still work, sir!
Tell 'em Jun-shik!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Help!
Gwang-choon!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Jun-shik!
Help!
Let go!
Gwang-choon!
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You're not hiding in here, are you?
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You son of a bitch!
Shut up!
Come out, pal!
Come out!
You wanna die?
I was starving
Put the bread down and come out now
What do we do?
Who's there?
How dare you steal, you bastard!
He's the one
He's the thief!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
Please Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
A rat sneaked into our food storage today
Luckily we caught him, thanks to comrade Anton
As you know, stealing is punishable by death
Jong-dae!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
I'm scared!
Tell 'em I didn't eat the bread!
Jong-dae!
Execute him!
Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Make it back home alive!
Is it because of this?
This is more important than a friend's life?
This is who you really are?
Call yourself human?
Yeah, I'm not human
I'm not the Jong-dae you know!
I'm Anton!
I'm Anton, you bastard!
Call me Anton from now on!
Got that!
How long do you think this armband will protect you?
How could you do that to Choon-bok?
What do you know?
You don't know anything!
Shut up and stay out of my life
Do you know that Gwang-choon died?
He's probably nothing but ashes by now
If you pull that again in front of them, I'll kill you
Your emperor abandoned you
How dare you speak of our Emperor!
POW repatriation has been denied
We showed mercy on you, but the Japanese refused
They're battling Americans in the Pacific and have no interest in you
You expect me to believe that?
Imperial soldiers are sons of the Emperor
A father does not abandon his son
That's what you want to believe
You naive, poor, abandoned son
You will also face death in the incinerator here
It's a Kokeshi
Is your hometown Yamagata?
You're good
You know, sir?
Have you been there?
My grandfather took me there when I was young
It's a beautiful place
I grew up there my whole life
My family ran a carpentry shop for generations
When I go back, I want to be a great carpenter like my father
Do you know why I chose to be your adjutant for Nomonhan, sir?
Because I saw your firm conviction for our country in your eyes
Conviction
Son of a bitch!
Tsukamoto!
You okay?
Wake up!
I go easy on you, you cripple, and for what!
Jong-dae!
We're doing our best, too!
Your best?
I'll show you my best in beating!
You son of a bitch!
You call that your best!
You bastards!
This is the best!
Jong-dae!
It's Anton, fool!
He's dead
Lieutenant!
What?
Never seen a man die before?
Get back to work, you bastards!
Work, you fools!
Get back to work now!
You fools never listen!
Damn Jap!
How dare you!
Stop it!
I told you to stay out of my way!
Dam Jap!
I gotta beat it into your head?
You bastards!
Damn Jap!
You son of bitch!
Jong-dae Lee!
Bastards!
Back to your posts!
There is no mercy for those who started the riot!
Begin the executions!
It's an urgent telegram, sir
Grab a uniform!
Change into now!
Germany has declared war against us
Comrade Stalin has given you too, your final calling
The choice is yours
Those who want to convert may wear Soviet army uniforms
Go get the uniforms!
Hurry!
Yes, sir
Hurry up and put it on!
Anton
This is a great opportunity for you
I hope you come back victorious
Long live the Soviet Union!
Good luck!
Comrade!
Please give them a chance, too
Let them go!
Thank you, sir!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurry up and put it on!
Hasegawa Tatsuo
This is your last chance
I'll say it one more time Put it on
Let's give it a good shot
It's better than freezing to death
Right, Jun-shik?
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Bastards
The Soviet army uniform suits our colonel so well, doesn't it?
DECEMBER, 1941 ZHEDOVSK, SOVIET UNION
Get off!
Get off, now!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Get off!
Move it!
This will be a grave for the Germans' today!
Thank you, sir!
Show the cowardly Germans the valor of the Soviet army!
It's mine!
Charge!
Attack!

What?
You wanna live, too?
I do, too!
I'm not dying here!
You die!
You die!
Tatsuo!
Move it!
Move it!
Charge!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Damn bastards!
No bullets!
Jong-dae!
Let's run!
This is dying like dogs!
It may be for you, but not me!
Charge!
You don't have any more bullets!
Charge!
Charge!
There is no retreat!
Jong-dae!
Come back!
Don't run away!
Come back!

What's with my goddamned life
Shit, I wanted to live it up
I'm so sorry, Jun-shik
Jong-dae
I want to see Eun-soo
I miss Eun-soo
Jun-shik
No, Jun-shik
Stay right here
Don't go out there
Charge!
There is no retreat!
I'll kill anyone who tries to run!
Charge ahead!
Attack!
Fools!
Attack!
Don't show your back to the enemy!
Charge!
Attack!
You'll need it to make it over the mountains
Where do you plan to go?
To German territory
I hope we're going the right way
I hope the snow stops
Even if we make it to German territory it won't be easy to make it back home
You don't have to come, if you don't want to
Back then
Why didn't you kill me?
Tatsuo!
Wake up!
I'll go find some medicine
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
I'll be right back
Help!
Help me!
I'm a Japanese soldier My friend's in danger
What's he saying?
I'm a Japanese soldier We're on the same side!
Take him away!
I'm a Japanese soldier, not a POW!
Let go!
You bastard!
Help me!
A man is dying!
Please!
Take him away, now!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Search every corner
You go up that way I'll go this way
3 YEARS LATER
There's word that the Allied Forces will invade Nord-Pas-de-Calais
Then we hit the jackpot getting stationed in Normandy
If Germany loses, aren't we all dead anyways?
Think they'll take us back?
We'd be lucky if they don't call us traitors and shoot us
That's why we should run away
You said you'll run for 2 years now
I'm going for sure this time
I heard from a man in another unit
There's a secret merchant ship to Jamaica at Cherbourg Harbor
How'll you get there?
Swim?
If you get caught trying to run, you'll be shot!
Wanna make a bet?
I bet 50 marks you can't run away
Bet 100 marks, stupid
Bet even your boots, you pig
May, 1944, NORMANDY, FRANCE will build additional defense walls and defense lines in the Atlantic
From tomorrow, you will build defense walls on the shore with unit 795
Our job is to build the defense encampment on Normandy hill
March forward!
Hurry up!
Squad 3!
Unit 2!
Go to barracks 14!
HEY
Shouldn't you give up looking for your Korean friend?
You're the only Asian here
That guy's so lucky
He gets to go in and out of base at will
Tatsuo!
Aren't you coming in?
Let's go
Go ahead I'll rest here for a sec
See ya later, then
I thought you might be dead
But you're here in the Eastern battalion
When did you come to Normandy?
Jun-shik?
Did you say something?
Can you repeat it?
Tatsuo!
It's more comfortable this way
I can't hear gunshots or screams
It's over
Let's play soccer
Tatsuo!
We're going to play against Squad 8!
Man, they're fast
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I lost cuz my rubber shoes fell off,
But I was happy to have a new running mate
We came much too far
How long will it take to run home from here?
More than a year, right?
We know the Allied forces will attack Nord-Pas-de-Calais
The Eastern battalion will all be sent to Nord-Pas-de-Calais!
You will all be reborn as true German soldiers!
Pack up your gear
We move out at 09:00 hours tomorrow!
Dismissed!
We're all dead I thought we'd be safe in Normandy
What's going on?
We're being transferred
It's nothing
Sending us to battle but feeding us this rubbish
I thought we'd get wine and steak when we came to France
Damn
Karim
I'm going to Cherbourg at dawn
Are you crazy?
I got the contact info from Roman
Is Roman going?
That liar
How will you get there?
The food truck always leaves at dawn
We gotta go when you're on watch
Think it over If you get caught, you're dead
Is it cuz of your friend?
Fine
I'll see you at dawn
We're not going to Nord-Pas-de-Calais
We're going to Cherbourg
Cherbourg?
A ship there will take us home
Jun-shik
Let's go home where your sister and father are
Can we really make it home?
We could get killed on the way
Still, we can't die here
Karim!
Karim!

Prepare for battle!
The Allied Forces have attacked!
To your battle positions!
Hurry and grab the machine gun!
Grab it!
Everyone to your battle positions!

Can't you see the enemy!
Reload and fire, now!
Allied forces attacked!
Send re-enforcements!
Let's run for it
Don't lag behind
You'll be watching my back as you run
Are you okay?
This won't kill me Let's go!
Jun-shik
Come on!
We have to get home!
Tatsuo
Are you okay?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
You're Jun-shik Kim from now on
If you say you're Japanese, they might kill you
Say you were dragged here and forced into the Eastern battalion
Jun-shik!
Wake up!
I have no regrets
Though I couldn't achieve my dream
You can't go like this!
Let's go home and run together!
Jun-shik
I wanted to run again when I go back home
Promise you'll make it back alive
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I was happy to have a new running mate
Ready, go!
JULY, 1948, LONDON, ENGLAND
MARCH, 1928, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Isn't the air nice, Tatsuo?
You'll get used to it here soon
I'm sure you'll make good friends here
It's Jun-shik!
I'm faster than a car!
Grandpa!
You show the signs of a great Imperial soldier already
Welcome, my boy
How've you been, Father?
Greet them
He's the new, young master
Jun-shik Kim, sir
I'm Eun-soo Kim, sir
Great, Tatsuo You have a new friend your age
Tatsuo runs well.
Like you
My brother's the best runner in Kyung-sung, sir

No match for a country boy
Wanna race me?
Ready
Go!
HASEGAWA TATSUO WINS NATIONAL MARATHONS AGAIN!
KIM JUN-SHIK WINS!
Congratulations
Good job chasing behind me
Must be your damn lucky day
Let's applaud Hasegawa Tatsuo who won the national high school marathon and brought great honor to Imperial Japan
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
This is my grandson, Tatsuo
You must be very proud
I expect a lot from you
It's a gift from the Japanese Minister of Defense
Open it
Yes, sir
Give me that!
Get away!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Father!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Do something!
Father, please!
Do something!
You're a doctor who saves lives!
Why aren't you doing anything?
You killed him!
No
You killed him!
No
Bring my grandfather back!
Let go!
He didn't kill anyone!
You bastards killed him!
Jun-shik!
Bring my grandfather back!
No!
No!
I didn't do it!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Jun-shik!
Daddy!
Father!
Bring my grandfather back!
Father!
Jun-shik
Let go!
Father!
Father Daddy...
Daddy
Don't show your face around here again
Or I might kill you
Korea's hero, Ki-jung Sohn won an Olympic gold medal!
Rejoice!
MAY, 1938, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Why do you have sandbags strapped on?
Are you a marathon runner?
Korea's luck in the marathon stops with Ki-jung Sohn
A Korean man will never be an Olympic victor again
Koreans are banned from Olympics 'cause Sohn covered the Japanese flag?
If you were a bomb, I'd run straight into the Athletics Association
Marathon running is a science demanding concentration and fighting spirit
I'll prove it once and for all at the Olympic tryouts
Can you go any faster?
You might regret it
I'll pay double if you get there in 30 minutes
Triple for 20 minutes
Hold on tight
Your victory in the tryouts is a given
What is your goal in the Olympics?
I'll win the gold and set a new record
What a laugh in honor of our great empire!
Look out!
Look out!
Let's go!
Coming through!
To a marathon gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics!
Cheers!
Cheers!
You're quite the runner
Here you are
Double would've been fine
Opportunities come to those who don't give up
Jun-shik Kim
Jun-shik!
Are you okay?
Isn't that...
Are you all so happy over half of a race?
I'm Ki-jung Sohn
Ki-jung Soho's in Japan
Wanna bet?
If I win, I get to marry your sister
Hurry
You say Japan and Korea are one yet you ban Koreans from tryouts?
Are you claiming the Athletics Association is unjust?
Your comment, Mr. Chairman?
The board has decided
If a Japanese runner will win anyways, what's the problem?
It'll be boring for Hasegawa without Jun-shik Kim
I think Jun-shik Kim shouldn't be in the discussion see!
Jun-shik Kim?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim, what have you been up to?
What are your thoughts on the ban on Korean runners?
Are you still training?
How much do you train each day?
Your comments, please
Mr. Hasegawa?
Are you confident you'll win even if Jun-shik Kim enters?
You think he stands a chance against me?
But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better than yours?
That was in the past
You think a mere rickshaw driver can beat a well-trained marathoner?
If you could enter, are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?
How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?
I'd be grateful just to enter the race
Here is your acceptance letter from Berlin Medical University
Sign it
The marathon is more important to me than my studies
This is the most important period in your life
Focus on your studies
Our men are sacrificing their lives to build a Greater East Asia
I don't want to be a coward who runs away from war
War is futile
You are insulting Grandfather
Tatsuo, watch what you say
Think of the people before your country
That's the way of a doctor
Then I must treat the Korean people who killed my grandfather?
Even if it kills me, I'll never do that
The picture is missing from the frame in my room
Jong-dae!
Why you
Why would someone steal a picture of all things?
It should be around somewhere
Anyway, I hope you can enter the tryouts
Father will be so happy
Don't get your hopes up Can't trust the Japs
Get more firewood The fire's dying
Please?
It's so pretty
How do I look?
Eun-soo
I think you're the prettiest girl in all of Asia
OLYMPIC TRYOUTS ENTRY FORM
Please win and bring hope to Korea again
I can really enter the race?
Show them how scary a mere rickshaw driver can be!
Jun-shik
Listen carefully
The man in front of Jun-shik is Ki-jung Sohn
Then, you must be holding the Olympic tryouts entry form
If I'm right, hold it up high!
Yes!
Let me see!
Yes!
Sir!
Sir!
Jun-shik!
Min-woo!
Everyone!
Korea's best marathoner, Jun-shik Kim, will run the marathon again!
Hurray for Jun-shik Kim!

The rickshaw won!
Jun-shik Kim!

Spectators, please calm down and be seated
Jun-shik Kim has been disqualified for blocking Kimura's way
Disqualified?
How!
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
Is this why you let me enter?

Didn't you hear you've been disqualified?
You should've run fair and square
Fair and square?

JULY, 1939, NOMONHAN, MONGOLIAN BORDERLAND
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
Jun-shik!
You okay?
That Way!
Concentrate!
Get up there!
Retreat!
Min-woo!
You okay?
It's me, Jun-shik
Wake up!
Shit.
I should've fought for independence instead
Who would've guessed we'd end up fighting for the Japs here?
Our damn fortunes
I'm starving to death
You're hungry 24 hours a day
Grow up will you?
Hey!
Hurry up!
Lazy Korean fools!
Yes, sir
Let's hurry
Hope you get shot down dead
He's really dead?
Choon-bok!
Your butt!
What?
Where's it coming from?
I almost got my head blown off
The broken wall at 1 o'clock
I heard the 1st regiment got attacked, too.
It's him
Just our damn luck
Jong-dae!
Cover me
No!
Stay back, Jun-shik!
Cover him!
Choon-bok!
Cover him!
Don't move!
Are you okay Jun-shik?
It's great you shot down just Japs, but Neda's gonna kill us
She killed so many
Hey!
Don't hog all the food!
Give me some
Don't slobber over it!
Give me some!
This is you?
You keep eating I'll look at this
Fine, I'll show you Let me see first
Not that sexy
She's crying
Cuz you took her picture
No, it's cuz you ate all her beef jerky
Fools.
Why'd you make her cry?
The bullets happened to swerve and hit only Japanese soldiers?
Did the bitch smell your Kimchi breath?
Talk, you fools!
Speak, you bastards!
Who sent you here!
Say it!
I'm Shirai from Hailaer
You raped my mother before my father, and raped me, too
Listen!
There are many like me in China
China will never lose to you!
I will never forgive!
Never!
What?
What are you saying?
Tell me!
Why did the bullets fly past you Korean rubbish!
Speak, you bastards!
Damn it!
Stop it!
I said no speaking Korean!
Enough
Stop
That won't bring back the dead!
Go back to your work places
What's all this?
Who's coming?
Colonel
I'm Colonel Takakura
Company, halt!
Attention!
What?
Why's that bastard here?
Colonel Hasegawa, what brings you here?
Private Takakura ever drive past honorable Imperial soldiers' corpses?
Mukai!
Yes, sir
First!
For shamefully ordering a retreat, you're demoted to private as of today
Second
Private Takakura will prove loyalty to our Emperor and commit hara-kiri!
Be thankful our Emperor granted you an honorable death!
Long live our Emperor!
Handle the deceased with due respect
Yes, sir
Remember, after feeding off corpses, crows can come and gouge out your eyes
I'm Hasegawa Tatsuo
I came here to demolish Soviet tanks!
I'll show them true power of the Imperial army!
When out of bullets, Imperial soldiers must charge with bayonets!
If bayonets are broken, we must fight with bare hands!
Imperial soldiers do not leave the battlefield till death!
Understood!
Yes, sir
We either win or die
First!
We'll build a pontoon bridge over Khalkhin River within 48 hours
Second!
We'll form a special suicide unit of 50 men to demolish tanks
All officers will stand with me at the vanguard of the special unit!
Mukai!
Yes, sir!
Write up the list and have it on my desk by tomorrow
Dismissed!
Dismissed!
I'm sorry about your picture I glued it together
Take it
I have a sister like you back home
My name is Jun-shik Kim
Thank you
'Shei-shei ni'?
The sun's going down!
Hurry up, you bastards!
Stop dawdling!
Hurry up!
Work harder!
When the sun goes down, it's over!
Squad 9!
Damn slow Korean dogs!
Build this in 2 days?
He's insane!
They worked us from dawn!
Where's the food!
Stop talking about food!
You're making me hungry
Choon-bok?
What's 'Shei-shei ni'?
Learning Chinese?
Why do you keep asking?
Just tell me
It means thank you
Stop working!
Attention!
At ease
I heard Tatsuo was your marathon rival
He didn't stand a chance
Jun-shik's way better!
Come out!
Keep that in your mouth and come out!
Choon-bok Hwang!
Come out faster than a bullet, or you'll drink all the water here!
Repeat after me
I'm a barbarian
I'm a barbarian
I'm a Korean
I'm a Korean I'm a Korean
Repeat that, keep the fish in, and do squats till sundown!
Begin!
Catching fish on duty or running during bedtime!
You think this is a playground?
Make sure everything gets incinerated
Yes, sir!
No!
How dare you!
Not my running shoes!
Oh, is that so?
If you wanna run, do it barefoot
Where are you going, fool!
Damn bastards!
How many more beatings you need!
Korean dog!
No!
Gwang-choon?
This side's sinking
What?
There's a screw lose
Who unscrewed this?
It was there before
Squad 9!
Step forward
If we went on like this tomorrow, what would've happened?
From now on, the engineering unit will fix up Squad 9's area
Squad 9 will hold the faulty plank on their heads
And return to the base before sundown
The best marathoner will be leading you
The plank must be leveled!
Keep it leveled!
Noda, the bastard!
Save your breath
Just walk, Jun-shik We'll hold up the plank
Don't worry
If you hurt your knee, it's over!
Listen!
Keep it leveled!
One!
Two!
How is it?
Cool enough for you Squad 9 sluggards!
Jong-dae Lee!
Yes, sir
Jun-shik Kim!
Yes, sir
Why're they calling us this time?
Attention!
The 50 soldiers called will fight in tomorrow's attack
On a special suicide mission with me
What did he say?
Suicide?
Us?
We will carry bombs and demolish enemy tanks at dawn
Fight like Imperial soldiers and die with honor
I'll kill anyone Who dares retreat
Koreans should be honored to be included in this heroic mission
I'm not taking part in this operation
Oh, really?
For what reason?
The Korean soldiers and I didn't volunteer we cannot consent to a mission that demands death
Your permission to shoot, sir!
Dare disobey me?
All Koreans here, including our squad, think the same
I'll ask again Are you disobeying me?
This is insane
Execute him with the other POWs!
Before we march out tomorrow
Have fun on your last night
Stupid bastards!
Are you okay?
I'll be executed at dawn
Like this
The Japanese are evil
Korea and China are foolish
I'm not afraid to die
I'm just mad I couldn't kill more Japanese fools
If I could, I'd get more revenge
I'd kill them all!
Jun-shik?
What are you doing?
If we're gonna die like dogs, might as well save Jun-shik!
Hurry UP
Hurry!
Shirai
Why her?
Pull her out!
Why?
At a time like this
It's coming!
Run!
Run!
Get down!
Jun-shik!
Let's head to the bridge and go south on Khalkin River to cross the border
Where's Min-woo?
We're the only ones going?
He's out on a job with Noda
We can't take all 100 Koreans with us
Let's hurry We don't have time
Come on
Jun-shik!
Get on
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
What's that?

What's going on?
Soviet tanks are coming!
Grab the oar!
Tanks?
Get on!
Jun-shik!
The tanks are coming!

Go ahead without me
What did you say?
What the hell are you doing!
Crazy?
Get on, Jun-shik!

Let's all survive and meet again!
Come with us!
Jun-shik!
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Just get on!

Charge!
Charge!
Don't back down!
Don't run!
Fight!
Charge!
Tatsuo!
Want to get everyone killed?
If you want to die, do it alone!
We're not dying like dogs!
Order the retreat!
Imperial soldiers must charge ahead even as ghosts!
Enough with the Imperial soldiers!
Order the retreat!
Colonel!
Here's your chance to die honorably as an Imperial soldier!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Where are we going?
Can we make it back home?

You bastards!

PERM
FEBRUARY, 1940, KUNGURSK, SOVIET UNION PRISONER OF WAR CAMP
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
As proof you'll carry out the oath
The leader of you Japanese dogs,
Hasegawa Tatsuo, must step on your national flag
We're not labors or criminals, but proud Imperial soldiers!
You have no right to force us to reform!
Imperial Japan will not abandon you!
Keep your dignity till the day you return and fight with honor!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Hurry up!
Move it!
Colonel!
Don't fall asleep, sir!
Shut up, fool!
Keep moving!
Hurry up!
You yellow bastards!
You slow sluggards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Hurry!
Line up, you bastards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Choon-bok!
Gwang-choon!
Jun-shik!
I thought you were dead!
What a relief you're all alive
Where's Jong-dae?
Jong-dae's here, but
Attention!
This is Anton, your supervisor
I'm Anton
If Area 3 doesn't shape up, it'll be hard to stay alive here
Officers or soldiers,
I won't tolerate anyone slacking on the job!
Each group leader, take 20 new POWs and go to your work areas!
Go!
Jong-dae!
Jun-shik!
You're alive!
I was so worried I'd never see you again
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
When did you get here?
About two months ago
I rule here
Nothing for you to worry about now
Korean dog!
Jong-dae Lee!
I didn't like the way you were talking
I'm sorry...
Thought I'd say that?
You damn Jap!
Dare call me a Korean dog?
Give me that
Still think I'm a damn soldier under you?
You stupid son of a bitch!
This isn't Kyung-sung or Nomonhan!
This is the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
I'm the colonel here!
And I'm the king!
Got that?
You got that, fool?
You got that, fool?
Got that, you damn Japs!
Colonel
Wake up, sir!
Noda
If you wanna stay alive, stay out of my sight
Hey!
So damn cold
If we don't warm him up, He'll die
Please move
Who cares?
That bastard's not even worth stomping on
I beg you Make room for him, please
Try saving him, then
It probably won't work
What are you doing!
We have to save the Colonel!
Mukai!
If he's a goner, bring him to the incinerator
No use watching him die Let's go
Jun-shik, have a drink
Look at that
If you get frostbitten here, you end up being firewood like him
This is the warmest place in the whole camp
Your legs are your life Take good care of 'em
I like it here No Japs calling me a Korean dog
We should go back when the war's over
I'm not
There's nothing but pulling a rickshaw there
Having a drink reminds me of home
Eun-soo's probably fine, right?
I miss her
All stand!
Starting the day without bowing towards our Emperor is contemptible
There is no exception here!
Get up!
No need.
Keep eating
It's an order!
Crazy bastard
Everyone stand!
Now!
Private Jun-shik Kim!
Get up!
Private Kim!
We're no longer your subordinates
We were unjustly dragged and forced to become Imperial soldiers
As the Soviets can't demand reform, you have no right to force us to bow
Remember
From now on, I'm not Private Jun-shik Kim but the Korean marathoner Jun-shik Kim!
Crazy fool!
You want to die!
You're the crazy one who killed hundreds of soldiers!
Commit hara-kiri like Colonel Takakura!
Bastard!
Since you have the energy to fight, guess you're not hungry enough
Grudges between a Korean and a Japanese, huh?
You got your wish
Fight till one of you dies!
Kill him, Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
One of us should've died
Today's the day
Colonel!
Kill me, Korean dog!
Kill him!
LOGGING AREA 3
Hold it up right!
Hurry up and do it!
Stop slacking off!
When did this happen?
It's okay, Jun-shik
Don't
It's okay
Hold still
Germany invaded the Soviet Union
The Soviets may speed up exchanging POWs to reinforce their army
Number 1277!
He's one of your men
Anton!
Go catch him!
Yes, sir!
It's time for frosebite examination
Where's Choon-bok?
Take him away
Let me go!
Gwang-choon!
No!
No!
Drag him out!
I'm fine!
I can still work, sir!
Tell 'em Jun-shik!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Help!
Gwang-choon!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Jun-shik!
Help!
Let go!
Gwang-choon!
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You're not hiding in here, are you?
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You son of a bitch!
Shut up!
Come out, pal!
Come out!
You wanna die?
I was starving
Put the bread down and come out now
What do we do?
Who's there?
How dare you steal, you bastard!
He's the one
He's the thief!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
Please Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
A rat sneaked into our food storage today
Luckily we caught him, thanks to comrade Anton
As you know, stealing is punishable by death
Jong-dae!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
I'm scared!
Tell 'em I didn't eat the bread!
Jong-dae!
Execute him!
Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Make it back home alive!
Is it because of this?
This is more important than a friend's life?
This is who you really are?
Call yourself human?
Yeah, I'm not human
I'm not the Jong-dae you know!
I'm Anton!
I'm Anton, you bastard!
Call me Anton from now on!
Got that!
How long do you think this armband will protect you?
How could you do that to Choon-bok?
What do you know?
You don't know anything!
Shut up and stay out of my life
Do you know that Gwang-choon died?
He's probably nothing but ashes by now
If you pull that again in front of them, I'll kill you
Your emperor abandoned you
How dare you speak of our Emperor!
POW repatriation has been denied
We showed mercy on you, but the Japanese refused
They're battling Americans in the Pacific and have no interest in you
You expect me to believe that?
Imperial soldiers are sons of the Emperor
A father does not abandon his son
That's what you want to believe
You na?
ve, poor, abandoned son
You will also face death in the incinerator here
It's a Kokeshi
Is your hometown Yamagata?
You're good
You know, sir?
Have you been there?
My grandfather took me there when I was young
It's a beautiful place
I grew up there my whole life
My family ran a carpentry shop for generations
When I go back, I want to be a great carpenter like my father
Do you know why I chose to be your adjutant for Nomonhan, sir?
Because I saw your firm conviction for our country in your eyes
Conviction
Son of a bitch!
Tsukamoto!
You okay?
Wake up!
I go easy on you, you cripple, and for what!
Jong-dae!
We're doing our best, too!
Your best?
I'll show you my best in beating!
You son of a bitch!
You call that your best!
You bastards!
This is the best!
Jong-dae!
It's Anton, fool!
He's dead
Lieutenant!
What?
Never seen a man die before?
Get back to work, you bastards!
Work, you fools!
Get back to work now!
You fools never listen!
Damn Jap!
How dare you!
Stop it!
I told you to stay out of my way!
Dam Jap!
I gotta beat it into your head?
You bastards!
Damn Jap!
You son of bitch!
Jong-dae Lee!
Bastards!
Back to your posts!
There is no mercy for those who started the riot!
Begin the executions!
It's an urgent telegram, sir
Grab a uniform!
Change into now!
Germany has declared war against us
Comrade Stalin has given you too, your final calling
The choice is yours
Those who want to convert may wear Soviet army uniforms
Go get the uniforms!
Hurry!
Yes, sir
Hurry up and put it on!
Anton
This is a great opportunity for you
I hope you come back victorious
Long live the Soviet Union!
Good luck!
Comrade!
Please give them a chance, too
Let them go!
Thank you, sir!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurry up and put it on!
Hasegawa Tatsuo
This is your last chance
I'll say it one more time Put it on
Let's give it a good shot
It's better than freezing to death
Right, Jun-shik?
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Bastards
The Soviet army uniform suits our colonel so well, doesn't it?
DECEMBER, 1941 ZHEDOVSK, SOVIET UNION
Get off!
Get off, now!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Get off!
Move it!
This will be a grave for the Germans' today!
Thank you, sir!
Show the cowardly Germans the valor of the Soviet army!
It's mine!
Charge!
Attack!
Charge!
Charge!
Attack!
Charge!
Fire!
Charge!
Let go, you bastard!
What?
You wanna live, too?

There is no retreat!
I'll kill anyone who tries to run!
Charge ahead!
Attack!
Fools!

Don't show your back to the enemy!
Charge!

You'll need it to make it over the mountains
Where do you plan to go?
To German territory
I hope we're going the right way
I hope the snow stops
Even if we make it to German territory it won't be easy to make it back home
You don't have to come, if you don't want to
Back then
Why didn't you kill me?
Tatsuo!
Wake up!
I'll go find some medicine
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
I'll be right back
Help!
Help me!
I'm a Japanese soldier My friend's in danger
What's he saying?
I'm a Japanese soldier We're on the same side!
Take him away!
I'm a Japanese soldier, not a POW!
Let go!
You bastard!
Help me!
A man is dying!
Please!
Take him away, now!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Search every corner
You go up that way I'll go this way
3 YEARS LATER
There's word that the Allied Forces will invade Nord-Pas-de-Calais
Then we hit the jackpot getting stationed in Normandy
If Germany loses, aren't we all dead anyways?
Think they'll take us back?
We'd be lucky if they don't call us traitors and shoot us
That's why we should run away
You said you'll run for 2 years now
I'm going for sure this time
I heard from a man in another unit
There's a secret merchant ship to Jamaica at Cherbourg Harbor
How'll you get there?
Swim?
If you get caught trying to run, you'll be shot!
Wanna make a bet?
I bet 50 marks you can't run away
Bet 100 marks, stupid
Bet even your boots, you pig
May, 1944, NORMANDY, FRANCE will build additional defense walls and defense lines in the Atlantic
From tomorrow, you will build defense walls on the shore with unit 795
Our job is to build the defense encampment on Normandy hill
March forward!
Hurry up!
Squad 3!
Unit 2!
Go to barracks 14!
HEY
Shouldn't you give up looking for your Korean friend?
You're the only Asian here
That guy's so lucky
He gets to go in and out of base at will
Tatsuo!
Aren't you coming in?
Let's go
Go ahead I'll rest here for a sec
See ya later, then
I thought you might be dead
But you're here in the Eastern battalion
When did you come to Normandy?
Jun-shik?
Did you say something?
Can you repeat it?
Tatsuo!
It's more comfortable this way
I can't hear gunshots or screams
It's over
Let's play soccer
Tatsuo!
We're going to play against Squad 8!
Man, they're fast
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I lost cuz my rubber shoes fell off,
But I was happy to have a new running mate
We came much too far
How long will it take to run home from here?
More than a year, right?
We know the Allied forces will attack Nord-Pas-de-Calais
The Eastern battalion will all be sent to Nord-Pas-de-Calais!
You will all be reborn as true German soldiers!
Pack up your gear
We move out at 09:00 hours tomorrow!
Dismissed!
We're all dead I thought we'd be safe in Normandy
What's going on?
We're being transferred
It's nothing
Sending us to battle but feeding us this rubbish
I thought we'd get wine and steak when we came to France
Damn
Karim
I'm going to Cherbourg at dawn
Are you crazy?
I got the contact info from Roman ls Roman going?
That liar
How will you get there?
The food truck always leaves at dawn
We gotta go when you're on watch
Think it over If you get caught, you're dead
Is it cuz of your friend?
Fine
I'll see you at dawn
We're not going to Nord-Pas-de-Calais
We're going to Cherbourg
Cherbourg?
A ship there will take us home
Jun-shik
Let's go home where your sister and father are
Can we really make it home?
We could get killed on the way
Still, we can't die here
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Tatsuo!
Those aren't planes, are they?
Tatsuo!

Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!

Prepare for battle!
The Allied Forces have attacked!
To your battle positions!
Hurry and grab the machine gun!
Grab it!
Everyone to your battle positions!
Move it!

Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!

Let's get out of here, now!
Grab the machine gun!
Now!
Hurry up, you fools!
Can't you see the enemy!
Reload and fire, now!
Allied forces attacked!
Send re-inforcements!
Let's run for it
Don't lag behind
You'll be watching my back as you run
Are you okay?
This won't kill me Let's go!
Jun-shik
Come on!
We have to get home!
Tatsuo
Are you okay?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
You're Jun-shik Kim from now on
If you say you're Japanese, they might kill you
Say you were dragged here and forced into the Eastern battalion
Jun-shik!
Wake up!
I have no regrets
Though I couldn't achieve my dream
You can't go like this!
Let's go home and run together!
Jun-shik
I wanted to run again when I go back home
Promise you'll make it back alive
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I was happy to have a new running mate
Ready, go!
JULY, 1948, LONDON, ENGLAND
MARCH, 1928, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Isn't the air nice, Tatsuo?
You'll get used to it here soon
I'm sure you'll make good friends here
It's Jun-shik!
I'm faster than a car!
Grandpa!
You show the signs of a great Imperial soldier already
Welcome, my boy
How've you been, Father?
Greet them
He's the new, young master
Jun-shik Kim, sir
I'm Eun-soo Kim, sir
Great, Tatsuo.
You have a new friend your age
Tatsuo runs well.
Like you.
My brother's the best runner in Kyung-sung, sir
I'm the best in Tokyo
No match for a country boy
Wanna race me?
Ready
Go!
HASEGAWA TATSUO WINS NATIONAL MARATHONS AGAIN!
KIM JUN-SHIK WINS!
Congratulations
Good job chasing behind me
Must be your damn lucky day
Let's applaud Hasegawa Tatsuo who won the national high school marathon and brought great honor to Imperial Japan
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
This is my grandson, Tatsuo
You must be very proud
I expect a lot from you
It's a gift from the Japanese Minister of Defense
Open it
Yes, sir
Give me that!
Get away!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Father!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Do something!
Father, please!
Do something!
You're a doctor who saves lives!
Why aren't you doing anything?
You killed him!
No.
You killed him!
No
Bring my grandfather back!
Let go!
He didn't kill anyone!
You bastards killed him!
Jun-shik!
Bring my grandfather back!
No!
No!
I didn't do it!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Jun-shik!
Daddy!
Father!
Bring my grandfather back!
Father!
Jun-shik
Let go!
Father!
Father.
Daddy...
Daddy
Don't show your face around here again
Or I might kill you
Korea's hero, Ki-jung Sohn won an Olympic gold medal!
Rejoice!
MAY, 1938, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Why do you have sandbags strapped on?
Are you a marathon runner?
Korea's luck in the marathon stops with Ki-jung Sohn
A Korean man will never be an Olympic victor again
Koreans are banned from Olympics 'cause Sohn covered the Japanese flag?
If you were a bomb, I'd run straight into the Athletics Association
Marathon running is a science demanding concentration and fighting spirit
I'll prove it once and for all at the Olympic tryouts
Can you go any faster?
You might regret it
I'll pay double if you get there in 30 minutes
Triple for 20 minutes
Hold on tight
Your victory in the tryouts is a given
What is your goal in the Olympics?
I'll win the gold and set a new record
What a laugh in honor of our great empire!
Look out!
Look out!
Let's go!
Coming through!
To a marathon gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics!
Cheers!
Cheers!
You're quite the runner
Here you are
Double would've been fine
Opportunities come to those who don't give up
Jun-shik Kim
Jun-shik!
Are you okay?
Isn't that...
Are you all so happy over half of a race?
I'm Ki-jung Sohn
Ki-jung Soho's in Japan
Wanna bet?
If I win, I get to marry your sister
Hurry
You say Japan and Korea are one yet you ban Koreans from tryouts?
Are you claiming the Athletics Association is unjust?
Your comment, Mr. Chairman?
The board has decided
If a Japanese runner will win anyways, what's the problem?
It'll be boring for Hasegawa without Jun-shik Kim
I think Jun-shik Kim shouldn't be in the discussion
See!
Jun-shik Kim?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim, what have you been up to?
What are your thoughts on the ban on Korean runners?
Are you still training?
How much do you train each day?
Your comments, please
Mr. Hasegawa?
Are you confident you'll win even if Jun-shik Kim enters?
You think he stands a chance against me?
But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better than yours?
That was in the past
You think a mere rickshaw driver can beat a well-trained marathoner?
If you could enter, are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?
How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?
I'd be grateful just to enter the race
Here is your acceptance letter from Berlin Medical University
Sign it
The marathon is more important to me than my studies
This is the most important period in your life
Focus on your studies
Our men are sacrificing their lives to build a Greater East Asia
I don't want to be a coward who runs away from war
War is futile
You are insulting Grandfather
Tatsuo, watch what you say
Think of the people before your country
That's the way of a doctor
Then I must treat the Korean people who killed my grandfather?
Even if it kills me, I'll never do that
The picture is missing from the frame in my room
Jong-dae!
Why you
Why would someone steal a picture of all things?
It should be around somewhere
Anyway, I hope you can enter the tryouts
Father will be so happy
Don't get your hopes up Can't trust the Japs
Get more firewood.
The fire's dying.
Please?
It's so pretty
How do I look?
Eun-soo
I think you're the prettiest girl in all of Asia
OLYMPIC TRYOUTS ENTRY FORM
Please win and bring hope to Korea again
I can really enter the race?
Show them how scary a mere rickshaw driver can be!
Jun-shik
Listen carefully
The man in front of Jun-shik is Ki-jung Sohn
Then, you must be holding the Olympic tryouts entry form
If I'm right, hold it up high!
Yes!
Let me see!
Yes!
Sir!
Sir!
Jun-shik!
Min-woo!
Everyone!
Korea's best marathoner, Jun-shik Kim, will run the marathon again!
Hurray for Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik Kim!
Get the rice cake kings ate!
Rice cakes here!
Here you are
Father picked it out himself The best pair there is
Promise you'll win the race today?
Tatsuo
Your father will be here soon!
Look

Don't mind Jun-shik Kim
Hasegawa!
Spurt ahead!
Spurt ahead!
Hasegawa!
The runners will come into the stadium any minute!
Why are you so late?
A surgery took long
What a tense moment!
There!
The runners can be finally seen!
Who is the first runner coming in?
Who will it be?
As expected, it's Hasegawa with Kimura behind him!
What?
There's another runner!
It's Jun-shik Kim!
You can do it
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim!
Go, Jun-shik!
Kimura!
Kimura!
Hey!
What's that bastard doing!
Be careful Jun-shik!
That bastard
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
The rickshaw won!
Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
The last runner is coming in!
It's a dream come true!
The medals will be awarded soon
I knew you could do it!
Ladies and gentlemen, the results will now be announced
The winner of All Japan Olympic Marathon Tryouts is
Hasegawa Tatsuo!
Second is number 13, Ando!
Third is number 18, Kimura!
Will the three runners come up to the victory stand?
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura.
Please come to the victory stand
Jun-shik Kim was first!
Jun-shik Kim!
Spectators, please calm down and be seated
Jun-shik Kim has been disqualified for blocking Kimura's way
Disqualified?
How!
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
Is this why you let me enter?
Go back.
Didn't you hear you've been disqualified?
You should've run fair and square
Fair and square?
Crazy bastards
Try saying it again!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Damn bastards!
Jong-dae!
Hasegawa!
Please come up to the victory stand, immediately!
The winner of the Olympic tryouts is Jun-shik Kim!
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura!
Please come up, immediately!
You bastards cheated first!
Tatsuo!

Soldiers must behave with decorum Soldiers must behave with decorum

Soldiers must always improve their battle skills
I don't believe this
Soldiers must always improve their battle skills
Soldiers must serve with utmost loyalty

Soldiers must always be frugal Soldiers must always be frugal
Frugal
JULY, 1939, NOMONHAN, MONGOLIAN BORDERLAND
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
Jun-shik!
You okay?
That Way!
Concentrate!
Get up there!
Retreat!
Min-woo!
You okay?
It's me, Jun-shik
Wake up!
Shit.
I should've fought for independence instead
Who would've guessed we'd end up fighting for the Japs here?
Our damn fortunes
I'm starving to death
You're hungry 24 hours a day
Grow up will you?
Hey!
Hurry up!
Lazy Korean fools!
Yes, sir
Let's hurry
Hope you get shot down dead
He's really dead?
Choon-bok!
Your butt!
What?
Where's it coming from?
I almost got my head blown off
The broken wall at 1 o'clock
I heard the 1st regiment got attacked, too.
It's him
Just our damn luck
Jong-dae!
Cover me
No!
Stay back, Jun-shik!
Cover him!
Choon-bok!
Cover him!
Don't move!
Are you okay Jun-shik?
It's great you shot down just Japs, but Neda's gonna kill us
She killed so many
Hey!
Don't hog all the food!
Give me some
Don't slobber over it!
Give me some!
This is you?
You keep eating I'll look at this
Fine, I'll show you Let me see first
Not that sexy
She's crying
Cuz you took her picture
No, it's cuz you ate all her beef jerky
Fools.
Why'd you make her cry?
The bullets happened to swerve and hit only Japanese soldiers?
Did the bitch smell your Kimchi breath?
Talk, you fools!
Speak, you bastards!
Who sent you here!
Say it!
I'm Shirai from Hailaer
You raped my mother before my father, and raped me, too
Listen!
There are many like me in China
China will never lose to you!
I will never forgive!
Never!
What?
What are you saying?
Tell me!
Why did the bullets fly past you Korean rubbish!
Speak, you bastards!
Damn it!
Stop it!
I said no speaking Korean!
Enough
Stop
That won't bring back the dead!
Go back to your work places
What's all this?
Who's coming?
Colonel
I'm Colonel Takakura
Company, halt!
Attention!
What?
Why's that bastard here?
Colonel Hasegawa, what brings you here?
Private Takakura
Ever drive past honorable Imperial soldiers' corpses?
Mukai!
Yes, sir
First!
For shamefully ordering a retreat, you're demoted to private as of today
Second
Private Takakura will prove loyalty to our Emperor and commit hara-kiri!
Be thankful our Emperor granted you an honorable death!
Long live our Emperor!
Handle the deceased with due respect
Yes, sir
Remember, after feeding off corpses, crows can come and gouge out your eyes
I'm Hasegawa Tatsuo
I came here to demolish Soviet tanks!
I'll show them true power of the Imperial army!
When out of bullets, Imperial soldiers must charge with bayonets!
If bayonets are broken, we must fight with bare hands!
Imperial soldiers do not leave the battlefield till death!
Understood!
Yes, sir
We either win or die
First!
We'll build a pontoon bridge over Khalkhin River within 48 hours
Second!
We'll form a special suicide unit of 50 men to demolish tanks
All officers will stand with me at the vanguard of the special unit!
Mukai!
Yes, sir!
Write up the list and have it on my desk by tomorrow
Dismissed!
Dismissed!
I'm sorry about your picture I glued it together
Take it
I have a sister like you back home
My name is Jun-shik Kim
Thank you
'Shei-shei ni'?
The sun's going down!
Hurry up, you bastards!
Stop dawdling!
Hurry up!
Work harder!
When the sun goes down, it's over!
Squad 9!
Damn slow Korean dogs!
Build this in 2 days?
He's insane!
They worked us from dawn!
Where's the food!
Stop talking about food!
You're making me hungry
Choon-bok?
What's 'Shei-shei ni'?
Learning Chinese?
Why do you keep asking?
Just tell me
It means thank you
Stop working!
Attention!
At ease
I heard Tatsuo was your marathon rival
He didn't stand a chance
Jun-shik's way better!
Come out!
Keep that in your mouth and come out!
Choon-bok Hwang!
Come out faster than a bullet, or you'll drink all the water here!
Repeat after me
I'm a barbarian
I'm a barbarian
I'm a Korean
I'm a Korean I'm a Korean
Repeat that, keep the fish in, and do squats till sundown!
Begin!
Catching fish on duty or running during bedtime!
You think this is a playground?
Make sure everything gets incinerated
Yes, sir!
No!
How dare you!
Not my running shoes!
Oh, is that so?
If you wanna run, do it barefoot
Where are you going, fool!
Damn bastards!
How many more beatings you need!
Korean dog!
No!
Gwang-choon?
This side's sinking
What?
There's a screw lose
Who unscrewed this?
It was there before
Squad 9!
Step forward
If we went on like this tomorrow, what would've happened?
From now on, the engineering unit will fix up Squad 9's area
Squad 9 will hold the faulty plank on their heads
And return to the base before sundown
The best marathoner will be leading you
The plank must be leveled!
Keep it leveled!
Noda, the bastard!
Save your breath
Just walk, Jun-shik We'll hold up the plank
Don't worry
If you hurt your knee, it's over!
Listen!
Keep it leveled!
One!
Two!
How is it?
Cool enough for you Squad 9 sluggards!
Jong-dae Lee!
Yes, sir
Jun-shik Kim!
Yes, sir
Why are they calling us this time?
Attention!
The 50 soldiers called will fight in tomorrow's attack
On a special suicide mission with me
What did he say?
Suicide?
Us?
We will carry bombs and demolish enemy tanks at dawn
Fight like Imperial soldiers and die with honor
I'll kill anyone Who dares retreat
Koreans should be honored to be included in this heroic mission
I'm not taking part in this operation
Oh, really?
For what reason?
The Korean soldiers and I didn't volunteer we cannot consent to a mission that demands death
Your permission to shoot, sir!
Dare disobey me?
All Koreans here, including our squad, think the same
I'll ask again.
Are you disobeying me?
This is insane
Execute him with the other POWs!
Before we march out tomorrow
Have fun on your last night
Stupid bastards!
Are you okay?
I'll be executed at dawn
Like this
The Japanese are evil
Korea and China are foolish
I'm not afraid to die
I'm just mad I couldn't kill more Japanese fools
If I could, I'd get more revenge
I'd kill them all!
Jun-shik?
What are you doing?
If we're gonna die like dogs, might as well save Jun-shik!
Hurry up
Hurry!
Shirai
Why her?
Pull her out!
Why?
At a time like this
It's coming!
Run!
Run!
Get down!
Jun-shik!
Let's head to the bridge and go south on Khalkin River to cross the border
Where's Min-woo?
We're the only ones going?
He's out on a job with Noda
We can't take all 100 Koreans with us
Let's hurry We don't have time
Come on
Jun-shik!
Get on

Are you okay?
I'm fine.
When did you get here?
About two months ago
I rule here
Nothing for you to worry about now
Korean dog!
Jong-dae Lee!
I didn't like the way you were talking
I'm sorry...
Thought I'd say that?
You damn Jap!
Dare call me a Korean dog?
Give me that
Still think I'm a damn soldier under you?
You stupid son of a bitch!
This isn't Kyung-sung or Nomonhan!
This is the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
I'm the colonel here!
And I'm the king!
Got that?
You got that, fool?
You got that, fool?
Got that, you damn Japs!
Colonel
Wake up, sir!
Noda
If you wanna stay alive, stay out of my sight
Hey!
So damn cold
If we don't warm him up, He'll die
Please move
Who cares?
That bastard's not even worth stomping on
I beg you.
Make room for him, please
Try saving him, then
It probably won't work
What are you doing!
We have to save the Colonel!
Mukai!
If he's a goner, bring him to the incinerator
No use watching him die Let's go
Jun-shik, have a drink
Look at that
If you get frostbitten here, you end up being firewood like him
This is the warmest place in the whole camp
Your legs are your life Take good care of 'em
I like it here No Japs calling me a Korean dog
We should go back when the war's over
I'm not
There's nothing but pulling a rickshaw there
Having a drink reminds me of home
Eun-soo's probably fine, right?
I miss her
All stand!
Starting the day without bowing towards our Emperor is contemptible
There is no exception here!
Get up!
No need.
Keep eating
It's an order!
Crazy bastard
Everyone stand!
Now!
Private Jun-shik Kim!
Get up!
Private Kim!
We're no longer your subordinates
We were unjustly dragged and forced to become Imperial soldiers
As the Soviets can't demand reform, you have no right to force us to bow
Remember
From now on, I'm not Private Jun-shik Kim but the Korean marathoner Jun-shik Kim!
Crazy fool!
You want to die!
You're the crazy one who killed hundreds of soldiers!
Commit hara-kiri like Colonel Takakura!
Bastard!
Since you have the energy to fight, guess you're not hungry enough
Grudges between a Korean and a Japanese, huh?
You got your wish
Fight till one of you dies!
Kill him, Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
One of us should've died
Today's the day
Colonel!
Kill me, Korean dog!
Kill him!
LOGGING AREA 3
Hold it up right!
Hurry up and do it!
Stop slacking off!
When did this happen?
It's okay, Jun-shik
Don't
It's okay
Hold still
Germany invaded the Soviet Union
The Soviets may speed up exchanging POWs to reinforce their army
Number 1277!
He's one of your men
Anton!
Go catch him!
Yes, sir!
It's time for frostbite examination
Where's Choon-bok?
Take him away
Let me go!
Gwang-choon!
No!
No!
Drag him out!
I'm fine!
I can still work, sir!
Tell 'em Jun-shik!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Help!
Gwang-choon!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Jun-shik!
Help!
Let go!
Gwang-choon!
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You're not hiding in here, are you?
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You son of a bitch!
Shut up!
Come out, pal!
Come out!
You wanna die?
I was starving
Put the bread down and come out now
What do we do?
Who's there?
How dare you steal, you bastard!
He's the one
He's the thief!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
Please Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
A rat sneaked into our food storage today
Luckily we caught him, thanks to comrade Anton
As you know, stealing is punishable by death
Jong-dae!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
I'm scared!
Tell 'em I didn't eat the bread!
Jong-dae!
Execute him!
Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Make it back home alive!
Is it because of this?
This is more important than a friend's life?
This is who you really are?
Call yourself human?
Yeah, I'm not human
I'm not the Jong-dae you know!
I'm Anton!
I'm Anton, you bastard!
Call me Anton from now on!
Got that!
How long do you think this armband will protect you?
How could you do that to Choon-bok?
What do you know?
You don't know anything!
Shut up and stay out of my life
Do you know that Gwang-choon died?
He's probably nothing but ashes by now
If you pull that again in front of them, I'll kill you
Your emperor abandoned you
How dare you speak of our Emperor!
POW repatriation has been denied
We showed mercy on you, but the Japanese refused
They're battling Americans in the Pacific and have no interest in you
You expect me to believe that?
Imperial soldiers are sons of the Emperor
A father does not abandon his son
That's what you want to believe
You naive, poor, abandoned son
You will also face death in the incinerator here
It's a Kokeshi
Is your hometown Yamagata?
You're good
You know, sir?
Have you been there?
My grandfather took me there when I was young
It's a beautiful place
I grew up there my whole life
My family ran a carpentry shop for generations
When I go back, I want to be a great carpenter like my father
Do you know why I chose to be your adjutant for Nomonhan, sir?
Because I saw your firm conviction for our country in your eyes
Conviction
Son of a bitch!
Tsukamoto!
You okay?
Wake up!
I go easy on you, you cripple, and for what!
Jong-dae!
We're doing our best, too!
Your best?
I'll show you my best in beating!
You son of a bitch!
You call that your best!
You bastards!
This is the best!
Jong-dae!
It's Anton, fool!
He's dead
Lieutenant!
What?
Never seen a man die before?
Get back to work, you bastards!
Work, you fools!
Get back to work now!
You fools never listen!
Damn Jap!
How dare you!
Stop it!
I told you to stay out of my way!
Dam Jap!
I gotta beat it into your head?
You bastards!
Damn Jap!
You son of bitch!
Jong-dae Lee!
Bastards!
Back to your posts!
There is no mercy for those who started the riot!
Begin the executions!
It's an urgent telegram, sir
Grab a uniform!
Change into now!
Germany has declared war against us
Comrade Stalin has given you too, your final calling
The choice is yours
Those who want to convert may wear Soviet army uniforms
Go get the uniforms!
Hurry!
Yes, sir
Hurry up and put it on!
Anton
This is a great opportunity for you
I hope you come back victorious
Long live the Soviet Union!
Good luck!
Comrade!
Please give them a chance, too
Let them go!
Thank you, sir!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurry up and put it on!
Hasegawa Tatsuo
This is your last chance
I'll say it one more time Put it on
Let's give it a good shot
It's better than freezing to death
Right, Jun-shik?
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Bastards
The Soviet army uniform suits our colonel so well, doesn't it?
DECEMBER, 1941 ZHEDOVSK, SOVIET UNION
Get off!
Get off, now!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Get off!
Move it!
This will be a grave for the Germans' today!
Thank you, sir!
Show the cowardly Germans the valor of the Soviet army!
It's mine!
Charge!
Attack!
Charge!
Charge!
Attack!
Charge!
Fire!
Charge!
Let go, you bastard!
What?
You wanna live, too?
I do, too!
I'm not dying here!
You die!
You die!
Tatsuo!
Move it!
Move it!
Charge!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Damn bastards!
No bullets!
Jong-dae!
Let's run!
This is dying like dogs!
It may be for you, but not me!
Charge!
You don't have any more bullets!
Charge!
Charge!
There is no retreat!
Jong-dae!
Come back!
Don't run away!
Come back!
There is no retreat!
Charge!
Charge!
Attack!
There is no retreat!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
What's with my goddamned life
Shit, I wanted to live it up
I'm so sorry, Jun-shik
Jong-dae
I want to see Eun-soo
I miss Eun-soo
Jun-shik
No, Jun-shik
Stay right here
Don't go out there
Charge!
There is no retreat!
I'll kill anyone who tries to run!
Charge ahead!
Attack!
Fools!
Attack!
Don't show your back to the enemy!
Charge!
Attack!
You'll need it to make it over the mountains
Where do you plan to go?
To German territory
I hope we're going the right way
I hope the snow stops
Even if we make it to German territory it won't be easy to make it back home
You don't have to come, if you don't want to
Back then
Why didn't you kill me?
Tatsuo!
Wake up!
I'll go find some medicine
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
I'll be right back
Help!
Help me!
I'm a Japanese soldier My friend's in danger
What's he saying?
I'm a Japanese soldier We're on the same side!
Take him away!
I'm a Japanese soldier, not a POW!
Let go!
You bastard!
Help me!
A man is dying!
Please!
Take him away, now!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Search every corner
You go up that way I'll go this way
3 YEARS LATER
There's word that the Allied Forces will invade Nord-Pas-de-Calais
Then we hit the jackpot getting stationed in Normandy
If Germany loses, aren't we all dead anyways?
Think they'll take us back?
We'd be lucky if they don't call us traitors and shoot us
That's why we should run away
You said you'll run for 2 years now
I'm going for sure this time
I heard from a man in another unit
There's a secret merchant ship to Jamaica at Cherbourg Harbor
How'll you get there?
Swim?
If you get caught trying to run, you'll be shot!
Wanna make a bet?
I bet 50 marks you can't run away
Bet 100 marks, stupid
Bet even your boots, you pig
May, 1944, NORMANDY, FRANCE will build additional defense walls and defense lines in the Atlantic
From tomorrow, you will build defense walls on the shore with unit 795
Our job is to build the defense encampment on Normandy hill
March forward!
Hurry up!
Squad 3!
Unit 2!
Go to barracks 14!
HEY
Shouldn't you give up looking for your Korean friend?
You're the only Asian here
That guy's so lucky
He gets to go in and out of base at will
Tatsuo!
Aren't you coming in?
Let's go
Go ahead I'll rest here for a sec
See ya later, then
I thought you might be dead
But you're here in the Eastern battalion
When did you come to Normandy?
Jun-shik?
Did you say something?
Can you repeat it?
Tatsuo!
It's more comfortable this way
I can't hear gunshots or screams
It's over
Let's play soccer
Tatsuo!
We're going to play against Squad 8!
Man, they're fast
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I lost cuz my rubber shoes fell off,
But I was happy to have a new running mate
We came much too far
How long will it take to run home from here?
More than a year, right?
We know the Allied forces will attack Nord-Pas-de-Calais
The Eastern battalion will all be sent to Nord-Pas-de-Calais!
You will all be reborn as true German soldiers!
Pack up your gear
We move out at 09:00 hours tomorrow!
Dismissed!
We're all dead I thought we'd be safe in Normandy
What's going on?
We're being transferred
It's nothing
Sending us to battle but feeding us this rubbish
I thought we'd get wine and steak when we came to France
Damn
Karim
I'm going to Cherbourg at dawn
Are you crazy?
I got the contact info from Roman
Is Roman going?
That liar
How will you get there?
The food truck always leaves at dawn
We gotta go when you're on watch
Think it over If you get caught, you're dead
Is it cuz of your friend?
Fine
I'll see you at dawn
We're not going to Nord-Pas-de-Calais
We're going to Cherbourg
Cherbourg?
A ship there will take us home
Jun-shik
Let's go home where your sister and father are
Can we really make it home?
We could get killed on the way
Still, we can't die here
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Tatsuo!
Those aren't planes, are they?
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Stay there!
I'll come to you!
Wait for me!
Hurry!
It's an attack!
Prepare for battle!
The Allied Forces have attacked!
To your battle positions!
Hurry and grab the machine gun!
Grab it!
Everyone to your battle positions!
Move it!
Move it!
Fire!
Fire!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Are you okay?
Let's get out of here, now!
Grab the machine gun!
Now!
Hurry up, you fools!
Can't you see the enemy!
Reload and fire, now!
Allied forces attacked!
Send re-enforcements!
Let's run for it
Don't lag behind
You'll be watching my back as you run
Are you okay?
This won't kill me Let's go!
Jun-shik
Come on!
We have to get home!
Tatsuo
Are you okay?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
You're Jun-shik Kim from now on
If you say you're Japanese, they might kill you
Say you were dragged here and forced into the Eastern battalion
Jun-shik!
Wake up!
I have no regrets
Though I couldn't achieve my dream
You can't go like this!
Let's go home and run together!
Jun-shik
I wanted to run again when I go back home
Promise you'll make it back alive
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I was happy to have a new running mate
Ready, go!
Isn't the air nice, Tatsuo?
You'll get used to it here soon
I'm sure you'll make good friends here
It's Jun-shik!
I'm faster than a car!
Grandpa!
You show the signs of a great imperial soldier already
Welcome, my boy
How've you been, Father?
Greet them
He's the new, young master
Jun-shik Kim, sir
I'm Eun-soo Kim, sir
Great, Tatsuo
You have a new friend your age
Tatsuo runs well.
Like you
My brother's the best runner in Kyung-sung, sir
I'm the best in Tokyo
No match for a country boy
Wanna race me?
Ready
Go!
Hasegawa beat Korea's Jun-shik Kim in the 4th high school marathons!
Korea's son, Jun-shik Kim, beat Hasegawa Tatsuo and won!
"HASEGAWA TATSUO WINS NATIONAL MARATHONS AGAIN!"
"KIM JUN-SHIK WINS!"
Congratulations
Jun-shik Kim, the light of Korean marathon
Hasegawa Tatsuo, the star of Japanese marathon wins again
Good job chasing behind me
Must be your damn lucky day
Let's applaud Hasegawa Tatsuo who won the national high school marathon and brought great honor to Imperial Japan
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Long live...
This is my grandson, Tatsuo
You must be very proud
I expect a lot from you
Thank you
It's a gift from the Japanese Minister of Defense
Open it
Yes, sir
Give me that!
Get away!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
- Father!
-Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Do something!
Father, please!
Do something!
You're a doctor who saves lives!
Why aren't you doing anything?
- You killed him!
-No
You killed him!
No
Bring my grandfather back!
Let go!
He didn't kill anyone!
You bastards killed him!
Jun-shik!
Bring my grandfather back!
No!
- Daddy!
-No!
I didn't do it!
Daddy!
- Jun-shik!
-Daddy!
Father!
Bring my grandfather back!
Father!
Jun-shik
Bring my grandfather back!
Let Go!
- Father!
Father
-Daddy...
Daddy
Don't show your face around here again
Or I might kill you
Korea's hero, Ki-jung Sohn won an Olympic gold medal!
Rejoice!
MAY, 1938, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Why do you have sandbags strapped on?
Are you a marathon runner?
Korea's luck in the marathon stops with Ki-jung Sohn
A Korean man will never be an Olympic victor again
Koreans are banned from Olympics 'cause Sohn covered the Japanese flag?
If you were a bomb,
I'd run straight into the Athletics Association
Marathon running is a science demanding concentration and fighting spirit
I'll prove it once and for all at the Olympic tryouts
Can you go any faster?
You might regret it
I'll pay double if you get there in 30 minutes
Triple for 20 minutes
Hold on tight
Your victory in the tryouts is a given
What is your goal in the Olympics?
I'll win the gold and set a new record
- What a laugh?
-In honor of our great empire!
Look out!
Look out!
Let's go!
Coming through!
Move!
Out of the way!
To a marathon gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics!
- Cheers!
-Cheers!
You're quite the runner
Here you are
Double would've been fine
Opportunities come to those who don't give up
Jun-shik Kim
Jun-shik!
Are you okay?
Isn't that...
Are you all so happy over half of a race?
I'm Ki-jung Sohn
Ki-jung Sohn's in Japan
Wanna bet?
If I win, I get to marry your sister
Hurry
You say Japan and Korea are one yet you ban Koreans from tryouts?
Are you claiming the Athletics Association is unjust?
Your comment, Mr. Chairman?
The board has decided
If a Japanese runner will win anyways, what's the problem?
It'll be boring for Hasegawa without Jun-shik Kim
I think Jun-shik Kim shouldn't be in the discussion
See!
Jun-shik Kim?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim, what have you been up to?
What are your thoughts on the ban on Korean runners?
Are you still training?
How much do you train each day?
Your comments, please
Mr. Hasegawa?
Are you confident you'll win even if Jun-shik Kim enters?
You think he stands a chance against me?
But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better than yours?
That was in the past
You think a mere rickshaw driver can beat a well-trained marathoner?
If you could enter, are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?
How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?
I'd be grateful just to enter the race
Here is your acceptance letter from Berlin Medical University
Sign it
The marathon is more important to me than my studies
This is the most important period in your life
Focus on your studies
Our men are sacrificing their lives to build a Greater East Asia
I don't want to be a coward who runs away from war
War is futile
You are insulting Grandfather
Tatsuo, watch what you say
Think of the people before your country
That's the way of a doctor
Then I must treat the Korean people who killed my grandfather?
Even if it kills me, I'll never do that
The picture is missing from the frame in my room
Jong-dae!
Why you
Why would someone steal a picture of all things?
It should be around somewhere
Anyway, I hope you can enter the tryouts
Father will be so happy
Don't get your hopes up
Can't trust the Japs
Get more firewood.
The fire's dying
Please?
It's so pretty
How do I look?
Eun-soo
I think you're the prettiest girl in all of Asia
"OLYMPIC TRYOUTS ENTRY FORM"
Please win and bring hope to Korea again
I can really enter the race?
Show them how scary a mere rickshaw driver can be!
Jun-shik
Listen carefully
The man in front of Jun-shik is Ki-jung Sohn
Then, you must be holding the Olympic tryouts entry form
If I'm right, hold it up high!
Yes!
Let me see!
Yes!
Sir!
Sir!
Jun-shik!
Min-woo!
Everyone!
Korea's best marathoner, Jun-shik Kim, will run the marathon again!
Hurray for Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik Kim!
Get the rice cake kings ate!
Rice cakes here!
Here you are
Father picked it out himself
The best pair there is
Promise you'll win the race today?
Tatsuo
Your father will be here soon!
Look
Let's relieve all our Korean folks' heartaches today!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik Kim!
Act according to the plans.
Runners to the starting line!
You can do it!
And they're off!
Tatsuo!
Go, Jun-shik
Tatsuo, go get 'em!
Hasegawa!
Faster!
Faster!
Jun-shik, you're halfway there!
Don't mind Jun-shik Kim
Hasegawa!
Spurt ahead!
Spurt ahead!
Hasegawa!
The runners will come into the stadium any minute!
Why are you so late?
A surgery took long
What a tense moment!
There!
The runners can be finally seen!
Who is the first runner coming in?
Who will it be?
As expected, it's Hasegawa with Kimura behind him!
What?
There's another runner!
It's Jun-shik Kim!
You can do it
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim!
Go, Jun-shik!
Kimura!
Kimura!
Hey!
What's that bastard doing!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
The rickshaw won!
Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
The last runner is coming in!
It's a dream come true!
The medals will be awarded soon
I knew you could do it!
Ladies and gentlemen, the results will now be announced
The winner of All Japan Olympic Marathon Tryouts is
Hasegawa Tatsuo!
Second is number 13, Ando!
Third is number 18, Kimura!
Will the three runners come up to the victory stand?
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura
Please come to the victory stand
- Jun-shik Kim was first!
- What's he saying?
Jun-shik Kim!
Spectators, please calm down and be seated
Jun-shik Kim has been disqualified for blocking Kimura's way
Disqualified?
How!
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
Is this why you let me enter?
Go back.
Didn't you hear you've been disqualified?
You should've run fair and square
Fair and square?
Crazy bastards
Try Saying it again!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Damn bastards!
Damn bastards!
Jong-dae!
Hasegawa!
Please come up to the victory stand, immediately!
The winner of the Olympic tryouts is Jun-shik Kim!
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura!
Please come up, immediately!
You bastards cheated first!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
This court has decided on the following sentence
Based on section 4 of the legal code, all accomplices of the riot will become Imperial soldiers and swear allegiance to the Emperor
Mother!
Mother!
I didn't do anything!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Eun-soo!
Jun-shik!
Father!
Father!
Jun-shik!
Soldiers must behave with decorum
Stop mumbling!
Soldiers must always improve their battle skills
I don't believe this
Soldiers must always improve their battle skills
Soldiers must serve with utmost loyalty
Soldiers must always be frugal
Frugal...
"JULY, 1939, NOMONHAN, MONGOLIAN BORDERLAND"
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
That Way!
Concentrate!
Get up there!
Retreat!
Min-woo!
You okay?
It's me, Jun-shik
Wake up!
Shit.
I should've fought for independence instead
Who would've guessed we'd end up fighting for the Japs here?
Our damn fortunes
I'm starving to death
You're hungry 24 hours a day
Grow up will you?
Hey!
Hurry up!
Lazy Korean fools!
Yes, sir
Let's hurry
Hope you get shot down dead
He's really dead?
- Choon-bok!
Your butt!
-What?
Where's it coming from?
I almost got my head blown off
The broken wall at 1 o'clock
I heard the 1st regiment got attacked, too.
It's him
Just our damn luck
Jong-dae!
Cover me
No!
Stay back, Jun-shik!
Cover him!
Choon-bok!
Cover him!
Are you okay Jun-shik?
It's great you shot down just Japs, but Noda's gonna kill us
She killed so many
Hey!
Don't hog all the food!
Give me some
Don't slobber over it!
Give me some!
This is you?
You keep eating.
I'll look at this
Fine, I'll show you.
Let me see first
Not that sexy
She's crying
Cuz you took her picture
No, it's cuz you ate all her beef jerky
Fools.
Why'd you make her cry?
The bullets happened to swerve and hit only Japanese soldiers?
Did the bitch smell your Kimchi breath?
Talk, you fools!
Speak, you bastards!
Who sent you here!
Say it!
I'm Shirai from Hailaer
You raped my mother before my father, and raped me, too
Listen!
There are many like me in China
China will never lose to you!
I will never forgive!
Never!
Tell me!
Why did the bullets fly past you Korean rubbish!
Speak, you bastards!
Damn it!
Stop it!
I said no speaking Korean!
Enough
That won't bring back the dead!
Go back to your work places
What's all this?
Who's coming?
Colonel
I'm Colonel Takakura
Company, halt!
Attention!
What?
Why's that bastard here?
Colonel Hasegawa, what brings you here?
Private Takakura ever drive past honorable Imperial soldiers' corpses?
Mukai!
Yes, sir
First!
For shamefully ordering a retreat, you're demoted to private as of today
Second
Private Takakura will prove loyalty to our Emperor and commit hara-kiri!
Be thankful our Emperor granted you an honorable death!
Long live our Emperor!
Handle the deceased with due respect
Yes, sir
Remember, after feeding off corpses, crows can come and gouge out your eyes
I'm Hasegawa Tatsuo
I came here to demolish
Soviet tanks!
I'll show them true power of the Imperial army!
When out of bullets, Imperial soldiers must charge with bayonets!
If bayonets are broken, we must fight with bare hands!
Imperial soldiers do not leave the battlefield till death!
Understood!
Yes, sir
We either win or die
First!
We'll build a pontoon bridge over Khalkhin River within 48 hours
Second!
We'll form a special suicide unit of 50 men to demolish tanks
All officers will stand with me at the vanguard of the special unit!
Mukai!
Yes, sir!
Write up the list and have it on my desk by tomorrow
Dismissed!
Dismissed!
I'm sorry about your picture
I glued it together
Take it
I have a sister like you back home
My name is Jun-shik Kim
Thank you
"Shei-shei ni"?
The sun's going down!
Hurry up, you bastards!
Stop dawdling!
Hurry up!
Work harder!
When the sun goes down, it's over!
Squad 9!
Damn slow Korean dogs!
Build this in 2 days?
He's insane!
They worked us from dawn!
Where's the food!
Stop talking about food!
You're making me hungry
Choon-bok?
What's "Shei-shei ni"?
Learning Chinese?
Why do you keep asking?
Just tell me
It means thank you
Stop working!
Attention!
At ease
I heard Tatsuo was your marathon rival
He didn't stand a chance
Jun-shik's way better!
Come out!
Keep that in your mouth and come out!
Choon-bok Hwang!
Come out faster than a bullet, or you'll drink all the water here!
Repeat after me
I'm a barbarian
I'm a Korean
Repeat that, keep the fish in, and do squats till sundown!
Begin!
Catching fish on duty or running during bedtime!
You think this is a playground?
Make sure everything gets incinerated
Yes, sir!
No!
How dare you!
Not my running shoes!
Oh, is that so?
If you wanna run, do it barefoot
Where are you going, fool!
Damn bastards!
How many more beatings you need!
Korean dog!
No!
Gwang-choon?
This side's sinking
What?
There's a screw lose
Who unscrewed this?
It was there before
Squad 9!
Step forward
If we went on like this tomorrow, what would've happened?
From now on, the engineering unit will fix up Squad 9's area
Squad 9 will hold the faulty plank on their heads
And return to the base before sundown
The best marathoner will be leading you
The plank must be leveled!
Keep it leveled!
Noda, the bastard!
Save your breath
Just walk, Jun-shik We'll hold up the plank
Don't worry
If you hurt your knee, it's over!
Listen!
Keep it leveled!
One!
Two!
How is it?
Cool enough for you
Squad 9 Sluggards!
John Yushe.
Yes sir.
Yueh Sanchin.
Yes sir.
Jong-dae Lee!
Yes, sir
Jun-shik Kim!
Yes, sir
Why're they calling us this time?
Attention!
The 50 soldiers called will fight in tomorrow's attack
On a special suicide mission with me
What did he say?
Suicide?
Us?
We will carry bombs and demolish enemy tanks at dawn
Fight like Imperial soldiers and die with honor
I'll kill anyone.
Who dares retreat
Koreans should be honored to be included in this heroic mission
I'm not taking part in this operation
Oh, really?
For what reason?
The Korean soldiers and I didn't volunteer we cannot consent to a mission that demands death
Your permission to shoot, sir!
Dare disobey me?
All Koreans here, including our squad, think the same
I'll ask again
Are you disobeying me?
This is insane
Execute him with the other POWs!
Before we march out tomorrow
Have fun on your last night
Stupid bastards!
Are you okay?
I'll be executed at dawn
Like this
The Japanese are evil
Korea and China are foolish
I'm not afraid to die
I'm just mad I couldn't kill more Japanese fools
If I could, I'd get more revenge
I'd kill them all!
What are you doing?
If we're gonna die like dogs, might as well save Jun-shik!
Hurry UP
Hurry!
Shirai
Why her?
Pull her out!
Why?
At a time like this
It's coming!
Run!
Get down!
Jun-shik!
Let's head to the bridge and go south on Khalkin River to cross the border
Where's Min-woo?
We're the only ones going?
He's out on a job with Noda
We can't take all 100 Koreans with us
Let's hurry
We don't have time.
Come on.
Jun-shik!
Get on
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
What's that?
It's an attack!
We could've gotten killed, too
Damn Japs!
Good for them!
Let's go!
Come on,
Jun-shik!
Hurry up!
What's going on?
Soviet tanks are coming!
Grab the oar!
Tanks?
Get on!
Jun-shik!
The tanks are coming!
Get on!
Go ahead without me
What did you say?
What the hell are you doing!
Crazy?
Get on, Jun-shik!
Come on!
What the hell are you doing!
Come with us!
Let's all survive and meet again!
Jun-shik!
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Just get on!
If you go back, you're dead, too!
Come back!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Shirai!
Watch out!
Watch out!
Shirai is an ace shooter
Shirai!
Shirai!
Shirai!
Shirai!
Shirai!
Hurry.
Go save your friends
Thank you.
Stop!
Don't come!
Stop!
Stop!
It's an attack!
Don't come!
It's an attack, sir!
Get ready for battle!
Block off the front with trucks!
Move the trucks up front!
The rest to the first line of defense!
To the first line of defense!
Defend the first line of defense!
To the first line of defense!
Charge!
Scatter!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live our Emperor!
Die bravely like a special suicide unit member!
You son of a bitch!
Min-woo!
It's okay
You go and die bravely!
Min-woo!
Help me
Min-woo
Min-woo
Fools!
Imperial soldier don't retreat!
How dare you run away!
Charge!
Don't show your back to the enemy!
Don't back away!
Charge!
Charge!
Don't back down!
Don't run!
Fight!
Charge!
Want to get everyone killed?
If you want to die, do it alone!
We're not dying like dogs!
Order the retreat!
Imperial soldiers must charge ahead even as ghosts!
Enough with the Imperial soldiers!
Order the retreat!
Colonel!
Here's your chance to die honorably as an Imperial soldier!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Where are we going?
Can we make it back home?
Hurry UP!
Move it!
You bastards!
"CHITA"
"OMSK"
"PERM"
"FEBRUARY, 1940, KUNGURSK, SOVIET UNION PRISONER OF WAR CAMP"
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
As proof you'll carry out the oath
The leader of you Japanese dogs,
Hasegawa Tatsuo, must step on your national flag
We're not labors or criminals, but proud Imperial soldiers!
You have no right to force us to reform!
Imperial Japan will not abandon you!
Keep your dignity till the day you return and fight with honor!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Hurry up!
Move it!
Walk in a line!
Colonel!
Don't fall asleep, sir!
Shut up, fool!
Keep moving!
Hurry up!
You yellow bastards!
You slow sluggards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Hurry!
Line up, you bastards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Choon-bok!
Gwang-choon!
- Jun-shik!
-Jun-shik!
I thought you were dead!
What a relief you're all alive
Where's Jong-dae?
Jong-dae's here, but
Attention!
This is Anton, your supervisor
I'm Anton
If Area 3 doesn't shape up, it'll be hard to stay alive here
Officers or soldiers,
I won't tolerate anyone slacking on the job!
Each group leader, take 20 new POWs and go to your work areas!
Go!
Jong-dae!
Jun-shik!
You're alive!
I was so worried I'd never see you again
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
When did you get here?
About two months ago
I rule here
Nothing for you to worry about now
Korean dog!
Jong-dae Lee!
I didn't like the way you were talking
I'm sorry...
Thought I'd say that?
You damn Jap!
Dare call me a Korean dog?
Give me that
Still think I'm a damn soldier under you?
You stupid son of a bitch!
This isn't Kyung-sung or Nomonhan!
This is the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
I'm the colonel here!
And I'm the king!
You got that, fool?
You got that, fool?
Got that, you damn Japs!
Colonel
Wake up, sir!
Noda
If you wanna stay alive, stay out of my sight
Hey!
So damn cold
If we don't warm him up, He'll die
Please move
Who cares?
That bastard's not even worth stomping on
I beg you
Make room for him, please
Try saving him, then It probably won't work
What are you doing!
We have to save the Colonel!
Mukai!
if he's a goner, bring him to the incinerator
No use watching him die Let's go
Jun-shik, have a drink
Look at that
If you get frostbitten here, you end up being firewood like him
This is the warmest place in the whole camp
Your legs are your life Take good care of 'em
I like it here
No Japs calling me a Korean dog
We should go back when the war's over
I'm not
There's nothing but pulling a rickshaw there
Having a drink reminds me of home
Eun-sods probably fine, right?
I miss her
All stand!
Starting the day without bowing towards our Emperor is contemptible
There is no exception here!
Get up!
No need.
Keep eating
It's an order!
Crazy bastard
Everyone stand!
Now!
Private Jun-shik Kim!
Get up!
Private Kim!
We're no longer your subordinates
We were unjustly dragged and forced to become Imperial soldiers
As the Soviets can't demand reform, you have no right to force us to bow
Remember
From now on, I'm not Private Jun-shik Kim but the Korean marathoner Jun-shik Kim!
Crazy fool!
You want to die!
You're the crazy one who killed hundreds of soldiers!
Commit hara-kiri like Colonel Takakura!
Bastard!
Since you have the energy to fight, guess you're not hungry enough
Grudges between a Korean and a Japanese, huh?
You got your wish
Fight till one of you dies!
Kill him, Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
One of us should've died
Today's the day
Colonel!
The knife, sir!
Colonel!
Colonel!
Jun-shik!
The knife!
Kill me, Korean dog!
Kill him!
Hold it up right!
Hurry up and do it!
Stop slacking off!
When did this happen?
It's okay, Jun-shik
Don't
It's okay
Hold still
Germany invaded the Soviet Union
The Soviets may speed up exchanging POWs to reinforce their army
Number 1277!
He's one of your men
Anton!
Go catch him!
Yes, sir!
It's time for frostbite examination
Where's Choon-bok?
Take him away
Gwang-choon!
NO!
No!
Drag him out!
Let's go!
I'm fine!
I can still work, sir!
Tell 'em Jun-shik!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
- I want to live, Jun-shik!
- Gwang-choon!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Lets Go!
Help!
Gwang-choon!
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You're not hiding in here, are you?
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
- You son of a bitch!
-Shut up!
Come out, pal!
Come out!
You wanna die?
I was starving
Put the bread down and come out now
What do we do?
What do we do?
Who's there?
How dare you steal, you bastard!
He's the one
- He's the thief!
- What are you doing?
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
Please Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
A rat sneaked into our food storage today
Luckily we caught him, thanks to comrade Anton
As you know, stealing is punishable by death
Jong-dae!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
I'm scared!
Tell 'em I didn't eat the bread!
Execute him!
Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Make it back home alive!
Is it because of this?
This is more important than a friend's life?
This is who you really are?
Call yourself human?
Yeah, I'm not human
I'm not the Jong-dae you know!
I'm Anton!
I'm Anton, you bastard!
Call me Anton from now on!
Got that!
How long do you think this armband will protect you?
How could you do that to Choon-bok?
What do you know?
You don't know anything!
Shut up and stay out of my life
Do you know that Gwang-choon died?
He's probably nothing, but ashes by now
If you pull that again in front of them, I'll kill you
Your emperor abandoned you
How dare you speak of our Emperor!
POW repatriation has been denied
We showed mercy on you, but the Japanese refused
They're battling Americans in the Pacific and have no interest in you
You expect me to believe that?
Imperial soldiers are sons of the Emperor
A father does not abandon his son
That's what you want to believe
You naive, poor, abandoned son
You will also face death in the incinerator here
It's a Kokeshi
Is your hometown Yamagata?
You're good
You know, sir?
Have you been there?
My grandfather took me there when I was young
It's a beautiful place
I grew up there my whole life
My family ran a carpentry shop for generations
When I go back,
I want to be a great carpenter like my father
Do you know why I chose to be your adjutant for Nomonhan, sir?
Because I saw your firm conviction for our country in your eyes
Conviction
Look out!
Son of a bitch!
Tsukamoto!
You okay?
Wake up!
I go easy on you, you cripple, and for what!
Jong-dae!
We're doing our best, too!
Your best?
I'll show you my best in beating!
You son of a bitch!
You call that your best!
You bastards!
This is the best!
Jong-dae Lee!
It's Anton, fool!
He's dead
Lieutenant!
What?
Never seen a man die before?
Get back to work, you bastards!
Work, you fools!
Get back to work now!
You fools never listen!
Damn Jap!
How dare you!
Stop it!
I told you to stay out of my way!
Damn Jap!
I gotta beat it into your head?
You bastards!
Damn Jap!
You son of bitch!
Kill 'em!
Bastards!
Back to your posts!
Stop!
You bastards!
There is no mercy for those who started the riot!
Begin the executions!
It's an urgent telegram, sir
Grab a uniform!
Change into now!
Germany has declared war against us
Comrade Stalin has given you too, your final calling
The choice is yours
Those who want to convert may wear Soviet army uniforms
- Go get the uniforms!
Hurry!
-Yes, sir
Hurry up and put it on!
Anton
This is a great opportunity for you
I hope you come back victorious
Long live the Soviet Union!
Good luck!
Comrade!
Please give them a chance, too
Let them go!
Thank you, sir!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurry up and put it on!
Hasegawa Tatsuo This is your last chance
I'll say it one more time.
Put it on.
Let's give it a good shot
It's better than freezing to death
Right, Jun-shik?
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Bastards
The Soviet army uniform suits our colonel so well, doesn't it?
"DECEMBER, 1941 ZHEDOVSK, SOVIET UNION"
Get off!
Get off, now!
Get off!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Get off!
Move it!
This will be a grave for the Germans' today!
Thank you, sir!
Show the cowardly Germans the valor of the Soviet army!
It's mine!
You are proud Soviet soldiers!
Charge!

I'm not dying here!
You die!

Tatsuo!
Move it!
Move it!
Charge!
Charge!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Damn bastards!
No bullets!
Jong-dae!
Let's run!
This is dying like dogs!
It may be for you, but not me!
Charge!
You don't have any more bullets!
Charge!

Jong-dae!
Stop!

What's with my goddamned life
Shit, I wanted to live it up
I'm so sorry, Jun-shik
Jong-dae
I want to see Eun-soo
I miss Eun-soo
Jun-shik
No, Jun-shik
Stay right here
Don't go out there
Charge!
There is no retreat!
I'll kill anyone who tries to run!
Charge ahead!
Attack!
Fools!
Attack!
Imperial soldier don't retreat!
Charge!
Attack!
You'll need it to make it over the mountains
Where do you plan to go?
To German territory
I hope we're going the right way
I hope the snow stops
Even if we make it to German territory it won't be easy to make it back home
You don't have to come, if you don't want to
Back then
Why didn't you kill me?
Tatsuo!
Wake up!
I'll go find some medicine kim...
Jun-shik kim
I'll be right back
Help!
Help me!
Help me!
I'm a Japanese soldier
My friend's in danger
What's he saying?
I'm a Japanese soldier
We're on the same side!
Take him away!
I'm a Japanese soldier, not a POW!
Lets Go!
You bastard!
Help me!
A man is dying!
Please!
Take him away, now!
Let go!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Lets Go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Search every corner
You go up that way
"3 YEARS LATER"
There's word that the Allied Forces will invade Nord-Pas-de-Calais
Then we hit the jackpot getting stationed in Normandy
If Germany loses, aren't we all dead anyways?
Think they'll take us back?
We'd be lucky if they don't call us traitors and shoot us
That's why we should run away
You said you'll run for 2 years now
I'm going for sure this time
I heard from a man in another unit
There's a secret merchant ship to Jamaica at Cherbourg Harbor
How'll you get there?
Swim?
If you get caught trying to run, you'll be shot!
Wanna make a bet?
I bet 50 marks you can't run away
Bet 100 marks, stupid
Bet even your boots, you pig
"May, 1944, NORMANDY, FRANCE"
Our battalion will build additional defense walls and defense lines in the Atlantic
From tomorrow, you will build defense walls on the shore with unit 795
Our job is to build the defense encampment on Normandy hill
March forward!
Hurry up!
Squad 3!
Unit 2!
Go to barracks 14!
Hey
Shouldn't you give up looking for your Korean friend?
You're the only Asian here
That guy's so lucky
He gets to go in and out of base at will
Tatsuo!
Aren't you coming in?
Let's go
Go ahead, I'll rest here for a sec
See ya later, then
I thought you might be dead
But you're here in the Eastern battalion
When did you come to Normandy?
Jun-shik?
Did you say something?
Can you repeat it?
Tatsuo!
It's more comfortable this way
I can't hear gunshots or screams
It's over
Let's play soccer
Tatsuo!
We're going to play against Squad 8!
Man, they're fast
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in I lost cuz my rubber shoes fell off,
But I was happy to have a new running mate
We came much too far
How long will it take to run home from here?
More than a year, right?
We know the Allied forces will attack Nord-Pas-de-Calais
The Eastern battalion will all be sent to Nord-Pas-de-Calais!
You will all be reborn as true German soldiers!
Pack up your gear
We move out at 09:00 hours tomorrow!
Dismissed!
We're all dead I thought we'd be safe in Normandy
What's going on?
We're being transferred
It's nothing
Sending us to battle but feeding us this rubbish
I thought we'd get wine and steak when we came to France
Damn
Karim
I'm going to Cherbourg at dawn
Are you crazy?
I got the contact info from Roman
Is Roman going?
That liar
How will you get there?
The food truck always leaves at dawn
We gotta go when you're on watch
Think it over
If you get caught, you're dead
Is it cuz of your friend?
Fine
I'll see you at dawn
We're not going to Nord-Pas-de-Calais
We're going to Cherbourg
Cherbourg?
A ship there will take us home
Jun-shik
Let's go home where your sister and father are
Can we really make it home?
We could get killed on the way
Still, we can't die here
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Tatsuo!
Those aren't planes, are they?
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!

Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Stay there!
I'll come to you!
Wait for me!
Hurry!
It's an attack!
Prepare for battle!
All units to battle positions!
The Allied Forces have attacked!
To your battle positions!
Hurry and grab the machine gun!
Grab it!
Everyone to your battle positions!
Move it!
Move it!
Fire!
Fire!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Are you okay?
Let's get out of here, now!
Grab the machine gun!
Now!
Hurry up, you fools!
Can't you see the enemy!
Reload and fire, now!
Allied forces attacked!
Send re-enforcements!
Damn it
Let's run for it
Don't lag behind
You'll be watching my back as you run
Are you okay?
This won't kill me
Let's go!
Jun-shik
Come on!
We have to get home!
Tatsuo
Are you okay?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
You're Jun-shik Kim from now on
If you say you're Japanese, they might kill you
Say you were dragged here and forced into the Eastern battalion
Jun-shik!
Wake up!
I have no regrets
Though I couldn't achieve my dream
You can't go like this!
Let's go home and run together!
Jun-shik
I wanted to run again when I go back home
Promise you'll make it back alive...
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I was happy to have a new running mate

Isn't the air nice, Tatsuo?
You'll get used to it here soon
I'm sure you'll make good friends here
It's Jun-shik!
I'm faster than a car!
Grandpa!
You show the signs of a great imperial soldier already
Welcome, my boy
How've you been, Father?
Greet them
He's the new, young master
Jun-shik Kim, sir
I'm Eun-soo Kim, sir
Great, Tatsuo
You have a new friend your age
Tatsuo runs well.
Like you
My brother's the best runner in Kyung-sung, sir
I'm the best in Tokyo
No match for a country boy
Wanna race me?
Ready
Go!
Hasegawa beat Korea's Jun-shik Kim in the 4th high school marathons!
Korea's son, Jun-shik Kim, beat Hasegawa Tatsuo and won!
"HASEGAWA TATSUO WINS NATIONAL MARATHONS AGAIN!"
"KIM JUN-SHIK WINS!"
Congratulations
Jun-shik Kim, the light of Korean marathon
Hasegawa Tatsuo, the star of Japanese marathon wins again
Good job chasing behind me
Must be your damn lucky day
Let's applaud Hasegawa Tatsuo who won the national high school marathon and brought great honor to Imperial Japan
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Long live...
This is my grandson, Tatsuo
You must be very proud
I expect a lot from you
Thank you
It's a gift from the Japanese Minister of Defense
Open it
Yes, sir
Give me that!
Get away!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
- Father!
-Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Do something!
Father, please!
Do something!
You're a doctor who saves lives!
Why aren't you doing anything?
- You killed him!
-No
You killed him!
No
Bring my grandfather back!
Let go!
He didn't kill anyone!
You bastards killed him!
Jun-shik!
Bring my grandfather back!
No!
- Daddy!
-No!
I didn't do it!

Don't show your face around here again
Or I might kill you
Korea's hero, Ki-jung Sohn won an Olympic gold medal!
Rejoice!
MAY, 1938, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Why do you have sandbags strapped on?
Are you a marathon runner?
Korea's luck in the marathon stops with Ki-jung Sohn
A Korean man will never be an Olympic victor again
Koreans are banned from Olympics 'cause Sohn covered the Japanese flag?
If you were a bomb,
I'd run straight into the Athletics Association
Marathon running is a science demanding concentration and fighting spirit
I'll prove it once and for all at the Olympic tryouts
Can you go any faster?
You might regret it
I'll pay double if you get there in 30 minutes
Triple for 20 minutes
Hold on tight
Your victory in the tryouts is a given
What is your goal in the Olympics?
I'll win the gold and set a new record
- What a laugh?
-In honor of our great empire!
Look out!
Look out!
Let's go!
Coming through!
Move!
Out of the way!
To a marathon gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics!
- Cheers!
-Cheers!
You're quite the runner
Here you are
Double would've been fine
Opportunities come to those who don't give up
Jun-shik Kim
Jun-shik!
Are you okay?
Isn't that...
Are you all so happy over half of a race?
I'm Ki-jung Sohn
Ki-jung Sohn's in Japan
Wanna bet?
If I win, I get to marry your sister
Hurry
You say Japan and Korea are one yet you ban Koreans from tryouts?
Are you claiming the Athletics Association is unjust?
Your comment, Mr. Chairman?
The board has decided
If a Japanese runner will win anyways, what's the problem?
It'll be boring for Hasegawa without Jun-shik Kim
I think Jun-shik Kim shouldn't be in the discussion
See!
Jun-shik Kim?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim, what have you been up to?
What are your thoughts on the ban on Korean runners?
Are you still training?
How much do you train each day?
Your comments, please
Mr. Hasegawa?
Are you confident you'll win even if Jun-shik Kim enters?
You think he stands a chance against me?
But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better than yours?
That was in the past
You think a mere rickshaw driver can beat a well-trained marathoner?
If you could enter, are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?
How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?
I'd be grateful just to enter the race
Here is your acceptance letter from Berlin Medical University
Sign it
The marathon is more important to me than my studies
This is the most important period in your life
Focus on your studies
Our men are sacrificing their lives to build a Greater East Asia
I don't want to be a coward who runs away from war
War is futile
You are insulting Grandfather
Tatsuo, watch what you say
Think of the people before your country
That's the way of a doctor
Then I must treat the Korean people who killed my grandfather?
Even if it kills me, I'll never do that
The picture is missing from the frame in my room
Jong-dae!
Why you
Why would someone steal a picture of all things?
It should be around somewhere
Anyway, I hope you can enter the tryouts
Father will be so happy
Don't get your hopes up
Can't trust the Japs
Get more firewood.
The fire's dying
Please?
It's so pretty
How do I look?
Eun-soo
I think you're the prettiest girl in all of Asia
"OLYMPIC TRYOUTS ENTRY FORM"
Please win and bring hope to Korea again
I can really enter the race?
Show them how scary a mere rickshaw driver can be!
Jun-shik
Listen carefully
The man in front of Jun-shik is Ki-jung Sohn
Then, you must be holding the Olympic tryouts entry form
If I'm right, hold it up high!
Yes!
Let me see!
Yes!
Sir!
Sir!
Jun-shik!
Min-woo!
Everyone!
Korea's best marathoner, Jun-shik Kim, will run the marathon again!
Hurray for Jun-shik Kim!

Don't mind Jun-shik Kim
Hasegawa!
Spurt ahead!
Spurt ahead!
Hasegawa!
The runners will come into the stadium any minute!
Why are you so late?
A surgery took long
What a tense moment!
There!
The runners can be finally seen!
Who is the first runner coming in?
Who will it be?
As expected, it's Hasegawa with Kimura behind him!
What?
There's another runner!
It's Jun-shik Kim!
You can do it
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim!
Go, Jun-shik!

The rickshaw won!
Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
The last runner is coming in!
It's a dream come true!
The medals will be awarded soon
I knew you could do it!
Ladies and gentlemen, the results will now be announced
The winner of All Japan Olympic Marathon Tryouts is
Hasegawa Tatsuo!
Second is number 13, Ando!
Third is number 18, Kimura!
Will the three runners come up to the victory stand?
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura
Please come to the victory stand
- Jun-shik Kim was first!
- What's he saying?
Jun-shik Kim!
Spectators, please calm down and be seated
Jun-shik Kim has been disqualified for blocking Kimura's way
Disqualified?
How!
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
Is this why you let me enter?
Go back.
Didn't you hear you've been disqualified?
You should've run fair and square
Fair and square?
Crazy bastards
Try Saying it again!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Damn bastards!
Damn bastards!
Jong-dae!

Please come up, immediately!
You bastards cheated first!

This court has decided on the following sentence
Based on section 4 of the legal code, all accomplices of the riot will become Imperial soldiers and swear allegiance to the Emperor

Soldiers must behave with decorum
Stop mumbling!
Soldiers must always improve their battle skills
I don't believe this
Soldiers must always improve their battle skills
Soldiers must serve with utmost loyalty
Soldiers must always be frugal
Frugal...
"JULY, 1939, NOMONHAN, MONGOLIAN BORDERLAND"
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
That Way!
Concentrate!
Get up there!
Retreat!
Min-woo!
You okay?
It's me, Jun-shik
Wake up!
Shit.
I should've fought for independence instead
Who would've guessed we'd end up fighting for the Japs here?
Our damn fortunes
I'm starving to death
You're hungry 24 hours a day
Grow up will you?
Hey!
Hurry up!
Lazy Korean fools!
Yes, sir
Let's hurry
Hope you get shot down dead
He's really dead?
- Choon-bok!
Your butt!
-What?
Where's it coming from?
I almost got my head blown off
The broken wall at 1 o'clock
I heard the 1st regiment got attacked, too.
It's him
Just our damn luck
Jong-dae!
Cover me
No!
Stay back, Jun-shik!
Cover him!
Choon-bok!
Cover him!
Are you okay Jun-shik?
It's great you shot down just Japs, but Noda's gonna kill us
She killed so many
Hey!
Don't hog all the food!
Give me some
Don't slobber over it!
Give me some!
This is you?
You keep eating.
I'll look at this
Fine, I'll show you.
Let me see first
Not that sexy
She's crying
Cuz you took her picture
No, it's cuz you ate all her beef jerky
Fools.
Why'd you make her cry?
The bullets happened to swerve and hit only Japanese soldiers?
Did the bitch smell your Kimchi breath?
Talk, you fools!
Speak, you bastards!
Who sent you here!
Say it!
I'm Shirai from Hailaer
You raped my mother before my father, and raped me, too
Listen!
There are many like me in China
China will never lose to you!
I will never forgive!
Never!
Tell me!
Why did the bullets fly past you Korean rubbish!
Speak, you bastards!
Damn it!
Stop it!
I said no speaking Korean!
Enough
That won't bring back the dead!
Go back to your work places
What's all this?
Who's coming?
Colonel
I'm Colonel Takakura
Company, halt!
Attention!
What?
Why's that bastard here?
Colonel Hasegawa, what brings you here?
Private Takakura ever drive past honorable Imperial soldiers' corpses?
Mukai!
Yes, sir
First!
For shamefully ordering a retreat, you're demoted to private as of today
Second
Private Takakura will prove loyalty to our Emperor and commit hara-kiri!
Be thankful our Emperor granted you an honorable death!
Long live our Emperor!
Handle the deceased with due respect
Yes, sir
Remember, after feeding off corpses, crows can come and gouge out your eyes
I'm Hasegawa Tatsuo
I came here to demolish
Soviet tanks!
I'll show them true power of the Imperial army!
When out of bullets, Imperial soldiers must charge with bayonets!
If bayonets are broken, we must fight with bare hands!
Imperial soldiers do not leave the battlefield till death!
Understood!
Yes, sir
We either win or die
First!
We'll build a pontoon bridge over Khalkhin River within 48 hours
Second!
We'll form a special suicide unit of 50 men to demolish tanks
All officers will stand with me at the vanguard of the special unit!
Mukai!
Yes, sir!
Write up the list and have it on my desk by tomorrow
Dismissed!
Dismissed!
I'm sorry about your picture
I glued it together
Take it
I have a sister like you back home
My name is Jun-shik Kim
Thank you
"Shei-shei ni"?
The sun's going down!
Hurry up, you bastards!
Stop dawdling!
Hurry up!
Work harder!
When the sun goes down, it's over!
Squad 9!
Damn slow Korean dogs!
Build this in 2 days?
He's insane!
They worked us from dawn!
Where's the food!
Stop talking about food!
You're making me hungry
Choon-bok?
What's "Shei-shei ni"?
Learning Chinese?
Why do you keep asking?
Just tell me
It means thank you
Stop working!
Attention!
At ease
I heard Tatsuo was your marathon rival
He didn't stand a chance
Jun-shik's way better!
Come out!
Keep that in your mouth and come out!
Choon-bok Hwang!
Come out faster than a bullet, or you'll drink all the water here!
Repeat after me
I'm a barbarian
I'm a Korean
Repeat that, keep the fish in, and do squats till sundown!
Begin!
Catching fish on duty or running during bedtime!
You think this is a playground?
Make sure everything gets incinerated
Yes, sir!
No!
How dare you!
Not my running shoes!
Oh, is that so?
If you wanna run, do it barefoot
Where are you going, fool!
Damn bastards!
How many more beatings you need!
Korean dog!
No!
Gwang-choon?
This side's sinking
What?
There's a screw lose
Who unscrewed this?
It was there before
Squad 9!
Step forward
If we went on like this tomorrow, what would've happened?
From now on, the engineering unit will fix up Squad 9's area
Squad 9 will hold the faulty plank on their heads
And return to the base before sundown
The best marathoner will be leading you
The plank must be leveled!
Keep it leveled!
Noda, the bastard!
Save your breath
Just walk, Jun-shik We'll hold up the plank
Don't worry
If you hurt your knee, it's over!
Listen!
Keep it leveled!
One!
Two!
How is it?
Cool enough for you
Squad 9 Sluggards!
John Yushe.
Yes sir.
Yueh Sanchin.
Yes sir.
Jong-dae Lee!
Yes, sir
Jun-shik Kim!
Yes, sir
Why're they calling us this time?
Attention!
The 50 soldiers called will fight in tomorrow's attack
On a special suicide mission with me
What did he say?
Suicide?
Us?
We will carry bombs and demolish enemy tanks at dawn
Fight like Imperial soldiers and die with honor
I'll kill anyone.
Who dares retreat
Koreans should be honored to be included in this heroic mission
I'm not taking part in this operation
Oh, really?
For what reason?
The Korean soldiers and I didn't volunteer we cannot consent to a mission that demands death
Your permission to shoot, sir!
Dare disobey me?
All Koreans here, including our squad, think the same
I'll ask again
Are you disobeying me?
This is insane
Execute him with the other POWs!
Before we march out tomorrow
Have fun on your last night
Stupid bastards!
Are you okay?
I'll be executed at dawn
Like this
The Japanese are evil
Korea and China are foolish
I'm not afraid to die
I'm just mad I couldn't kill more Japanese fools
If I could, I'd get more revenge
I'd kill them all!
What are you doing?
If we're gonna die like dogs, might as well save Jun-shik!
Hurry UP
Hurry!
Shirai
Why her?
Pull her out!
Why?
At a time like this
It's coming!
Run!
Get down!
Jun-shik!
Let's head to the bridge and go south on Khalkin River to cross the border
Where's Min-woo?
We're the only ones going?
He's out on a job with Noda
We can't take all 100 Koreans with us
Let's hurry
We don't have time.
Come on.
Jun-shik!
Get on
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
What's that?
It's an attack!
We could've gotten killed, too
Damn Japs!
Good for them!
Let's go!
Come on,
Jun-shik!
Hurry up!
What's going on?
Soviet tanks are coming!
Grab the oar!
Tanks?
Get on!
Jun-shik!
The tanks are coming!
Get on!
Go ahead without me
What did you say?
What the hell are you doing!
Crazy?
Get on, Jun-shik!
Come on!
What the hell are you doing!
Come with us!
Let's all survive and meet again!
Jun-shik!
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Just get on!
If you go back, you're dead, too!
Come back!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!

Don't come!
Stop!
Stop!
It's an attack!
Don't come!
It's an attack, sir!
Get ready for battle!
Block off the front with trucks!
Move the trucks up front!
The rest to the first line of defense!
To the first line of defense!
Defend the first line of defense!

You go and die bravely!
Min-woo!
Help me

Fools!
Imperial soldier don't retreat!
How dare you run away!
Charge!
Don't show your back to the enemy!
Don't back away!
Charge!
Charge!
Don't back down!
Don't run!
Fight!
Charge!
Want to get everyone killed?
If you want to die, do it alone!
We're not dying like dogs!
Order the retreat!
Imperial soldiers must charge ahead even as ghosts!
Enough with the Imperial soldiers!
Order the retreat!
Colonel!
Here's your chance to die honorably as an Imperial soldier!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Where are we going?
Can we make it back home?
Hurry UP!
Move it!
You bastards!

"FEBRUARY, 1940, KUNGURSK, SOVIET UNION PRISONER OF WAR CAMP"
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
As proof you'll carry out the oath
The leader of you Japanese dogs,
Hasegawa Tatsuo, must step on your national flag
We're not labors or criminals, but proud Imperial soldiers!
You have no right to force us to reform!
Imperial Japan will not abandon you!
Keep your dignity till the day you return and fight with honor!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Hurry up!
Move it!
Walk in a line!
Colonel!
Don't fall asleep, sir!
Shut up, fool!
Keep moving!
Hurry up!
You yellow bastards!
You slow sluggards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Hurry!
Line up, you bastards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Choon-bok!
Gwang-choon!
- Jun-shik!
-Jun-shik!
I thought you were dead!
What a relief you're all alive
Where's Jong-dae?
Jong-dae's here, but
Attention!
This is Anton, your supervisor
I'm Anton
If Area 3 doesn't shape up, it'll be hard to stay alive here
Officers or soldiers,
I won't tolerate anyone slacking on the job!
Each group leader, take 20 new POWs and go to your work areas!
Go!
Jong-dae!
Jun-shik!
You're alive!
I was so worried I'd never see you again
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
When did you get here?
About two months ago
I rule here
Nothing for you to worry about now
Korean dog!
Jong-dae Lee!
I didn't like the way you were talking
I'm sorry...
Thought I'd say that?
You damn Jap!
Dare call me a Korean dog?
Give me that
Still think I'm a damn soldier under you?
You stupid son of a bitch!
This isn't Kyung-sung or Nomonhan!
This is the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
I'm the colonel here!
And I'm the king!
You got that, fool?
You got that, fool?
Got that, you damn Japs!
Colonel
Wake up, sir!
Noda
If you wanna stay alive, stay out of my sight
Hey!
So damn cold
If we don't warm him up, He'll die
Please move
Who cares?
That bastard's not even worth stomping on
I beg you
Make room for him, please
Try saving him, then It probably won't work
What are you doing!
We have to save the Colonel!
Mukai!
if he's a goner, bring him to the incinerator
No use watching him die Let's go
Jun-shik, have a drink
Look at that
If you get frostbitten here, you end up being firewood like him
This is the warmest place in the whole camp
Your legs are your life Take good care of 'em
I like it here
No Japs calling me a Korean dog
We should go back when the war's over
I'm not
There's nothing but pulling a rickshaw there
Having a drink reminds me of home
Eun-sods probably fine, right?
I miss her
All stand!
Starting the day without bowing towards our Emperor is contemptible
There is no exception here!
Get up!
No need.
Keep eating
It's an order!
Crazy bastard
Everyone stand!
Now!
Private Jun-shik Kim!
Get up!
Private Kim!
We're no longer your subordinates
We were unjustly dragged and forced to become Imperial soldiers
As the Soviets can't demand reform, you have no right to force us to bow
Remember
From now on, I'm not Private Jun-shik Kim but the Korean marathoner Jun-shik Kim!
Crazy fool!
You want to die!
You're the crazy one who killed hundreds of soldiers!
Commit hara-kiri like Colonel Takakura!
Bastard!
Since you have the energy to fight, guess you're not hungry enough
Grudges between a Korean and a Japanese, huh?
You got your wish
Fight till one of you dies!
Kill him, Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
One of us should've died
Today's the day
Colonel!
The knife, sir!
Colonel!
Colonel!
Jun-shik!
The knife!
Kill me, Korean dog!
Kill him!
Hold it up right!
Hurry up and do it!
Stop slacking off!
When did this happen?
It's okay, Jun-shik
Don't
It's okay
Hold still
Germany invaded the Soviet Union
The Soviets may speed up exchanging POWs to reinforce their army
Number 1277!
He's one of your men
Anton!
Go catch him!
Yes, sir!
It's time for frostbite examination
Where's Choon-bok?
Take him away
Gwang-choon!
NO!
No!
Drag him out!
Let's go!
I'm fine!
I can still work, sir!
Tell 'em Jun-shik!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
- I want to live, Jun-shik!
- Gwang-choon!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Lets Go!
Help!
Gwang-choon!
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You're not hiding in here, are you?
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
- You son of a bitch!
-Shut up!
Come out, pal!
Come out!
You wanna die?
I was starving
Put the bread down and come out now
What do we do?
What do we do?
Who's there?
How dare you steal, you bastard!
He's the one
- He's the thief!
- What are you doing?
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
Please Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
A rat sneaked into our food storage today
Luckily we caught him, thanks to comrade Anton
As you know, stealing is punishable by death
Jong-dae!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
I'm scared!
Tell 'em I didn't eat the bread!
Execute him!
Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Make it back home alive!
Is it because of this?
This is more important than a friend's life?
This is who you really are?
Call yourself human?
Yeah, I'm not human
I'm not the Jong-dae you know!
I'm Anton!
I'm Anton, you bastard!
Call me Anton from now on!
Got that!
How long do you think this armband will protect you?
How could you do that to Choon-bok?
What do you know?
You don't know anything!
Shut up and stay out of my life
Do you know that Gwang-choon died?
He's probably nothing, but ashes by now
If you pull that again in front of them, I'll kill you
Your emperor abandoned you
How dare you speak of our Emperor!
POW repatriation has been denied
We showed mercy on you, but the Japanese refused
They're battling Americans in the Pacific and have no interest in you
You expect me to believe that?
Imperial soldiers are sons of the Emperor
A father does not abandon his son
That's what you want to believe
You naive, poor, abandoned son
You will also face death in the incinerator here
It's a Kokeshi
Is your hometown Yamagata?
You're good
You know, sir?
Have you been there?
My grandfather took me there when I was young
It's a beautiful place
I grew up there my whole life
My family ran a carpentry shop for generations
When I go back,
I want to be a great carpenter like my father
Do you know why I chose to be your adjutant for Nomonhan, sir?
Because I saw your firm conviction for our country in your eyes
Conviction
Look out!
Son of a bitch!
Tsukamoto!
You okay?
Wake up!
I go easy on you, you cripple, and for what!
Jong-dae!
We're doing our best, too!
Your best?
I'll show you my best in beating!
You son of a bitch!
You call that your best!
You bastards!
This is the best!
Jong-dae Lee!
It's Anton, fool!
He's dead
Lieutenant!
What?
Never seen a man die before?
Get back to work, you bastards!
Work, you fools!
Get back to work now!
You fools never listen!
Damn Jap!
How dare you!
Stop it!
I told you to stay out of my way!
Damn Jap!
I gotta beat it into your head?
You bastards!
Damn Jap!
You son of bitch!
Kill 'em!
Bastards!
Back to your posts!
Stop!
You bastards!
There is no mercy for those who started the riot!
Begin the executions!
It's an urgent telegram, sir
Grab a uniform!
Change into now!
Germany has declared war against us
Comrade Stalin has given you too, your final calling
The choice is yours
Those who want to convert may wear Soviet army uniforms
- Go get the uniforms!
Hurry!
-Yes, sir
Hurry up and put it on!
Anton
This is a great opportunity for you
I hope you come back victorious
Long live the Soviet Union!
Good luck!
Comrade!
Please give them a chance, too
Let them go!
Thank you, sir!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurry up and put it on!
Hasegawa Tatsuo This is your last chance
I'll say it one more time.
Put it on.
Let's give it a good shot
It's better than freezing to death
Right, Jun-shik?
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Bastards
The Soviet army uniform suits our colonel so well, doesn't it?
"DECEMBER, 1941 ZHEDOVSK, SOVIET UNION"
Get off!
Get off, now!
Get off!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!

I miss Eun-soo
Jun-shik
No, Jun-shik

There is no retreat!
I'll kill anyone who tries to run!
Charge ahead!
Attack!
Fools!
Attack!
Imperial soldier don't retreat!
Charge!
Attack!
You'll need it to make it over the mountains
Where do you plan to go?
To German territory
I hope we're going the right way
I hope the snow stops
Even if we make it to German territory it won't be easy to make it back home
You don't have to come, if you don't want to
Back then
Why didn't you kill me?
Tatsuo!
Wake up!
I'll go find some medicine kim...
Jun-shik kim
I'll be right back
Help!
Help me!
Help me!
I'm a Japanese soldier
My friend's in danger
What's he saying?
I'm a Japanese soldier
We're on the same side!
Take him away!
I'm a Japanese soldier, not a POW!
Lets Go!
You bastard!
Help me!
A man is dying!
Please!
Take him away, now!
Let go!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Lets Go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Search every corner
You go up that way
"3 YEARS LATER"
There's word that the Allied Forces will invade Nord-Pas-de-Calais
Then we hit the jackpot getting stationed in Normandy
If Germany loses, aren't we all dead anyways?
Think they'll take us back?
We'd be lucky if they don't call us traitors and shoot us
That's why we should run away
You said you'll run for 2 years now
I'm going for sure this time
I heard from a man in another unit
There's a secret merchant ship to Jamaica at Cherbourg Harbor
How'll you get there?
Swim?
If you get caught trying to run, you'll be shot!
Wanna make a bet?
I bet 50 marks you can't run away
Bet 100 marks, stupid
Bet even your boots, you pig
"May, 1944, NORMANDY, FRANCE"
Our battalion will build additional defense walls and defense lines in the Atlantic
From tomorrow, you will build defense walls on the shore with unit 795
Our job is to build the defense encampment on Normandy hill
March forward!
Hurry up!
Squad 3!
Unit 2!
Go to barracks 14!
Hey
Shouldn't you give up looking for your Korean friend?
You're the only Asian here
That guy's so lucky
He gets to go in and out of base at will
Tatsuo!
Aren't you coming in?
Let's go
Go ahead, I'll rest here for a sec
See ya later, then
I thought you might be dead
But you're here in the Eastern battalion
When did you come to Normandy?
Jun-shik?
Did you say something?
Can you repeat it?
Tatsuo!
It's more comfortable this way
I can't hear gunshots or screams
It's over
Let's play soccer
Tatsuo!
We're going to play against Squad 8!
Man, they're fast
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in I lost cuz my rubber shoes fell off,
But I was happy to have a new running mate
We came much too far
How long will it take to run home from here?
More than a year, right?
We know the Allied forces will attack Nord-Pas-de-Calais
The Eastern battalion will all be sent to Nord-Pas-de-Calais!
You will all be reborn as true German soldiers!
Pack up your gear
We move out at 09:00 hours tomorrow!
Dismissed!
We're all dead I thought we'd be safe in Normandy
What's going on?
We're being transferred
It's nothing
Sending us to battle but feeding us this rubbish
I thought we'd get wine and steak when we came to France
Damn
Karim
I'm going to Cherbourg at dawn
Are you crazy?
I got the contact info from Roman
Is Roman going?
That liar
How will you get there?
The food truck always leaves at dawn
We gotta go when you're on watch
Think it over
If you get caught, you're dead
Is it cuz of your friend?
Fine
I'll see you at dawn
We're not going to Nord-Pas-de-Calais
We're going to Cherbourg
Cherbourg?
A ship there will take us home
Jun-shik
Let's go home where your sister and father are
Can we really make it home?
We could get killed on the way
Still, we can't die here
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Tatsuo!
Those aren't planes, are they?
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!

Jun-shik!
Stay there!
I'll come to you!
Wait for me!
Hurry!
It's an attack!
Prepare for battle!
All units to battle positions!
The Allied Forces have attacked!
To your battle positions!
Hurry and grab the machine gun!
Grab it!
Everyone to your battle positions!
Move it!
Move it!
Fire!
Fire!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Are you okay?
Let's get out of here, now!
Grab the machine gun!
Now!
Hurry up, you fools!
Can't you see the enemy!
Reload and fire, now!
Allied forces attacked!
Send re-enforcements!
Damn it
Let's run for it
Don't lag behind
You'll be watching my back as you run
Are you okay?
This won't kill me
Let's go!
Jun-shik
Come on!
We have to get home!
Tatsuo
Are you okay?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
You're Jun-shik Kim from now on
If you say you're Japanese, they might kill you
Say you were dragged here and forced into the Eastern battalion
Jun-shik!
Wake up!
I have no regrets
Though I couldn't achieve my dream
You can't go like this!
Let's go home and run together!
Jun-shik
I wanted to run again when I go back home
Promise you'll make it back alive...
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I was happy to have a new running mate
Ready, go!
JULY, 1948, LONDON, ENGLAND
MARCH, 1928, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Isn't the air nice, Tatsuo?
You'll get used to it here soon
I'm sure you'll make good friends here
It's Jun-shik!
I'm faster than a car!
Grandpa!
You show the signs of a great Imperial soldier already
Welcome, my boy
How've you been, Father?
Greet them
He's the new, young master
Jun-shik Kim, sir
I'm Eun-soo Kim, sir
Great, Tatsuo You have a new friend your age
Tatsuo runs well.
Like you
My brother's the best runner in Kyung-sung, sir
I'm the best in Tokyo
No match for a country boy
Wanna race me?
Ready
Go!
HASEGAWA TATSUO WINS NATIONAL MARATHONS AGAIN!
KIM JUN-SHIK WINS!
Congratulations
Good job chasing behind me
Must be your damn lucky day
Let's applaud Hasegawa Tatsuo who won the national high school marathon and brought great honor to Imperial Japan
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
This is my grandson, Tatsuo
You must be very proud
I expect a lot from you
It's a gift from the Japanese Minister of Defense
Open it
Yes, sir
Give me that!
Get away!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Father!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Do something!
Father, please!
Do something!
You're a doctor who saves lives!
Why aren't you doing anything?
You killed him!
No
You killed him!
No
Bring my grandfather back!
Let go!
He didn't kill anyone!
You bastards killed him!
Jun-shik!
Bring my grandfather back!
No!
No!
I didn't do it!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Jun-shik!
Daddy!
Father!
Bring my grandfather back!
Father!
Jun-shik
Let go!
Father!
Father Daddy...
Daddy
Don't show your face around here again
Or I might kill you
Korea's hero, Ki-jung Sohn won an Olympic gold medal!
Rejoice!
MAY, 1938, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Why do you have sandbags strapped on?
Are you a marathon runner?
Korea's luck in the marathon stops with Ki-jung Sohn
A Korean man will never be an Olympic victor again
Koreans are banned from Olympics 'cause Sohn covered the Japanese flag?
If you were a bomb, I'd run straight into the Athletics Association
Marathon running is a science demanding concentration and fighting spirit
I'll prove it once and for all at the Olympic tryouts
Can you go any faster?
You might regret it
I'll pay double if you get there in 30 minutes
Triple for 20 minutes
Hold on tight
Your victory in the tryouts is a given
What is your goal in the Olympics?
I'll win the gold and set a new record
What a laugh in honor of our great empire!
Look out!
Look out!
Let's go!
Coming through!
To a marathon gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics!
Cheers!
Cheers!
You're quite the runner
Here you are
Double would've been fine
Opportunities come to those who don't give up
Jun-shik Kim
Jun-shik!
Are you okay?
Isn't that...
Are you all so happy over half of a race?
I'm Ki-jung Sohn
Ki-jung Soho's in Japan
Wanna bet?
If I win, I get to marry your sister
Hurry
You say Japan and Korea are one yet you ban Koreans from tryouts?
Are you claiming the Athletics Association is unjust?
Your comment, Mr. Chairman?
The board has decided
If a Japanese runner will win anyways, what's the problem?
It'll be boring for Hasegawa without Jun-shik Kim
I think Jun-shik Kim shouldn't be in the discussion see!
Jun-shik Kim?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim, what have you been up to?
What are your thoughts on the ban on Korean runners?
Are you still training?
How much do you train each day?
Your comments, please
Mr. Hasegawa?
Are you confident you'll win even if Jun-shik Kim enters?
You think he stands a chance against me?
But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better than yours?
That was in the past
You think a mere rickshaw driver can beat a well-trained marathoner?
If you could enter, are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?
How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?
I'd be grateful just to enter the race
Here is your acceptance letter from Berlin Medical University
Sign it
The marathon is more important to me than my studies
This is the most important period in your life
Focus on your studies
Our men are sacrificing their lives to build a Greater East Asia
I don't want to be a coward who runs away from war
War is futile
You are insulting Grandfather
Tatsuo, watch what you say
Think of the people before your country
That's the way of a doctor
Then I must treat the Korean people who killed my grandfather?
Even if it kills me, I'll never do that
The picture is missing from the frame in my room
Jong-dae!
Why you
Why would someone steal a picture of all things?
It should be around somewhere
Anyway, I hope you can enter the tryouts
Father will be so happy
Don't get your hopes up Can't trust the Japs
Get more firewood The fire's dying
Please?
It's so pretty
How do I look?
Eun-soo
I think you're the prettiest girl in all of Asia
OLYMPIC TRYOUTS ENTRY FORM
Please win and bring hope to Korea again
I can really enter the race?
Show them how scary a mere rickshaw driver can be!
Jun-shik
Listen carefully
The man in front of Jun-shik is Ki-jung Sohn
Then, you must be holding the Olympic tryouts entry form
If I'm right, hold it up high!
Yes!
Let me see!
Yes!
Sir!
Sir!
Jun-shik!
Min-woo!
Everyone!
Korea's best marathoner, Jun-shik Kim, will run the marathon again!
Hurray for Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik Kim!
Get the rice cake kings ate!
Rice cakes here!
Here you are
Father picked it out himself The best pair there is

Don't mind Jun-shik Kim
Hasegawa!
Spurt ahead!
Spurt ahead!
Hasegawa!
The runners will come into the stadium any minute!
Why are you so late?
A surgery took long
What a tense moment!
There!
The runners can be finally seen!
Who is the first runner coming in?
Who will it be?
As expected, it's Hasegawa with Kimura behind him!
What?
There's another runner!
It's Jun-shik Kim!
You can do it
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim!
Go, Jun-shik!

Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
The rickshaw won!
Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
The last runner is coming in!
It's a dream come true!
The medals will be awarded soon
I knew you could do it!
Ladies and gentlemen, the results will now be announced
The winner of All Japan Olympic Marathon Tryouts is
Hasegawa Tatsuo!
Second is number 13, Ando!
Third is number 18, Kimura!
Will the three runners come up to the victory stand?
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura Please come to the victory stand
Jun-shik Kim was first!
Jun-shik Kim!
Spectators, please calm down and be seated
Jun-shik Kim has been disqualified for blocking Kimura's way
Disqualified?
How!
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
Is this why you let me enter?
Go back.
Didn't you hear you've been disqualified?
You should've run fair and square
Fair and square?
Crazy bastards

Jong-dae!

JULY, 1939, NOMONHAN, MONGOLIAN BORDERLAND
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
Jun-shik!
You okay?
That Way!
Concentrate!
Get up there!
Retreat!
Min-woo!
You okay?
It's me, Jun-shik
Wake up!
Shit.
I should've fought for independence instead
Who would've guessed we'd end up fighting for the Japs here?
Our damn fortunes
I'm starving to death
You're hungry 24 hours a day
Grow up will you?
Hey!
Hurry up!
Lazy Korean fools!
Yes, sir
Let's hurry
Hope you get shot down dead
He's really dead?
Choon-bok!
Your butt!
What?
Where's it coming from?
I almost got my head blown off
The broken wall at 1 o'clock
I heard the 1st regiment got attacked, too.
It's him
Just our damn luck
Jong-dae!
Cover me
No!
Stay back, Jun-shik!
Cover him!
Choon-bok!
Cover him!
Don't move!
Are you okay Jun-shik?
It's great you shot down just Japs, but Neda's gonna kill us
She killed so many
Hey!
Don't hog all the food!
Give me some
Don't slobber over it!
Give me some!
This is you?
You keep eating I'll look at this
Fine, I'll show you Let me see first
Not that sexy
She's crying
Cuz you took her picture
No, it's cuz you ate all her beef jerky
Fools.
Why'd you make her cry?
The bullets happened to swerve and hit only Japanese soldiers?
Did the bitch smell your Kimchi breath?
Talk, you fools!
Speak, you bastards!
Who sent you here!
Say it!
I'm Shirai from Hailaer
You raped my mother before my father, and raped me, too
Listen!
There are many like me in China
China will never lose to you!
I will never forgive!
Never!
What?
What are you saying?
Tell me!
Why did the bullets fly past you Korean rubbish!
Speak, you bastards!
Damn it!
Stop it!
I said no speaking Korean!
Enough
Stop
That won't bring back the dead!
Go back to your work places
What's all this?
Who's coming?
Colonel
I'm Colonel Takakura
Company, halt!
Attention!
What?
Why's that bastard here?
Colonel Hasegawa, what brings you here?
Private Takakura ever drive past honorable Imperial soldiers' corpses?
Mukai!
Yes, sir
First!
For shamefully ordering a retreat, you're demoted to private as of today
Second
Private Takakura will prove loyalty to our Emperor and commit hara-kiri!
Be thankful our Emperor granted you an honorable death!
Long live our Emperor!
Handle the deceased with due respect
Yes, sir
Remember, after feeding off corpses, crows can come and gouge out your eyes
I'm Hasegawa Tatsuo
I came here to demolish Soviet tanks!
I'll show them true power of the Imperial army!
When out of bullets, Imperial soldiers must charge with bayonets!
If bayonets are broken, we must fight with bare hands!
Imperial soldiers do not leave the battlefield till death!
Understood!
Yes, sir
We either win or die
First!
We'll build a pontoon bridge over Khalkhin River within 48 hours
Second!
We'll form a special suicide unit of 50 men to demolish tanks
All officers will stand with me at the vanguard of the special unit!
Mukai!
Yes, sir!
Write up the list and have it on my desk by tomorrow
Dismissed!
Dismissed!
I'm sorry about your picture I glued it together
Take it
I have a sister like you back home
My name is Jun-shik Kim
Thank you
'Shei-shei ni'?
The sun's going down!
Hurry up, you bastards!
Stop dawdling!
Hurry up!
Work harder!
When the sun goes down, it's over!
Squad 9!
Damn slow Korean dogs!
Build this in 2 days?
He's insane!
They worked us from dawn!
Where's the food!
Stop talking about food!
You're making me hungry
Choon-bok?
What's 'Shei-shei ni'?
Learning Chinese?
Why do you keep asking?
Just tell me
It means thank you
Stop working!
Attention!
At ease
I heard Tatsuo was your marathon rival
He didn't stand a chance
Jun-shik's way better!
Come out!
Keep that in your mouth and come out!
Choon-bok Hwang!
Come out faster than a bullet, or you'll drink all the water here!
Repeat after me
I'm a barbarian
I'm a barbarian
I'm a Korean
I'm a Korean I'm a Korean
Repeat that, keep the fish in, and do squats till sundown!
Begin!
Catching fish on duty or running during bedtime!
You think this is a playground?
Make sure everything gets incinerated
Yes, sir!
No!
How dare you!
Not my running shoes!
Oh, is that so?
If you wanna run, do it barefoot
Where are you going, fool!
Damn bastards!
How many more beatings you need!
Korean dog!
No!
Gwang-choon?
This side's sinking
What?
There's a screw lose
Who unscrewed this?
It was there before
Squad 9!
Step forward
If we went on like this tomorrow, what would've happened?
From now on, the engineering unit will fix up Squad 9's area
Squad 9 will hold the faulty plank on their heads
And return to the base before sundown
The best marathoner will be leading you
The plank must be leveled!
Keep it leveled!
Noda, the bastard!
Save your breath
Just walk, Jun-shik We'll hold up the plank
Don't worry
If you hurt your knee, it's over!
Listen!
Keep it leveled!
One!
Two!
How is it?
Cool enough for you Squad 9 sluggards!
Jong-dae Lee!
Yes, sir
Jun-shik Kim!
Yes, sir
Why're they calling us this time?
Attention!
The 50 soldiers called will fight in tomorrow's attack
On a special suicide mission with me
What did he say?
Suicide?
Us?
We will carry bombs and demolish enemy tanks at dawn
Fight like Imperial soldiers and die with honor
I'll kill anyone Who dares retreat
Koreans should be honored to be included in this heroic mission
I'm not taking part in this operation
Oh, really?
For what reason?
The Korean soldiers and I didn't volunteer we cannot consent to a mission that demands death
Your permission to shoot, sir!
Dare disobey me?
All Koreans here, including our squad, think the same
I'll ask again Are you disobeying me?
This is insane
Execute him with the other POWs!
Before we march out tomorrow
Have fun on your last night
Stupid bastards!
Are you okay?
I'll be executed at dawn
Like this
The Japanese are evil
Korea and China are foolish
I'm not afraid to die
I'm just mad I couldn't kill more Japanese fools
If I could, I'd get more revenge
I'd kill them all!
Jun-shik?
What are you doing?
If we're gonna die like dogs, might as well save Jun-shik!
Hurry UP
Hurry!
Shirai
Why her?
Pull her out!
Why?
At a time like this
It's coming!
Run!
Run!
Get down!
Jun-shik!
Let's head to the bridge and go south on Khalkin River to cross the border
Where's Min-woo?
We're the only ones going?
He's out on a job with Noda
We can't take all 100 Koreans with us
Let's hurry We don't have time
Come on
Jun-shik!

Enough with the Imperial soldiers!
Order the retreat!
Colonel!

FEBRUARY, 1940, KUNGURSK, SOVIET UNION PRISONER OF WAR CAMP
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform
As proof you'll carry out the oath
The leader of you Japanese dogs,
Hasegawa Tatsuo, must step on your national flag
We're not labors or criminals, but proud Imperial soldiers!
You have no right to force us to reform!
Imperial Japan will not abandon you!
Keep your dignity till the day you return and fight with honor!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Hurry up!
Move it!
Colonel!
Don't fall asleep, sir!
Shut up, fool!
Keep moving!
Hurry up!
You yellow bastards!
You slow sluggards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Hurry!
Line up, you bastards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Choon-bok!
Gwang-choon!
Jun-shik!
I thought you were dead!
What a relief you're all alive
Where's Jong-dae?
Jong-dae's here, but
Attention!
This is Anton, your supervisor
I'm Anton
If Area 3 doesn't shape up, it'll be hard to stay alive here
Officers or soldiers,
I won't tolerate anyone slacking on the job!
Each group leader, take 20 new POWs and go to your work areas!
Go!
Jong-dae!
Jun-shik!
You're alive!
I was so worried I'd never see you again
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
When did you get here?
About two months ago
I rule here
Nothing for you to worry about now
Korean dog!
Jong-dae Lee!
I didn't like the way you were talking
I'm sorry...
Thought I'd say that?
You damn Jap!
Dare call me a Korean dog?
Give me that
Still think I'm a damn soldier under you?
You stupid son of a bitch!
This isn't Kyung-sung or Nomonhan!
This is the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
I'm the colonel here!
And I'm the king!
Got that?
You got that, fool?
You got that, fool?
Got that, you damn Japs!
Colonel
Wake up, sir!
Noda
If you wanna stay alive, stay out of my sight
Hey!
So damn cold
If we don't warm him up, He'll die
Please move
Who cares?
That bastard's not even worth stomping on
I beg you Make room for him, please
Try saving him, then
It probably won't work
What are you doing!
We have to save the Colonel!
Mukai!
If he's a goner, bring him to the incinerator
No use watching him die Let's go
Jun-shik, have a drink
Look at that
If you get frostbitten here, you end up being firewood like him
This is the warmest place in the whole camp
Your legs are your life Take good care of 'em
I like it here No Japs calling me a Korean dog
We should go back when the war's over
I'm not
There's nothing but pulling a rickshaw there
Having a drink reminds me of home
Eun-soo's probably fine, right?
I miss her
All stand!
Starting the day without bowing towards our Emperor is contemptible
There is no exception here!
Get up!
No need.
Keep eating
It's an order!
Crazy bastard
Everyone stand!
Now!
Private Jun-shik Kim!
Get up!
Private Kim!
We're no longer your subordinates
We were unjustly dragged and forced to become Imperial soldiers
As the Soviets can't demand reform, you have no right to force us to bow
Remember
From now on, I'm not Private Jun-shik Kim but the Korean marathoner Jun-shik Kim!
Crazy fool!
You want to die!
You're the crazy one who killed hundreds of soldiers!
Commit hara-kiri like Colonel Takakura!
Bastard!
Since you have the energy to fight, guess you're not hungry enough
Grudges between a Korean and a Japanese, huh?
You got your wish
Fight till one of you dies!
Kill him, Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
One of us should've died
Today's the day
Colonel!
Kill me, Korean dog!
Kill him!
LOGGING AREA 3
Hold it up right!
Hurry up and do it!
Stop slacking off!
When did this happen?
It's okay, Jun-shik
Don't
It's okay
Hold still
Germany invaded the Soviet Union
The Soviets may speed up exchanging POWs to reinforce their army
Number 1277!
He's one of your men
Anton!
Go catch him!
Yes, sir!
It's time for frosebite examination
Where's Choon-bok?
Take him away

Come out, pal!
Come out!
You wanna die?
I was starving
Put the bread down and come out now
What do we do?
Who's there?
How dare you steal, you bastard!
He's the one
He's the thief!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
Please Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
A rat sneaked into our food storage today
Luckily we caught him, thanks to comrade Anton
As you know, stealing is punishable by death
Jong-dae!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
I'm scared!
Tell 'em I didn't eat the bread!
Jong-dae!
Execute him!
Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Make it back home alive!
Is it because of this?
This is more important than a friend's life?
This is who you really are?
Call yourself human?
Yeah, I'm not human
I'm not the Jong-dae you know!
I'm Anton!
I'm Anton, you bastard!
Call me Anton from now on!
Got that!
How long do you think this armband will protect you?
How could you do that to Choon-bok?
What do you know?
You don't know anything!
Shut up and stay out of my life
Do you know that Gwang-choon died?
He's probably nothing but ashes by now
If you pull that again in front of them, I'll kill you
Your emperor abandoned you
How dare you speak of our Emperor!
POW repatriation has been denied
We showed mercy on you, but the Japanese refused
They're battling Americans in the Pacific and have no interest in you
You expect me to believe that?
Imperial soldiers are sons of the Emperor
A father does not abandon his son
That's what you want to believe
You na?
ve, poor, abandoned son
You will also face death in the incinerator here
It's a Kokeshi
Is your hometown Yamagata?
You're good
You know, sir?
Have you been there?
My grandfather took me there when I was young
It's a beautiful place
I grew up there my whole life
My family ran a carpentry shop for generations
When I go back, I want to be a great carpenter like my father
Do you know why I chose to be your adjutant for Nomonhan, sir?
Because I saw your firm conviction for our country in your eyes
Conviction
Son of a bitch!
Tsukamoto!
You okay?
Wake up!
I go easy on you, you cripple, and for what!
Jong-dae!
We're doing our best, too!
Your best?
I'll show you my best in beating!
You son of a bitch!
You call that your best!
You bastards!
This is the best!
Jong-dae!
It's Anton, fool!
He's dead
Lieutenant!
What?
Never seen a man die before?
Get back to work, you bastards!
Work, you fools!
Get back to work now!
You fools never listen!
Damn Jap!
How dare you!
Stop it!
I told you to stay out of my way!
Dam Jap!
I gotta beat it into your head?
You bastards!
Damn Jap!
You son of bitch!
Jong-dae Lee!
Bastards!
Back to your posts!
There is no mercy for those who started the riot!
Begin the executions!
It's an urgent telegram, sir
Grab a uniform!
Change into now!
Germany has declared war against us
Comrade Stalin has given you too, your final calling
The choice is yours
Those who want to convert may wear Soviet army uniforms
Go get the uniforms!
Hurry!
Yes, sir
Hurry up and put it on!
Anton
This is a great opportunity for you
I hope you come back victorious
Long live the Soviet Union!
Good luck!
Comrade!
Please give them a chance, too
Let them go!
Thank you, sir!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurry up and put it on!
Hasegawa Tatsuo
This is your last chance
I'll say it one more time Put it on
Let's give it a good shot
It's better than freezing to death
Right, Jun-shik?
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Bastards
The Soviet army uniform suits our colonel so well, doesn't it?
DECEMBER, 1941 ZHEDOVSK, SOVIET UNION
Get off!
Get off, now!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Get off!
Move it!
This will be a grave for the Germans' today!
Thank you, sir!
Show the cowardly Germans the valor of the Soviet army!
It's mine!
Charge!
Attack!
Charge!
Charge!
Attack!
Charge!
Fire!
Charge!
Let go, you bastard!
What?
You wanna live, too?
I do, too!
I'm not dying here!
You die!
You die!
Tatsuo!
Move it!
Move it!
Charge!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Damn bastards!
No bullets!
Jong-dae!
Let's run!
This is dying like dogs!
It may be for you, but not me!
Charge!
You don't have any more bullets!
Charge!
Charge!
There is no retreat!
Jong-dae!
Come back!
Don't run away!
Come back!
There is no retreat!
Charge!
Charge!
Attack!
There is no retreat!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
What's with my goddamned life
Shit, I wanted to live it up
I'm so sorry, Jun-shik
Jong-dae
I want to see Eun-soo
I miss Eun-soo
Jun-shik
No, Jun-shik
Stay right here
Don't go out there
Charge!
There is no retreat!
I'll kill anyone who tries to run!
Charge ahead!
Attack!
Fools!
Attack!
Don't show your back to the enemy!
Charge!
Attack!
You'll need it to make it over the mountains
Where do you plan to go?
To German territory
I hope we're going the right way
I hope the snow stops
Even if we make it to German territory it won't be easy to make it back home
You don't have to come, if you don't want to
Back then
Why didn't you kill me?
Tatsuo!
Wake up!
I'll go find some medicine
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
I'll be right back
Help!
Help me!
I'm a Japanese soldier My friend's in danger
What's he saying?
I'm a Japanese soldier We're on the same side!
Take him away!
I'm a Japanese soldier, not a POW!
Let go!
You bastard!
Help me!
A man is dying!
Please!
Take him away, now!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Search every corner
You go up that way I'll go this way 3 YEARS LATER
There's word that the Allied Forces will invade Nord-Pas-de-Calais
Then we hit the jackpot getting stationed in Normandy
If Germany loses, aren't we all dead anyways?
Think they'll take us back?
We'd be lucky if they don't call us traitors and shoot us
That's why we should run away
You said you'll run for 2 years now
I'm going for sure this time
I heard from a man in another unit
There's a secret merchant ship to Jamaica at Cherbourg Harbor
How'll you get there?
Swim?
If you get caught trying to run, you'll be shot!
Wanna make a bet?
I bet 50 marks you can't run away
Bet 100 marks, stupid
Bet even your boots, you pig
May, 1944, NORMANDY, FRANCE will build additional defense walls and defense lines in the Atlantic
From tomorrow, you will build defense walls on the shore with unit 795
Our job is to build the defense encampment on Normandy hill
March forward!
Hurry up!
Squad 3!
Unit 2!
Go to barracks 14!
HEY
Shouldn't you give up looking for your Korean friend?
You're the only Asian here
That guy's so lucky
He gets to go in and out of base at will
Tatsuo!
Aren't you coming in?
Let's go
Go ahead I'll rest here for a sec
See ya later, then
I thought you might be dead
But you're here in the Eastern battalion
When did you come to Normandy?
Jun-shik?
Did you say something?
Can you repeat it?
Tatsuo!
It's more comfortable this way
I can't hear gunshots or screams
It's over
Let's play soccer
Tatsuo!
We're going to play against Squad 8!
Man, they're fast
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I lost cuz my rubber shoes fell off,
But I was happy to have a new running mate
We came much too far
How long will it take to run home from here?
More than a year, right?
We know the Allied forces will attack Nord-Pas-de-Calais
The Eastern battalion will all be sent to Nord-Pas-de-Calais!
You will all be reborn as true German soldiers!
Pack up your gear
We move out at 09:00 hours tomorrow!
Dismissed!
We're all dead I thought we'd be safe in Normandy
What's going on?
We're being transferred
It's nothing
Sending us to battle but feeding us this rubbish
I thought we'd get wine and steak when we came to France
Damn
Karim
I'm going to Cherbourg at dawn
Are you crazy?
I got the contact info from Roman ls Roman going?
That liar
How will you get there?
The food truck always leaves at dawn
We gotta go when you're on watch
Think it over If you get caught, you're dead
Is it cuz of your friend?
Fine
I'll see you at dawn
We're not going to Nord-Pas-de-Calais
We're going to Cherbourg
Cherbourg?
A ship there will take us home
Jun-shik
Let's go home where your sister and father are
Can we really make it home?
We could get killed on the way
Still, we can't die here
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Tatsuo!
Those aren't planes, are they?
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Stay there!
I'll come to you!
Wait for me!
Hurry!
It's an attack!
Prepare for battle!
The Allied Forces have attacked!
To your battle positions!
Hurry and grab the machine gun!
Grab it!
Everyone to your battle positions!
Move it!

Fire!
Fire!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!

Are you okay?
Let's get out of here, now!
Grab the machine gun!
Now!
Hurry up, you fools!
Can't you see the enemy!
Reload and fire, now!
Allied forces attacked!
Send re-inforcements!
Let's run for it
Don't lag behind
You'll be watching my back as you run
Are you okay?
This won't kill me Let's go!
Jun-shik
Come on!
We have to get home!
Tatsuo
Are you okay?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
You're Jun-shik Kim from now on
If you say you're Japanese, they might kill you
Say you were dragged here and forced into the Eastern battalion
Jun-shik!
Wake up!
I have no regrets
Though I couldn't achieve my dream
You can't go like this!
Let's go home and run together!
Jun-shik
I wanted to run again when I go back home
Promise you'll make it back alive
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I was happy to have a new running mate
Ready, go!
Isn't the air nice, Tatsuo?
You'll get used to it here soon
I'm sure you'll make good friends here
It's Jun-shik!
I'm faster than a car!
Grandpa!
You show the signs of a great imperial soldier already
Welcome, my boy
How've you been, Father?
Greet them
He's the new, young master
Jun-shik Kim, sir
I'm Eun-soo Kim, sir
Great, Tatsuo
You have a new friend your age
Tatsuo runs well.
Like you
My brother's the best runner in Kyung-sung, sir
I'm the best in Tokyo
No match for a country boy
Wanna race me?
Ready
Go!
Hasegawa beat Korea's Jun-shik Kim in the 4th high school marathons!
Korea's son, Jun-shik Kim, beat Hasegawa Tatsuo and won!
"HASEGAWA TATSUO WINS NATIONAL MARATHONS AGAIN!"
"KIM JUN-SHIK WINS!"
Congratulations
Jun-shik Kim, the light of Korean marathon
Hasegawa Tatsuo, the star of Japanese marathon wins again
Good job chasing behind me
Must be your damn lucky day
Let's applaud Hasegawa Tatsuo who won the national high school marathon and brought great honor to Imperial Japan
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Long live...
This is my grandson, Tatsuo
You must be very proud
I expect a lot from you
Thank you
It's a gift from the Japanese Minister of Defense
Open it
Yes, sir
Give me that!
Get away!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
- Father!
- Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Do something!
Father, please!
Do something!
You're a doctor who saves lives!
Why aren't you doing anything?
- You killed him!
- No
You killed him!
No
Bring my grandfather back!
Let go!
He didn't kill anyone!
You bastards killed him!
Jun-shik!
Bring my grandfather back!
No!
- Daddy!
- No!
I didn't do it!
Daddy!
- Jun-shik!
- Daddy!
Father!
Bring my grandfather back!
Father!
Jun-shik
Bring my grandfather back!
Let go!
- Father!
Father
-Daddy...
Daddy
Don't show your face around here again
Or I might kill you
Korea's hero, Ki-jung Sohn won an Olympic gold medal!
Rejoice!
MAY, 1938, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Why do you have sandbags strapped on?
Are you a marathon runner?
Korea's luck in the marathon stops with Ki-jung Sohn
A Korean man will never be an Olympic victor again
Koreans are banned from Olympics 'cause Sohn covered the Japanese flag?
If you were a bomb,
I'd run straight into the Athletics Association
Marathon running is a science demanding concentration and fighting spirit
I'll prove it once and for all at the Olympic tryouts
Can you go any faster?
You might regret it
I'll pay double if you get there in 30 minutes
Triple for 20 minutes
Hold on tight
Your victory in the tryouts is a given
What is your goal in the Olympics?
I'll win the gold and set a new record
- What a laugh?
- In honor of our great empire!
Look out!
Look out!
Let's go!
Coming through!
Move!
Out of the way!
To a marathon gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
You're quite the runner
Here you are
Double would've been fine
Opportunities come to those who don't give up
Jun-shik Kim
Jun-shik!
Are you okay?
Isn't that...
Are you all so happy over half of a race?
I'm Ki-jung Sohn
Ki-jung Sohn's in Japan
Wanna bet?
If I win, I get to marry your sister
Hurry
You say Japan and Korea are one yet you ban Koreans from tryouts?
Are you claiming the Athletics Association is unjust?
Your comment, Mr. Chairman?
The board has decided
If a Japanese runner will win anyways, what's the problem?
It'll be boring for Hasegawa without Jun-shik Kim
I think Jun-shik Kim shouldn't be in the discussion
See!
Jun-shik Kim?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim, what have you been up to?
What are your thoughts on the ban on Korean runners?
Are you still training?
How much do you train each day?
Your comments, please
Mr. Hasegawa?
Are you confident you'll win even if Jun-shik Kim enters?
You think he stands a chance against me?
But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better than yours?
That was in the past
You think a mere rickshaw driver can beat a well-trained marathoner?
If you could enter, are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?
How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?
I'd be grateful just to enter the race
Here is your acceptance letter from Berlin Medical University
Sign it
The marathon is more important to me than my studies
This is the most important period in your life
Focus on your studies
Our men are sacrificing their lives to build a Greater East Asia
I don't want to be a coward who runs away from war
War is futile
You are insulting Grandfather
Tatsuo, watch what you say
Think of the people before your country
That's the way of a doctor
Then I must treat the Korean people who killed my grandfather?
Even if it kills me, I'll never do that
The picture is missing from the frame in my room
Jong-dae!
Why you
Why would someone steal a picture of all things?
It should be around somewhere
Anyway, I hope you can enter the tryouts
Father will be so happy
Don't get your hopes up
Can't trust the Japs
Get more firewood.
The fire's dying
Please?
It's so pretty
How do I look?
Eun-soo
I think you're the prettiest girl in all of Asia
"OLYMPIC TRYOUTS ENTRY FORM"
Please win and bring hope to Korea again
I can really enter the race?
Show them how scary a mere rickshaw driver can be!
Jun-shik
Listen carefully
The man in front of Jun-shik is Ki-jung Sohn
Then, you must be holding the Olympic tryouts entry form
If I'm right, hold it up high!
Yes!
Let me see!
Yes!
Sir!
Sir!
Jun-shik!
Min-woo!
Everyone!
Korea's best marathoner, Jun-shik Kim, will run the marathon again!
Hurray for Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik Kim!
Get the rice cake kings ate!
Rice cakes here!
Here you are
Father picked it out himself
The best pair there is
Promise you'll win the race today?
Tatsuo
Your father will be here soon!
Look
Let's relieve all our Korean folks' heartaches today!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik Kim!
Act according to the plans.
Runners to the starting line!
You can do it!
And they're off!
Tatsuo!
Go, Jun-shik
Tatsuo, go get 'em!
Hasegawa!
Faster!
Faster!
Jun-shik, you're half way there!
Don't mind Jun-shik Kim
Hasegawa!
Spurt ahead!
Spurt ahead!
Hasegawa!
The runners will come into the stadium any minute!
Why are you so late?
A surgery took long
What a tense moment!
There!
The runners can be finally seen!
Who is the first runner coming in?
Who will it be?
As expected, it's Hasegawa with Kimura behind him!
What?
There's another runner!
It's Jun-shik Kim!
You can do it
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim!
Go, Jun-shik!
Kimura!
Kimura!
Hey!
What's that bastard doing!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
The rickshaw won!
Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
The last runner is coming in!
It's a dream come true!
The medals will be awarded soon
I knew you could do it!
Ladies and gentlemen, the results will now be announced
The winner of All Japan Olympic Marathon Tryouts is
Hasegawa Tatsuo!
Second is number 13, Ando!
Third is number 18, Kimura!
Will the three runners come up to the victory stand?
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura
Please come to the victory stand
- Jun-shik Kim was first!
- What's he saying?
Jun-shik Kim!
Spectators, please calm down and be seated
Jun-shik Kim has been disqualified for blocking Kimura's way
Disqualified?
How!
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
Is this why you let me enter?
Go back.
Didn't you hear you've been disqualified?
You should've run fair and square
Fair and square?
Crazy bastards
Try saying it again!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Damn bastards!
Damn bastards!
Jong-dae!
Hasegawa!
Please come up to the victory stand, immediately!
The winner of the Olympic tryouts is Jun-shik Kim!
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura!
Please come up, immediately!
You bastards cheated first!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
This court has decided on the following sentence
Based on section 4 of the legal code, all accomplices of the riot will become Imperial soldiers and swear allegiance to the Emperor
Mother!
Mother!
I didn't do anything!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Eun-soo!
Jun-shik!
Father!
Father!
Jun-shik!
Soldiers must behave with decorum
Soldiers must behave with decorum
Stop mumbling!
Soldiers must always improve their battle skills
I don't believe this
Soldiers must always improve their battle skills
Soldiers must serve with utmost loyalty
Soldiers must serve with utmost loyalty
Soldiers must always be frugal
Soldiers must always be frugal
Frugal...
"JULY, 1939, NOMONHAN, MONGOLIAN BORDERLAND"
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
That way!
Concentrate!
Get up there!
Retreat!
Min-woo!
You okay?
It's me, Jun-shik
Wake up!
Shit.
I should've fought for independence instead
Who would've guessed we'd end up fighting for the Japs here?
Our damn fortunes
I'm starving to death
You're hungry 24 hours a day
Grow up will you?
Hey!
Hurry up!
Lazy Korean fools!
Yes, sir
Let's hurry
Hope you get shot down dead
He's really dead?
- Choon-bok!
Your butt!
- What?
Where's it coming from?
I almost got my head blown off
The broken wall at 1 o'clock
I heard the 1st regiment got attacked, too.
It's him
Just our damn luck
Jong-dae!
Cover me
No!
Stay back, Jun-shik!
Cover him!
Choon-bok!
Cover him!
Are you okay Jun-shik?
It's great you shot down just Japs, but Noda's gonna kill us
She killed so many
Hey!
Don't hog all the food!
Give me some
Don't slobber over it!
Give me some!
This is you?
You keep eating.
I'll look at this
Fine, I'll show you.
Let me see first
Not that sexy
She's crying
Cuz you took her picture
No, it's cuz you ate all her beef jerky
Fools.
Why'd you make her cry?
The bullets happened to swerve and hit only Japanese soldiers?
Did the bitch smell your Kimchi breath?
Talk, you fools!
Speak, you bastards!
Who sent you here!
Say it!
I'm Shirai from Hailaer
You raped my mother before my father, and raped me, too
Listen!
There are many like me in China
China will never lose to you!
I will never forgive!
Never!
Tell me!
Why did the bullets fly past you Korean rubbish!
Speak, you bastards!
Damn it!
Stop it!
I said no speaking Korean!
Enough
That won't bring back the dead!
Go back to your work places
What's all this?
Who's coming?
Colonel
I'm Colonel Takakura
Company, halt!
Attention!
What?
Why's that bastard here?
Colonel Hasegawa, what brings you here?
Private Takakura ever drive past honorable Imperial soldiers' corpses?
Mukai!
Yes, sir
First!
For shamefully ordering a retreat, you're demoted to private as of today
Second
Private Takakura will prove loyalty to our Emperor and commit hara-kiri!
Be thankful our Emperor granted you an honorable death!
Long live our Emperor!
Handle the deceased with due respect
Yes, sir
Remember, after feeding off corpses, crows can come and gouge out your eyes
I'm Hasegawa Tatsuo
I came here to demolish
Soviet tanks!
I'll show them true power of the Imperial army!
When out of bullets, Imperial soldiers must charge with bayonets!
If bayonets are broken, we must fight with bare hands!
Imperial soldiers do not leave the battlefield till death!
Understood!
Yes, sir
We either win or die
First!
We'll build a pontoon bridge over Khalkhin River within 48 hours
Second!
We'll form a special suicide unit of 50 men to demolish tanks
All officers will stand with me at the vanguard of the special unit!
Mukai!
Yes, sir!
Write up the list and have it on my desk by tomorrow
Dismissed!
Dismissed!
I'm sorry about your picture
I glued it together
Take it
I have a sister like you back home
My name is Jun-shik Kim
Thank you
"Shei-shei ni"?
The sun's going down!
Hurry up, you bastards!
Stop dawdling!
Hurry up!
Work harder!
When the sun goes down, it's over!
Squad 9!
Damn slow Korean dogs!
Build this in 2 days?
He's insane!
They worked us from dawn!
Where's the food!
Stop talking about food!
You're making me hungry
Choon-bok?
What's "Shei-shei ni"?
Learning Chinese?
Why do you keep asking?
Just tell me
It means thank you
Stop working!
Attention!
At ease
I heard Tatsuo was your marathon rival
He didn't stand a chance
Jun-shik's way better!
Come out!
Keep that in your mouth and come out!
Choon-bok Hwang!
Come out faster than a bullet, or you'll drink all the water here!
Repeat after me
I'm a barbarian
I'm a barbarian
I'm a Korean
I'm a Korean
Repeat that, keep the fish in, and do squats till sundown!
Begin!
Catching fish on duty or running during bedtime!
You think this is a playground?
Make sure everything gets incinerated
Yes, sir!
No!
How dare you!
Not my running shoes!
Oh, is that so?
If you wanna run, do it barefoot
Where are you going, fool!
Damn bastards!
How many more beatings you need!
Korean dog!
No!
Gwang-choon?
This side's sinking
What?
There's a screw lose
Who unscrewed this?
It was there before
Squad 9!
Step forward
If we went on like this tomorrow, what would've happened?
From now on, the engineering unit will fix up Squad 9's area
Squad 9 will hold the faulty plank on their heads
And return to the base before sundown
The best marathoner will be leading you
The plank must be leveled!
Keep it leveled!
Noda, the bastard!
Save your breath
Just walk, Jun-shik We'll hold up the plank
Don't worry
If you hurt your knee, it's over!
Listen!
Keep it leveled!
One!
Two!
How is it?
Cool enough for you
Squad 9 sluggards!
John Yushe.
Yes sir.
Yueh Sanchin.
Yes sir.
Jong-dae Lee!
Yes, sir
Jun-shik Kim!
Yes, sir
Why're they calling us this time?
Attention!
The 50 soldiers called will fight in tomorrow's attack
On a special suicide mission with me
What did he say?
Suicide?
Us?
We will carry bombs and demolish enemy tanks at dawn
Fight like Imperial soldiers and die with honor
I'll kill anyone.
Who dares retreat
Koreans should be honored to be included in this heroic mission
I'm not taking part in this operation
Oh, really?
For what reason?
The Korean soldiers and I didn't volunteer we cannot consent to a mission that demands death
Your permission to shoot, sir!
Dare disobey me?
All Koreans here, including our squad, think the same
I'll ask again
Are you disobeying me?
This is insane
Execute him with the other POWs!
Before we march out tomorrow
Have fun on your last night
Stupid bastards!
Are you okay?
I'll be executed at dawn
Like this
The Japanese are evil
Korea and China are foolish
I'm not afraid to die
I'm just mad I couldn't kill more Japanese fools
If I could, I'd get more revenge
I'd kill them all!
What are you doing?
If we're gonna die like dogs, might as well save Jun-shik!
Hurry up
Hurry!
Shirai
Why her?
Pull her out!
Why?
At a time like this
It's coming!
Run!

Korea's hero, Ki-jung Sohn won an Olympic gold medal!
Rejoice!
MAY, 1938, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Why do you have sandbags strapped on?
Are you a marathon runner?
Korea's luck in the marathon stops with Ki-jung Sohn
A Korean man will never be an Olympic victor again
Koreans are banned from Olympics 'cause Sohn covered the Japanese flag?
If you were a bomb,
I'd run straight into the Athletics Association
Marathon running is a science demanding concentration and fighting spirit
I'll prove it once and for all at the Olympic tryouts
Can you go any faster?
You might regret it
I'll pay double if you get there in 30 minutes
Triple for 20 minutes
Hold on tight
Your victory in the tryouts is a given
What is your goal in the Olympics?
I'll win the gold and set a new record
- What a laugh?
-In honor of our great empire!
Look out!
Look out!
Let's go!
Coming through!
Move!
Out of the way!
To a marathon gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics!
- Cheers!
-Cheers!
You're quite the runner
Here you are
Double would've been fine
Opportunities come to those who don't give up

Jun-shik!
Are you okay?
Isn't that...
Are you all so happy over half of a race?
I'm Ki-jung Sohn
Ki-jung Sohn's in Japan
Wanna bet?
If I win, I get to marry your sister
Hurry
You say Japan and Korea are one yet you ban Koreans from tryouts?
Are you claiming the Athletics Association is unjust?
Your comment, Mr. Chairman?
The board has decided
If a Japanese runner will win anyways, what's the problem?
It'll be boring for Hasegawa without Jun-shik Kim
I think Jun-shik Kim shouldn't be in the discussion
See!
Jun-shik Kim?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik Kim, what have you been up to?
What are your thoughts on the ban on Korean runners?
Are you still training?
How much do you train each day?
Your comments, please
Mr. Hasegawa?
Are you confident you'll win even if Jun-shik Kim enters?
You think he stands a chance against me?
But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better than yours?
That was in the past
You think a mere rickshaw driver can beat a well-trained marathoner?
If you could enter, are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?
How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?
I'd be grateful just to enter the race
Here is your acceptance letter from Berlin Medical University
Sign it
The marathon is more important to me than my studies
This is the most important period in your life
Focus on your studies
Our men are sacrificing their lives to build a Greater East Asia
I don't want to be a coward who runs away from war
War is futile
You are insulting Grandfather
Tatsuo, watch what you say
Think of the people before your country
That's the way of a doctor
Then I must treat the Korean people who killed my grandfather?
Even if it kills me, I'll never do that
The picture is missing from the frame in my room
Jong-dae!
Why you
Why would someone steal a picture of all things?
It should be around somewhere
Anyway, I hope you can enter the tryouts
Father will be so happy
Don't get your hopes up
Can't trust the Japs
Get more firewood.

It's so pretty
How do I look?

Don't mind Jun-shik Kim

Spurt ahead!
Spurt ahead!

The runners will come into the stadium any minute!
Why are you so late?
A surgery took long
What a tense moment!
There!
The runners can be finally seen!
Who is the first runner coming in?
Who will it be?
As expected, it's Hasegawa with Kimura behind him!
What?
There's another runner!
It's Jun-shik Kim!
You can do it

Second is number 13, Ando!

Please come to the victory stand
- Jun-shik Kim was first!

Spectators, please calm down and be seated
Jun-shik Kim has been disqualified for blocking Kimura's way
Disqualified?
How!
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
Is this why you let me enter?
Go back.
Didn't you hear you've been disqualified?
You should've run fair and square
Fair and square?

Everyone retreat!
That Way!
Concentrate!
Get up there!
Retreat!
Min-woo!
You okay?
It's me, Jun-shik
Wake up!
Shit.
I should've fought for independence instead
Who would've guessed we'd end up fighting for the Japs here?
Our damn fortunes
I'm starving to death
You're hungry 24 hours a day
Grow up will you?
Hey!
Hurry up!
Lazy Korean fools!
Yes, sir
Let's hurry
Hope you get shot down dead
He's really dead?
- Choon-bok!
Your butt!
-What?
Where's it coming from?
I almost got my head blown off
The broken wall at 1 o'clock
I heard the 1st regiment got attacked, too.
It's him
Just our damn luck
Jong-dae!
Cover me
No!
Stay back, Jun-shik!
Cover him!
Choon-bok!
Cover him!
Are you okay Jun-shik?
It's great you shot down just Japs, but Noda's gonna kill us
She killed so many
Hey!
Don't hog all the food!
Give me some
Don't slobber over it!
Give me some!
This is you?
You keep eating.
I'll look at this
Fine, I'll show you.
Let me see first
Not that sexy
She's crying
Cuz you took her picture
No, it's cuz you ate all her beef jerky
Fools.
Why'd you make her cry?
The bullets happened to swerve and hit only Japanese soldiers?
Did the bitch smell your Kimchi breath?
Talk, you fools!
Speak, you bastards!
Who sent you here!
Say it!
I'm Shirai from Hailaer
You raped my mother before my father, and raped me, too
Listen!
There are many like me in China
China will never lose to you!
I will never forgive!
Never!
Tell me!
Why did the bullets fly past you Korean rubbish!
Speak, you bastards!
Damn it!
Stop it!
I said no speaking Korean!
Enough
That won't bring back the dead!
Go back to your work places
What's all this?
Who's coming?
Colonel
I'm Colonel Takakura
Company, halt!
Attention!
What?
Why's that bastard here?
Colonel Hasegawa, what brings you here?
Private Takakura ever drive past honorable Imperial soldiers' corpses?
Mukai!
Yes, sir
First!
For shamefully ordering a retreat, you're demoted to private as of today
Second
Private Takakura will prove loyalty to our Emperor and commit hara-kiri!
Be thankful our Emperor granted you an honorable death!
Long live our Emperor!
Handle the deceased with due respect
Yes, sir
Remember, after feeding off corpses, crows can come and gouge out your eyes
I'm Hasegawa Tatsuo
I came here to demolish
Soviet tanks!
I'll show them true power of the Imperial army!
When out of bullets, Imperial soldiers must charge with bayonets!
If bayonets are broken, we must fight with bare hands!
Imperial soldiers do not leave the battlefield till death!
Understood!
Yes, sir
We either win or die
First!
We'll build a pontoon bridge over Khalkhin River within 48 hours
Second!
We'll form a special suicide unit of 50 men to demolish tanks
All officers will stand with me at the vanguard of the special unit!
Mukai!
Yes, sir!
Write up the list and have it on my desk by tomorrow
Dismissed!
Dismissed!
I'm sorry about your picture
I glued it together
Take it
I have a sister like you back home
My name is Jun-shik Kim

He's insane!
They worked us from dawn!
Where's the food!
Stop talking about food!
You're making me hungry
Choon-bok?
What's "Shei-shei ni"?
Learning Chinese?
Why do you keep asking?
Just tell me
It means thank you
Stop working!
Attention!
At ease
I heard Tatsuo was your marathon rival
He didn't stand a chance
Jun-shik's way better!
Come out!
Keep that in your mouth and come out!
Choon-bok Hwang!
Come out faster than a bullet, or you'll drink all the water here!
Repeat after me
I'm a barbarian
I'm a Korean
Repeat that, keep the fish in, and do squats till sundown!
Begin!
Catching fish on duty or running during bedtime!
You think this is a playground?
Make sure everything gets incinerated
Yes, sir!
No!
How dare you!
Not my running shoes!
Oh, is that so?

Squad 9 will hold the faulty plank on their heads
And return to the base before sundown
The best marathoner will be leading you
The plank must be leveled!
Keep it leveled!
Noda, the bastard!
Save your breath
Just walk, Jun-shik We'll hold up the plank
Don't worry
If you hurt your knee, it's over!
Listen!
Keep it leveled!
One!

How is it?
Cool enough for you

Yes, sir
Why're they calling us this time?
Attention!
The 50 soldiers called will fight in tomorrow's attack
On a special suicide mission with me
What did he say?
Suicide?
Us?
We will carry bombs and demolish enemy tanks at dawn
Fight like Imperial soldiers and die with honor
I'll kill anyone.
Who dares retreat
Koreans should be honored to be included in this heroic mission
I'm not taking part in this operation
Oh, really?
For what reason?
The Korean soldiers and I didn't volunteer we cannot consent to a mission that demands death
Your permission to shoot, sir!
Dare disobey me?
All Koreans here, including our squad, think the same
I'll ask again
Are you disobeying me?
This is insane
Execute him with the other POWs!
Before we march out tomorrow
Have fun on your last night
Stupid bastards!
Are you okay?
I'll be executed at dawn
Like this
The Japanese are evil
Korea and China are foolish
I'm not afraid to die
I'm just mad I couldn't kill more Japanese fools
If I could, I'd get more revenge
I'd kill them all!
What are you doing?
If we're gonna die like dogs, might as well save Jun-shik!

It's okay, Jun-shik
Don't
It's okay
Hold still
Germany invaded the Soviet Union
The Soviets may speed up exchanging POWs to reinforce their army
Number 1277!
He's one of your men
Anton!
Go catch him!
Yes, sir!
It's time for frosebite examination
Where's Choon-bok?
Take him away
Gwang-choon!
NO!
No!
Drag him out!
Let's go!
I'm fine!
I can still work, sir!
Tell 'em Jun-shik!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
- I want to live, Jun-shik!
- Gwang-choon!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Let gQ!
Help!
Gwang-choon!
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You're not hiding in here, are you?
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
- You son of a bitch!
-Shut up!
Come out, pal!
Come out!
You wanna die?
I was starving
Put the bread down and come out now
What do we do?
What do we do?
Who's there?
How dare you steal, you bastard!
He's the one
- He's the thief!
- What are you doing?
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
Please Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
A rat sneaked into our food storage today
Luckily we caught him, thanks to comrade Anton
As you know, stealing is punishable by death
Jong-dae!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
I'm scared!
Tell 'em I didn't eat the bread!
Execute him!
Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Make it back home alive!
Is it because of this?
This is more important than a friend's life?
This is who you really are?
Call yourself human?
Yeah, I'm not human
I'm not the Jong-dae you know!
I'm Anton!
I'm Anton, you bastard!
Call me Anton from now on!
Got that!
How long do you think this armband will protect you?
How could you do that to Choon-bok?
What do you know?
You don't know anything!
Shut up and stay out of my life
Do you know that Gwang-choon died?
He's probably nothing, but ashes by now
If you pull that again in front of them, I'll kill you
Your emperor abandoned you
How dare you speak of our Emperor!
POW repatriation has been denied
We showed mercy on you, but the Japanese refused
They're battling Americans in the Pacific and have no interest in you
You expect me to believe that?
Imperial soldiers are sons of the Emperor
A father does not abandon his son
That's what you want to believe
You naive, poor, abandoned son
You will also face death in the incinerator here
It's a Kokeshi ls your hometown Yamagata?
You're good
You know, sir?
Have you been there?
My grandfather took me there when I was young
It's a beautiful place
I grew up there my whole life
My family ran a carpentry shop for generations
When I go back,
I want to be a great carpenter like my father
Do you know why I chose to be your adjutant for Nomonhan, sir?
Because I saw your firm conviction for our country in your eyes
Conviction
Look out!
Son of a bitch!
Tsukamoto!
You okay?
Wake up!
I go easy on you, you cripple, and for what!
Jong-dae!
We're doing our best, too!
Your best?
I'll show you my best in beating!
You son of a bitch!
You call that your best!
You bastards!
This is the best!
Jong-dae Lee!
It's Anton, fool!
He's dead
Lieutenant!
What?
Never seen a man die before?
Get back to work, you bastards!
Work, you fools!
Get back to work now!
You fools never listen!
Damn Jap!
How dare you!
Stop it!
I told you to stay out of my way!
Damn Jap!
I gotta beat it into your head?
You bastards!
Damn Jap!
You son of bitch!
Kill 'em!
Bastards!
Back to your posts!
Stop!
You bastards!
There is no mercy for those who started the riot!
Begin the executions!
It's an urgent telegram, sir
Grab a uniform!
Change into now!
Germany has declared war against us
Comrade Stalin has given you too, your final calling
The choice is yours
Those who want to convert may wear Soviet army uniforms
- Go get the uniforms!
Hurry!
-Yes, sir
Hurry up and put it on!
Anton
This is a great opportunity for you
I hope you come back victorious
Long live the Soviet Union!
Good luck!
Comrade!
Please give them a chance, too
Let them go!
Thank you, sir!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurry up and put it on!
Hasegawa Tatsuo This is your last chance
I'llsay it one more time.
Put it on.
Let's give it a good shot
It's better than freezing to death
Right, Jun-shik?
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Bastards
The Soviet army uniform suits our colonel so well, doesn't it?
"DECEMBER, 1941 ZHEDOVSK, SOVIET UNION"
Get off!
Get off, now!
Get off!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Get off!
Move it!
This will be a grave for the Germans' today!
Thank you, sir!
Show the cowardly Germans the valor of the Soviet army!
It's mine!
You are proud Soviet soldiers!

I'll kill anyone who tries to run!
Charge ahead!
Attack!
Fools!

Imperial soldier don't retreat!
Charge!

You'll need it to make it over the mountains
Where do you plan to go?
To German territory
I hope we're going the right way
I hope the snow stops
Even if we make it to German territory it won't be easy to make it back home
You don't have to come, if you don't want to
Back then
Why didn't you kill me?
Tatsuo!
Wake up!
I'll go find some medicine kim...
Jun-shik kim
I'll be right back
Help!
Help me!
Help me!
I'm a Japanese soldier
My friend's in danger
What's he saying?
I'm a Japanese soldier
We're on the same side!
Take him away!
I'm a Japanese soldier, not a POW!
Let gQ!
You bastard!
help me!
A man is dying!
Please!
Take him away, now!
Let go!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Let gQ!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Search every corner
You go up that way
"3 YEARS LATER"
There's word that the Allied Forces will invade Nord-Pas-de-Calais
Then we hit the jackpot getting stationed in Normandy
If Germany loses, aren't we all dead anyways?
Think they'll take us back?
We'd be lucky if they don't call us traitors and shoot us
That's why we should run away
You said you'll run for 2 years now
I'm going for sure this time
I heard from a man in another unit
There's a secret merchant ship to Jamaica at Cherbourg Harbor
How'll you get there?
Swim?
If you get caught trying to run, you'll be shot!
Wanna make a bet?
I bet 50 marks you can't run away
Bet 100 marks, stupid
Bet even your boots, you pig
"May, 1944, NORMANDY, FRANCE"
Our battalion will build additional defense walls and defense lines in the Atlantic
From tomorrow, you will build defense walls on the shore with unit 795
Ourjob is to build the defense encampment on Normandy hill
March forward!
Hurry up!
Squad 3!
Unit 2!
Go to barracks 14!
H93'
Shouldn't you give up looking for your Korean friend?
You're the only Asian here
That guy's so lucky
He gets to go in and out of base at will
Tatsuo!
Aren't you coming in?
Let's go
Go ahead, I'll rest here for a sec
See ya later, then
I thought you might be dead
But you're here in the Eastern battalion
When did you come to Normandy?
Jun-shik?
Did you say something?
Can you repeat it?
Tatsuo!
It's more comfortable this way
I can't hear gunshots or screams
It's over
Let's play soccer
Tatsuo!
We're going to play against Squad 8!
Man, they're fast
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in I lost cuz my rubber shoes fell off,
But I was happy to have a new running mate
We came much too far
How long will it take to run home from here?
More than a year, right?
We know the Allied forces will attack Nord-Pas-de-Calais
The Eastern battalion will all be sent to Nord-Pas-de-Calais!
You will all be reborn as true German soldiers!
Pack up your gear
We move out at 09:00 hours tomorrow!
Dismissed!
We're all dead I thought we'd be safe in Normandy
What's going on?
We're being transferred
It's nothing
Sending us to battle but feeding us this rubbish
I thought we'd get wine and steak when we came to France
Damn
Karim
I'm going to Cherbourg at dawn
Are you crazy?
I got the contact info from Roman ls Roman going?
That liar
How will you get there?
The food truck always leaves at dawn
We gotta go when you're on watch
Think it over
If you get caught, you're dead
Is it cuz of your friend?
Fine
I'll see you at dawn
We're not going to Nord-Pas-de-Calais
We're going to Cherbourg
Cherbourg?
A ship there will take us home
Jun-shik
Let's go home where your sister and father are
Can we really make it home?
We could get killed on the way
Still, we can't die here
Karim!
Karim!

Those aren't planes, are they?

Let's get out of here, now!
Grab the machine gun!
Now!
Hurry up, you fools!
Can't you see the enemy!
Reload and fire, now!
Allied forces attacked!
Send re-inforcements!
Damn it
Let's run for it
Don't lag behind
You'll be watching my back as you run
Are you okay?
This won't kill me
Let's go!
Jun-shik
Come on!
We have to get home!
Tatsuo
Are you okay?
Jun-shik
Jun-shik
You're Jun-shik Kim from now on
If you say you're Japanese, they might kill you
Say you were dragged here and forced into the Eastern battalion
Jun-shik!
Wake up!
I have no regrets
Though I couldn't achieve my dream
You can't go like this!
Let's go home and run together!
Jun-shik
I wanted to run again when I go back home
Promise you'll make it back alive...
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
I sometimes think of when we first ran together
The day you moved in
I was happy to have a new running mate
Ready, go!
Isn't the air nice, Tatsuo?
You'll get used to it here soon.
I'm sure you'll make good friends here.
It's Jun-shik!
I'm faster than a car!
Grandpa!
You show the signs of a great imperial soldier already.
Welcome, my boy!
How've you been, Father?
Greet them!
He's the new, young master.
Jun-shik Kim, sir.
I'm Eun-soo Kim, sir.
Great, Tatsuo.
You have a new friend your age.
Tatsuo runs well.
Like you.
My brother's the best runner in Kyung-sung, sir.
I'm the best in Tokyo.
No match for a country boy.
Wanna race me?
Ready.
Go!
Hasegawa beat Korea's Jun-shik Kim in the 4th high school marathons!
Korea's son, Jun-shik Kim, beat Hasegawa Tatsuo and won!
"HASEGAWA TATSUO WINS NATIONAL MARATHONS AGAIN!"
"KIM JUN-SHIK WINS!"
Congratulations!
Jun-shik Kim, the light of Korean marathon.
Hasegawa Tatsuo, the star of Japanese marathon wins again.
Good job chasing behind me.
Must be your damn lucky day.
Let's applaud Hasegawa Tatsuo.
who won the national high school marathon.
and brought great honor to Imperial Japan.
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Long live...
This is my grandson, Tatsuo.
You must be very proud.
I expect a lot from you.
Thank you.
It's a gift from the Japanese Minister of Defense.
Open it!
Yes, sir.
Give me that!
Get away!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
- Father!
- Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Do something!
Father, please!
Do something!
You're a doctor who saves lives!
Why aren't you doing anything?
- You killed him!
- No.
- You killed him!
- No.
Bring my grandfather back!
Let go!
He didn't kill anyone!
- You bastards killed him!
- Jun-shik!
- Bring my grandfather back!
- No!
- Daddy!
- No!
I didn't do it!
- Daddy!
- Jun-shik!

Father!
- Daddy...
Daddy!
Don't show your face around here again!
Or I might kill you.
Korea's hero, Ki-jung Sohn won an Olympic gold medal!
Rejoice!
MAY, 1938, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA
Why do you have sandbags strapped on?
Are you a marathon runner?
Korea's luck in the marathon stops with Ki-jung Sohn.
A Korean man will never be an Olympic victor again.
Koreans are banned from Olympics.
'cause Sohn covered the Japanese flag?
If you were a bomb,
I'd run straight into the Athletics Association.
Marathon running is a science demanding concentration and fighting spirit.
I'll prove it once and for all at the Olympic tryouts.
- Can you go any faster?
- You might regret it.
I'll pay double if you get there in 30 minutes.
Triple for 20 minutes.
Hold on tight.
Your victory in the tryouts is a given.
What is your goal in the Olympics?
I'll win the gold and set a new record.
- What a laugh?
- In honor of our great empire!
Look out!
Look out!
Let go!
Coming through!
Move!
Out of the way!
To a marathon gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
You're quite the runner.
Here you are.
Double would've been fine.
Opportunities come to those who don't give up.
Jun-shik Kim.
Jun-shik!
Are you okay?
Isn't that...
Are you all so happy over half of a race?
- I'm Ki-jung Sohn.
- Ki-jung sohn's in Japan.
Wanna bet?
If I win, I get to marry your sister.
Hurry!
You say Japan and Korea are one yet you ban Koreans from tryouts?
Are you claiming the Athletics Association is unjust?
Your comment, Mr. Chairman?
The board has decided.
If a Japanese runner will win anyways, what's the problem?
It'll be boring for Hasegawa without Jun-shik Kim.
I think Jun-shik Kim shouldn't be in the discussion.
See!
Jun-shik Kim?
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik Kim, what have you been up to?
What are your thoughts on the ban on Korean runners?
Are you still training?
How much do you train each day?
Your comments, please.
Mr. Hasegawa?
Are you confident you'll win even if Jun-shik Kim enters?
You think he stands a chance against me?
But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better than yours?
That was in the past.
You think a mere rickshaw driver can beat a well-trained marathoner?
If you could enter, are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?
How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?
I'd be grateful just to enter the race.
Here is your acceptance letter from Berlin Medical University.
Sign it!
The marathon is more important to me than my studies.
This is the most important period in your life.
Focus on your studies.
Our men are sacrificing their lives to build a Greater East Asia.
I don't want to be a coward who runs away from war.
War is futile.
You are insulting Grandfather.
Tatsuo, watch what you say.
Think of the people before your country.
That's the way of a doctor.
Then I must treat the Korean people who killed my grandfather?
Even if it kills me, I'll never do that.
The picture is missing from the frame in my room.
Jong-dae!
Why you?
Why would someone steal a picture of all things?
It should be around somewhere.
Anyway, I hope you can enter the tryouts.
Father will be so happy.
Don't get your hopes up!
Can't trust the Japs.
Get more firewood.
The fire's dying.
Please?
It's so pretty.
- How do I look?
- Eun-soo!
I think you're the prettiest girl in all of Asia.
"OLYMPIC TRYOUTS ENTRY FORM"
Please win and bring hope to Korea again!
I can really enter the race?
Show them how scary a mere rickshaw driver can be!
Jun-shik!
Listen carefully!
The man in front of Jun-shik is Ki-jung Sohn.
Then, you must be holding the Olympic tryouts entry form.
If I'm right, hold it up high!
Yes!
Let me see!
Yes!
Sir!
Sir!
Jun-shik!
Min-woo!
Everyone!
Korea's best marathoner, Jun-shik Kim, will run the marathon again!
Hurray for Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik Kim!
Get the rice cake kings ate!
Rice cakes here!
Here you are!
Father picked it out himself.
The best pair there is.
Promise you'll win the race today?
Tatsuo!
Your father will be here soon!
Look!
Let's relieve all our Korean folks' heartaches today!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik Kim!
Act according to the plans.
Runners to the starting line!
You can do it!
And they're off!
Tatsuo!
Go, Jun-shik!
Tatsuo, go get 'em!
Hasegawa!
Faster!
Faster!
Jun-shik, you're half way there!
Don't mind Jun-shik Kim!
Hasegawa!
Spurt ahead!
Spurt ahead!
Hasegawa!
The runners will come into the stadium any minute!
Why are you so late?
A surgery took long.
What a tense moment!
There!
The runners can be finally seen!
Who is the first runner coming in?
Who will it be?
As expected, it's Hasegawa with Kimura behind him!
What?
There's another runner!
It's Jun-shik Kim!
- You can do it.
- Jun-shik!
Jun-shik Kim!
Go, Jun-shik!
Kimura!
Kimura!
Hey!
What's that bastard doing!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
The rickshaw won!
Jun-shik Kim!
Hurray!
Jun-shik Kim!
The last runner is coming in!
It's a dream come true!
The medals will be awarded soon.
I knew you could do it!
Ladies and gentlemen, the results will now be announced.
The winner of All Japan Olympic Marathon Tryouts is.
Hasegawa Tatsuo!
Second is number 13, Ando!
Third is number 18, Kimura!
Will the three runners come up to the victory stand?
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura.
Please come to the victory stand!
- Jun-shik Kim was first!
- What's he saying?
Jun-shik Kim!
Spectators, please calm down and be seated.
Jun-shik Kim has been disqualified for blocking Kimura's way.
Disqualified?
How!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Is this why you let me enter?
Go back.
Didn't you hear you've been disqualified?
You should've run fair and square.
Fair and square?
Crazy bastards!
Try saying it again!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Damn bastards!
Damn bastards!
Jong-dae!
Hasegawa!
Please come up to the victory stand, immediately!
The winner of the Olympic tryouts is Jun-shik Kim!
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura!
Please come up, immediately!
You bastards cheated first!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
This court has decided on the following sentence.
Based on section 4 of the legal code, all accomplices of the riot will become Imperial soldiers and swear allegiance to the Emperor.
Mother!
Mother!
- I didn't do anything!
- Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!

Eun-soo!
Jun-shik!
Father!
Father!
Jun-shik!
Soldiers must behave with decorum.
Stop mumbling!
- Soldiers must always improve their battle skills.
- I don't believe this.
Soldiers must always improve their battle skills.
Soldiers must serve with utmost loyalty.
Soldiers must always be frugal.
Frugal...
"JULY, 1939, NOMONHAN, MONGOLIAN BORDERLAND"
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
That way!
Concentrate!
Get up there!
Retreat!
Min-woo!
You okay?
It's me, Jun-shik.
Wake up!
Shit.
I should've fought for independence instead.
Who would've guessed we'd end up fighting for the Japs here?
Our damn fortunes.
I'm starving to death.
You're hungry 24 hours a day.
Grow up will you?
Hey!
Hurry up!
Lazy Korean fools!
Yes, sir.
Let's hurry!
Hope you get shot down dead.
He's really dead?
- Choon-bok!
Your butt!
- What?
Where's it coming from?
I almost got my head blown off.
The broken wall at 1 o'clock.
I heard the 1st regiment got attacked, too.
It's him.
Just our damn luck.
Jong-dae!
Cover me!
No!
Stay back, Jun-shik!
Cover him!
Choon-bok!
Cover him!
Are you okay Jun-shik?
It's great you shot down just Japs, but Noda's gonna kill us.
She killed so many.
Hey!
Don't hog all the food!
Give me some!
Don't slobber over it!
Give me some!
This is you?
You keep eating.
I'll look at this.
Fine, I'll show you.
Let me see first!
Not that sexy.
She's crying.
Cuz you took her picture.
No, it's cuz you ate all her beef jerky.
Fools.
Why'd you make her cry?
The bullets happened to swerve and hit only Japanese soldiers?
Did the bitch smell your Kimchi breath?
Talk, you fools!
Speak, you bastards!
Who sent you here!
Say it!
I'm Shirai from Hailaer.
You raped my mother before my father, and raped me, too.
Listen!
There are many like me in China.
China will never lose to you!
I will never forgive!
Never!
Tell me!
Why did the bullets fly past you Korean rubbish!
Speak, you bastards!
Damn it!
Stop it!
I said no speaking Korean!
Enough!
That won't bring back the dead!
Go back to your work places!
What's all this?
Who's coming?
Colonel.
I'm Colonel Takakura.
Company, halt!
Attention!
What?
Why's that bastard here?
Colonel Hasegawa, what brings you here?
Private Takakura ever drive past honorable Imperial soldiers' corpses?
Mukai!
Yes, sir.
First!
For shamefully ordering a retreat, you're demoted to private as of today.
Second!
Private Takakura will prove loyalty to our Emperor and commit hara-kiri!
Be thankful our Emperor granted you an honorable death!
Long live our Emperor!
- Handle the deceased with due respect.
- Yes, sir.
Remember, after feeding off corpses, crows can come and gouge out your eyes.
I'm Hasegawa Tatsuo.
I came here to demolish.
Soviet tanks!
I'll show them true power of the Imperial army!
When out of bullets, Imperial soldiers must charge with bayonets!
If bayonets are broken, we must fight with bare hands!
Imperial soldiers do not leave the battlefield till death!
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.
We either win or die.
First!
We'll build a pontoon bridge over Khalkhin River within 48 hours.
Second!
We'll form a special suicide unit of 50 men to demolish tanks.
All officers will stand with me at the vanguard of the special unit!
- Mukai!
- Yes, sir!
Write up the list and have it on my desk by tomorrow.
- Dismissed!
- Dismissed!
I'm sorry about your picture.
I glued it together.
Take it!
I have a sister like you back home.
My name is Jun-shik Kim.
Thank you!
Shefsheinp?
The sun's going down!
Hurry up, you bastards!
Stop dawdling!
Hurry up!
Work harder!
When the sun goes down, it's over!
Squad 9!
Damn slow Korean dogs!
Build this in 2 days?
He's insane!
They worked us from dawn!
Where's the food!
Stop talking about food!
You're making me hungry.
Choon-bok?
What's "Shei-shei ni"?
Learning Chinese?
Why do you keep asking?
Just tell me!
It means thank you.
Stop working!
Attention!
At ease.
I heard Tatsuo was your marathon rival.
- He didn't stand a chance.
- Jun-shik's way better!
Come out!
Keep that in your mouth and come out!
Choon-bok Hwang!
Come out faster than a bullet, or you'll drink all the water here!
Repeat after me!
I'm a barbarian.
I'm a Korean.
Repeat that, keep the fish in, and do squats till sundown!
Begin!
Catching fish on duty or running during bedtime!
You think this is a playground?
Make sure everything gets incinerated.
Yes, sir!
No!
How dare you!
Not my running shoes!
Oh, is that so?
If you wanna run, do it barefoot.
Where are you going, fool!
Damn bastards!
How many more beatings you need!
Korean dog!
No!
Gwang-choon?
This side's sinking.
What?
There's a screw lose.
Who unscrewed this?
It was there before.
Squad 9!
Step forward!
If we went on like this tomorrow, what would've happened?
From now on, the engineering unit will fix up Squad 9's area.
Squad 9 will hold the faulty plank on their heads.
And return to the base before sundown.
The best marathoner will be leading you.
The plank must be leveled!
Keep it leveled!
- Noda, the bastard!
- Save your breath!
Just walk, Jun-shik!
We'll hold up the plank.
Don't worry!
If you hurt your knee, it's over!
Listen!
Keep it leveled!
One!
Two!
How is it?
Cool enough for you.
Squad 9 Sluggards!
- John Yushe.
- Yes, sir.
- Yueh Sanchin.
- Yes sir.
- Jong-dae Lee!
- Yes, sir.
- Jun-shik Kim!
- Yes, sir.
Why're they calling us this time?
Attention!
The 50 soldiers called will fight in tomorrow's attack.
On a special suicide mission with me.
What did he say?
Suicide?
Us?
We will carry bombs and demolish enemy tanks at dawn.
Fight like Imperial soldiers and die with honor.
I'll kill anyone.
Who dares retreat?
Koreans should be honored to be included in this heroic mission.
I'm not taking part in this operation.
Oh, really?
For what reason?
The Korean soldiers and I didn't volunteer.
we cannot consent to a mission that demands death.
Your permission to shoot, sir!
Dare disobey me?
All Koreans here, including our squad, think the same.
I'll ask again.
- Are you disobeying me?
- This is insane.
Execute him with the other POWs!
Before we march out tomorrow,
have fun on your last night!
Stupid bastards!
Are you okay?
I'll be executed at dawn.
Like this.
The Japanese are evil.
Korea and China are foolish.
I'm not afraid to die.
I'm just mad I couldn't kill more Japanese fools.
If I could, I'd get more revenge.
I'd kill them all!
What are you doing?
If we're gonna die like dogs, might as well save Jun-shik!
Hurry up!
Hurry!
Shirai!
- Why her?
- Pull her out!
Why?
At a time like this.
It's coming!
Run!
Get down!
Jun-shik!
Let's head to the bridge and go south on Khalkin River to cross the border.
Where's Min-woo?
We're the only ones going?
- He's out on a job with Noda.
- We can't take all 100 Koreans with us.
Let's hurry!
We don't have time.
Come on.
Jun-shik!
Get on!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
What's that?
It's an attack!
We could've gotten killed, too.
Damn Japs!
Good for them!
Let's go!
Come on!
Jun-shik!
Hurry up!
What's going on?
Soviet tanks are coming!
Grab the oar!
Tanks?
Get on!
Jun-shik!
- The tanks are coming!
- Get on!
Go ahead without me!
What did you say?
What the hell are you doing!
Crazy?
Get on, Jun-shik!
Come on!
What the hell are you doing!
- Come with us!
- Let's all survive and meet again!
Jun-shik!
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Just get on!
- If you go back, you're dead, too!
- Come back!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik Kim!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Shirai!
Watch out!
- Watch out!
- Shirai is an ace shooter.
Shirai!
Shirai!
Shirai!
Shirai!
Shirai!
Hurry!
Go save your friends!
Thank you.
Stop!
Don't come!
Stop!
Stop!
It's an attack!
Don't come!
It's an attack, sir!
Get ready for battle!
Block off the front with trucks!
Move the trucks up front!
The rest to the first line of defense!
To the first line of defense!
Defend the first line of defense!
To the first line of defense!
Charge!
Scatter!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live our Emperor!
Die bravely like a special suicide unit member!
You son of a bitch!
Min-woo!
It's okay.
You go and die bravely!
Min-woo!
Help me!
Min-woo!
Min-woo!
Fools!
Imperial soldier don't retreat!
How dare you run away!
Charge!
Don't show your back to the enemy!
Don't back away!
Charge!
Charge!
Don't back down!
Don't run!
Fight!
Charge!
Want to get everyone killed?
If you want to die, do it alone!
We're not dying like dogs!
Order the retreat!
Imperial soldiers must charge ahead even as ghosts!
Enough with the Imperial soldiers!
Order the retreat!
Colonel!
Here's your chance to die honorably as an Imperial soldier!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Where are we going?
Can we make it back home?
Hurry up!
Move it!
You bastards!
"CHITA"
"OMSK"
"PERM"
"FEBRUARY, 1940, KUNGURSK, SOVIET UNION PRISONER OF WAR CAMP"
We are not prisoners of war, but criminals who started war.
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union with dedicated labor and reform.
As proof you'll carry out the oath.
The leader of you Japanese dogs,
Hasegawa Tatsuo, must step on your national flag.
We're not labors or criminals, but proud Imperial soldiers!
You have no right to force us to reform!
Imperial Japan will not abandon you!
Keep your dignity till the day you return and fight with honor!
Long live our Emperor!
Long live Imperial Japan!
Hurry up!
Move it!
Walk in a line!
Colonel!
Don't fall asleep, sir!
Shut up, fool!
Keep moving!
Hurry up!
You yellow bastards!
You slow sluggards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Hurry!
Line up, you bastards!
Newcomers to the left!
Old maggots to the right!
Choon-bok!
Gwang-choon!
- Jun-shik!
- Jun-shik!
I thought you were dead!
What a relief you're all alive.
Where's Jong-dae?
Jong-dae's here, but...
Attention!
This is Anton, your supervisor.
I'm Anton.
If Area 3 doesn't shape up, it'll be hard to stay alive here.
Officers or soldiers,
I won't tolerate anyone slacking on the job!
Each group leader, take 20 new POWs and go to your work areas!
Go!
Jong-dae!
Jun-shik!
You're alive!
I was so worried I'd never see you again.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
When did you get here?
About two months ago
I rule here.
Nothing for you to worry about now.
Korean dog!
Jong-dae Lee!
I didn't like the way you were talking.
I'm sorry...
Thought I'd say that?
You damn Jap!
Dare call me a Korean dog?
Give me that!
Still think I'm a damn soldier under you?
You stupid son of a bitch!
This isn't Kyung-sung or Nomonhan!
This is the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
I'm the colonel here!
And I'm the king!
You got that, fool?
You got that, fool?
Got that, you damn Japs!
Colonel.
Wake up, sir!
Noda.
If you wanna stay alive, stay out of my sight!
Hey!
So damn cold.
If we don't warm him up, he'll die.
Please move!
Who cares?
That bastard's not even worth stomping on.
I beg you.
Make room for him, please.
Try saving him, then it probably won't work.
What are you doing!
We have to save the Colonel!
Mukai!
If he's a goner, bring him to the incinerator.
No use watching him die!
Let's go!
Jun-shik, have a drink.
Look at that!
If you get frostbitten here, you end up being firewood like him.
This is the warmest place in the whole camp.
Your legs are your life.
Take good care of 'em.
I like it here.
No Japs calling me a Korean dog.
We should go back when the war's over.
I'm not.
There's nothing, but pulling a rickshaw there.
Having a drink reminds me of home.
Eun-soo's probably fine, right?
I miss her.
All stand!
Starting the day without bowing towards our Emperor is contemptible.
There is no exception here!
Get up!
No need.
Keep eating!
It's an order!
Crazy bastard
Everyone stand!
Now!
Private Jun-shik Kim!
Get up!
Private Kim!
We're no longer your subordinates.
We were unjustly dragged and forced to become Imperial soldiers.
As the Soviets can't demand reform, you have no right to force us to bow.
Remember!
From now on, I'm not Private Jun-shik Kim, but the Korean marathoner Jun-shik Kim!
Crazy fool!
You want to die!
You're the crazy one who killed hundreds of soldiers!
Commit hara-kiri like Colonel Takakura!
Bastard!
Since you have the energy to fight, guess you're not hungry enough.
Grudges between a Korean and a Japanese?
You got your wish
Fight till one of you dies!
Kill him, Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Hurry!
Jun-shik!
One of us should've died.
Today's the day.
Colonel!
The knife, sir!
Colonel!
Colonel!
Jun-shik!
The knife!
Kill me, Korean dog!
Kill him!
Hold it up right!
Hurry up and do it!
Stop slacking off!
When did this happen?
It's okay, Jun-shik.
Don't!
It's okay.
Hold still.
Germany invaded the Soviet Union.
The Soviets may speed up exchanging POWs to reinforce their army.
Number 1277!
He's one of your men.
Anton!
Go catch him!
Yes, sir!
It's time for frosebite examination.
Where's Choon-bok?
Take him away!
Gwang-choon!
No!
No!
Drag him out!
Let's go!
I'm fine!
I can still work, sir!
Tell 'em Jun-shik!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
- I want to live, Jun-shik!
- Gwang-choon!
I want to live, Jun-shik!
Let's go!
Help!
Gwang-choon!
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
You're not hiding in here, are you?
Choon-bok?
Choon-bok?
- You son of a bitch!
- Shut up!
Come out!
Come out!
You wanna die?
I was starving.
Put the bread down and come out now.
What do we do?
What do we do?
Who's there?
How dare you steal, you bastard!
He's the one.
- He's the thief!
- What are you doing?
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
Please Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
Jong-dae!
A rat sneaked into our food storage today.
Luckily we caught him, thanks to comrade Anton
As you know, stealing is punishable by death.
Jong-dae!
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
I'm scared!
Tell 'em I didn't eat the bread!
Execute him!
Jun-shik!
Gwang-choon!
Make it back home alive!
Is it because of this?
This is more important than a friend's life?
This is who you really are?
Call yourself human?
Yeah, I'm not human.
I'm not the Jong-dae you know!
I'm Anton!
I'm Anton, you bastard!
Call me Anton from now on!
Got that!
How long do you think this armband will protect you?
How could you do that to Choon-bok?
What do you know?
You don't know anything!
Shut up and stay out of my life!
Do you know that Gwang-choon died?
He's probably nothing, but ashes by now.
If you pull that again in front of them, I'll kill you.
Your emperor abandoned you.
How dare you speak of our Emperor!
POW repatriation has been denied
We showed mercy on you, but the Japanese refused.
They're battling Americans in the Pacific and have no interest in you.
You expect me to believe that?
Imperial soldiers are sons of the Emperor.
A father does not abandon his son
That's what you want to believe.
You naive, poor, abandoned son.
You will also face death in the incinerator here.
It's a Kokeshi.
Is your hometown Yamagata?
You're good.
You know, sir?
Have you been there?
My grandfather took me there when I was young.
It's a beautiful place.
I grew up there my whole life.
My family ran a carpentry shop for generations.
When I go back,
I want to be a great carpenter like my father.
Do you know why I chose to be your adjutant for Nomonhan, sir?
Because I saw your firm conviction for our country in your eyes.
Conviction.
Look out!
Son of a bitch!
Tsukamoto!
You okay?
Wake up!
I go easy on you, you cripple, and for what!
Jong-dae!
We're doing our best, too!
Your best?
I'll show you my best in beating!
You son of a bitch!
You call that your best!
You bastards!
This is the best!
Jong-dae Lee!
It's Anton, fool!
He's dead.
Lieutenant!
What?
Never seen a man die before?
Get back to work, you bastards!
Work, you fools!
Get back to work now!
You fools never listen!
Damn Jap!
How dare you!
Stop it!
I told you to stay out of my way!
Damn Jap!
I gotta beat it into your head?
You bastards!
Damn Jap!
You son of bitch!
Kill 'em!
Bastards!
Back to your posts!
Stop!
You bastards!
There is no mercy for those who started the riot!
Begin the executions!
It's an urgent telegram, sir.
Grab a uniform!
Change into now!
Germany has declared war against us.
Comrade Stalin has given you too, your final calling.
The choice is yours.
Those who want to convert may wear Soviet army uniforms.
- Go get the uniforms!
Hurry!
- Yes, sir.
Hurry up and put it on!
Anton.
This is a great opportunity for you.
I hope you come back victorious.
Long live the Soviet Union!
Good luck!
Comrade!
Please give them a chance, too.
Let them go!
Thank you, sir!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurry up and put it on!
Hasegawa Tatsuo.
This is your last chance.
I'll say it one more time.
Put it on.
Let's give it a good shot!
It's better than freezing to death.
Right, Jun-shik?
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Bastards!
The Soviet army uniform suits our colonel so well, doesn't it?
"DECEMBER, 1941 ZHEDOVSK, SOVIET UNION"
Get off!
Get off, now!
Get off!
Long live the Soviet Union!
Hurrah!
Get off!
Move it!
This will be a grave for the Germans' today!
Thank you, sir!
Show the cowardly Germans the valor of the Soviet army!
It's mine!
You are proud Soviet soldiers!
Charge!
Attack!

What?
You wanna live, too?
I do, too!
I'm not dying here!
You die!
You die!
Tatsuo!
Move it!
Move it!
Charge!
Charge!
Charge!
Jong-dae!
Damn bastards!
No bullets!
Jong-dae!
Let's run!
This is dying like dogs!
It may be for you, but not me!
Charge!
You don't have any more bullets!

What's with my goddamned life.
Shit, I wanted to live it up.
I'm so sorry, Jun-shik.
Jong-dae.
I want to see Eun-soo.
I miss Eun-soo.
Jun-shik.
No, Jun-shik.
Stay right here.
Don't go out there.
Charge!
There is no retreat!
I'll kill anyone who tries to run!
Charge ahead!
Attack!
Fools!
Attack!
Imperial soldier don't retreat!
Charge!
Attack!
You'll need it to make it over the mountains.
Where do you plan to go?
To German territory.
I hope we're going the right way.
I hope the snow stops.
Even if we make it to German territory.
it won't be easy to make it back home.
You don't have to come, if you don't want to.
Back then.
Why didn't you kill me?
Tatsuo!
Wake up!
I'll go find some medicine.
Kim...
Jun-shik Kim.
I'll be right back.
Help!
Help me!
Help me!
I'm a Japanese soldier.
My friend's in danger.
What's he saying?
I'm a Japanese soldier.
We're on the same side!
Take him away!
I'm a Japanese soldier, not a POW!
Let go!
You bastard!
Help me!
A man is dying!
Please!
Take him away, now!
Let go!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Let go!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Search every corner.
You go up that way.
"3 YEARS LATER"
There's word that the Allied Forces will invade Nord-Pas-de-Calais.
Then we hit the jackpot getting stationed in Normandy.
If Germany loses, aren't we all dead anyways?
Think they'll take us back?
We'd be lucky if they don't call us traitors and shoot us.
- That's why we should run away.
- You said you'll run for 2 years now.
I'm going for sure this time.
I heard from a man in another unit.
There's a secret merchant ship to Jamaica at Cherbourg Harbor.
How'll you get there?
Swim?
If you get caught trying to run, you'll be shot!
Wanna make a bet?
I bet 50 marks you can't run away.
Bet 100 marks, stupid.
Bet even your boots, you pig.
"May, 1944, NORMANDY, FRANCE"
Our battalion will build additional defense walls and defense lines in the Atlantic.
From tomorrow, you will build defense walls on the shore with unit 795.
Our job is to build the defense encampment on Normandy Hill.
March forward!
Hurry up!
Squad 3!
Unit 2!
Go to barracks 14!
H93!
Shouldn't you give up looking for your Korean friend?
You're the only Asian here.
That guy's so lucky.
He gets to go in and out of base at will.
Tatsuo!
Aren't you coming in?
Let's go!
Go ahead, I'll rest here for a sec.
See you later, then.
I thought you might be dead.
But you're here in the Eastern battalion.
When did you come to Normandy?
Jun-shik?
Did you say something?
Can you repeat it?
Tatsuo!
It's more comfortable this way.
I can't hear gunshots or screams.
It's over.
Let's play soccer.
Tatsuo!
We're going to play against Squad 8!
Man, they're fast.
I sometimes think of when we first ran together.
The day you moved in I lost cuz my rubber shoes fell off, but I was happy to have a new running mate.
We came much too far.
How long will it take to run home from here?
More than a year, right?
We know the Allied forces will attack Nord-Pas-de-Calais.
The Eastern battalion will all be sent to Nord-Pas-de-Calais!
You will all be reborn as true German soldiers!
Pack up your gear!
We move out at 09:00 hours tomorrow!
Dismissed!
We're all dead I thought we'd be safe in Normandy.
What's going on?
We're being transferred.
It's nothing.
Sending us to battle but feeding us this rubbish.
I thought we'd get wine and steak when we came to France.
Damn.
Karim!
I'm going to Cherbourg at dawn.
Are you crazy?
I got the contact info from Roman.
Is Roman going?
That liar.
How will you get there?
The food truck always leaves at dawn.
We gotta go when you're on watch.
Think it over.
If you get caught, you're dead.
Is it cuz of your friend?
Fine.
I'll see you at dawn.
We're not going to Nord-Pas-de-Calais.
We're going to Cherbourg.
Cherbourg?
A ship there will take us home.
Jun-shik.
Let's go home!
Where your sister and father are.
Can we really make it home?
We could get killed on the way.
Still, we can't die here.
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Karim!
Tatsuo!
Those aren't planes, are they?
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
- Jun-shik!
- Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Tatsuo!
Jun-shik!
Stay there!
I'll come to you!
Wait for me!
Hurry!
It's an attack!
Prepare for battle!
All units to battle positions!
The Allied Forces have attacked!
To your battle positions!
Hurry and grab the machine gun!
- Grab it!
- Everyone to your battle positions!
Move it!
Move it!
Fire!
Fire!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Tatsuo!
Are you okay?
Let's get out of here, now!
Grab the machine gun!
Now!
Hurry up, you fools!
Can't you see the enemy!
Reload and fire, now!
Allied forces attacked!
Send re-inforcements!
Damn it.
Let's run for it!
Don't lag behind!
You'll be watching my back as you run.
Are you okay?
This won't kill me.
Let's go!
- Jun-shik!
- Come on!
We have to get home!
Tatsuo!
Are you okay?
Jun-shik.
Jun-shik.
You're Jun-shik Kim from now on.
If you say you're Japanese, they might kill you.
Say you were dragged here and forced into the Eastern battalion.
Jun-shik!
Wake up!
I have no regrets.
Though I couldn't achieve my dream.
You can't go like this!
Let's go home and run together!
Jun-shik!
I wanted to run again when I go back home.
Promise you'll make it back alive...
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
Jun-shik!
I sometimes think of when we first ran together.
The day you moved in.
I was happy to have a new running mate.
Ready, go!

-I didn't wanna take the chance.
As it is, your landing could have destabilized the entire bridge.
-It didn't.
-But it could have.
We don't yet know the limits of your powers.
Well, maybe you could , you know, help me figure that out.
Batman's got that covered.

[BLACK CANARY CLEARS THROAT]
Ready for training, everyone?
MISS MARTIAN :
Black Canary.
Uncle J'onn.
M'gann.
I was in the neighborhood so I thought I'd see how you were adjusting.
A few bumps but I'm learning.
That's all I can ask.
Stick around.
Class is in session.
I consider it an honor to be your teacher.
I'll throw a lot at you everything I've learned from my own mentors, unh and my own bruises.
What happened?
The job.
Now, combat is about controlling conflict putting the battle on your terms.
You should always be acting, never reacting.
I'll need a sparring partner.
Right here, yeah.
After this--
Swish.
--I'll show you my moves.
[GRUNTING]
Oh, man.
Hurts so good.
Good block.
But did anyone see what he did wrong?
-Ooh, he hit on teacher and got served?
-Dude.
-He allowed me to dictate the terms of-- SUPERBOY:
Oh, please.
With my powers, the battle 's always on my terms.
I'm a living weapon and this is a waste of my time.
Prove it.

That's it.
I'm done.
Training is mandatory.
Batman to the Cave.
Five hours ago a new menace attacked Green Arrow and Black Canary.
The attacker was capable of studying then duplicating the powers and abilities of its opponents.
Arrow called in reinforcements, which nearly proved disastrous as our foe gained more and more power with each new combatant.
Whoa, one guy with the powers of the entire League?
In the end, it took eight Leaguers four hours to defeat and dismantle the android.
An android?
Who made it?
T.O. Morrow?
Good guess, Robin but Red Tornado doesn't think so.
The technology bears the signature of Professor Ivo.
Ivo?
But Ivo's dead.
So we all thought.
Or hoped.
To make certain this threat is permanently neutralized we're sending two trucks carrying the android's parts to two separate S.T.A.R. Lab facilities in Boston and New York for immediate evaluation.
Every precaution is being taken.
We'll have four additional decoy trucks to create confusion in case Ivo or anyone tries to recover the remains.
You will split into undercover teams to safeguard the two real trucks.
Yes.
Road trip.
So now we take out your trash?
You had something better to do?
[BEEPS]
Coordinates received.
On our way.
When you're ready, I'll be here.
MAN 1 :
S. T.A.R. Boston is a go.
MAN 2:
S. T.A.R. Manhattan is go.
I told you.
We need to talk .
If dislike is the opposite of like, is disaster the opposite of aster?
See, instead of things going wrong, they go right.
Uh, clearly , you're not feeling the aster.
What's wrong?
Canary.
What business does she have teaching combat skills to a guy with super-strength?
Taking down stronger guys is part of the gig.
Canary learned that the hard way.
Same with Batman, and, well, me.
MISS MARTIAN :
Do you think Superboy's okay?
I wasn't reading his mind, I swear, but anger flowed off him in waves.
Surfed that wave.
Just give him space.
Me?
Stick as close as you want.
Superboy just needs time to cool off.
A quiet mission will clear his head.

AQUALAD [OVER COMMUNICATOR]:
Aqualad to Robin.
We've lost our cargo.
-Did you--?
-It's gone.
And so is my partner.
AQUALAD:
Aqualad to Superboy, radio your position.
-We'll help you.
-I don't need help .
Don't want any.
AQUALAD:
Superboy?
ROBIN:
I think he ditched his comm.
Super.
Now we can't even track him.
He's out of my telepathic range.
This Professor Ivo, if he is alive, seems to be two steps ahead of us.
Maybe we should contact Red Tornado.
Tornado always tells us to handle things ourselves.
The mission can still succeed if we recover the parts before they're reassembled.
That's a great plan except for the part about us not knowing where to look.
ROBIN:
Maybe we do.
We'd have heard by now if the decoy trucks had been attacked.
So how did these monkeys know exactly which trucks to target?
Ha!
The parts have GPS.
The monkeys can track the signal.
Which means I can track them with the one I captured.
Looks like both sets of parts are converging on Gotham City.
That far south?
M'gann and I won't get there any time soon.
I'm sending Kid on ahead to meet you.
Aqualad out.
Definitely a disaster.
Heavy on the "dis."
Apple pie.
The devil's food.
Something tells me this isn't about dessert.
-The boy needs you.
-No.
He needs you.
He needs Red.
I'm just a constant reminder of what he's not.
Sorry, Clark, but you're dead wrong.
Look, I know he troubles you.
But he's here.
You have to get over the how and why.
Trust me on this.
This boy needs his father.
I'm not his father.
I'll take that pie to go.
[GIBBERING]
Oh.
Hello .
SUPERBOY:
You?
You're Ivo?
I'm whelmed.
You're one to talk .
Now since when does the big blue Boy Scout have a brat?
He doesn't.
Yeah.
If you say so.
Have you met my Mobile optimal

Dude, the guy has no head.
AQUALAD:
Don't take any chances.
Superboy.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Feeling the aster.
Hey, where's Ivo?
The Amazo android is in pieces again safely being analyzed at the two separate S. T.A.R. Labs.
But Ivo escaped.
And since he originated the tech he's arguably more dangerous than the android.
Capturing the professor will be a League priority.
But we understand your mission encountered other complications.
BATMAN:
Complications come with the job.
Your ability to handle them has impressed the League.
The whole League?
Given time, yes.
Kryptonians, as you know, have very hard heads.
Of course, there's no shame in asking for help .
That's why the League exists.
Because there are some problems even we can't handle individually .
Please.
If we needed help , we'd never get the chance to ask.
Look familiar?
You were following us.

-You still don't trust us.
-We didn't follow you.
And that's not your arrow.

[BLACK CANARY CLEARS THROAT]
Ready for training, everyone?
MISS MARTIAN:
Black Canary.
Uncle J'onn.
M'gann.
I was in the neighborhood so I thought I'd see how you were adjusting.
A few bumps but I'm learning.
That's all I can ask.
Stick around.
Class is in session.
I consider it an honor to be your teacher.
I'll throw a lot at you everything I've learned from my own mentors, unh and my own bruises.
What happened?
The job.
Now, combat is about controlling conflict putting the battle on your terms.
You should always be acting, never reacting.
I'll need a sparring partner.
Right here, yeah.
After this...
Swish.
- I'll show you my moves.
[GRUNTING]
Oh, man.
Hurts so good.
Good block.
But did anyone see what he did wrong?
- Ooh, he hit on teacher and got served?
- Dude.
- He allowed me to dictate the terms of...
SUPERBOY:
Oh, please.
With my powers, the battle's always on my terms.
I'm a living weapon and this is a waste of my time.
Prove it.
[GRUNTING]

You're angry.
Good.
But don't react.
Channel that anger into...
[GRUNTING]
[ROBIN GIGGLES]
That's it.
I'm done.
Training is mandatory.
Batman to the Cave.
Five hours ago a new menace attacked Green Arrow and Black Canary.
The attacker was capable of studying then duplicating the powers and abilities of its opponents.
Arrow called in reinforcements, which nearly proved disastrous as our foe gained more and more power with each new combatant.
Whoa, one guy with the powers of the entire League?
In the end, it took eight Leaguers four hours to defeat and dismantle the android.
An android?
Who made it?
T.O. Morrow?
Good guess, Robin but Red Tornado doesn't think so.
The technology bears the signature of Professor Ivo.
Ivo?
But Ivo's dead.
So we all thought.
Or hoped.
To make certain this threat is permanently neutralized we're sending two trucks carrying the android's parts to two separate S.T.A.R. Lab facilities in Boston and New York for immediate evaluation.
Every precaution is being taken.
We'll have four additional decoy trucks to create confusion in case Ivo or anyone tries to recover the remains.
You will split into undercover teams to safeguard the two real trucks.
Yes.
Road trip.
So now we take out your trash?
You had something better to do?
[BEEPS]
Coordinates received.
On our way.
When you're ready, I'll be here.
MAN 1:
S.T.A.R. Boston is a go.
MAN 2:
S.T.A.R. Manhattan is go.
I told you.
We need to talk.
If dislike is the opposite of like, is disaster the opposite of aster?
See, instead of things going wrong, they go right.
Uh, clearly, you're not feeling the aster.
What's wrong?
Canary.
What business does she have teaching combat skills to a guy with super-strength?
Taking down stronger guys is part of the gig.
Canary learned that the hard way.
Same with Batman, and, well, me.
MISS MARTIAN:
Do you think Superboy's okay?
I wasn't reading his mind, I swear, but anger flowed off him in waves.
Surfed that wave.
Just give him space.
Me?
Stick as close as you want.
Superboy just needs time to cool off.
A quiet mission will clear his head.
[GIBBERING]

So I thought I'd see how you were adjusting.
- A few bumps, but I'm learning.
- That's all I can ask.
- Stick around.
Class is in session.
I consider it an honor to be your teacher.
I'll throw a lot at you--
Everything I've learned from my own mentors--uh!

And my own bruises.
- What happened?
- The job.
Now, combat is about controlling conflict,
Putting the battle on your terms.
You should always be acting, never reacting.
I'll need a sparring partner.
- Right here.
Yeah!
After this--
Swish--
I'll show you my moves.
Aah!
Uh!
Ohh.
Hurts so good.
- Good block.
But did anyone see what he did wrong?
- Ooh, ooh.
He hit on teacher and got served?
- Dude!
- He allowed me to dictate the terms of--
- Oh, please.
With my powers, the battle's always on my terms.
I'm a living weapon, and this is a waste of my time.
- Prove it.
- Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha.
- You're angry.
Good, but don't react.
Channel that anger into--
- That's it.
I'm done.
- Training is mandatory.
- Batman to the cave.
Five hours ago, a new menace attacked Green Arrow and Black Canary.
The attacker was capable of studying, then duplicating
The powers and abilities of its opponents.
Arrow called in reinforcements, which nearly proved disastrous
As our foe gained more and more power with each new combatant.
- Whoa.
One guy with the powers of the entire League?
- In the end, it took 8 leaguers 4 hours to defeat
And dismantle the android.
- An android?
Who made it, T.O. Morrow?
- Good guess, Robin.
But Red Tornado doesn't think so.
- The technology bears the signature of professor Ivo.
- Ivo?
But Ivo's dead.
- So we all thought...
Or hoped.
- To make certain this threat is permanently neutralized,
We're sending two trucks carrying the android's parts
To two separate S.T.A.R. lab facilities in Boston
And New York for immediate evaluation.
Every precaution is being taken.
We'll have 4 additional decoy trucks to create confusion
In case Ivo or anyone tries to recover the remains.
You will split into undercover teams
To safeguard the two real trucks.
- Yes!
Road trip.
- So now we take out your trash.
- You had something better to do?
- Coordinates received.
On our way.
- When you're ready, I'll be here.
- S.T.A.R. Boston is a go.
- S.T.A.R. Manhattan is go.
- I told you, we need to talk.
- If dislike is the opposite of like,
Is disaster the opposite of aster?
See, instead of things going wrong, they go right.
Uh, clearly you're not feeling the aster.
What's wrong?
- Canary.
And what business does she have teaching combat skills
To a guy with super strength?
- Taking down stronger guys is part of the gig.
Canary learned that the hard way.
Same with Batman and, well, me.
- Do you think Superboy's ok?
I wasn't reading his mind, I swear,
But anger flowed off him in waves.
- Heh.
Surf that wave.
Just give him space.

Stick as close as you want.

A quiet mission will clear his head.

M-maybe w-we should contact Red Tornado?
- Tornado always tells us to handle things ourselves.
And the mission can still succeed if we recover the parts
Before they're reassembled.
- Well, that's a great plan, except for the part about us
Not knowing where to look!
- Maybe we do.
We'd have heard by now if the decoy trucks had been attacked.
So how did these monkeys know exactly which trucks to target?
Ha!
The parts have gps.
The monkeys can track the signal,
Which means I can track them with the one I captured.
It looks both sets of parts are converging on...
Gotham city.

You're all such poor copies of the originals.

It makes me angry!

- Want to see me channel that anger?
- Great.
He's gone ballistic again.
- Maybe not.

- Dude, the guy has no head.
- Don't take any chances.
- Superboy, are you all right?
- I'm fine.
Feeling the aster.
- Hey.
Where's Ivo?
- The Amazo android is in pieces again,
Safely being analyzed at the two separate S.T.A.R. labs,
But Ivo escaped, and since he
Originated the tech, he's arguably
More dangerous than the android.
- Capturing the professor ill be a League priority.
- But we understand your mission encountered
Other complications.
- Complications come with the job.
Your ability to handle them has impressed the League.
- The whole League?
- Given time, yes.
Kryptonians, as you know, have very hard heads.
Of course, there's no shame in asking for help.
That's why the League exists-- because there are some problems
Even we can't handle individually.
- Please.
If we needed help, we'd never get
The chance to ask.
Look familiar?
You were following us!
Babysitting!
You still don't trust us.
- We didn't follow you.

As it is, your landing could have destabilized the entire bridge.
- It didn't.

We don't yet know the limits of your powers.
- But maybe you could, you know, help me figure that out.
- Batman's got that covered.

Wait, Arrow.
Slow down.

No, I'm definitely available.

You kidding?
I feel naked in civvies.
Still tracking the parts?
They were heading through Gotham.
But they veered.
Wait.
Dude, they're at my school.
[GROANING]
That all you got?
Access Captain Atom.
[GRUNTING]

I don't usually attend these things in person but, heh, this was too good to miss.

Access Captain Atom.
Access Black Canary.

[SCREAMS]
Martian Manhunter.
Access Black Canary.
Superman.
Access Black Canary.
Oh, yawn.
Normally, Amaze would study and mimic your abilities during battle.
But what's the point?
You're all such poor copies of the originals.
[GIBBERING]
So everyone keeps saying.
It makes me angry.
Wanna see me channel that anger?
Great.
He's gone ballistic again.
Maybe not.
Amaze, protect your master.
Priority alpha.
Captain Atom.
Anyone wanna play keep away?
- Ooh, ooh.
Me, me.
- Access Superman.
Martian Manhunter.
Superman.
ROBIN:
Help me disassemble him.
Now!
Dude, the guy has no head.
AQUALAD:
Don't take any chances.
Superboy.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Feeling the aster.
Hey, where's Ivo?
The Amaze android is in pieces again safely being analyzed at the two separate S.T.A.R. Labs.
But Ivo escaped.
And since he originated the tech he's arguably more dangerous than the android.
Capturing the professor will be a League priority.
But we understand your mission encountered other complications.
BATMAN:
Complications come with the job.
Your ability to handle them has impressed the League.
The whole League?
Given time, yes.
Kryptonians, as you know, have very hard heads.
Of course, there's no shame in asking for help.
That's why the League exists.
Because there are some problems even we can't handle individually.
Please.
If we needed help, we'd never get the chance to ask.
Look familiar?
You were following us.
Babysitting.
- You still don't trust us.
- We didn't follow you.
And that's not your arrow.
- But that means-
- Speedy.
He has our backs.
Souvenir.
[SUPERBOY CLEARS THROAT]
- I'm ready.
- Good.
Because I'm here.

[SONIC BOOM]
[KIDS MOANING]
[SUPERBOY GROANS]
[KIDS SCREAM]
I had that.
I didn't want to take the chance.
As it is, your landing could have destabilized the entire bridge.
It didn't.
But it could have.
We don't yet know the limits of your powers.
But maybe you could, you know, help me figure that out.
Batman's got that covered.
[DEVICE BEEPS] I know, but-
- Superman.
Wait, Arrow.
Slow down.
What's attacking?
No, I'm definitely available.
Coordinates?
Acknowledged.
On my way.
[AWKWARDLY] Sorry, super... boy.
Duty calls.
[DEVICE BEEPS]
Already got the alert, Bruce.
I know, Clark, but we need to talk.

[COMPUTER BEEPS]
Recognized.
Superboy, B-0-4.
Hi, Superboy.
How was Metropolis?
[BLACK CANARY CLEARS THROAT]
Ready for training, everyone?
Black Canary!
Uncle J'onn!
M'gann, I was in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd see how you were adjusting.
A few bumps, but I'm learning.
That's all I can ask.
Stick around.
Class is in session.
I consider it an honor to be your teacher.
I'll throw a lot at you...
Everything I've learned from my own mentors... uh!
...
And my own bruises.
What happened?
The job.
Now, combat is about controlling conflict, putting the battle on your terms.
You should always be acting, never reacting.
I'll need a sparring partner.
Right here.
Yeah!
After this...
Swish...
[PLUNK]
I'll show you my moves.
Aah!
Uh!
Ohh.
Hurts so good.
Good block.
But did anyone see what he did wrong?
Ooh, ooh.
He hit on teacher and got served?
Dude!
He allowed me to dictate the terms of... oh, please.
With my powers, the battle's always on my terms.
I'm a living weapon, and this is a waste of my time.
Prove it.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha.
[SUPERBOY GROWLS]
You're angry.
Good, but don't react.
Channel that anger into...
[SUPERBOY GROWLING NOISILY]
[ROBIN CHUCKLES]
That's it.
I'm done.
Training is mandatory.
Batman to the cave.
Five hours ago, a new menace attacked Green Arrow and Black Canary.
The attacker was capable of studying, then duplicating the powers and abilities of its opponents.
Arrow called in reinforcements, which nearly proved disastrous as our foe gained more and more power with each new combatant.
Whoa.
One guy with the powers of the entire League?
In the end, it took 8 Leaguers 4 hours to defeat and dismantle the android.
An android?
Who made it, T.O. Morrow?
Good guess, Robin.
But Red Tornado doesn't think so.
The technology bears the signature of professor Ivo.
Ivo?
But Ivo's dead.
So we all thought...
Or hoped.
To make certain this threat is permanently neutralized, we're sending two trucks carrying the android's parts to two separate S.T.A.R. Lab facilities in Boston and New York for immediate evaluation.
Every precaution is being taken.
We'll have 4 additional decoy trucks to create confusion in case Ivo or anyone tries to recover the remains.
You will split into undercover teams to safeguard the two real trucks.
Yes!
Road trip.
So now we take out your trash.
You had something better to do?
Coordinates received.
On our way.
When you're ready, I'll be here.
S.T.A.R. Boston is a go.
S.T.A.R. Manhattan is go.
I told you, we need to talk.
If dislike is the opposite of like, is disaster the opposite of aster?
See, instead of things going wrong, they go right.
Uh, clearly you're not feeling the aster.
What's wrong?
Canary.
And what business does she have teaching combat skills to a guy with super strength?
Taking down stronger guys is part of the gig.
Canary learned that the hard way.
Same with Batman and, well, me.
[REVS ENGINE]
Do you think Superboy's Ok?
I wasn't reading his mind, I swear, but anger flowed off him in waves.
Heh.
Surf that wave.
Just give him space.
Me?
Stick as close as you want.
Superboy just needs time to cool off.
A quiet mission will clear his head.
[ANDROID MONKEYS CHATTERING]
Robin, Superboy, our truck is under attack!
Kind of figured.
[ANDROID MONKEY CHATTER]
I hate monkeys.
[DRIVER GROANS]
Robot monkeys!
Ha ha!
Totally Ivo's tweaked style.
Hey, hey.
Switch your ride to battle mode.
No point.
Or not.
[ANDROID MONKEYS CHATTERING]
[SUPERBOY YELLS]
Aah!
Uh!

[SUPERBOY GROANS]
[SUPERBOY GROANS]
Superboy!
Aqualad to Robin.
We've lost our cargo.
Did you... it's gone.
And so is my partner.
Aqualad to Superboy.
Radio your position.
We'll help you.
I don't need help, don't want any!
Superboy?
I think he ditched his comm.
Super.
Now we can't even track him.
He's out of my telepathic range.
This professor Ivo, if he is alive, seems to be two steps ahead of us.
M-maybe w-we should contact Red Tornado?
Tornado always tells us to handle things ourselves.
And the mission can still succeed if we recover the parts before they're reassembled.
Well, that's a great plan, except for the part about us not knowing where to look!
Maybe we do.
We'd have heard by now if the decoy trucks had been attacked.
So how did these monkeys know exactly which trucks to target?
Ha!
The parts have GPS.
The monkeys can track the signal, which means I can track them with the one I captured.
It looks both sets of parts are converging on...
Gotham City.
That far south?
M'gann and I won't get there anytime soon.
I'm sending kid on ahead to meet you.
Aqualad out.
Definitely a disaster, heavy on the "dis."
[DISTANT SIRENS]
Apple pie.
The devil's food.
Something tells me this isn't about dessert.
The boy needs you.
No.
He needs you.
He needs Red.
I'm just a constant reminder of what he's not.
Sorry, Clark, but you're dead wrong.
Look, I know he troubles you, but he's here.
You have to get over the how and why.
Trust me on this.
This boy needs his father.
I'm not his father.
I'll take that pie to go.
[ANDROIDS CHATTERING]
[ANDROID CHATTERING]
Oh, hello.
You?
You're Ivo?
I'm whelmed.
You're one to talk.
Now, since when does the Big Blue Boy Scout have a brat?
He doesn't.
Yeah, if you say so.
Have you met my Mobile Optimal Neural Quotient Infiltrators?
[ANDROIDS CHATTERING]
Ah.
And after all the trouble I went through finding an acronym for MONQI.
[SUPERBOY GRUNTS]
[PANTING HEAVILY]
Access Captain Atom.
Uh!
Since professor Ivo's magnificent MONQIs don't float your boat, maybe my amazing Amazo will better suit you or better slay you.
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING]
Give me your best shot.
Ha ha ha!
Heh heh heh!
Please.
My android has the strength of Superman.
What chance do you have?
Aah!
[GRUNTING]
Oh, sorry.
Did that strike a nerve?
Amazo, strike a few more.
Aah!
Access Black Canary.
[HIGH-PITCHED SOUND]
Aah!
Ohh!

Oh.
No wonder daddy keeps you hidden away.
You're not really doing justice to the old "S" shield, are you?

Access Superman.
Aah!

Ha ha ha!

They were heading through Gotham, but they veered.
Wait.
Dude, they're at my school.
[CRACK]
Unh!
Errgh!
Aah!

Hey.
Where's Ivo?
The Amazo android is in pieces again, safely being analyzed at the two separate S.T.A.R. Labs, but Ivo escaped, and since he originated the tech, he's arguably more dangerous than the android.
Capturing the professor will be a League priority.
But we understand your mission encountered other complications.
[FOOTSTEPS]
Complications come with the job.
Your ability to handle them has impressed the League.
The whole League?
Given time, yes.
Kryptonians, as you know, have very hard heads.
Of course, there's no shame in asking for help.
That's why the League exists...
Because there are some problems even we can't handle individually.
Please.
If we needed help, we'd never get the chance to ask.

You were following us!

You still don't trust us.
We didn't follow you.
And that's not your arrow, but that means...
- Speedy!
- He has our backs.
Souvenir!
Ahem.
I'm ready.
Good.
Because I'm here.
Obviously, I miscalculated a few things.
Eddie!
I know you're in there!
Why is it that the moment your life exceeds your wildest dreams...
The access code you have entered...
The knife appears at your back?
The access code you have entered is invalid...
Well, I'll tell you one thing...
I will never let them touch me.
My neighbor, who must have opened his door to complain.
You're gonna be next, Eddie!
We're coming in!
For a guy with a four digit IQ, I must have missed something.
And I hadn't missed much.
I'd come this close to having an impact on the world.
And now, the only thing I'd have an impact on was the sidewalk.
You see that guy?
That was me, not so long ago.
What kind of guy without a drug or alcohol problem looks this way?
Only a writer.
Strangely enough, nobody believed that I actually had a book contract.
Well, it's masquerading as a sci-fi novel, but it's really, uh, my own personal manifesto about the plight of the individual in the 21st century.
I sort of created a utopian society where we all sort of...
Uh...
Uh...
It's really... it's really...
Uh...
Today was the day I was gonna kick its ass.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go...
It was gonna be great.
Just gotta put in the time.
Stay in the room.
That's the key concept.
Don't leave the room.
A few weeks passed this way.
Maybe a few months.
At least I still had Lindy.
Just like that?
Come on, Eddie, This is hardly a surprise,
I'm surprised,
Let's just not do this, OK?
Let me...
I'm gonna hand in 90 pages to Marla on Friday,
If you just wait to see what she says...
Eddie,
- What?
- I know how it's going,
I'm your...
I was your girlfriend,
That word doesn't even begin to describe what you are to me,
Partner?
Squeeze?
Paramour, Inamorata,
Cleaning lady, Bank,
Thanks, Be right back,
Be that a...
What's mine is yours, too, and you know I want to share the rest of my life with you,
- I was thinking that we should...
- Don't propose,
Why not?
Because it worked out so well for you last time,
It's true, I did marry once.
Right out of college, to Melissa.
I do,
Briefly.
This isn't working.
Well, even though everything you say is true, I still love you,
I gotta get back to work,
You didn't even tell me what happened,
- I got it,
- You did?
Mm-hm, I'm an editor,
I'll have my own assistant, Can you believe that?
Yeah, of course I believe it, You deserve it,
Thanks,
- OK,
- OK,
She was right.
Why stick it out?
I had clearly missed the on-ramp.
We both knew what was beckoning.
The lower bunk in my childhood bedroom in Jersey.
My father happy to welcome me into the challenging field of dental supply inventory.
Eddie Morra,
Of all the useless relationships better forgotten and put away in mothballs, is there any more useless than...
the ex-brother-in-law?
Holy shit, man,
What has it been?
Like nine years?
- God!
- Hey,
You all right?
You look like you're living on the streets,
What's going on?
Not much, I...
Well...
What am I...
What's up?
Uh, I'm writing, Writing a lot,
Oh, you're still trying to write?
Matter of fact, I have a book contract,
- Really?
- Yeah,
- That's great,
- How about you?
Are you still dealing, Vern?
- Do I look like I'm still dealing?
- No, you don't, No,
Come on, let's go get a drink, I want to hear about this book,
I don't know, It's 2:00 in the afternoon,
When has that ever stopped you?
-
- So,
- So...
How's Melissa doing?
- Here you go,
- Thanks,
Wouldn't know, I don't see her, She moved upstate,
She got some kind of Internet home sales kind of job, Couple kids,
Couple kids, Who's the husband?
He walked out on her, if you really want to know,
But what do you care, man?
You were married, like, five minutes,
Look, I don't wanna talk about her, I wanna talk about you, OK?
Tell me about this book, How's it going?
Well, it's, uh...
I'm...
I'm...
I'm behind, I'm behind on my book,
And, uh, it's pretty well polluting my days and nights, if you really want to know,
- Well, how much have you written of it?
- Not one word,
- Creative problems, huh?
- Yeah, Mm-hm,
Well, I suppose I can help you with that,
Just this once,
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
- You don't even know what it is,
- You're still dealing,
Brother, I am light years from that now,
I've been doing, uh, some consulting for a pharmaceutical company,
What, like some offshore lab making fake Viagra?
Come on, Vern,
No, This is an exclusive product that's coming on stream next year,
They've had clinical trials and it's FDA approved,
All right, just out of curiosity and that's all...
Let's see it,
What's in it?
They've identified these receptors in the brain that activate specific circuits,
And you how they say that we can only access 20 percent of our brain?
Well, what this does...
it lets you access all of it,
Vern, look at me, Do I look good to you?
I'm broke and I'm depressed off my ass,
I don't think that my life's gonna take some sudden upswing into fame and fortune by taking some shiny, brand-new designer drug,
Gant.
When?
Tell him we can't do that, No, you tell him,
No, now.
Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to leave you here, Eddie,
But I really...
I really do want to do this again,
So, call me, And, uh, that's on the house,
I don't want it,
Don't be ungrateful, You know how much that costs?
Eight hundred bucks, A pop,
You're welcome,
All the way home, I thought about Melissa.
How could she be a failure, too?
She'd been so smart.
Smarter than anyone around her. -
Clearly, there was a direct link between this Eddie, slightly drunk at 3:00 in the afternoon, and an earlier Eddie vomiting on his boss's desk or stealing his dying aunt's Percocet.
So who could blame Lindy for dumping me?
In the end, how much worse could it get?
I didn't want to see anybody.
Especially not my landlord's nasty young wife.
- Valerie, Tuesday,
- Look, Enough, OK?
Steve handles the rent, so you can feed your crap to him,
I suddenly had extra reason to get away from her.
I had thoughtlessly ingested a substance.
Like the rent's not low enough!
I had gotten remarkably little information from Vernon about what this drug would do.
You could even be a bike messenger and come up with that, Really,
- What if it was a hallucinogen?
- It's pathetic,
Oh, my God.
Listening to her rag...
If I were tripping, I'd jump out a fucking window.
Hello?
Are you listening to me?
Do you get it?
You are gonna be out on the streets!
And then, I felt it.
I was blind, but now I see.
... running away!
You can't even look at me, you know why?
Because you're not even a man, You're not even a man!
You don't have rent!
You don't have a job!
- What's wrong?
- What?
You don't like me and I don't blame you, You see a self-defeating, energy-sucking piece of shit who's sponging off your husband,
You're wishing I'd blow my brains out, but my existence shouldn't make you this upset, What is it?
- That's none of your business,
- Something wrong at law school?
How do you know I'm in law school?
People who aren't, usually don't carry around dry, academically-constipated books about a dead Supreme Court justice,
You're a creep, aren't you?
You've been...
You've been following me,
- No, I just noticed the book,
- You just saw the corner of it,
How did you know that?
I'd seen it before.
Twelve years ago in college.
Sitting on the couch of a TA I was trying to make, waiting for her to come back out of the bathroom, hoping she'd have a condom.
Somehow my unconscious had served that up.
A memory I had never even recorded.
Or was it there the whole time and all I needed was the access?
If you're writing a paper, that's not the book I'd use,
Well, who asked you?
Hastings has his oral history, I'd start there,
Interesting point, Grammatically, this guy was an idiot, which sort of gives credence to the theory that one of the clerks he had fired actually wrote most of this guy's major opinions,
You could Google the clerk's sons, they'd love to talk to you,
Exonerate their dad, That'd give you something that no one else has...
Information from the odd museum show, a half-read article, some PBS documentary... it was all bubbling up in my frontal lobes, mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information.
- She didn't have a chance.
- So, what are your suggestions?
We'd really worked on her paper, too.
In 45 minutes, it was a polished gem.
She was pleased.
Home.
But it couldn't be my home, could it?
Who would live like this?
My first thought:
Torch it.
But saner heads prevailed.
What was this drug?
I couldn't stay messy on it,
I hadn't had a cigarette in six hours, hadn't eaten, so... abstemious and tidy?
What was this?
A drug for people who wanted to be more anal retentive?
I wasn't high, I wasn't wired.
Just clear.
I knew what I needed to do and how to do it.
The next morning, I sent a little probe down into my brain.
No surge of brilliance came up to greet me.
In short...
I was back.
But, something remained.
You're kidding,
- No,
- Words have appeared on paper,
- Yes,
- Written by you,
All you have to do is read three pages,
Just read three pages in the next hour and if you don't want to keep reading, I'll give you back the advance,
OK,
- OK, Eddie,
- OK,
Eddie, give me a call when you get in.
Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in.
Call me.
It's a little grandiose, but I'm still reading.
OK, how did you do this?
I'd really like...
Just call me the minute you get in.
Call.
OK?
- Who is it?
- Hey, Vernon, it's Eddie,
- Eddie who?
- Uh, Morra,
It's not a good time, Eddie,
Uh, hey, Vern, I really just need to talk to you,
Hey...
Oh...
- Vern, what happened?
- Don't worry about it, I'm fine,
So, Eddie, You are interested after all,
- That stuff's amazing,
- Works better if you're already smart,
Vern, who did this to you?
Trust me, you don't want to know,
Uh...
- So, uh, what's it called?
- Doesn't have a street name yet,
But the boys in the kitchen are calling it NZT 48,
"The boys in the kitchen"?
I don't...
That doesn't sound very FDA-approved, Vern,
FDA-approved, that's a laugh, You didn't really believe that shit, did ya?
OK, so what do we have here?
Some unknown, untested, possibly dangerous drug scammed out of some unidentified lab somewhere given to me by a highly unreliable guy I hadn't seen in years.
- So you want some more?
- Yes, Definitely,
All right, we'll talk about it, but I, uh, need a favor first,
Obviously, I'm in no condition to go out right now, so,
I was wondering if you could pop down to the dry cleaners, grab my suit for me,
And maybe grab a little...
A little breakfast for us,
He knew he had me.
Sure,
From now on, I'd happily be his errand boy.
Wash his windows, scrub his toilet anything I could do to get my hands on that little clear pill that would bring back...
Enhanced Eddie.
Vern?
Vern?
Vern...
Oh, Vern,
Hey, hey!
Hey!
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Hi, I need to report a a murder,
7B, yes,
OK, I won't,
Took them forever.
And the longer I stood there, the clearer I saw.
Vern had known whoever had done this.
And one guess what they'd been looking for.
But had they found it?
Shit, if you ever cooked, I'd be dead, too,
Police Department!
Open the door, please!
Police Department!
Open the door!
Open the door, please!
Police!
Open the door!
Let's go!
Open the door!
- Let me see your hands,
- Hey,
- Let me see your hands!
- No, no, I'm the one who called!
I called you guys!
So, you guys tight?
Hang out a lot?
No, my ex-wife's brother, I just actually ran into him on the street
- and he asked me to come up to...
- Buy some drugs?
- No, no, What?
- What did this guy do?
He...
Uh, I don't know, He was, um...
I heard that he was an antiques dealer?
- A dealer?
- Yeah, uh, antiques, Um...
Like, uh, Viennese kinda, um chairs and stuff.
Like, you know, like curlicue leg things,
Yeah?
That is correct, An Edward Morra,
He's here,
Victim's sister,
I hadn't heard her voice in ten years.
- Eddie?
- Melissa?
- You were there?
- Um...
Just before, I had run into him on the street and, uh... yeah,
Oh, God.
I wish I was more surprised.
He was involved in some stuff.
I'd better not say any more.
No, no, that's probably a good idea,
So, uh...
We should probably, uh, meet or something, right?
No, I gotta do the funeral and God knows what else.
I just...
We can't meet, OK?
Right, Well, I'll just...
I guess I'll just see you at the funeral then,
No.
I don't want that.
Please don't.
I'll call you at some point, OK?
- When this is over.
- OK, all right,
OK.
You know, something doesn't gel here,
Write down your number, I may need to contact you later,
Worth the risk?
What would you do?
Vern's cash, combined with an unprecedented surge of motivation, enabled me to finish the book in four days.
A tablet a day and what I could do with my day was limitless.
I learned to play the piano in three days.
Math became useful.
And fun.
I'm all in,
Even half-listening to any language, I became fluent.
So that Shakespeare's catchiness belies mediocrity?
There's no arguing with you,
This was great.
So, Mom, I've been doing a little research on Aunt Helen's tumor,
And it's totally clear that anybody with familial adenomatous polyposis should be supplementing platinum-based doublet regiments with eicosapentaeonic acid,
I suddenly knew everything.
About everything.
Well, sure, you get a short-term spike, but wouldn't that rapid expansion devalue that stock completely in two years?
- No, because there are safeguards,
- Against aggressive over-expansion?
There aren't, Because there are no safeguards in human nature,
We're wired to overreach,
Look at history, all the countries that ever ruled the world,
Portugal with this big massive navy,
All they got now are salt cod and cheap condoms,
And the Brits?
Now they're just sitting on a dank little island fussing over their suits,
No one's stopping and thinking, "Hey, we're doing pretty well,
We got France, we got Poland, we got a big Swiss bank account,
You know what?
Let's not invade Russia in the winter,
Let's go home, let's pop a beer, and let's live off the interest,"
Yeah.
My brain was just pouring this stuff out.
Everything I had ever read, heard, seen was now organized and available.
Here it is.
Here you go.
Eddie, Hey, Listen, I'm sure you have a portfolio, but if you don't, I'd be very interested in working with you,
OK, Kevin,
I made some new friends who invited me to the beach.
The beach was not nearby.
All my fear, all my shyness, gone.
They've done four basic trials...
But mere lounging wasn't enough.
Only problem?
If I wasn't moving forward,
I felt like I was going to explode.
Come up here because it's beautiful, right?
- Anybody ever jump?
- Are you crazy?
- He's gonna do it,
- He's not gonna do it,
Oh, my God!
Oh!
Ah!
And then I began to form an idea.
Suddenly, I knew exactly what I needed to do.
It wasn't writing.
It wasn't books.
It was much bigger than that.
But it would take money to get there.
In a down market, no one was making much.
But no one had NZT.
In an optimistic scenario, gains of that nature merely would reflect growth in the economy and would not pose an obstacle...
Armed with Vern's last $800, I made 2,000 in a day.
Next day, 7,500.
It was too slow.
I'd need more capital.
But banks weren't lending to guys like me.
Hey, Liev,
That's your man in the corner back there,
Yeah,
So, uh, Liev told you that I'm looking for a short-term loan?
Yeah, and I told Liev forget it,
Why?
Because I don't see you before and I don't fucking like you already,
Why do I give you $100,000?
Because I quintupled my money four days in a row,
So you got a fix on the game,
No, not a fix,
I was able to calculate certain patterns using algorithms,
If you look at column four, this was the first...
You're good,
OK, it's a fix,
Yeah, you know, all you people get caught,
Yeah, you know, all you people get caught,
What are you gonna do then?
Well, it's not as if I have a black book with your name in it, if that's what you're talking about,
And besides, I get the strong feeling that you're not somebody I want to disappoint,
Don't get up, I said don't get up,
- Sit down!
- Hey, OK,
- OK, you take this, you mine,
- OK,
You understand?
You don't pay, you know what we do?
I cut you at waist,
Peel your skin up over your head and tie knot in it,
You don't die from this, You suffocate,
- OK,
- Good luck,
My new friend, Kevin Doyle, showed me how you could leverage two and a half times your cash at the day trading firm.
I'd been upping the dose for over a week.
It seemed to cut my learning curve.
Why are you buying that?
The CEO was just indicted,
But not for the big fat defense contract he bribed his way into,
That's still on, Should be announced next week,
I was jacked in.
Booted up.
At the end of the week, my brokerage account contained over two million dollars.
Word quickly got out.
- -
- You have 19 messages.
Four job offers, my bank raising my line of credit, a reporter from the New York Post,
Really call me back, Mr. Morra.
No one makes money that fast.
This article's gonna get written with or without you.
And finally, Kevin Doyle trying to sound casual.
Eddie, I was talking you up to my boss and, well, the impossible happened, bud.
We got you a meeting with Carl Van Loon.
Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?
- Apparently so,
- But you're not in the finance game,
What can you do for Carl Van Loon?
Since when do you speak Italian?
Oh, Self-improvement month,
I guess somebody gave me a wake up call,
I hope you didn't do it for me,
No, I just wanted to apologize to you, Lin,
And let you know that apparently my capacity for self-sabotage wasn't boundless after all,
The real question is, why did you ever put up with me?
I was in love with you,
So, when does the book come out?
Next year, How's your new assistant?
- She's good,
- Good,
- Yeah,
- Yeah,
And, uh, are you gonna get a new...
You know...
I'm really happy you're here with me,
I'm proud of you, And a little intimidated,
We started up again.
Her place.
My place.
Basically every place.
"In a sizzling three days of trading, the unknown Mr. Morra trumped the market, prompting one top hedge fund manager to comment:
'He's Houdini, He's a prophet of our times,"'
OK, give me that, Give me that!
- "He's God"?
- You coming over later?
I can't, I don't have a key,
Oh, that's right,
- Can I have it back?
- Uh...
Nope,
- No?
- I mean, does it have to be that key?
Can it be a new key?
To our place?
- It would be cost effective,
- And you say I'm not practical,
Can I walk you to work?
Whatcha doing, hon?
Nothing,
You should sleep,
Isn't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow?
Eddie?
Are you OK?
What are you doing out here?
When's the last time you ate something?
There he is, Nice article in the Post, buddy,
OK, he is on his way,
Now, be warned, He's mercurial,
One minute, your best friend, the next, you're a leper,
And he needs direct answers, Anything tentative and you've lost him forever,
I think we should rehearse a few scenarios,
I'm eating, Kevin,
Hey, are you up for this?
You sure?
'Cause I got a little bit on the line here,
Have a toast point,
- It's Carl Van Loon,
- That's Carl Van Loon,
He's worth a fortune,
- Hey, John,
- Hey, Carl, Good to see you,
- How are ya?
- Eddie,
So, Eddie Morra,
- What's your secret?
- Medication,
I'm on special medication,
OK,
Well, it's a formula with a complex method,
But, of course, research was a component, Massive research,
I knew every helix of every scrap of DNA in every company I bought,
Papers stacked like the Himalayas in my office, and you know what?
- The stocks went up,
- By a hair,
Sure, the stocks rose, but who wants to do all that work for a shitty little uptake?
It's not the visceral kind of spike you want in short term holdings so I dispensed with all the hard statistics and I went right to the rumor mill,
So you bought your stocks based on what?
The tom-toms beating in the street?
Sure, Share prices aren't really based on how a company works,
It's about how mass psychology works,
So, if I found certain algorithms in the perception of the stock...
Pattern recognition, That's your snake oil,
Well, not everybody understands the patterns,
And that gave me a little bit more of an uptake, but it's just a parlor trick,
So then, I went on to door number three,
Are you really implying that you have some sort of ultimate formula?
Well, from 12,000 to 2,3 million in ten days,
- I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce,
- Delusions of grandeur,
I don't have delusions of grandeur, I have an actual recipe for grandeur,
I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what you game is, but I'm sure of one thing,
You don't work in my world,
I'm up to my ass with investment guys and you don't have their half-terrified, half-cocky line of crap which is not to say that I like yours any better,
But you obviously pick your stocks in a way which I haven't seen before,
Take a look at these companies and tell me what you think,
- Right now?
- Yeah, Take your time,
Sure,
These companies aren't the question, are they?
Explain,
Unless you're playing both sides of the fence,
Control the whole power enchilada, but, no, these companies wouldn't get you there in emerging markets,
You would have to...
Oh, Whoa,
This must be some big-ass merger you're contemplating,
And there's really only one company with enough bling to justify a merger with Van Loon and Associates,
Who have you been talking to?
Oh, I'm just connecting the dots, Is Hank Atwood really gonna go for it?
Well, you're an amazing con artist, or you're a very smart young man,
I mean, come on, The two of you together?
The whole world would have to come begging for energy like Oliver Twist and his bowl of gruel,
Now you're going backwards, What else you got?
- A prediction, It won't come off,
- Why's that?
- You'd have to back off Libya,
- Really?
Well, you don't want to hear this from some schmuck who needs a ride home,
All right, you get your shot, Meet me tomorrow at the Saint Regis at ten and tell me how the gutsy little schmuck who needs a ride home would re-structure these deals, And you'd better be prepared,
I'm at your disposal,
You don't really live here, do you?
Well...
Spartans weren't big on amenities,
Yeah, and they eventually got their asses kicked,
I didn't go in.
I wanted to walk, move, digest, ingest.
There are moments in life... moments when you know you've crossed a bridge.
Your old life is over.
Van Loon was my bridge.
I finally had my shot.
Wall Street would provide my nest egg, but then how far could I go?
CEO?
A global force?
Maybe President.
Time somebody shook up the free world and got things done.
Suddenly...
It was another skip.
How had I gone the last 20 blocks?
I got another ten blocks.
And then I was way uptown.
What bar was this?
... black canvas and then they would just drop all the paint...
Yeah, Did you ever meet and then I actually went there and had lunch, I went back,
My friends are rolling...
I heard you like to party.
- Hey, watch it,
- Hey, hey!
Take it easy!
A fight?
Don't know how to fight.
Or do I?
Ah!
You use the fishhook action to get inside the mouth.
Like this. -
Attack the sensitive areas.
The eyes, the throat, the groin.
If you are hit, do not stop.
Your persistence will discourage your attacker.
Off-balancing your opponent and then using his momentum, take him down.
When it finally stopped,
I couldn't account for the last 18 hours of my life.
Hey, it's me.
I thought you were coming over.
Is everything OK?
Call me when you get this.
Even off NZT, I decided to give Van Loon's files a shot.
They were hieroglyphs.
- Hello?
- Kevin, this is Eddie.
- Eddie?
- Listen,
- I can't make the meeting today.
- What are you talking about?
I can't come in today, I'm sick,
Yeah, well you can't have the flu right now,
He'll never give you this chance again,
I know, listen, I just...
I have all this data to analyze...
What have you been doing for the last day?
- Kev, I...
- Don't you get it?
This is your test,
Yeah, well, I can't pass the test right now,
And how am I gonna look if you don't?
- I know, listen, I just...
- Sh, Listen to me,
Pull yourself together, Get down to the meeting,
OK, OK, I'll be there, I'll be there,
- Hey, how are ya?
- Eddie,
Good to see you again,
Sit down,
What do you know about Hank Atwood?
Atwood, um...
He's an iconoclast, um...
Owns about half of Colorado,
So this is prepared, Eddie?
Uh...
Is this Atwood 101?
Doesn't everybody know about Atwood?
Where was he two years ago?
Hm?
- Nowhere,
Two years ago he wasn't even on Forbes' radar,
That was a great leap forward, right?
I'm baffled by this guy, He comes out of nowhere so strong,
Has me on the run before I can even get to anybody in his camp,
Beats me out of two properties, investing in countries with no oil, Places I'd never go near...
We're here in front of the hotel where a woman, identified as Maria Winberg, was found dead in her room last night, a victim of foul play.
Ms. Winberg was a well-known socialite and model but was also known for her dedicated charity work around the city.
Police spent hours questioning hotel staff and patrons and an eyewitness reported seeing a man leaving the scene help me convince him that I can raise his game, Got any ideas?
What do you think?
Hm?
- Um...
Hotel has adequate security cameras...
You're not one of those kind of guys, are you Eddie?
We lose you if there's a screen in the room?
These are tectonic plates that are shifting right under us,
Pardon me, one second.
Was it possible?
Could I have killed someone?
Was it even me?
Eddie?
This is Melissa.
Listen, Vernon hasn't been giving you anything, has he?
Because that stuff is dangerous.
Melissa?
Melissa, hey, do you think that we can meet somewhere?
- I really need to talk to you,
- We're talking now.
No, no, let's meet at, uh...
Billy's on Grant at noon?
- You can't see me, Eddie.
- No, no...
- Eddie, please.
- Please, please come, please come, I...
It's important, I really need to know what you're talking about,
I realized that there were other people who might know about NZT.
Vernon's other clients.
- Hi.
- Yeah, hi, may I please speak with Jerry Brady?
- Jerry's in the hospital.
- He's what?
Yeah, he's not doing well at all.
- Yeah, hello, is Paul Kaplan there?
- Uh, no.
No, he's not.
Uh, Paul passed away three days ago.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry,
Yeah, he started getting headaches, then he collapsed at work.
Now he's in the ICU.
OK, please give him my best, Thank you,
Of all the people I called...
three were dead and the rest were sick.
Hello?
Hello?
Watch it, man!
Did you see that?
Hey!
Go!
Go!
Eddie,
Melissa,
Hey,
Don't tell me I look good, 'cause I know,
I didn't want you to see me this way,
You look good,
Oh, I, uh...
Yeah, I sorta got myself together,
NZT will do that to you,
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I took it, too,
Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?
No,
Well, when he told me about this amazing new drug,
I was like, down the hatch, And it was, It was amazing,
I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes and I understood it,
My work rate increased just insanely overnight and my boss started to hate me,
They offered me his job and then...
and then I got scared,
- Why?
- Why?
Because I'm not stupid,
Nobody can operate at that level of mental activity and not crash,
I stopped taking it,
- And?
- And I got sick, Headaches,
Throwing up, So I went back to Vernon,
He told me about all the people that were dying,
How much have you been taking, Eddie?
I've been taking a lot,
Well, maybe... maybe they've worked out the bugs, Maybe...
Maybe this is a different batch,
- Yeah,
- You're off it right now, aren't you?
- Just finish your story,
- Well I didn't take any more and I didn't die,
But after a while, I realized I couldn't concentrate on anything for longer than ten minutes,
I, uh...
I missed deadlines, got lazy, slow, so slow,
That was two years ago,
And I haven't been the same since,
Do you have some left?
Good,
You go home and you take it, You take the dose down, but you don't just stop,
You'll die if you just stop,
Try to taper off, otherwise the headaches are just the beginning,
I have to go,
- Do you know who makes it?
- I don't know,
I have to go,
Oh, shit, Listen, listen, listen, Listen, listen, listen...
OK,
- You forget about me, huh?
- No, no, no, no, 12:00 and you're not here,
- I'm here now, Oh!
- Good,
- Come on, get going,
- I could write you a check,
Check, Check, Are you out of your mind?
What do you think I am?
Some financial institution?
All right, You're right, Look, we just need to go to a bank...
What do you got there?
- What is it?
- No, it's just aspirin,
Don't look like no aspirin I ever see, It's something good, huh?
I feel good, man, What's in this stuff?
It's just, uh, vitamins and aspirin,
You full of shit, Eddie baby,
Lindy, I wouldn't have let him in, but...
I'm sorry...
Tyler, I gotta go,
I'm sick,
I shouldn't...
I'm sorry, I couldn't make it home,
- Let's get you to a hospital,
- No, no, no, no, no, I don't need...
I need you to get...
It's really simple, babe, I need my pills,
- Eddie, what pills?
- I don't...
Babe, it's complicated,
What are you taking?
Are you on drugs?
They're... it's...
I had no choice.
I told Lindy everything.
So all this energy of yours, all this focus has been a drug,
Well, it was supposed to be legal,
I have a... a supply stashed,
You want me to go get it,
- No, No, no, no, I'm gonna go get it,
- Give me your keys,
I'll go to your apartment,
It's not... in my apartment, I moved it,
OK, so where did you move it?
In my house,
Unbelievable,
Hey, have you got it?
Yeah,
There's someone following me,
Are you sure?
Yeah, He got into the cab behind me and he's making every turn I'm making,
- Baby, call the cops,
- Can you go around him?
Babe, what's happening?
We're stopped dead,
He's getting out,
Eddie, he's walking over here,
Lindy?
Oh, God!
Ow!
Help!
Help!
This man's...
This man's chasing me!
He followed me from my building, I don't know him,
- Please!
- Yo, buddy, let's leave her alone!
Are you deaf?
I said leave her alone,
Hey, buddy, are you trying to piss me off?
What are you doing, man?
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm here, What happened?
I'm stuck, He'll find me,
OK, stop talking.
Don't move.
- He killed two guys.
- What?
- He's gonna kill me, too,
- No, no, no...
Can he see you?
No,
Not yet,
I don't know what to do,
OK, I need you to go into the bag and take one of the pills,
Why?
Because you'll know what to do.
You'll take it and then you'll know.
He's got a knife, Eddie, I can't think my way out of a knife,
Just listen to me, It'll come on in 30 seconds,
And you'll think your way out, That's what it does,
He's getting closer,
Lindy, I love you,
Hey!
Now turn to me...
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Ah!
- Daddy!
Ah!
Eddie, Here,
It's gonna be OK,
We've got to get out of here, Eddie?
You OK?
Yeah,
I'm so sorry about what happened,
I want you to know that you never, ever have to go through that again, 'cause I can take care of us now,
I'm sure you can,
I can make us safe, I'm back, OK?
- Who's back, Eddie?
- Me,
No, It's not you,
- You were different before,
- I'm still the same person, Lin,
I wasn't, when I was on it,
I did things I would never do,
- Those things saved your life,
- But they weren't me,
Yes, they were, No, the way it works...
I know how it works, I get it,
I totally get it, You feel invincible,
Where it will take us, Lin, you can't even imagine,
The things we'll be able to do, Where we'll be a year from now,
The kind of life that we'll finally be able to live,
Well, you might have to live it without me,
Look, I am gonna stop taking it, There's just some things I have to do to keep us safe and that...
To set us up and then I'm gonna get off it,
- I mean, that's the plan,
- Eddie...
Look, I have a plan, I swear,
I'm gonna get off it,
OK,
I hope you do,
Looking for me?
You think you can run out on me, huh?
You think I don't know where you are?
I was under the impression our business was settled,
I want some more of that stuff,
Or I shoot you right here, Take your pick,
This guy was not going away.
A few pills would buy me some time.
- There it is, We're done,
- Oh, yeah, We'll see,
Until I found a more... permanent solution.
Unless you see a real threat, I never want it known that I have any security,
You'll never precede me, you'll always follow me,
Never more than 15 steps behind, And never stand too close together,
I want to able to look behind me if the opportunity presents itself,
And don't wear the same color suit, This isn't The Matrix.
You have to know, Eddie, I wrote you off,
- I was sick,
- You don't get sick,
You're playing at this level, you get hit by a car, you don't even die,
- You're absolutely right,
- I know I'm right,
I mean, I didn't know who or what I was talking to,
A hundred and five, That's who you were talking to, Carl, Delirium,
Mm-hm,
I sent over my revised projections,
I didn't ask for your projections,
I know, but I think if you take a look at them...
I already have, As a matter of fact I fired a few people over your projections,
- I'm sorry,
- No, you're not,
You're relieved that you know things my team missed,
The minute, the instant that's no longer true...
Two months after I'd started NZT,
I was brokering the biggest merger in corporate history.
Ironically, it's gonna be crude, Crude is gonna be where we're gonna hit them,
Which yields a prospective profit of 200 percent,
That makes both of us very happy campers,
I found that if I maintained an even dose, remembered to eat, drank no alcohol,
- the blackouts didn't recur.
- How you doing, Eddie?
Tom, is it possible to construct an imperceptible compartment?
In this jacket?
- In all of them,
- Certainly, sir,
Safer though my stash now was, I was not sitting around until it ran out.
Can I combine these ingredients in the same exact quantity, yes, but, the exact method of delivery to the brain...
Darts at a dartboard,
- Meaning?
- Clinical trials, guinea pig people,
- That's gonna take too long,
- It's what it is,
Or you'll kill people, You need 12, to 18 months...
I'll give you two million dollars if you can do it in six,
I found that we can cut costs 30 percent and, um...
Excuse me one second,
I thought we straightened this out, Detective,
This isn't about Vernon Gant, Mr. Morra,
What is this about?
The witness identified the Maria Winberg suspect as this person,
Wanna tell me your whereabouts the night of April 2nd?
I couldn't keep this quiet on my own.
Enter Morris Brandt...
the most lethal lawyer in New York.
You're lucky somebody wiped the room, It's weak, Circumstantial at best,
Just between us, were you there?
I don't remember,
I don't want to make concessions to you...
Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood had no idea I might soon be charged with murder.
But SyCorps, Andine and others are jockeying for the same industrial concessions in Libya that both our companies are pretending we're not sniffing out,
How do you know this?
The governmental bribe system is itself corrupt, so, of course, information about its inner workings, like anything, can be bought,
Go on,
If you take a look at the lower left-hand column, in 2008, five companies were jockeying for a position before we even took notice,
Jesus, he looks frail,
- Could be an act,
- He's not even 60,
So, have you decided, Eddie?
What are you gonna do?
When this is over?
I don't know,
You haven't given me the answer,
You haven't asked the question,
Well, given the scale of my contribution, let's say 45,
Done, Forty-five thousand dollars,
Forty million is plenty, Eddie, There's a lot more where that came from,
You know, Eddie it may be on your mind that you're not gonna continue to work for me anymore,
This has been the learning experience of my life,
I hope it has, I hope you don't think you've gotten enough from me,
On to the next,
Well, in order for a career to evolve, I'm gonna have to move on,
That you would even think that would only show me how unprepared you are to be on your own,
I mean, you do know you're a freak, -
Your deductive powers are a gift from God, or chance, or a stray shot of sperm, or whatever, or whoever the hell wrote your life script, a gift not earned,
You do not know what I know because you have not earned those powers,
You're careless with those powers,
You flaunt them and you throw them around like a brat with his trust fund,
You haven't had to climb up all the greasy little rungs,
You haven't been bored blind at the fundraisers, You haven't done the time in that first marriage to the girl with the right father,
You think you can leap over all in a single bound,
You haven't had to bribe or charm or threaten your way to a seat at that table, You don't know how to assess your competition because you haven't competed, Don't make me your competition,
Now, I'll open up a line of credit for you,
You'll be wanting a few toys,
Hotel rooms were no longer an option.
What I needed was a bunker.
There's a built-in safe, central surveillance, vault grade pneumatic doors.
It's an unparalleled three-tier security system,
A fortress with a hell of a view,
- What's the asking price?
- Eight-point-five,
I'll take it,
Right away, it was obvious he was on NZT.
Next week, I'm gonna need 20 pills,
Next week, you can go fuck yourself!
-
Not that you'd feel anything,
I don't think your Fortune 500 financial friends would appreciate the details of your little dilemma with the police,
Thursday, I'm gonna need the pills here,
Getting smarter!
Obviously, this could not go on, but there is very little on this earth that 40 million dollars can't solve.
And tomorrow at nine, Atwood would sign the papers.
- Do you want to call it?
- Cold feet?
There was all last night to tell us that,
- Anything?
- I'll call him again, sir.
OK, the decision could have changed, That makes sense,
OK, the decision could have changed, That makes sense,
The discourtesy doesn't, It's still on,
Oh, based on your charts and projections,
You know, remind me, who the fuck are you, anyway?
I'm sorry, Carl, I've had it with this unqualified, posturing little prick,
- Pull it back,
- Since when is this the Delphic Oracle?
- Pull it back,
- Excuse me, Mr. Van Loon?
Mrs. Atwood is in your office,
Ah, Mrs. Atwood, Carl Van Loon,
- My associate, Edward Morra,
- Pleasure,
I wanted to make this as confidential as possible,
Of course,
My husband experienced some pain and dizziness this morning,
He's currently at Lenox Hill, undergoing tests,
I just want you to know we have every intention
I just want you to know we have every intention of signing the contract,
And as soon as he is able, we will proceed,
I realize this is a useless platitude, but if there's anything that we can do, please don't hesitate to tell us,
Obviously, we want to be as helpful and respectful as possible, Mrs. Atwood,
Thank you, gentlemen, I rely on your discretion,
There won't be a proxy,
No, a cagey prick like him giving away power of attorney?
Well, he'd better get better,
But Atwood wouldn't get better.
Because Atwood was out of NZT.
Well, why be surprised?
How many other meteoric rises might be explained by NZT?
At least I had some.
- My life wasn't in jeopardy.
- You can wait here,
Only my money.
And my liberty.
I've been all over with them,
We can't allow any disparity in race or physical type between you and the rest of the line up,
OK,
They're as close to your clones as I could possibly get,
It's gotta be just one big handsome blur to this guy.
Who was out there?
The woman's husband?
A hotel maid?
Was this how it was all going to end?
Not the dimmest clue, He was dithering,
"He was the third one from the right, No, Not him,"
There you go, It's a thing of beauty, You have that made?
I did,
...market's been mixed today.
The Dow has been yo-yoing amidst speculation that
Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger...
Have you been talking to anyone?
No, I haven't been talking to anybody, Carl, I'm not stupid,
I know you're not stupid, Eddie, but don't make the classic smart person's mistake,
Thinking no one's smarter than you,
Where the hell have you been?
This is the second time you've turned to vapor,
I was in the building, I was getting coffee, Why, has there been movement?
Yeah, there's been movement alright, Atwood's in a coma,
He wasn't playing us, He's dying,
What do you know about this?
I was less than usually equipped to answer.
The dullness was coming on.
I was overdue to take my NZT.
And the pain was starting behind my eyes.
Excuse me,
You're not excused,
What?
A man in your employ can't take a piss, Carl?
Was it Brandt or someone else?
The police station?
A coatroom?
Mr. Morra,
- Carl, I'm sorry...
- Mr. Morra, Mr. Morra!
- This just came for you,
- Yeah, what?
Hope not, so let me know when you know,
All right, I'm gonna ask you again, Eddie, What do you know about this?
- What?
About the leak?
- No, About Atwood,
- What?
About the leak?
- No, About Atwood,
What?
What about Atwood?
Look, you got a long way to go as a liar, kiddo,
- Carl, I don't know what you're...
- Listen!
What you're about to say is bullshit,
I know there's something you're hiding from me,
I smell it on you, Right now,
I wanna know why this clusterfuck of a deal is dead in the water!
Carl,
Eddie!
Eddie!
Outside Lenox Hill Hospital today, more twists and turns in the Van Loon-Atwood merger.
There is absolutely no truth to the rumor of this merger.
None whatsoever.
My husband is having tests.
This is a difficult time.
We would appreciate your directing further questions to our attorney.
Yes, we have no further comments at this time.
We're just awaiting the results of the latest round of tests and hoping for the best.
Thank you.
Eddie, I know you're in there, Eddie,
Open up,
Come on,
Open the door,
And so, here I am.
I knew they would kill me slowly and horribly.
But this choice would at least be mine.
But we're instinctive creatures.
We want to live.
So my foggy brain tried to remember where one tablet of NZT might be.
It was possible.
And possible was enough.
Hey, Eddie,
Now you know I want more, so why would you upset me?
I don't like being down to this last one,
You don't even know how to use it,
You don't appreciate it,
You see, I dissolve in a solution,
You shoot it, It goes straight into the blood and brain,
Lasts much longer,
So...
You gonna tell me where the rest is?
I'm plumb out,
You know, these guys are gonna find it,
Or I'm gonna make you tell me,
Question is, which is gonna come first?
I guess we're gonna find out, huh?
This is a waste of my time, you know?
I'm getting out of this side of the business,
I'm branching out, I'm starting import-export company,
Very exciting stuff,
I got a lot on my plate, You're lucky I'm here,
Back in the old times, I might peel your skin back, Fillet you,
"Fillet," It's a nice word,
I didn't know this before, Oh, I had such a poor vocabulary,
But then I discovered this thing, Google,
Did you know the small and large intestines is 20 foot long?
I had no idea, I don't believe it,
I gotta see this for myself, I'm dubious, It's another nice word,
Anyway, I'm sure you're curious, too,
Don't worry, everything's sterilized,
We're gonna keep you alive for the whole shebang,
You're gonna get a front row seat, Eddie,
What?
Ah!
Not much of a triumph, was it?
Because I would die here, too.
Only NZT could help me and the last of it was in this fuck's blood stream.
Victor!
What?
Ah!
Hey!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Victor?
Victor?
Victor?
The police would later note that my apartment's previous owner was an arms dealer.
Of course, these intruders had been his dissatisfied clients.
And the night was still young.
I'm sure you're curious about what happened to your boss,
I know I certainly am,
I mean, if my attorney was really working for Mr. Atwood, trying to save his life, why is he dead?
I mean, at what point was the pony express supposed to ride in with his life-saving medication?
His boss was dead.
So, I didn't matter now.
But he did not appreciate that Morris Brandt had kept the pills for himself.
And it was all still possible.
Actually, no, there's no more tickets,
Yeah, I know, An overbooked fundraiser, That's a first,
Well, here he comes, I'll ask him,
Oh, that's much better,
- Great job,
- Thank you, sir,
Hi, Mr. Morra,
Edward!
I think we're looking at a second overflow event,
There's a wave of donations coming in and I don't think they're even gonna try a second debate,
- Great,
- Hold on,
A guy from Eiben-Chemcorp's in your office,
- I have a lunch,
- They're your biggest contributor,
Give him his two crappy little minutes,
- Eiben-Chemcorp Pharmaceuticals?
- Yeah,
Finally get to meet the guys that keep the lights on,
- Carl!
- Mr. Morra,
What a surprise, They told me somebody from Eiben was coming,
Chemcorp, Yeah, that's me now, I'm moving out of the energy business,
Come on, That's like Hef moving out of the mansion,
Yeah, I bought Eiben a couple of months ago, I'm surprised you didn't hear,
No, No, Well, they really keep me hopping here,
Well, it's gonna pay off, Senator Morra,
The Senate, Who knows...
Everything's a technicality from here on in, isn't it, Eddie?
I think we both know where it's headed, if you can maintain,
Have you asked yourself what you're gonna do when you run out?
- When did you know?
- Does it matter?
I know now,
I wish you'd come to me at first, Eddie, I could have bought Eiben at 33 a share,
We could have been partners,
So, Eiben makes NZT,
Well, it'll never officially exist,
Obviously, I don't need to point out the advantages for you,
Oh, I think maybe you do,
Limitless supply, We know you can't get any more,
You sure about that?
They shut down your lab this morning,
Eddie, I just want to help you, that's all,
Keep you supplied, No disruption in service,
Give you peace of mind, That's all,
And in return, I do what?
Get a little advice, maybe, I won't be bothering you much at first,
And later, What are you gonna be bothering me with?
Well, given where you're heading, some of our ideas are a bit ambitious,
But hey, I think they're achievable,
And what if I don't like your ideas?
Then we'll say, "Godspeed,"
And your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely light,
But you know what, Eddie, let's not even go there right now,
Right now, I just want to keep you brilliant and healthy, Come on, Let's go get some lunch,
After you, Senator,
Thanks for stopping by, Carl,
Give us a second,
What are you doing?
Do you want to be President of the United States
- or brain dead, stuck full of tubes?
- I'll take my chances,
I told you your chances don't exist, We shut down your lab,
You don't think some smartass on NZT might have two or three or even four labs?
- So what?
You're not making any more,
- That's right, I'm not,
I thought better of it, See, once you know what's in it, you can tweak it, re-engineer it, Get the bugs out, Taper off,
I'm off it, Carl,
Well, on it or off it, there's no scenario where you're not working for me,
How you gonna pay me?
In cigarettes?
Last year you traded
- inside information 17 times,
- You threatening me?
Blank checks from Dubai, Dumping in Chile, Disappeared officials,
- I mean, you shed a spot light...
- Do you want to go to war with me?
And trust me when I say this, I'm not even being creative,
There's no way you can be making accusations like that and be walking around alive,
That you would even think that shows me how unprepared you are to fight me,
- You're no longer equipped to fight me,
- I may be off it, but you think I didn't learn anything?
That my synapses didn't change?
That I kept absolutely nothing?
You have no idea what kind of enemy I can be,
- That van's gonna rear-end that taxi,
- What?
The driver's distracted, He's texting, He's going 30 miles an hour,
He has 60 feet to stop, He doesn't have room,
What van?
I see everything, Carl,
I'm 50 moves ahead of you and everybody else,
What makes you think I don't have a guy with a bead on you right now?
How do you know you're gonna be alive this time next year?
What are you doing?
You get your hands off me, What are you doing?
Something's pumping half-mass in there, The walls of your heart are dilated,
Your aortic valve's steno, So you're gonna need to get that replaced,
But you already knew that,
You know, you should really be glad about this,
'Cause me working for you?
You'd end up as my bitch,
Maybe we should cool off, Talk again,
I don't think so,
Don't forget to vote,
Edward,
You good?
Yeah, Told you I have a lunch,
- Sorry I'm late,
- Hey, Don't worry,
- How's your day going?
- Ah, I've had better,
I still can't deal with that haircut,
I wouldn't even recognize you on the street,
Well, I'm a new man,
I've already ordered,
What?
Obviously, I miscalculated a few things.
Eddie
I know you're in there,
Why is it that, the moment your life exceeds your wildest dreams...
"The Knife" appears in your back.
Well, I'll tell you one thing...
I will never let them touch me.
My neighbor, must have opened his door to complain.
For a guy with a 4 digit IQ, I must have missed something...
And I hadn't missed much.
I'd come this close to having an impact in the world.
And now, the only thing I had an impact on... was the sidewalk.
You see that guy?
That was me, Not so long ago.
What kind of guy, without a drug or alcohol problem looks this way?
Only a writer.
strangely enough, nobody believed that I actually had a book contract.
Well it's best rated as a sci-fi novel... but it's really uh, my own personal manifesto about the plight of the individual in the 21 century.
and I sort a created a Utopian society, where, we all sort of uh uh uh...
It's really...
It, it's really, it's re- uh.
Today was the day, I was gonna kick its ass
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go
Man, It's gonna be great.
Just gotta put in the time and stay in the room.
That's the key concept.
Don't leave the room!
A few weeks passed this way
Maybe a few months.
At least I still had Lindi.
Just like that?
Come on, Eddie...
This is hardly a surprise.
I, I'm surprised?
Let's just not do this.
I am gonna hand in 90 pages tomorrow on Friday
You just wait to see what she says.
- Eddie!
- What?
I know how it's going.
I am, I was, your girlfriend.
That word doesn't even begin to describe what you are to me.
Partner?
Squeeze?
Paramour.
Inamorata
Cleaning Lady.
Bank.
Well be there that..
Well what's mine is yours too.
and you know that I want to share the rest of my life with you.
- In fact, I was thinking...
- that we should probab...
- Don't propose.
Why not?
Because it worked out so well for you last time.
it's true, I did marry once, right out of college - to melissa..
I do!
briefly.
This isn't working.
Well, even though everything you said is true, I still love you.
I gotta get back to work.
You didn't even tell me what happened.
- I got it!
- You did?
I'm an Editor.
I have my own assistant.
You believe that?
Yeah, Of course I believe you.
You deserve it.
Thanks.
She was right.
Why stick it out?
I had clearly missed the on-ramp.
We both knew what was beckoning.
The lower bunk of my childhood bedroom in Jersey.
My Father happy to welcome me into the challenging field of dental supply inventory.
Eddy Morra!
Of all the useless relationships better forgotten and put away in mothballs
Is there any more useless than, the ex-brother in law?
Holy Shit, man!
How's it been, like Nine years?
- God!
- Hey!
You alright?
You look like you're livin' on the streets.
What's going on?
Not much.
Uh, I just broke up...
What am I, what's up uh, I'm writing...
Writing a lot
Oh, you still trying to write?
Matter of fact, I have a book contract
- Really?
- Yeah.
- That's great.
how about you?
Are you uh...
You still dealing?
- Do I look like I am still dealing?
- No, you don't.
No.
Come on, let's get a drink I wanna hear about this book.
I don't know, it's two o'clock in the afternoon.
When has that ever stopped you?
So.
- So...
- How is Melissa doing?
- Here.
- Thanks.
Wouldn't know, I don't see you her.
She moved upstate.
She got some kind of Internet, home-sales kinda job.
Couple of kids.
Couple of kids...
Who's the husband?
He walked out on her, if you really wanna know.
But what do you care, man?
You were married for like five minutes.
Look, I don't wanna talk about her.
I want to talk about you.
Okay?
Tell me about this book.
How's it going?
Well it's a...
I'm behind.
I'm behind on my book, and uh, It's pretty booked... including my days and nights, if you really want to know.
- Well, how much have you written on it?
- Not one word.
- Creative problems, um?
- Yeah.
Well I suppose, I can help you with that.
Just this once.
Oh, No, no, no...
You don't even know what it is.
- You're still dealing.
- Brother, I am light-years from that now.
I've been doing some consulting for a pharmaceutical company.
What, like some off-shore lab making fake Viagra?
Come on Vern.
No.
This is an exclusive product, that's coming on the stream next year.
They've had clinical tries, and it's F.D.A. approved.
Alright, just out of curiosity and that's all...
Let me see it.
What's in it?
They've identified these, receptors in the brain that activate specific circuits.
And you know how they say that we can access only 20% of our brain?
Well what this does, it lets you access all of it.
Vernon, look at me.
Do I look good to you?
I'm broke and I'm depressed off my ass.
I don't think that my life's gonna take some sudden upswing into fame and fortune, by taking some shiny brain exotic drug.
Get.
When?
Tell him we can't do that.
No.
You tell em.
No.
Now!
Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to leave you here Eddie.
But I really, I really do wanna do this again.
So, call me.
And, that's on the house.
I don't want it.
Do not be ungrateful.
You know how much that costs?
Eight hundred bucks...
A pop.
You're welcome.
All the way home, I thought about Melissa.
How could she be a failure too?
.
She'd been so smart.
Smarter than anyone around her
Clearly, there was a direct link between this Eddie...
Slightly drunk at three o'clock in the afternoon, and an earlier Eddie.
vomiting on his boss' desk... or stealing his dying aunts Percocet.
So who can blame Lindie for dumping me?
In the end, how much worse could it get?
I didn't want to see anybody.
Especially not my landlord's nasty young wife
- Valerie, Tuesday...
- Look!
Enough!
Okay...
Steve handles the rent, so you can feed your crap to him!
I suddenly had extra reason to get away from her.
I had thoughtlessly ingested a substance.
Like the rent's not low enough!
I had gotten remarkably little information from Vernon about what this drug would do.
you can even be a biker messenger and come up with that.
Really!
What if it was a hallucinogen?
.
It's pathetic!
Oh my God!
Listening to her rag - If I were tripping, I'd jump out a window
Hello!
Are you listening to me?
Do you get it?
You are gonna be out on the streets!
And then I felt it.
I was blind, but now I see.
- What's wrong?
- What?
You don't like me and I don't blame you.
You see a self defeating, energy sucking, piece of shit who's sponging off your husband... you're wishing I'd blow my brains out... but my existence shouldn't make you this upset
- What is it?
- That's none of your business!
Something wrong in Law school?
How do you know I am in law school?
People who aren't, usually don't carry around dry..
academically constipated books about a dead supreme court justice.
You are a creep aren't you?
You've been following me.
No, I just noticed the book.
You just saw the corner of it.
How did you know that?
I'd seen it before.
12 years ago in college.
sitting on the couch with a T.A. I was trying to make... waiting for her coming back out of the bathroom, hoping she'd have a condom.
Somehow, my unconscious had served that up.
A memory I'd never even recorded... or was there the whole time and I all I need was the access?
If you're writing a paper, that's not the book I'd use.
Who asked you?
Hastings has it's own history.
I'd start there.
Interesting point...
Grammatically, this guy was an idiot which sort of gives credence to the theory that one of the clerks, he had fired..
actually wrote most of this guy's major opinions.
you'd ruler the clerks sons...
They'd love to talk to you; exonerate their dad.
that'd give you something that no one else has... information from the odd museum show...
a half read article, some PBS documentary... was all bubbling up in my frontal lobes, mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information.
She didn't have a chance.
What, what, what are your suggestions?
We'd really worked on her paper too.
In 45 minutes, it was a polished gem.
She was pleased.
Home... but it couldn't be my home, could it!
?
and who would live like this?
My first thought...
Torch it!
.
But, saner heads prevailed.
What was this drug?
I couldn't stay messy on it
I hadn't had a cigarette in 6 hours;
hadn't eaten...
So, I'm steamiest and tidy.
What was this?
A drug for people, who wanted to be more anal retentive?
I wasn't high, wasn't wired...
Just clear.
I knew what I needed to do, and how to do it
The next morning, I sent a little probe down into my brain.
No surge of brilliance came up to greet me.
In short, I was back.
But something remained
- You're kidding?
!
- No
- Words have appeared on paper.
- Yes.
- Written by you?
- All you have to do, is to read 3 pages
Just read 3 Pages in the next hour.
and, if you don't want to keep reading, I'll give you back the advance.
- Okay, Eddie.
- Okay
Eddie, give me a call, when you get in.
Eddie, I am 40 pages further in.
call me.
It's, a little grandiose but I am still reading.
Okay, how did you do this?
I really...
Call me the minute, you get in.
Call!
Okay?
- Who is it?
- Hey, Vernon, its Eddie.
- Eddie who?
- Morra.
not a good time, Eddie.
Hey Vern, I really just need to talk to you.
- Vern, what happened?
- Don't worry about it.
I'm fine.
So, Eddie, you are interested after all.
That stuff's amazing.
Works better, if you're already smart.
- Vernon, who did this to you?
- Trust me, you do not want to know.
- So, uh, what, what's it called?
- Doesn't have a street name yet.
But, the boys in the kitchen, are calling it NZT-48.
The "boys" and, the "kitchen"?
Doesn't sound very, FDA approved Vern.
FDA approved.
That's a laugh.
You didn't really believe that shit.
Did ya?
Okay, so what do we have here?
some unknown, untested, possibly dangerous drug scammed out of some unidentified lab somewhere.
given to me by a highly unreliable guy I hadn't seen in years
- So you want some more?
- Yes.
Definitely.
Alright, we'll talk about it.
But I need a favor first.
Obviously, I'm in no condition to go out right now
So I was wondering if you could pop down to the uh, dry cleaners; grab my suit for me?
And maybe grab a little breakfast for us.
He knew, he had me.
Sure.
From now on, I'd happily be his errand boy.
Wash his windows, scrub his toilets...
Anything I can do, to get my hands on this little clear pill that would bring back, enhanced Eddie.
Vern?
Vern?
Vern?
Oh God.
Hey!
HEY!
911...
What's your emergency?
Hi, I need to report uh...
A murder?
7B, yes.
Okay, I'll hold.
It took them forever.
And the longer I stood there, the clearer I saw
Vern had known, whoever had done this
And one guess, what they'd been looking for
But had they found it?
Shit.
If you ever cooked, I'd be dead too.
Police dept!
Open the door please.
Police dept!
Open the door!
Open the door please!
Police!
Open the door!
Let's go!
Open the door!
- Let me see your hands!
- I'm the one who called!
- I called you guys!
So you guys tight?
Hang out a lot?
No.
He's my ex-wife's brother.
I just actually met him on the street and he asked me to come up.
- To buy drugs?
- No, No!
What?
- What did this guy do?
- I do not know.
He was...
I heard he was an antiques dealer.
- A dealer?
- Yeah uh, Antiques, um...
Like uh...
Like, Viennese kinda uh, um chairs and stuff.
like, curly cue leg things.
Yeah?
That is correct.
An Edward Morra.
He's here.
The victim's sister.
I hadn't heard her voice in ten years.
- Eddie?
- Melissa?
You were there?
um, just, just before.
I had run into him on the street, and uh, yeah
Oh God
I wish I was more surprised, he was involved in some stuff.
I better not to say anymore.
No, no, that's probably a good idea.
So uh, we should probably um, meet or something, right...
No, I gotta do the funeral and God knows what else...
We can't meet, okay?
Right.
I guess I'll just see you at the funeral then. uh?
No!
I don't, I don't want that.
Please don't.
I call you at the point okay, when this is over
Okay.
Alright
Okay.
You know, something doesn't gel here.
Write down your number.
I'll need it to contact you later.
Worth the risk?
What would you do?
Vern's cash, combined with an unprecedented surge in motivation enabled me to finish the book in 4 days
A tablet a day, and what I could do with my day, was limitless.
In learned to play the piano in 3 days.
Math became useful And fun...
All in.
Even half listing to any language, I became fluent.
So that Shakespeare's text, it is polite mediocrity.
who'd ever argue with you?
This was great.
So mom, I've been doing a little research on aunt Helen's tumor.
And... it's totally clear, that anybody with Familial Adomis Phalacrosis... should be supplementing Platinum doublet regiments... with lico cimpenti oic acid.
I suddenly knew everything;
about everything.
Sure dude!
You'd get a short term spike... but wouldn't that rapid expansion devalue the stock completely in two years?
No, cause there are safeguards.
Against the aggressive over expansion?
There aren't.
Cause there are no safeguards in Human nature.
Oh, we're wired to overreach.
look at history...
All the countries that ever ruled the world...
Portugal with his big massive navy.
All they got now are salt Cod and cheap condoms.
The Brits!
Now they're just sitting in their dank little isle and fussing over their suits.
No-one stopping and thinking...
Hey!
We're doing pretty well.
We got France.
We got Poland.
We got a big Swiss bank account
You know what...
Let's not invade Russia in the winter.
Let's go home.
Let's pop a beer.
Let's live off the interest.
Yeah.
My brain was just pouring this stuff out.
Everything I'd ever read, heard, seen was now organized and available here it is, here you go
Eddie!
Hey...
Listen, I'm sure you have a portfolio but if don't...
I'd be very interested working with you.
Okay, Kevin.
I made some new friends who invited me to the beach.
The beach, was not nearby.
All my fear, all my shyness, gone!
But mere lounging wasn't enough.
only problem, if I wasn't moving forward
I felt like I was going to explode
- Anybody ever jumped?
- Are you crazy?
- He is gonna do it.
- He's not gonna do it.
Oh my God!
And then I began to form, an idea.
Suddenly, I knew exactly what I needed do.
It wasn't writing.
It wasn't books.
It was much bigger than that
But it will take money to get there.
In a down market, no-one was making much.
But, no one had NZT.
Armed Vern's last 800 Dollars, I made $2,000 in a day.
Next day, 7500
It was too slow
I'd need more capital.
Banks weren't lending to guys like me.
That's him in the corner back there.
So, uh...
Liv told you that, I'm looking for a short-term loan?
Yeah, and I told them that - forget it.
Why?
Because I don't see you before, and I don't like you already
Why do I give you $100,000 Dollars?
Because...
I quintupled my money 4 days in a row.
- So you got a fix on the game?
- No, not a fix.
I was able to calculate certain patterns in the algorithms.
If you look at column 4, This was the first...
You're good.
Okay, its a fix.
Yea, and all you people get caught.
What are you gonna do then?
Well it's not as I if have a black book with your name in it...
If that's what you're talking about.
...and besides, I get the strong feeling... that, you're not somebody I want to disappoint.
Don't get up.
I said don't get up.
Sit down!
Okay.
Okay, you take this, you're mine. - okay
- You understand?
you don't pay...
You know what we do?
I cut you at waist.
peel your skin up over your head and tie a knot in it
You don't die from this, You suffocate
Good luck.
My new friend, Kevin Doyle, showed me how you can leverage.
two and a half times your cash at day trading firm
I've been upping the dose for over a week.
It seemed to cut my learning curve.
Hey, Why you buying that?
The CEO was just indicted
But not for the big fat defensive contract he bribed his way into
That's still on should be announced next week
I was jacked in, booted up.
At the end of week, My brokerage account.
contained over two million dollars.
word, quickly got out.
You have 19 messages.
four job offers, My bank raising my line of credit a reporter from the New York Post...
Really call me back Mr. Morra.
No one makes money that fast
This Article's gonna get written - with or without you.
And finally, Kevin Doyle, trying to sound casual.
Eddie, I was talking you up to my boss and well, the impossible happened bud.
But we got you a meeting with Karl van Loon.
Karl van Loon wants to meet you?
apparently so.
But you are not in the finance game?
What can you do for Karl van Loon?
Since when do you speak Italian?
Self improvement month.
I guess uh, somebody gave me a wakeup call.
- I hope you didn't do it for me.
- No, I just wanted to apologize to you.
And that you know, that apparently, my capacity for self-sabotage wasn't boundless after all.
The real question is...
Why did you ever put up with me?
I was in love with you.
- So when does the book come out?
- Next year.
How's your new assistant?
She's Good.
You know, I'm really happy you're here with me.
I'm proud of you.
And... a little intimidated.
We started up again her place.
my place.
basically everyplace.
"In a sizzling 3 days of trading, the unknown Mr. Morra"
"trumped the market, prompting one top hedge fund manger to comment:"
"He's Houdini.
He's a prophet of our times. "
Okay, give me that.
- He's god!
?
- You coming over later?
I can't.
I don't have a key.
Oh that's right.
Can I have it back?
- No
- No?
I mean, does it have to be that key?
Can it be a new key?
to our place?
It'll be cost-effective.
And you say I am not practical.
Can I walk you to work?
What you doin, hon?
Nothing.
You should sleep.
Isn't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow?
Eddie?
Are you okay?
What are you doing out here?
When's the last time you ate something?
Here he is.
Nice Article in the post buddy.
He is on his way.
Now be warned, he's mercurial.
One minute your best friend, the next, you're a leper.
And he needs direct answers.
Anything tentative, and you've lost him forever.
I think we should rehearse a few scenarios.
I am eating, Kevin.
Hey!
Are you up for this?
You sure?
Because I got a little bit on the line here.
Have a toast plate.
Hey, Karl.
Good to see you.
How are ya?
So, Eddie Morra, What's your secret?
Medication.
I'm on a special medication.
okay.
There's a formula with a complex method- but of course, research was a component;
massive research
I knew every helix of every scrap of DNA in every company I bought.
Papers stacked like the Himalayas in my office.
And you know what?
- The stocks went up.
- by a hair.
Sure, the stocks rose, but who wants to do all that work, for a shitty little uptake?
It's not the visceral kind of spike you want in short-time holding.
So...
I dispensed with all the hard statics and I went right to the rumor mill
So your bought your stocks based on what the tom-toms beating in the street?
Sure.
The share prices aren't really based on how a company works it's about how mass psychology works
So, if I found certain algorithms in the perception of the stock...
Pattern recognition.
That's your cycle help?
Well, not everybody understands the patterns.
and that gave me a little bit more of an uptake, but it's just a parlor trick.
so then I went to door number 3
You're really implying that you've, some sort of ultimate formula?
Well, from 12,000 to 2.3 million in ten days.
I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce.
delusions of grandeur
I don't have delusions of grandeur I have an actual recipe for grandeur.
I do not know who you are Eddie, or what your game is,
But I'm sure of one thing, you don't work in my world.
I'm up to my ass with investment guys... and you don't have the half terrified, half cocky line of crap; which is, not to say, that I like yours any better, but you obviously pick your stocks in a way that I haven't seen before.
Take a look at these companies and tell me what you think.
- Right now?
- Yeah.
Take your time.
Sure.
These companies aren't the question, are they?
Explain.
Unless you're playing both sides of the fence.
control the whole power enchilada...
But no, these companies wouldn't get you there in a merging markets
You would have...
Oh whoa!
Whoa, this must be some, big-ass merger you're contemplating
And there's really only one company with enough bling to justify a merger with Van Loon and associations.
Who've you been talking to?
Oh, I am just connecting the dots.
Is Hank Atwood really gonna go for it?
Well you're an amazing con artist, or you're a very smart young man...
I mean, come on!
The two of you together...
The whole world will have to come begging for energy like Oliver Twist and his bowl of Gruel.
Well now you're going backwards.
What else you got?
A prediction.
- It won't come off.
- Why's that?
- You'd have to back off Libya
Really?
But, you don't want hear this from some schmuck who needs a ride home.
Alright.
You get your shot.
Meet me tomorrow at the Saint Regis at 10 and tell me how the gutsy little schmuck who needs a ride home, would restructure these deals.
- And you better be prepared.
- I am at your disposal.
You don't really live here, do you?
Well, um Spart's weren't big on amenities.
Yea, and they eventually got their asses kicked.
I didn't go in.
I wanted to walk, move, digest, ingest
There are moments in life moments, when you know, you've crossed a bridge.
Your old life is over.
Van Loon was my bridge.
I finally had my shot.
Wall Street would provide my nest egg.
but then how far could I go?
CEO?
A global force?
Maybe president.
time, somebody shook up the free world and got the things done.
Suddenly, there was another skip.
How have I gone the last 20 blocks?
I got another 10 blocks ...and then...
I was way up town.
Hey!
Watch it!
a fight?
I don't know how to fight.
or do I?
if your assailants do not stop, your insistence will distract the attacker.
off balancing your opponent, can make use of his momentum
What bar was this?
When it finally stopped
I couldn't account for the last 18 hours in my life
Hey, it's me.
I thought you were coming over.
Is everything okay?
Call me when you get this.
Even off NZT, I decided to give Van Loon's files a shot.
they were hieroglyphs.
- Hello?
- Kevin, it's Eddie.
Eddie?
Listen, I can't
- I can't make the meeting today.
What are you talking about?
I can't come in today.
I'm sick.
Yeah?
Well, you can't have the flu right now.
He'll never give you this chance again.
I know.
Listen.
I just, ah...
I have all this data to analyze.
What have you been doing for the last day?
Don't you get it?
This is your test.
Yeah.
Well, I can't pass the test right now.
And how am I gonna look if you don't?
- I know.
Listen...
- Sh!
Listen to me.
Pull yourself together - get down to the meeting
Okay.
Okay.
I, I, I, I'll be there.
I'll be there.
- Hey.
How are you, Eddie?
- Good to see you again.
Sit down.
- What do you know about Hank Atwood?
- Atwood...
Atwood...
Um, He's an iconoclast... uhm...
He owns about a half of Colorado...
So, this is "prepared"?
Eddie.
What is this, Atwood 101?
I mean...
Doesn't everybody know about Atwood?
Where was he two years ago?
Hm?
Nowhere.
Two years ago, he wasn't even on Forbes radar.
That was a great leap forward.
Right?
I'm baffled by this guy...
Comes out of nowhere, so strong...
Has me on the run, before I could even get to anybody in his camp.
beats me out of two properties, investment companies up north...
We're here in the front of the hotel where a woman... identified as Maria Winberg, was found dead in her room last night.
a victim of foul play..
Miss Winberg was a well known socialite... but was also known for her dedicated charity work around the city.
Police spent hours, questioning hotel staff and patrons.
and an eye witness reported seeing a man leaving the scene.
How can we convince him that I can raise his game?
Got any ideas?
What do you think?
Hm?
You're not one of those kind of guys - are you Eddy?
we lose you, if there's a screen in the room?
These are tectonic plates that are shifting right under us.
Pardon me one second.
Was it possible?
Could I have killed someone?
Was is it even me?
Eddie?
This is Melissa..
Listen...
Vernon hasn't been giving you anything-has he?
Because that stuff is dangerous.
Melissa?
Hey.
Do you think we can meet somewhere?
I really need to talk to you we're talking now.
No no, let's meet at uh, Billy's on Grant...
At noon?
You can't see me Eddie.
Please please come.
Please come.
It's important.
I really need to know what you're talking about.
I realized, that there were other people, who I might now about NZT.
Vern's other clients.
Yeah, Hi.
May I please speak with Jerry Braden?
Jerry's in the hospital..
- He's what?
- Yeah, he's not doing well at all
Yeah, hello.
Is Paul Kaplan there?
Ah, no.
No he's not.
uh, uh, Paul passed away - uh, three days ago
Oh my God!
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, he started getting headaches, then he collapsed at work.
Now he's in the I.C.U..
Okay, well please give him my best.
thank you.
Of all the people I called... three were dead, and the rest were sick.
Hello
Go!
GO!
Eddie.
Melissa.
Hey.
Do not tell me I look good like this, I know.
I didn't want you to see me this way.
You look good.
Well I uh...
Yes, I sorta got myself together.
NZT will do that to you..
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I took it too.
- Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?
- No
What, when we he told me about this amazing new drug...
I was like, "down the hatch. "
and it was.
It was amazing.
I read Brian Green's, The Elegant Universe - in 45 minutes and I understood it.
My, my work rate increased, just as insanely overnight... and my boss started to hate me
They offered me his job.
And then, then I got, I got scared.
Why?
Why?
Because I am not stupid.
Nobody can operate at that level of mental activity and not crash.
I stopped taking it.
- Then?
- Then I got sick.
Headaches, throwing up So I went back to, Veron... he told me about all the people that were dying.
- How much you have been taking Eddie?
- I've been taking a lot.
Well maybe...
Maybe they've worked out the bugs maybe.
Maybe this is a different batch.
Yeah.
- You're off it right now, aren't you?
- Just finish the story.
Well, I didn't take anymore and I didn't die
But after a while I realized that I couldn't concentrate on anything for longer than 10 minutes..
I missed deadlines...
Got lazy.
Slow.
So slow.
That was two years ago.
I haven't been the same since.
You have some left?
Good.
Well you go home and you take it.
You take the dose down,
But you don't just stop.
You'll die, if you just stop!
Try to taper off.
Otherwise, the headaches are just beginning.
I have to go.
- Do you know who makes them?
- I do not know.
I have to go.
Oh Shit!
Listen listen listen listen...
- You forget about me eh?
- No no no 12:00 and you're not here!
- I'm here now.
- Come on, keep going.
- I can to write you a check.
Check.
Check
Are you out of your mind?
What do you think I am, some financial institution?
Alright.
You're right.
Maybe at least you can go to the bank.
What you got there?
- What is it?
- It's just aspirin.
Don't look like no aspirin I ever see.
I feel good man, what's in this stuff?
Well, it's just some vitamins and aspirin.
You're full of shit Eddie baby...
I'm sorry
- Tyler, I gotta go.
- I'm sick.
I'm sorry!
I couldn't make it home.
- I'll take you to a hospital.
- No no no no, honey...
I need yo to get...
It's really simple baby.
I need my pills.
- Eddie, what pills?
- Baby, it's complicated.
- What are you taking?
Are you on drugs?
I had no choice.
I told Lindi everything
So all this energy of yours, all this focus, has been a drug?
Well, it was supposed to be legal.
I, I have a supply stashed.
- you want me to go get it.
- No.
No no no.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go get it.
Give me your keys.
I'll go to your apartment.
It's not in my apartment.
I moved it.
Okay...
So where did you move it?
In my house.
Unbelievable!
- Have you got it?
- Yeah.
There's someone following me.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
He got into the cab behind me, and he's making every turn I'm making.
Better call the cops.
Can you go around him?
- Baby, what's happening?
- We're stopped dead.
He's getting out...
Eddie, he's walking over here.
Lindi...
Oh God!
Help!
Help!
This man, this man is chasing me.
He followed me from my building.
I don't know him.
Please!
Yo buddy!
Let's leave her alone.
Are you deaf?
I said, leave her alone!
Hey buddy, are you trying to piss me off?
What are you doing, man?
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm here.
What happened?
- I'm stuck!
He'll find me.
- Okay, stop talking.
Don't move...
- He killed two guys.
- What?
He's gonna kill me too.
No no no no no.
Let me look.
Can you see him?
No.
Nothin'.
I don't know what to do.
Okay...
I need you to go into the bag and take one of the pills.
Why?
Because you'll know what to do.
You'll take it and then you'll know.
He's got a knife.
Eddie, I can't think my way out of a knife.
Just listen to me.
It'll come on in 30 seconds, and you'll think your way out.
That's what it does.
He's getting closer.
Lindi, I love you.
Eddie...
Here.
It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna get outta here.
Eddie.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm so sorry about what happened.
I want you to know that you'll never, ever have to go through that again
Cause I can take care of us now.
I'm sure you can.
I can make us safe.
I'm back!
Okay
- Who's back?
Eddie.
- Me.
No!
It's not you You were different before.
- I am still the same person.
- I wasn't when I was on it.
I did things, I would never do.
Those things saved your life.
- But they weren't me.
- Yes.
You know the way it works...
I know how it works.
I get it, I totally get it.
You feel invincible.
Where it will take us Lin, you can't even imagine The things we'll be able to do
Where we'll be a year from now The kind of life that we'll finally be able to live
Well, you might have to live it without me.
Look!
I am gonna stop taking it.
There's just some things I have to do to keep us safe and to, to set us up
And then, I'm gonna get off it...
I mean, that's the plan.
Look!
I have a plan.
I swear I'm gonna get off it.
Okay
I hope you do
Looking for me?
Think you can run out on me?
uh!
You think, I don't know where you are?
I was under the impression, our business was settled.
Well I want some more of that stuff, or I shoot you right here.
Take your pick.
This guy was not going away.
A few pills would buy me some time
- Here it is.
We're done.
- We will see.
Until I found a more...
permanent solution.
Unless you see a real threat, I never want it known that I have any security.
You'll never proceed me
You'll always follow me.
never more than 15 steps behind.
And never stand too close together.
I wanna be able to look behind me if the opportunity presents itself.
And don't wear the same color suit.
This isn't the Matrix!
You have to know Eddie...
I wrote you off.
- I was sick.
- You don't get sick
You're playing at this level
-You get hit by a car, you don't even die.
- You're absolutely right.
- I know I'm right.
I mean, I didn't know who or what I was talking to.
105.
That's who you were talking to Carl.
Delirium.
Hm hm.
- I sent over my revised projections.
- I didn't ask for your projections...
I know, but I think If you take a look at them...
I already have.
As a matter of fact...
I fired a few people, over your projections.
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.
You're relieved, that you know things, my team missed.
The minute, the instant, that's no longer true...
Two months after I'd started NZT...
I was brokering the biggest merger in corporate history.
Ironically, it's gonna be crude.
Crude is gonna be where we're gonna hit em.
Which yields a projected profit of 200%.
That makes both of us very happy campers.
I found that if I maintained an even dose, remembered to eat drank no alcohol...
The blackouts didn't occur
Tom is it possible to construct an imperceptible compartment?
- In this jacket?
- In all of them.
Certainly, sir.
Safer though my stash now was,
I was not sitting around until I ran out.
Well, can I combine these ingredients in the same exact quantity?
Yes.
but, the exact method of delivery to the brain, uhhh...
Dart to the dart board.
- Meaning?
- clinical trials, guinea pig people.
that's gonna take too long.
It is was it is.
Or you'll kill people.
Look.
You need 12-18 months
I'll give you two million dollars If you can do it in 6
I found that we could cart the cost, 30%.
and uhm...
Excuse me for one sec
I thought we straightened this out, detective.
This isn't about Vernon again, Mr. Morra.
What is this about?
The witness identified the Maria Winberg suspect...
As this person.
Wanna tell me your whereabouts the night of April 2nd?
I couldn't keep this quite on my own
Enter Morris Brant, the most lethal lawyer in New York.
You're lucky, somebody wiped the room.
It's weak circumstantial at best.
- Just between us...
Were you there?
- I don't remember.
I don't want to make concessions to you...
Karl van Loon's and Hank Atwood, had no idea
I might soon be charged with murder.
But Ci-Corps, An-Dine and others, are jockeying for the same industrial concessions in Libya that both our companies are pretending, we're not sniffing out.
How do you know this?
The governmental bribes system is itself corrupt
So of course, information about its inner-workings, like anything, can be bought.
Go on.
If you take a look at the lower left hand column in 2008, five companies were jockeying for a position before we even took notice.
Jesus, he looks frail.
- Could be an act.
- He's not even 60.
So have you decided Eddie, whatta ya gonna do?
When this is over?
I do not know.
- You haven't given me the answer.
- You haven't you asked the question.
Well, Given the scale of my contribution...
let's say 45
Humph!
$45,000?
40 million's plenty Eddie.
There's a lot more where that'll come from
You know, Eddie... it may be on your mind, that you're not gonna continue to work for me anymore...
This has been the learning experience of my life.
I hope has.
I hope you don't think you've gotten enough from me.
on to the next...
Well, in order for a career to evolve, I'm gonna have to move on.
That you would even think that, would only show me how unprepared you are, to be on your own.
I mean, you do know, you're a freak?
Your deductive powers are a gift from God, or chance, or straight shot of sperm... or whatever, or whoever the hell, wrote your life script.
A gift. not earned.
You do not know what I know, because you have not earned those powers.
You're careless with those powers.
You flaunt them and you throw them around like a brat with his trust fund.
You haven't had to climb up all the greasy little rungs...
You haven't been board-lined at the fundraisers... you haven't done the time in that first marriage, to the girl with the right father...
You think you can leap over, all in a single bound.
You haven't had to bribe or charm or threaten your way, to sit at this table.
You don't know how to assess your competition, because you haven't competed...
Don't make me your competition.
Now I'll open up a line of credit for you.
You'll be wanting a few toys.
hotel rooms were no longer an option.
What I needed, was a bunker.
There's a built in safe... central surveillance, vault grade pneumatic doors.
It's an unparalleled three tier security system.
A fortress, with a hell of a view.
- What is the asking price?
- 8.5
I'll take it.
Right away, it was obvious, he was on NZT
Next week, I'm gonna need 20 pills.
Next week, you can go, fuck yourself.
Not that you'll feel anything.
I don't think your fortune 500 financial friends, would appreciate the details, of your little dilemma with the police.
Thursday, I'm gonna need the pills here.
Getting smarter...
Obviously, this can not go on
But there is very little on this earth that 40 million dollars can't solve and tomorrow at 9:00, Atwood would sign the papers.
Do you wanna call it?
- Cold feet?
- With all last night to tell us that.
- Anything?
- I'll call it again, sir.
Okay, the decision could've changed...
That makes sense - but discourtesy doesn't.
It's still on.
Oh!
Based on your charts and projections?
You know, remind me...
Who are you anyway?
I'm sorry Karl, I've had it with this unqualified posturing little prick.
- Look...
- Since when is this the Delta quarrel?
Don...
Pull it back!
Excuse me.
Mr. Van Loon, Mrs. Atwood is in your office.
Ah.
Mrs. Atwood, Karl van Loon, My associate, Edward Morra.
Pleasure.
- I wanted to make this as confidential as possible.
- Of course.
My husband experienced some pain and dizziness this morning.
He's currently at Lenox Hill - undergoing test.
I just want you to know we have every intention of signing the contract.
And as soon as he is able, we will proceed.
I realize this is a useless platitude, but if there's anything we can do...
Please don't hesitate to tells us.
Obviously, we want to be as helpful and as practical as possible, Mrs. Atwood.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I rely on your discretion.
There wont be a proxy.
a crazy prick like him giving away power of attorney?
Well, better get better.
But Atwood wouldn't get better because Atwood was out of NZT.
Well, why are we surprised?
How many other meteoric rises might be explained by NZT?
At least I had some.
My life wasn't in jeopardy
You wait here.
only my money. and my liberty
I've been all over them.
We can't allow any disparity in race or physical type between you and the rest of the line-up.
they're as close to your clones, as I could possibly get.
It's gotta be, just one big handsome blur to this guy.
Who was out there?
the woman's husband?
the hotel maid?
Was this how, it was all going to end?
Not the dimmest clue.
- He was dithering "He was the third from the right.
No not him. "
Here you go.
A thing of beauty.
You had that made?
I did.
This today...
The Dow has been YO-YO-ing amid speculation, that Van-Loon Associates, and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger...
Have you been talking to anyone?
NO.
I haven't been talking to anybody, Karl.
I'm not stupid!
I know you're not stupid Eddie, but don't make the classic smart person's mistake... thinking no-one's smarter than you.
Where the hell have you been?
This is the second time you've turned to vapor.
I was in the building.
I was getting coffee?
Why?
Has there been movement?
Yeah!
There's been movement alright.
Atwood's in a coma.
He wasn't playing us, he's dying.
What do you know about this?
I was less than usually equipped to answer.
The dullness was coming on.
I was overdue to take my NZT.
And the pain was starting behind my eyes.
Excuse me.
You're not excused.
What, a man in your employ, can't take a piss, Karl?
Was it Brant, or someone else?
The police station?
The coat room?
Mr. Morra...
Mr. Morra.
Mr. Morra!
This just came for you.
Alright, I'm gonna ask you again Eddie...
What do you know about this?
- What?
About the leak?
- No...
About Atwood.
What?
What about Atwood?
Look...
You got a long way to go
-as a liar kiddo...
-Heck Karl, I don't know what your..
Listen, what you about to say is bullshit!
I know there's something you're hiding from me.
I smell it on you!
Right now,I wanna know why this deal is dead in the water!
Karl.
Hey!
Eddie!
Outside Lennox Hill Hospital today, more twists and turns in the Van Loon
- Atwood merger.
There is absolutely.
no truth to the rumor of this merger.
None whatsoever!
My husband is having tests...
it's a difficult time
We would appreciate you direct, your further questions to our attorney.
Ah, Yes...
We have no further comments at this time... we're just awaiting the results from the latest round of test, and hoping the best.
