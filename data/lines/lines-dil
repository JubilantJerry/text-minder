Bitch!
Be damned!
Go away!
You are the disgrace of this house.
It was her, I swear It's always her driving me!
Is this what you were hiding from me all these years?
You wanted Rossana too.
It's a warning sign, Simone
We have to do something, now.
George!
Be careful, George!
Marcelle!
Open up!
Marcelle!
Marcelle!
Open up!
Marcelle!
Marcelle!
No!
They killed him They killed him
Go away Simone They're gonna kill you!
Go away!
Why?
Why?
Assassins, be damned!
Filthy pigs!
You are Hell
They killed him It's all my fault
They are crazy I should've known
They are crazy
I take your grief my darling
You have to go far away
I get it, that's what you want to see you motherfuckers
You waited for so long Don't you want to jerk off now?
Come on, this is the right time
Are you scared?
Come on, I won't be here tomorrow
Come on, I won't say anything to your beloved wives
Go away and come back when you will know how to use your dicks
I am an assassin, Rossana, an assassin.
My mind is failing me
I hate them and I hate you too.
I thought you were alive.
I've lost my daughter too.
You're all I've got.
Open up!
Open up, please!
He was just a vicious beast
I punished him
You betrayed me all
You loved everyone but me
It doesn't matter
No, I want to go away I don't want to see you anymore
You're a monster George...
Simone....
It was just a game and now it ends
We love you
Now get dressed Marcelle and you too
Be quick, let's get out of here
I'm sorry, we didn't want to hurt you, I swear
Quick
Take me with you.
Please don't leave me here.
I want to go away from here, forever.
We'll find a way to make you escape with us.
A witch!
Just when the cruel uselessness of death was celebrated
Marcelle's soul, joined with the memory of George started to live again in Simone
That suffered erotic communion was now complete so much desired and so much feared that would finally free them from that ghost world that gave them the illusion of life.

If the Moon was a mirror... my beloved's face...
I could see every night
I still have feelings for him
I haven't forgotten anything
Yukino?
I don't know her.
Yukino?
Maybe, it's Chizuru's elder sister?
If you're talking about her... she's very far away now.
Do you happen to know where she went?
To the place you can't reach.
I gave her food for free.
I paid for her doctor and medicine.
But trying to treat such a serious lung disease is pouring money down the drain.
It's just delaying the inevitable.
Merciful Buddha...
Let the dead go to heaven.
It's a lie...
Lie!
Calm down!
Someone is bound to find a solution.
I, personally, have nothing to do with it.
It won't do!
What's going on?
To my beloved wife...
I'll send a divorce petition
This is for you, sister!
Thank you, Sir!
Thank you, young man.
Thank you very much for everything!
Ume!
Oh...
It's you.
Everyone's rejoicing in the spring... only one monk is sorrowing
Sister Yurika!
I've been waiting for you!
Why didn't you write me?
I'd have come to meet you.
Hey, Yurika!
Which regiment are you from?
Here, listen.
Everyone knows, that I'm from the 21st Hamada regiment.
Yuri received his call-up papers.
Something must be wrong in the Emperor's Army.
What's going on in the world?
It's ridiculous.
Where are you going?
Hey!
Did you think about me in prison?
Yes.
All I did was think about you.
Was there nothing else to do there?
Darling...
Listen...
Have you kept what I gave you before I was arrested?
You mean the map?
You haven't lost it, have you?
I've kept it, but...
We shouldn't think about all those silly things.
Don't you want to find the treasure?
You'll become a millionaire's wife.
It's very nice to be a rich woman... but, given my popularity,... we can live comfortably as it is.
Alright-alright...
Yasu!
Go on...
lick it a little...
- You're a libertine!
- Me?
You're a libertine yourself, that's why a libertine has come to you.
You're insatiable...
- Sir, here's your bill.
- What?
Elder, we owe you 1 yen 50 sen.
You owe me ten times as much.
What?
Elder!
15 for this rathole?
You must be kidding me!
If you stay for one more night, I'll give you a discount.
Hey!
Just pay.
Just pay?
It's robbery!
Listen, these girls are so inexperienced.
Did you want Sakie?
She's busy.
Libertine bitch!
Who hired her?
Elder...
If you use a woman, she becomes corrupt little by little.
Shut your mouth!
10-20 yen is nothing.
I'm thinking about the real job.
How's Sakie doing there?
Elder!
Wait!
Hug me...
Damn!
This money...
I was saving it for my sister.
You can take it.
If you really want to help me... help me escape from here.
I don't want to die here like my sister.
Will you help me?
I heard everything you were talking about.
What an unexpected encounter!
Do you know each other?
We used to share everything.
What do you want?
I've been listening to you... you seem to know the area really well.
I have a risky job.
You'll earn a hundred times as much in no time.
Will you really help me?
Yes.
It's better to go together than alone.
Is there a person who will trust you?
Will you trust me?
Will this be enough?
Yes.
Alright, trust me.
Regiment... forward!
What's going on?
To the right salute!
- Forward!
- What happened?
- Over there!
Run!
Regiment... stop!
Forward!
According to the commander's order, our squadron... is taking control of this area immediately.
Take position!
Seriously?
Has he really arranged everything with the ferryman?
Hey, what are you doing here?
You!
Talk...
Bastards!
Brother, let's call for help.
Hang on.
What?
It's Jôkichi.
Who?
From the Shinjiro gang.
Does it hurt?
It's nothing.
Are we safe here?
We're not safe anywhere.
They'll want revenge.
I'd like... to see the sea someday.
The sea?
Yes, I want to see it.
I've always dreamed about it.
When I'm free, I'd like to live in a village overlooking the sea.
Sister, where are you from?
I don't know.
You don't know?
But I think...
I was born near the sea.
Would you like a candy?
No.
The man, whose grave you passed...
Was he sister Chizuru's husband?
Did you love Chizuru?
Where are you going to go?
I've put you on the train, now you're free.
You can go to the sea or to the mountains, if you like.
Am I a burden for you?
You shouldn't be with me.
You've lit the wrong end of the cigarette...
Don't miss your chance!
Famous magician...
Shokokusai!
A beauty disappears in the blink of an eye!
A true wonder!
Not to miss!
Welcome!
We're waiting for you!
Don't make a crowd!
Everyone in turn!
Special delivery from Arabia.
Sweet lollipops.
Everything is gone.
Every trouble has befallen us.
Our business went bust, we lost our home.
His mother died.
We're desperate.
He keeps crying for his mum.
We have no possessions left.
Only these three pieces of fabric were saved.
These three rolls are everything I have left.
If you want to buy one like this... you'll have to pay 5 or 6 yen.
Or 15 yen for three.
You can make sure yourself.
Quality material...
And I want only 10 yen for all three.
I'll take it...
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Here's 10 yen.
Thank you very much.
Your tears were so natural.
Here you are.
Thank you...
Do you need some fabric?
No.
Don't cry... don't cry...
Dad made a mistake.
I'm sorry...
Welcome!
Samurai drama with Umenojo Bando.
For the first time in the area!
The performance starts now.
The interlude is called...
"The Art of Killing"...
Ah...
Gen, long time no see!
Try your luck!
Put it here!
Then do like this and like this.
Here.
I take the prize.
Hey, Gen, you cheated!
Everything is according to the rules!
Elder!
Elder!
Why are you looking so gloomy?
You're free now.
You should be happy.
He was the one who saved me, because he can swim.
He swims that well?
He used to be a diver.
Did he?
Where is Jôkichi?
I don't know.
Apparently...
I was a burden for him.
Why?
Apparently, sister Chizuru, who died...
What happened to her?
The lady had ordered to kill her.
Ordered who?
A man named Senzo.
It's revenge.
Darling, what are you doing?
Bastard, you're stealing our costumes from the dressing room!
All we need is to wait for tail wind.
This time you're going to become a rich woman.
I can't wait.
Looks like he's not coming.
Indeed, he has fled.
You still haven't understood that?
Excuse me...
Have you finished?
Yes.
Would you like... to have... separate beds?
Yes?
Yes.
Separate.
Can't sleep?
Alright, let's sleep together.
You're weird.
There was nothing between Jôkichi and you, right?
You're a strange woman...
Let's sleep together for real.
Okay?
Okay.
I'm a child of the sea...
It's not the right time for songs.
The waves are crashing against the beach
Is this Mr. Senzo's room?
Yes.
Are you Senzo?
Are you looking for me?
Unexpected encounter, isn't it?
Wait...
Hang on.
Where are you going?
Stop!
We have to talk.
Can we talk like men?
You're too irresponsible for a man.
All you're capable of is jokes.
Do you want to fight?
Try, hit me.
It's a matter of life and death.
Will you be my right hand?
It's a conversation between men...
Don't you want to know where to find Senzo?
Do you know where he is?
It's important that no one hears this conversation.
Many years ago, my father and uncle... saw a ship sink on the high sea.
It was a warship!
A battleship of the Baltic Fleet.
Admiral Togo sank it.
Yes.
What does it have to do with the war and the Baltic Fleet?
Listen...
Ever since I met you in prison...
I've been wanting to entrust you with this.
What are you getting at?
You used to be a diver, didn't you?
That means you're a good swimmer.
We'll do it together.
A great job for us both.
Here, look.
It sank right here.
You can dive and find the ship.
Why do you want to kill Senzo?
Do you want to go back to prison?
I really do like you.
I don't know why.
It's destiny.
I've been dreaming of finding a person like you my whole life.
You'll get a half.
Why aren't you saying anything?
There are gold coins down there.
I want you to find that Russian gold.
If you convert these 100-200 thousand to Japanese money... you'll get a million yen!
Your share will be 500 thousand yen.
500 thousand yen are yours.
Hey, where's Jôkichi?
Hey!
Where has our guest gone?
Your friend got up bright and early and left.
Finish up.
I'm done.
Want more?
No.
Let's go then.
Thank god... we've found the woman.
What about Jôkichi?
Jôkichi is another matter.
They say, he was wandering around the red light district, dressed in uniform.
Is it possible?
You talked to the boss, didn't you?
You promised to bring him Jôkichi.
Right?
Precisely because you promised to bring him Jôkichi... we've come all the way here.
Yusaku...
We'll send this girl first thing.
What about Elder?
Until we sort it out with Jôkichi, we'll keep him in Hiranuma.
What for?
Because boss said so.
I'm counting on you.
Alright.
Where are you going?
I need to take a leak.
You've just done it.
If you need to, do it right here.
What are you doing?
He pissed his pants.
Are you really going to Hiranuma?
Here you go...
Asshole!
ÔTAGURO ATAE FIRM
I repair umbrellas...
A mouse under the bridge...
Has hid inside the geta
And eating zori, nom-nom-nom
Nom-nom-nom, who's eaten the cake?
No one
There is a sign on the shamisen store
Third building from the corner
After the master was murdered... our sister was sold.
There was nothing we could do.
Forgive us.
Do you know anything about a man named Senzo?
No.
Brother, after you were released from prison... didn't you go to Oba?
If I'd gone to Oba, what could I have found out?
- 2 pieces of ice.
- Here you are.
Eat the half.
Yes.
Your turn.
Accepted.
Sorry, it's trumped.
Is it okay?
Enough for me.
I'll take it.
Take a seat.
Is everyone ready?
Yes.
It's my turn.
Trumped.
- Trumped.
- Your turn.
Are you Senzo?
Do you know a person named Jôkichi?
He's going to kill you.
I'm sorry if this piece of news is not interesting for you.
This Jôkichi committed a petty crime... and got into prison, like me.
I'm sorry... but you... should really hide somewhere.
There's only one life.
You shouldn't jeopardize it.
Please, I beg you.
Thank you.
Let me through.
You're welcome.
I have hancho.
Okay, it's my turn.
Here's my move.
I also want to find him.
I'll find him even without you.
Anybody home?
Does Senzo live here?
I escaped from them.
I said, I escaped from them.
I've been waiting for you here, since I knew you had to find Senzo.
What?
It hurts.
Well, you've hit me.
Are you satisfied now?
Hey!
I've been looking for you for your own good.
I want to come with you.
Piece of shit.
Wait.
You can hit me.
You can go back to jail.
I don't want to go back.
It hurts... very much.
You really can...
It hurts, seriously...
You're good at fighting.
You...
You...
It's you I care about...
Hurts...
I've been told that... since I was born.
I'm Jôkichi, Shinjiro's younger brother.
Jôkichi, I didn't think you were so timid.
Have you found Jôkichi?
I don't know him anymore.
I don't know this person anymore.
Never again!
He's free to go to prison or to the grave.
I hate people who don't give a damn about their life.
Senzo!
Who put a contract on my brother's head?
Senzo!
Jôkichi... don't listen to this bullshit.
You know... this Jôkichi...
I don't want to hear his name anymore!
You're mistaken!
I'm grateful to him.
Not for myself, but for my sister.
Where will you go now?
I want to see the sea.
Maybe, you will also go to the sea?
Where I go is my business.
We're close...
Only a little bit left to walk.
The sea!
Is there anyone who can dive here?
It's useless.
Why useless?
It's forbidden to dive here.
Forbidden?
Yes.
Says who?
The military.
See that?
It's a patrol vessel.
It runs three times a day.
I don't go there anymore.
So seamen have also got the wind.
We used to break this ban during the war.
Sometimes, but it was hard.
It's always hard to procure money.
But if you have a goal...
I have a boat.
I can give you the equipment.
Can't you go yourself?
I'm too old.
I can't do it.
Thank you for the purchase.
We don't need this.
Tighten it harder.
Sorry.
You can hug me.
Get up, please...
Wake up.
Are you alright?
Do you want to kill me?
Let's try once again.
Do as I taught you.
Like this... got it?
Have a go.
What is it?
Komagen, look.
Over there.
Damn him.
Well...
Maybe...
My jaw hurts.
Still hurts?
Buy another bowl.
What?
Two are not enough.
We missed you a lot.
We have to look here.
Well, is it ready yet?
Until now, I've behaved very irresponsibly.
From now on, everything will be different.
The patrol ship.
Now that's a real professional.
Nothing?
There's a strong current down there.
What your father saw, happened 30 years ago.
The ship has been carried away by the current.
Let's change the position then?
Yes.
Done.
Tighten it better.
Done.
Ready.
Hey, what happened?
Damn... he's not responding.
Don't just stand there!
If you don't try harder, he'll die.
One-two... one-two...
Pull harder!
Come on, pull!
Faster...
If we find that money, what will you do?
There's no point in thinking about it.
I want to buy a land lot.
A land lot?
I'll build a house there.
A beautiful one.
That's a real thing.
I want to be a noble bandit, like Kunisada Chuji.
He took care of people in trouble, like a mother.
And one day I'll get married.
And you, what are you thinking?
I don't know.
Maybe, I'll move abroad.
Abroad?
Do you have family there?
No.
That's exactly what draws me.
You're strange.
You think so?
Welcome back!
Found anything?
Incredible...
You know... it's probably from the Baltic Fleet.
A Russian crown.
Idiot.
It's a part of a searchlight.
In any case, it's a good sign.
After so many years, we have found a Russian searchlight.
Look at this thing.
Here it is.
See?
If we carry on like this, we'll soon find the treasure.
For me, even without the treasure... every day here is joy.
Stop talking nonsense.
You want your share, don't you?
And then you can move abroad together.
Where are you going?
What is that car?
It's my business.
What business?
I'll go instead of you.
I can talk and settle everything.
It has nothing to do with you.
Don't interfere.
Wait!
What do you mean it has nothing to do with me?
We're partners.
Don't you dare say that.
It's arrogant.
We have equal shares in this.
Don't we?
I'm really glad... that I came here.
Really?
Really.
Hello...
I'm sorry...
The military doesn't allow you to come here.
We're very sorry.
Who are you?
Komagen...
THE END
-So how was it?
-Good.
-You're gonna go ahead?
-Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying:
"No matter how hot it gets up there during the day...
-... there'snota- -"-" Notadamnthingtodoatnight ."
What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
Come in the office for a minute.
I got people waiting upstairs.
I wanted to tell you...
... SenatorParker'scomingtothededicationtonight.
He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them.
I'll build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'll never leave.
After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay opened.
-Whatever happened to "hello"?
-Hello.
-How are you?
-Good.
You look like it took.
-Hi, Mr. Roberts.
-Just a second.
We'll miss you.
-Duncan know?
-He's all smiles.
-What electromagnets went in?
-Doug?
-Thompson G-4s.
-Don't you think they should be G-12s?
That's what comes from last-minute panic.
I'll fix it.
There's ground water on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in today.
How about Chicago specs?
-Philadelphia?
-In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Who's there?
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
All protein, no bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
I got about a $140 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will...
... remembertotellthemthat itwasmy idea.
Got change for a 50?
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.
Not a chance!
Let's see what we got here... .
Twenty-five, 50, 60...
... 70,75...
... 85,95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
All your security squad's up there... .
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us?
Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Here, let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
-Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that?
-I said how are you?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Okay, I'll get on it right now.
I'll have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.
Mr. Callahan?
We still got any G-12 electrodes?
-Yeah, main storeroom.
-Right.
Okay, booster pump, zone one.
-One-ten.
-Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?
I wouldn't like that at all!
The business offices only go up to 80.
From the 81 st floor, here...
... allthewayupto120,it'sexclusivelyresidential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 8145... .
Say, Bill?
Tune in the main utility room.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
The sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello?
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean-
- I guess we've got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both.
Can I?
I don't know.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight.
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
-What about that?
-It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
Specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay, send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire...
... froma burned-outcircuitbreakerisn'tconclusive.
Maybe not.
But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will, Doug...
... J.D.,waittillyou see this.
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?
We have an equipment problem.
-No problem in the tower, is there?
-Could be.
Come on.
You're just guessing.
I want to talk to your son-in-law.
I wanna talk to him right away.
-Get Roger Simmons.
-Yes, sir.
I guarantee I'll check this out.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah, a fire.
In this building?
Come on.
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
-The party should've been put off--
-Hold it, Will!
Everybody's overreacting.
-Mr.
Simmons is out, sir.
-Out where?
They don 't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'll decide what to do.
-That's okay, isn't it?
-Nope.
Won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it!
This is top priority.
We gotta get these electrical systems on.
Our security program's loused up without them.
Don't go away.
Doug!
Well, what a surprise!
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on, I'll get you a drink.
He must've done something.
My father called.
He hasn't been that upset in years.
Have any idea where he is?
Well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you wanna wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
-Can I get you a drink?
-No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
-Honey.
-Hello.
-What are you drinking these days?
-Nothing, right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a systems failure.
How can that be?
It can't be, theoretically.
Unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours?
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
All the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!
I asked for installations way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
That would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have!
In my office!
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks...
... evenifthat'swhatyouwantmetodo .
All I want is the man I thought I married.
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Nonsense.
Be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.
Here you are...
... youroriginalspecs.
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
-Susan.
-Hello, Dan.
Good evening.
-How are you, dear?
-Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
I'll meet you out front.
-I'd like to talk to Susan.
-Right.
Find me the architect who designed you...
... andwhoneedsDougRoberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who.
There are leaders from society and government...
... starsofscreenand television.
And now, just arriving, the Honorable Gary Parker...
... chairmanoftheFederalUrbanRenewalCommission.
The senator's in from Washington to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark...
... ina longsuccessionoflandmarksforthisgreatcity.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
--being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
Later, I wanna ask you a few questions...
... andI expectsomestraightanswers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower...
... tallestbuildingin theworld!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
After you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
I've never seen the bridge look like that.
-It's unbelievable!
-Astonishing!
-How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
-Fine, thank you.
Good night.
Shall I leave you a night line?
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Lorrie... .
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
We almost missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
Hello.
Hi.
-Promise me something?
-What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
I promise.
-How's the family?
-Fine, thank you.
Good.
Gary?
-Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
-Certainly.
-I've got a surprise for you.
-Politicians don't like surprises.
-Carlos?
-Yes, sir.
-What can I fix you?
-Meet Senator Parker.
-Great pleasure.
-It's an honor, senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
1929?
-That's all you'll drink tonight.
-A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'll ship to Washington.
-Open a bottle, will you?
-Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
I guess you're looking for someone.
I am.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?
-Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
-Susan, tell me... .
What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man...
... decidestoleavefor two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No headhunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
-You must miss your villa.
-Well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
-No false humility, please.
-Oh, shall we?
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco...
... toregainmy perspectiveand myhumility...
... andspendmoretimeattheonethingI'mreallygoodat:
The stock market.
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
You better leave it off.
Utility.
Wes.
Doug, I'm up on 83 with Will.
We got a wiring problem.
Overloads could be trouble.
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.
I can't do that.
All the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.
You mean the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
-Not all the power, just the overload!
-Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81.
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.
-I'll be in 81.
-You got it.
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
Pull it around over here.
Put it all over him.
Come on!
Let's get some water onto that fire.
Turn it on!
Down, down!
Stay low!
Call an ambulance for this man.
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor!
-The fire department?
-On their way.
Get that ambulance.
Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.
All right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
This is 81.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes, right away.
Call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a lot of people up there.
-What?
-Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
An ambulance is coming, but you better think about...
... gettingthosepeopledownontheground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but--
Well, then why the urgency?
Urgency?
If fluky wiring in this building caused that fire...
... firescouldbreakout everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 ...
... becauseitcan'tpossiblyaffectusuphere ...
... notinthisbuilding.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and--
Oh, Jesus!
-The glass tower!
-What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being inside a chimney.
Jesus!
How in the hell did they get here before we did?
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
-Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.
-Eighty-first floor, right?
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
-Set up a Forward Command.
-Got it.
Chief...
... thisisRoberts,the architect.
-What do we got here, Kappy?
-Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.
It's bad.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
-Exhaust system?
-Should've reversed automatically.
It must be a motor burnout.
-Sprinklers?
-They're not working on 81.
-Why not?
-I don't know.
-Jim?
-Yes, sir?
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.
-Floors have 3 and 1.5-inch outlets.
-GPM?
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1,000 from 68 to 100...
... and500fromtheretotheroof.
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
-What floor are your plans on?
-79.
My office.
That's two floors below the fire.
It'll be our Forward Command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
Architects!
Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.
But you keep building them as high as you can.
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?
What about the 81st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.
Not live-ins.
Businesses.
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.
Those that have are off at night.
I wanna know who they are, not where.
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?
Any wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Any sporting-good manufacturers, like table-tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?
-One tenant list, coming up.
-Thank you.
What do we got?
Elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
-Pipe alleys here?
-One, two, three, four, five.
-This is south?
-South.
Have you got any construction on 81?
Anything that can blow up, like gasoline, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'll be up on 81.
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room. 300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.
Jack?
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
-I'll be up topside.
-Right.
Jack...
... watchyourself.
Keep it high.
-Looking for me, chief?
-If you're Duncan.
I am.
Everything under control?
Gotta move these people out of here.
Now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems...
... wehavedesignedintothis building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.
I don't think you're listening.
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.
-I'll do it.
-Hold it, hold it.
Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I could tell them, but you ought to.
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests...
... thattheparty'sbeingmoveddownbelowthefire floor.
Now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now, don't leave this table.
You, I wanna talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
-I most certainly did.
-For God's sake, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire.
If it was caused by what you did, I'll hang you out to dry.
And then I'm going to hang you!
Would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen... .
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire...
... inoneof ourstoragerooms...
... 50floorsbelow.
I assure you there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders...
... apurelyprecautionaryprocedure...
... we'regoingto movethe partydown tothelobbyforawhile.
And we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators... .
Now, ladies and gentlemen...
... there'snoreasontorush .
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
-Lisolette!
-Frank!
Lisolette!
-How's it going, chief?
-Better get ready.
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire lapping?
-Are your com lines tested?
-Phone jacks on every floor.
-I'm plugging into your PA system.
-No sweat.
-Emergency setup?
-Battery-powered standby system.
Splice these lines into our two-way communications van.
Sure.
-No problem?
-No problem.
-How long will this take?
-A minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
The fire's lapping up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
What was that?
-Come on!
-The ceiling's going!
Men trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
Pull them out, pull them out!
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!
Battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!
Forward Command, go ahead.
Explosion on 81, fire headed toward elevator banks!
We need more crews up here fast!
-They need relief on 81.
Hit it.
-They're on their way.
Done!
Tell Duncan to stop those Tower Room people...
... fromusingthatexpresselevator,orsomebody'llgetkilled.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads and some choppers here.
We may need them to get those people down.
Come on, Park.
I'll be on 81.
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.
I don't like how you talk to me.
-You drunk?
-Not yet.
-Then get out of my way!
-You didn't talk like this before.
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?
Shut up and help these people!
-Let me ask, father-in-law--
-Excuse me.
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?
Please!
Please!
Hold everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Move back into the Promenade Room...
... andwe'lltakeyou downbythescenic elevator.
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.
And with the probability of short circuits...
... thecarsmightstoponthefloorwherethefireis.
So please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there.
For God's sake, get out of there!
Please, back!
It looks bad, Jack.
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
The fire's spreading.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
Firemen, let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out!
Take it down!
Empty all the water out.
Chief, it's out of control.
Bring in another line!
Get another tank!
Angela?
Angela?
Phillip?
Phillip, open the door!
What ideas can I use upstairs...
... toexplainwhereI'vebeen allthistime?
Well, what you might do is just...
... walkrightup to himand say ,"J.D.,I'msorry forthedelay...
... butmysecretaryhad anurgentpersonalproblem."
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
He won't.
-You know what astonishes me?
-What?
You make love with a girl...
... andthere'sno visibleevidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
Look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus!
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan?
Right.
-What'd they say?
-Help's on the way.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Please.
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
-They're aware of that.
-She's wearing a purple dress.
-I've got to find her!
-I promise, they'll find her.
Now, only 12 at a time.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
We'll be in the next group, maybe.
It won't be too long.
What's she doing on 87?
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf!
Sure, the kids can hear!
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
You stay there.
I'll get them down!
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
-We'll send them right up.
-Still got people on 87.
I'll get them down.
I'll give you a hand.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
Well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
At least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.
Don't go!
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
-You all right?
-The mother and children are in there.
-Don't worry.
We'll get them out.
-Wait!
Please, Mrs. Mueller!
Please stay back.
-What do you think?
-I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
!
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
-Mom, Mom!
-Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
Anybody else?
My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela?
Angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay, Angela.
Thank God!
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
-All right!
-That's it.
Don't crush.
It'll take hours to get everyone down.
Those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs.
-That's 135 floors.
-All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos!
-Yes, sir.
-Help us get this thing open.
Is it stuck?
Here, let me try to kick it.
-I'll call security.
-Yes, sir.
Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
You want it easy, chief?
They should design a survival suit for us like for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Let's go to work.
I need two men up the stairwell to the tower.
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay, you got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?
Glass will be sailing everywhere.
Tell the police to move those barricades four blocks back.
-Got it.
-Let's hit it.
Yo!
Security guard.
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty, almost missed you.
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip!
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip!
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, boy.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip!
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy.
Easy.
Don't look down!
Come on.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had a... .
I got up, but I'll have trouble getting down.
Can you help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck, real tight?
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Put her legs down.
Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.
Just hold on tight.
Hold on.
Hold on tight, now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
-Hold on, Angela.
-I've got ahold of you!
Get your arms around my neck!
Thattagirl.
Nurse?
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!
Take it slowly, now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt.
Try to get your hand over there.
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller!
Are you all right?
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God!
We're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on, let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
Inside, security phone on the right.
-Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
-I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
The fire's below us.
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.
It's the copter air-control officer.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.
I'm getting relief for you and your men.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.
Right away.
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs.
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby.
Thank you.
This ain't gonna help any!
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!
It's a fire door.
It's over 2.5 inches thick.
I could crawl through the duct.
Will we be able to go with you?
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right, I'll tell him.
-How is it on 65?
-They're containing it.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown.
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold on to me a second.
Hold on!
Christ!
That's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.
-Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
-Not for us.
-Where've you been?
-We had trouble getting here.
The Navy flight commander needs you.
Just walk 65 floors down?
Only five.
A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.
-Got it controlled?
-Getting there.
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike... .
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow. " Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another one there!
Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Anybody'll do.
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How--?
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.
-How're you doing?
-We're fine.
Glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
Mrs. Mueller?
It's Mr. Roberts!
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.
Okay, get down low.
-What kind of explosives are you using?
-It's plastic C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here, shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it up here.
Is there gonna be a bang?
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good going, Brian.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
-Hold it down!
-Listen!
I've been informed that there's no possibility...
... ofusingthisstairwaytogetout.
Now, I'm sorry.
Patty... .
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
-I'm getting out.
-Roger, you... .
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
-I guess you thought I stood you up.
-It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Can I get you anything else?
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the Peerless Building...
... andgetabreechesbuoy tothePromenadeRoom.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
-Doc?
-Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
-There's no way down.
-Thank God you're all right.
-Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
-I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
-Responsible?
-Feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase...
... liftaneyebrowintheexact sameway...
... IseeandIhear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.
Right now...
... whatI needmost...
... isthis.
I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
-But you don't know anything about me.
-But I do.
You're penniless...
... youhaveno villainthesouth ofFrance ...
... noantiquescoming,nopaintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But you see, your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively...
... ifyoudon'tenjoycheatingthem?
I came here to sell you 1 000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked...
... oratleastdisappointed.
-But I'm not.
-You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
I thought we were building something...
... wherepeoplecouldwork,live andbesafe.
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials...
... weremadebecauseI,asabuilder,havearightto makethosedecisions.
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
-Who is it?
-Chief O'Hallorhan.
-What happened?
-Part of the central corridor just blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
It's too windy.
We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.
What can we do to help?
Move your combustible material away from the window.
Okay, gotcha.
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.
Jake, give me a hand.
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean...
... ifsheshouldhaveto.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
-Here he is.
-The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Get Roberts.
Get 10 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
-Doug, are they going to land?
-They're gonna try.
We'll send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 100 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
-There may not be time to tell you--
-There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'll be a lot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
Look out!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
Here he is now.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and l--
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
-Sure, what do you want them for?
-I want to try something.
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people out.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
Help me.
If you asked me to go to the North Pole...
... oreventhecliffsofMendocino,I'dgo.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
-Ma'am, I'll take her.
-Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
-I'll meet you in the lobby.
-I'll be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
-You've gotta go.
-I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
All right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
All right, let it go!
Let it go!
All right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!
Explosion above 110...
... blewtheelevatoroff its track.
It's hangingbyacable .
-How many people in it?
-Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
What're you gonna go?
Flaker.
-Flaker!
-Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up out of there.
Pull it.
Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, let her go!
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
All right!
There's one in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right, let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
All right, keep it going!
All right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
-Come ahead!
-I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
-I can't!
-Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
-This is O'Hallorhan.
-We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook...
... andsetme downonthescenicelevator.
Then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
You think this'll hold it?
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
-What's your number?
-68.
47.
Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now.
-You'll be all right.
-Tell my husband I'm all right.
-Tell him I'll be all right.
-I will.
-And I'll see him at home later.
-I will.
Let's go.
Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
Watch the ladder.
Hey, Mike...
... deputywantsto seeyou .
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 17 or 18 minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'll die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room...
... coulddefinitelywithstandthe explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
-You're crazy.
-Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design--
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you... .
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation...
... I'llbethelastoneoutof herealongwithmyson-in-law .
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'll kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'll burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line.
Get off!
-You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
-Let go of me!
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
-Get the hell out of there!
-Go!
Get off.
Chief.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
See you up there.
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts...
... anythingyoucanfind!
-Carlos!
-Yes, sir.
Get some knives.
There we go.
For God's sakes, Carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug...
... Ineverthoughtthiscouldhappen.
Sure.
-How much time you think we got?
-Ten minutes, maybe less.
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
All right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire...
... we'llplugit andspliceitintothetimer,setit,anditblows .
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
-Got it?
-I got it.
-Good luck.
See you later.
-Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman?
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
-Claiborne!
-What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God...
... thatI canstopthisfrom ever happeningagain .
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'll kill 1 0,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies...
... untilsomebodyasksus...
... howtobuildthem.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.
-So how was it?
-Good.
-You're gonna go ahead?
-Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying:
"No matter how hot it gets up there during the day...
-... there'snota- -" -"Not a damn thing to do at night. "
What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
Come in the office for a minute.
I got people waiting upstairs.
I wanted to tell you...
... SenatorParker'scoming to the dedication tonight.
He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them.
I'll build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'll never leave.
After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay opened.
-Whatever happened to "hello"?
-Hello.
-How are you?
-Good.
You look like it took.
-Hi, Mr. Roberts.
-Just a second.
We'll miss you.
-Duncan know?
-He's all smiles.
-What electromagnets went in?
-Doug?
-Thompson G-4s.
-Don't you think they should be G-12s?
That's what comes from last-minute panic.
I'll fix it.
There's ground water on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in today.
How about Chicago specs?
-Philadelphia?
-In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Who's there?
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
All protein, no bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
I got about a $140 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will...
... remembertotellthemthat it was my idea.
Got change for a 50?
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.
Not a chance!
Let's see what we got here... .
Twenty-five, 50, 60...
... 70,75...
... 85,95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
All your security squad's up there... .
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us?
Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Here, let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
-Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that?
-I said how are you?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Okay, I'll get on it right now.
I'll have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.
Mr. Callahan?
We still got any G-12 electrodes?
-Yeah, main storeroom.
-Right.
Okay, booster pump, zone one.
-One-ten.
-Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?
I wouldn't like that at all!
The business offices only go up to 80.
From the 81 st floor, here...
... allthewayupto120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 8145... .
Say, Bill?
Tune in the main utility room.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
The sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello?
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean-
- I guess we've got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both.
Can I?
I don't know.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight.
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
-What about that?
-It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
Specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay, send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire...
... froma burned-outcircuitbreaker isn't conclusive.
Maybe not.
But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will, Doug...
... J.D.,waittillyou see this.
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?
We have an equipment problem.
-No problem in the tower, is there?
-Could be.
Come on.
You're just guessing.
I want to talk to your son-in-law.
I wanna talk to him right away.
-Get Roger Simmons.
-Yes, sir.
I guarantee I'll check this out.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah, a fire.
In this building?
Come on.
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
-The party should've been put off--
-Hold it, Will!
Everybody's overreacting.
-Mr.
Simmons is out, sir.
-Out where?
They don 't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'll decide what to do.
-That's okay, isn't it?
-Nope.
Won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it!
This is top priority.
We gotta get these electrical systems on.
Our security program's loused up without them.
Don't go away.
Doug!
Well, what a surprise!
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on, I'll get you a drink.
He must've done something.
My father called.
He hasn't been that upset in years.
Have any idea where he is?
Well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you wanna wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
-Can I get you a drink?
-No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
-Honey.
-Hello.
-What are you drinking these days?
-Nothing, right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a systems failure.
How can that be?
It can't be, theoretically.
Unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours?
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
All the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!
I asked for installations way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
That would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have!
In my office!
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks...
... evenifthat's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Nonsense.
Be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.
Here you are...
... youroriginalspecs.
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
-Susan.
-Hello, Dan.
Good evening.
-How are you, dear?
-Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
I'll meet you out front.
-I'd like to talk to Susan.
-Right.
Find me the architect who designed you...
... andwhoneedsDougRoberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who.
There are leaders from society and government...
... starsofscreenand television.
And now, just arriving, the Honorable Gary Parker...
... chairmanofthe Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator's in from Washington to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark...
... ina longsuccessionoflandmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
--being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
Later, I wanna ask you a few questions...
... andI expect some straight answers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower...
... tallestbuildingin theworld!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
After you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
I've never seen the bridge look like that.
-It's unbelievable!
-Astonishing!
-How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
-Fine, thank you.
Good night.
Shall I leave you a night line?
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Lorrie... .
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
We almost missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
Hello.
Hi.
-Promise me something?
-What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
I promise.
-How's the family?
-Fine, thank you.
Good.
Gary?
-Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
-Certainly.
-I've got a surprise for you.
-Politicians don't like surprises.
-Carlos?
-Yes, sir.
-What can I fix you?
-Meet Senator Parker.
-Great pleasure.
-It's an honor, senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
1929?
-That's all you'll drink tonight.
-A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'll ship to Washington.
-Open a bottle, will you?
-Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
I guess you're looking for someone.
I am.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?
-Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
-Susan, tell me... .
What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man...
... decidestoleavefor two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No headhunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
-You must miss your villa.
-Well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
-No false humility, please.
-Oh, shall we?
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco...
... toregainmy perspective and my humility...
... andspendmoretimeattheone thing I'm really good at:
The stock market.
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
You better leave it off.
Utility.
Wes.
Doug, I'm up on 83 with Will.
We got a wiring problem.
Overloads could be trouble.
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.
I can't do that.
All the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.
You mean the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
-Not all the power, just the overload!
-Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81.
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.
-I'll be in 81.
-You got it.
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
Pull it around over here.
Put it all over him.
Come on!
Let's get some water onto that fire.
Turn it on!
Down, down!
Stay low!
Call an ambulance for this man.
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor!
-The fire department?
-On their way.
Get that ambulance.
Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.
All right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
This is 81.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes, right away.
Call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a lot of people up there.
-What?
-Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
An ambulance is coming, but you better think about...
... gettingthosepeopledown on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but--
Well, then why the urgency?
Urgency?
If fluky wiring in this building caused that fire...
... firescouldbreakout everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 ...
... becauseitcan'tpossibly affect us up here...
... notinthisbuilding.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and--
Oh, Jesus!
-The glass tower!
-What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being inside a chimney.
Jesus!
How in the hell did they get here before we did?
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
-Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.
-Eighty-first floor, right?
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
-Set up a Forward Command.
-Got it.
Chief...
... thisisRoberts,the architect.
-What do we got here, Kappy?
-Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.
It's bad.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
-Exhaust system?
-Should've reversed automatically.
It must be a motor burnout.
-Sprinklers?
-They're not working on 81.
-Why not?
-I don't know.
-Jim?
-Yes, sir?
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.
-Floors have 3 and 1.5-inch outlets.
-GPM?
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1,000 from 68 to 100...
... and500fromtheretotheroof.
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
-What floor are your plans on?
-79.
My office.
That's two floors below the fire.
It'll be our Forward Command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
Architects!
Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.
But you keep building them as high as you can.
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?
What about the 81st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.
Not live-ins.
Businesses.
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.
Those that have are off at night.
I wanna know who they are, not where.
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?
Any wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Any sporting-good manufacturers, like table-tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?
-One tenant list, coming up.
-Thank you.
What do we got?
Elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
-Pipe alleys here?
-One, two, three, four, five.
-This is south?
-South.
Have you got any construction on 81?
Anything that can blow up, like gasoline, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'll be up on 81.
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.
Jack?
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
-I'll be up topside.
-Right.
Jack...
... watchyourself.
Keep it high.
-Looking for me, chief?
-If you're Duncan.
I am.
Everything under control?
Gotta move these people out of here.
Now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems...
... wehavedesignedintothis building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.
I don't think you're listening.
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.
-I'll do it.
-Hold it, hold it.
Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I could tell them, but you ought to.
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests...
... thattheparty'sbeingmoveddown below the fire floor.
Now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now, don't leave this table.
You, I wanna talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
-I most certainly did.
-For God's sake, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire.
If it was caused by what you did, I'll hang you out to dry.
And then I'm going to hang you!
Would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen... .
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire...
... inoneof ourstoragerooms...
... 50floorsbelow.
I assure you there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders...
... apurelyprecautionaryprocedure...
... we'regoingto movethe party down to the lobby for a while.
And we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators... .
Now, ladies and gentlemen...
... there'snoreasontorush .
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
-Lisolette!
-Frank!
Lisolette!
-How's it going, chief?
-Better get ready.
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire lapping?
-Are your com lines tested?
-Phone jacks on every floor.
-I'm plugging into your PA system.
-No sweat.
-Emergency setup?
-Battery-powered standby system.
Splice these lines into our two-way communications van.
Sure.
-No problem?
-No problem.
-How long will this take?
-A minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
The fire's lapping up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
What was that?
-Come on!
-The ceiling's going!
Men trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
Pull them out, pull them out!
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!
Battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!
Forward Command, go ahead.
Explosion on 81, fire headed toward elevator banks!
We need more crews up here fast!
-They need relief on 81.
Hit it.
-They're on their way.
Done!
Tell Duncan to stop those Tower Room people...
... fromusingthatexpresselevator, or somebody'll get killed.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads and some choppers here.
We may need them to get those people down.
Come on, Park.
I'll be on 81.
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.
I don't like how you talk to me.
-You drunk?
-Not yet.
-Then get out of my way!
-You didn't talk like this before.
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?
Shut up and help these people!
-Let me ask, father-in-law--
-Excuse me.
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?
Please!
Please!
Hold everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Move back into the Promenade Room...
... andwe'lltakeyou downby the scenic elevator.
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.
And with the probability of short circuits...
... thecarsmightstop on the floor where the fire is.
So please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there.
For God's sake, get out of there!
Please, back!
It looks bad, Jack.
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
The fire's spreading.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
Firemen, let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out!
Take it down!
Empty all the water out.
Chief, it's out of control.
Bring in another line!
Get another tank!
Angela?
Angela?
Phillip?
Phillip, open the door!
What ideas can I use upstairs...
... toexplainwhereI'vebeen all this time?
Well, what you might do is just...
... walkrightup to himand say , "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay...
... butmysecretary had an urgent personal problem. "
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
He won't.
-You know what astonishes me?
-What?
You make love with a girl...
... andthere'sno visibleevidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
Look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus!
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan?
Right.
-What'd they say?
-Help's on the way.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Please.
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
-They're aware of that.
-She's wearing a purple dress.
-I've got to find her!
-I promise, they'll find her.
Now, only 12 at a time.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
We'll be in the next group, maybe.
It won't be too long.
What's she doing on 87?
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf!
Sure, the kids can hear!
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
You stay there.
I'll get them down!
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
-We'll send them right up.
-Still got people on 87.
I'll get them down.
I'll give you a hand.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
Well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
At least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.
Don't go!
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
-You all right?
-The mother and children are in there.
-Don't worry.
We'll get them out.
-Wait!
Please, Mrs. Mueller!
Please stay back.
-What do you think?
-I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
!
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
-Mom, Mom!
-Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
Anybody else?
My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela?
Angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay, Angela.
Thank God!
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
-All right!
-That's it.
Don't crush.
It'll take hours to get everyone down.
Those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs.
-That's 135 floors.
-All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos!
-Yes, sir.
-Help us get this thing open.
Is it stuck?
Here, let me try to kick it.
-I'll call security.
-Yes, sir.
Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
You want it easy, chief?
They should design a survival suit for us like for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Let's go to work.
I need two men up the stairwell to the tower.
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay, you got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?
Glass will be sailing everywhere.
Tell the police to move those barricades four blocks back.
-Got it.
-Let's hit it.
Yo!
Security guard.
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty, almost missed you.
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip!
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip!
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, boy.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip!
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy.
Easy.
Don't look down!
Come on.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had a... .
I got up, but I'll have trouble getting down.
Can you help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck, real tight?
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Put her legs down.
Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.
Just hold on tight.
Hold on.
Hold on tight, now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
-Hold on, Angela.
-I've got ahold of you!
Get your arms around my neck!
Thattagirl.
Nurse?
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!
Take it slowly, now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt.
Try to get your hand over there.
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller!
Are you all right?
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God!
We're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on, let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
Inside, security phone on the right.
-Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
-I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
The fire's below us.
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.
It's the copter air-control officer.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.
I'm getting relief for you and your men.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.
Right away.
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs.
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby.
Thank you.
This ain't gonna help any!
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!
It's a fire door.
It's over 2.5 inches thick.
I could crawl through the duct.
Will we be able to go with you?
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right, I'll tell him.
-How is it on 65?
-They're containing it.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown.
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold on to me a second.
Hold on!
Christ!
That's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.
-Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
-Not for us.
-Where've you been?
-We had trouble getting here.
The Navy flight commander needs you.
Just walk 65 floors down?
Only five.
A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.
-Got it controlled?
-Getting there.
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike... .
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow. " Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another one there!
Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Anybody'll do.
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How--?
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.
-How're you doing?
-We're fine.
Glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
Mrs. Mueller?
It's Mr. Roberts!
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.
Okay, get down low.
-What kind of explosives are you using?
-It's plastic C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here, shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it up here.
Is there gonna be a bang?
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good going, Brian.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
-Hold it down!
-Listen!
I've been informed that there's no possibility...
... ofusingthisstairwaytogetout.
Now, I'm sorry.
Patty... .
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
-I'm getting out.
-Roger, you... .
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
-I guess you thought I stood you up.
-It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Can I get you anything else?
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the Peerless Building...
... andgetabreechesbuoy to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
-Doc?
-Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
-There's no way down.
-Thank God you're all right.
-Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
-I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
-Responsible?
-Feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase...
... liftaneyebrow in the exact same way...
... IseeandIhear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.
Right now...
... whatI needmost...
... isthis.
I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
-But you don't know anything about me.
-But I do.
You're penniless...
... youhaveno villa in the south of France...
... noantiquescoming,nopaintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But you see, your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively...
... ifyoudon'tenjoycheatingthem?
I came here to sell you 1 000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked...
... oratleastdisappointed.
-But I'm not.
-You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
I thought we were building something...
... wherepeoplecouldwork, live and be safe.
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials...
... weremadebecauseI,asabuilder, have a right to make those decisions.
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
-Who is it?
-Chief O'Hallorhan.
-What happened?
-Part of the central corridor just blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
It's too windy.
We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.
What can we do to help?
Move your combustible material away from the window.
Okay, gotcha.
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.
Jake, give me a hand.
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean...
... ifsheshouldhaveto.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
-Here he is.
-The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Get Roberts.
Get 10 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
-Doug, are they going to land?
-They're gonna try.
We'll send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 100 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
-There may not be time to tell you--
-There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'll be a lot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
Look out!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
Here he is now.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and l--
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
-Sure, what do you want them for?
-I want to try something.
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people out.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
Help me.
If you asked me to go to the North Pole...
... oreventhecliffsofMendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
-Ma'am, I'll take her.
-Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
-I'll meet you in the lobby.
-I'll be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
-You've gotta go.
-I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
All right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
All right, let it go!
Let it go!
All right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!
Explosion above 110...
... blewtheelevatoroff its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
-How many people in it?
-Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
What're you gonna go?
Flaker.
-Flaker!
-Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up out of there.
Pull it.
Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, let her go!
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
All right!
There's one in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right, let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
All right, keep it going!
All right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
-Come ahead!
-I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
-I can't!
-Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
-This is O'Hallorhan.
-We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook...
... andsetme downonthe scenic elevator.
Then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
You think this'll hold it?
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
-What's your number?
-68.
47.
Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now.
-You'll be all right.
-Tell my husband I'm all right.
-Tell him I'll be all right.
-I will.
-And I'll see him at home later.
-I will.
Let's go.
Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
Watch the ladder.
Hey, Mike...
... deputywantsto seeyou .
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 17 or 18 minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'll die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room...
... coulddefinitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
-You're crazy.
-Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design--
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you... .
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation...
... I'llbethelastoneoutof here along with my son-in-law.
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'll kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'll burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line.
Get off!
-You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
-Let go of me!
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
-Get the hell out of there!
-Go!
Get off.
Chief.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
See you up there.
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts...
... anythingyoucanfind!
-Carlos!
-Yes, sir.
Get some knives.
There we go.
For God's sakes, Carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug...
... Ineverthoughtthiscouldhappen.
Sure.
-How much time you think we got?
-Ten minutes, maybe less.
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
All right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire...
... we'llplugit andspliceitinto the timer, set it, and it blows.
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
-Got it?
-I got it.
-Good luck.
See you later.
-Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman?
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
-Claiborne!
-What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God...
... thatI canstopthisfrom ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'll kill 1 0,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies...
... untilsomebodyasksus...
... howtobuildthem.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.
So, how was it?
Good.
You're gonna go ahead, huh?
Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying that, uh, no matter how hot it gets up there during the day, there's not...
Not a damn thing to do at night.
That's right.
Now just what the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
[Door Opens] You'll be back in two weeks.
Can you come in the office for a minute?
I got people waiting upstairs.
Well, what I wanted to tell you is that, uh,
Senator Parker's flying in for the dedication tonight, and he's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Now, do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
[Elevator Door Opens]
You design 'em, I'll build 'em.
Jim, I think you suffer from an "edifice" complex.
You'll never leave.
Right after the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Sam.
It's Doug.
How are ya?
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay open.
Dampers?
Whatever happened to hello?
Hello.
How are ya?
Good.
You look like it took.
Yeah.
Hi, Mr. Roberts.
Hey, Doug.
Just a second.
We're gonna miss you.
Duncan know?
He's all smiles.
Mm-hmm.
Hey.
What electromagnets went in?
Doug.
Thompson G-4's.
Shouldn't they have been, like, G-12's?
Oh, no.
That's what comes from this damn last-minute panic.
I'll fix it, Doug.
Okay.
What?
We keep running into groundwater on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in sometime this afternoon.
Good to see you back, but how about Chicago specs?
Philadelphia.
In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Well, is there-
Mm-hmm.
No, I'm not taking any calls.

You're better.
All protein.
No bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase over there.
What's in that suitcase?
I got about 140 dollars' worth of vulgar underwear for ya.
First things first.
It's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this- and they will- remember to tell them that it was my idea.
Right.
Got change for a 50?

Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
Tomorrow we're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us tonight.
Oh, thank you, but I'm going up to the party in the tower.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Oh, here.
Let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?

What was that?
I said, "How are you?" Okay.
[Chuckles] Good-bye.
Okay.
I'll get on it right now.
[Man] I'll have to check the panel.
Just leave all those fired up.
Mr. Callahan.
Yeah.
We still got any of those G-12 electrodes in stock?
Yeah.
Main storeroom.
Right.
Okay.
Booster pump, Zone 1.
110.
Check.
Main generator, Zone 1.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Ah.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor as well as apartments?
Oh, I wouldn't like that at all.
Oh, no, no.
The business offices only go as high as 80.
From the 81st floor here, all the way up to 120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 8145.
Say, Bill.
Tune in the main utility room.
Okay.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire department alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
Well, the sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
[Sighs] Hello.
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean...
[Clears Throat]
I guess we got ourselves a situation.
Seems.
See, Doug, I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
And I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I've wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have...
I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it.
Something that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both, can I?
I don't know.
[Beeps]
Yeah.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight, hmm?
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
Yeah.
What about that?
It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
[Snip]
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now, just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ.
The specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
[Intercom Buzzes]
Yeah.
[Woman] Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay.
Send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire from a burned-out circuit breaker is hardly conclusive.
Well, maybe not, but after that, I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will.
Doug.
J.D., wait till you see this.
What happened?
Somebody hang the wallpaper upside down?
We have an equipment problem.
No problem in the tower, is there?
Could be.
Come on, Doug.
You're just guessing.
All right.
I'm just guessing.
But I want to talk to that son-in-law of yours.
I want to talk to him right away.
Okay.
Get me Roger Simmons.
[Woman] Yes, sir.
I'm gonna check this thing out, Mr. Duncan.
I guarantee you.
Sure, sure.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah.
A fire.
In this building?
Come on.
Do you know we haven't even finished installing the safety equipment?
The party should have been put off for at least another month.
Now, hold it, Will.
Hold it!
Everybody's overreacting.
[Buzzes]
Yes.
Mr. Simmons is out, sir.
- Out where?
- [Woman] They don't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
[Duncan] Okay.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow, and then we'll decide what to do.
That's okay, isn't it?
Nope.
Won't wait.
Try Zone 1 again.
Damn it, Harry.
This is top priority.
We've got to get these electrical systems back on the beam.
Our whole security program's loused up without 'em.
Don't go away.
[Doorbell Chimes]
Doug.
Well, what a surprise.
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I mean, I called his office, the club, the marina- everywhere.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on.
I'll get you a drink.
He must have done something, 'cause my father called.
I haven't heard him that upset in years.
You have any idea where he is?
Well, my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's roughly equivalent to that of the timber wolf- anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you want to wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
Can I get you a drink?
No.
No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
[Door Opens]
[Door Closes]
Hi, Doug.
Honey.
Hello.
What are you drinking these days?
Nothing right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a power surge and a systems failure.
How can that be?
Well, it can't be, theoretically.
Unless you've been screwing around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours anyway?
Well, I'm just wondering what kind of kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Now, listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
It looked to me like some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
Every piece of wire I put in that building is strictly up to code- inspected and approved.
The code's not enough for that building.
And you know it.
That's why I asked for installations that were way, way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dreamworld.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
It'd take weeks to get all that together- and someone with more clout than you to make me do it.
In my office, tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
[Door Closes] Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
Roger, if you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help.
Or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time daddy barks.
I mean, if that's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
But I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.

Yeah, I found him.
Well, did he or didn't he change your specs?

Payoffs and kickbacks.
That's the only way he could've swung it.
Well, here you are.
Your original specs.
Zone 1 only, but we gotta start somewhere.
The son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
Susan.
Hello, Danny.
Good evening.
Good show.
How are you, dear?
Jim.
Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
Uh, I'll meet you out front.
I'd like to talk to Susan for a minute.
Right.
Find me the architect who designed you, and who needs Doug Roberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries tonight reads like a who's who.
There are leaders from society and government.
Stars of screen and television.
And now, just arriving, the honorable Gary Parker, chairman of the Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator flew in from Washington tonight to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him over to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I am honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark... in a long succession of landmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
I am deeply appreciative... of being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
[Applause]
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's Mr. and Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, Senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Ah, yes.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
When I get the time, I want to ask you a few questions, and I expect some straight answers.
[Announcer] And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
[Crowd Whistling]
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower... tallest building in the world.

[Rings] Utility.
Wes.
Doug.
I'm up on 83 with Will.
Listen.
We got a little wiring problem.
If we get an overload, it could be trouble.
Shut down as many Zone 1 systems as you can.
Afraid I can't do that, Mr. Roberts.
We've got all the lights on for the dedication ceremony.
All?
You mean the whole building?
Well, we're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
But I can't do that without a direct okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility for that.
Just turn off the goddamn lights.
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
- I didn't say kill all the power.
Just the overload.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts.
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
Okay.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81.
[Beeping]
Bill, phone it in just in case our automatic lines to the fire department are out.
I'll be in 81.

Hello.
This is 81.
We've had an accident up here.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes.
Right away.
Roberts, call Duncan in the tower.
We've got a lot of people up there.
What?
Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah.
Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
Everybody wants to know why the world's greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind about that.
Will Giddings has been pretty badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
Listen.
I've already got an ambulance coming, but you better think about getting those people upstairs down on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but-
Well, then, uh, why the urgency?
Urgency?
Hey, Dunc, if that fire was caused by fluky wiring in this building, we could get fires breaking out everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
Now, I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I am not going to concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81... because it can't possibly affect us up here.
Not in this building.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
In the meantime, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party.
Now, come on!

Okay.

I want you over that way.
Mike, she's throwin' a lot of smoke.
Eighty-first floor, right?
Right.
We've got lobby control.
Second alarm is in.
Set up a forward command.
Got it.
[Siren Wailing]
Chief, this is Roberts, the architect.
What've we got here, Kappy?
Fire started 81st floor.
Storage room.
This is a bad one.
The smoke is so thick we can't tell how far it's spread.
What about your exhaust system?
Well, it should've reversed automatically.
There must have been a motor burnout or somethin'.
Sprinklers?
They're not working on 81.
Why not?
I don't know.
Jim.
Yes, sir.
All right.
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe systems.
Well, we got outlets on every floor.
Both three and one-and-a-half inch.
G.P.M.?
1,500 from ground to 68, 1,000 from 68 to 100... and, uh, 500 from there to the roof.
All right.
And you're sure these elevators are programmed for emergency service?
These two are.
What floor do you keep your plans on?
Seventy-nine.
My office.
That's good.
That's two floors below the fire.
All right.
That'll be our forward command.
All right, men.
Take up the equipment.
Right.
Let's go.
Okay.
[Sighs] Architects.
Yeah.
It's all our fault.
Now, you know there's no sure way for us to fight a fire... in anything over the seventh floor, but you guys just keep buildin' em as high as you can.
Hey.
Are you here to take me on or the fire?
Okay.
Well, what about the 81st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
[Elevator Door Opens]
I want to see all your floor plans.
Eighty-one through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what I'm worried about.
All those beams and that glass.
Chief.
Yeah.
81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
How long before you can give me a complete list of your tenants?
You don't have to worry about that.
We're movin' 'em out right now.
Not live-in.
Business tenants.
We kind of looked up there too.
The majority of them haven't moved in yet, and those that have aren't working tonight.
I want to know who they are, not where they are.
Now what does that got to do with anything- who they are?
Do you have any wool or silk manufacturers?
You see, in a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Do you have any, uh, sporting good manufacturers, like table tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Want me to keep goin' down the line?
No.
One list of tenants comin' right up.
Thank you.
Over here and here.
Here.
What have we got?
Well, elevator bank.
Central core.
Service elevators over here.
Air-conditioning duct, six inches.
Right.
Pipe alleys here?
One, two, three, four, five.
This is south.
South.
Have you got any construction going up in 81?
Nope.
Anything that could blow up, like gasoline, kerosene, uh, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
[Sighs] Good.
I'll be up on 81.
[Kappy] Okay.
For what it's worth, architect, this is one building that I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
- Party?
What party?
Where?
- In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get 'em the hell out of there?
Why don't you go on upstairs and talk to Duncan?
He ain't exactly listening to me.
I will.

Well, uh, I don't believe that you're familiar with... the many modern safety systems we have designed into this building.
We've got 'em all.
All right.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now let's get these people the hell out of here.
I don't think you're listening, Chief.
There's no way for a fire on 81 to reach up here.
Not in this building.
Okay.

Do you want me to pull rank on you?

Not yet.
Well, then get out of my way.
You didn't talk like this two years ago, did you?
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then how I could shave two million dollars of four electrical costs?
Shut up, and help me with these people.
And let me ask you, my dear father-in-law...
Excuse me.
Am I the only subcontractor you encouraged to cut corners?
Excuse me.

[Sirens Wailing In Distance]
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
[Coughs]
We were supposed to have fire drills.
That's what they said.
But they never did.
[Sirens Continue]
[Whispers] It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
[Angela Whimpering]
You all right?
You know, I had- I got up all right, but I think I'm gonna have a lot of trouble gettin' down.
You think you could help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck real tight?
[Sobs] Oh, no.
Come on.
Give it a try.
[Mouths Word]
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Okay?
Put her legs down.
[Whimpering]
Okay.
Hold on tight.
Put your legs around here.
Hold on real tight now.
Go on.
Hang on.
[Whimpering]
Just hold on tight, honey.
Hold on.
[Sobbing]
Hold on.
You're okay.
Hold on tight now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
Hold on, Angela.
I've got a hold of you.
Get your arms around my neck.
That-a-girl.
Nurse.
He stayed in too long.
Bring him right over here.
[Panting]
[Coughing]
Mrs. Mueller, come on.
You've gotta try!
Take it slowly now.
[Breathing Heavily]
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold onto that pole and grab a hold of my belt.
Try to get your left hand over there.
About half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
[Angela] Mrs. Mueller.
[Grunts]
Are you all right?
Fine.
All right, let's go.
[Angela Whimpering]
[Whimpering]
Come on.
Come on.
I'm comin'.
I'm comin'.
[Breathing Heavily]
[Clattering]
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God, we're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on.
Let's go.
[Sirens Wail]
Chief O'Hallorhan?
O'Hallorhan.
Inside, security phone on the right.
[Sirens Continue]
Would you get me Chief O'Hallorhan right away?
I'm trying to get through now.
[Sobbing]
Can't we go down?
No, the fire's below us.
We have to go up.
This'll put us right underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
[Whimpering]
[Phone Rings] Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
Jack?
Yeah?
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling and vent that other side.
It's for you, Chief.
The air control officer for the copter.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hittin' it.
I'm gonna get some relief for you and your men.
This is O'Hallorhan.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We could use your rescue choppers.
I'll order them right away.
I'd like to set up communications... next to the forward command center.
No, no, too dangerous.
Stay outta those elevators.
Well, then, sir, we'll just trot right up the stairs.
Yeah, you'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby, sir.
Thank you.
[Coughing]
[Breathing Heavily]
This isn't gonna help any.
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people.
It's a fire door.
It's over two and a half inches thick.
Maybe I could crawl through there.
Will we- Will we be able to go with you?
It leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
[Metal Clanks] Use this.
Phillip, you take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
[Metal Thuds]
[Heavy Breathing]
[Exhales]
All right.
I'll tell him.
Chief?
Yeah.
How does it look on 65?
They're getting it contained.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
[Electrical Crackling]
[Whistling] Come here!
The master generator's blown!
But the backup should've kicked on by now.
Go see what's holding up our starters.
[Motor Slows] [Brakes Squeal]
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
[Clamoring]
[Clamor Continues]
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
Well, what's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold onto me a second.
[Rattling]
[Chattering]
[Metal Clattering]
Hold on!
Jesus Christ, that's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Okay, okay.
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We're gonna rappel.
Down to 65.
Get on top of that elevator, use it for an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Okay.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room!
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Okay, open it up.
Of course I read you!
Look, I don't know where the hell he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him!
Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
Not for us.
Mike, where have you been?
We had a little trouble getting here.
The navy flight commander needs you down in the lobby right away.
Sixty-five floors?
Just walk right down?
No, it's only five.
They got a freight elevator on 60 on auxiliary power.
Okay.
You got this thing controlled?
Well, we're gettin' there.
All right, you men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike...
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow." Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Located O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
[Chattering]
[Helicopter Whirring]
Look!
There's another there.
Look.
[Chattering] [Exhales]
[Chattering] [Man] It's too damn windy out there!
Hey, Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
Mr. Roberts.
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Well, that's okay.
Anybody'll do.
Listen.
The south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for Chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How...
Okay.
Oh.
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
Oh, it's okay, Mrs. Mueller.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
[Footsteps Approaching]
Oh, hello, ma'am.
Oh, hello.
How you doin'?
We're fine.
Glad to see you.
Yeah.
That's the door right here!
It's blocked with cement.
Okay.
Ah, we're gonna have to blow that thing.
Right.
[Doug] Mrs. Mueller.
It's Mr. Roberts.
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you!
We're gonna blow this door!
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there outta the way.
Okay.
Everybody, could you please go back?
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back to the elevator.
We're blowing up the exit door.
Okay, get down low.
What kind of explosives are you using?
It's plastic, C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
[Gasps]
Here.
Shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it on there.
Is there going to be a bang?
Ah, nothin' for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
[Clamoring]
Good goin', guys.
Hey.
[Chuckling] You all right?
[Chattering]
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
[Man] Hold it down!
Listen!
I've been informed by the fire department... that there's no possibility of using this stairway to get out.
[Crowd Groans] Now, I'm-I'm sorry.
Patty.
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
We can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
No.
[Sighs]
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
I'm getting out.
Roger.
You...
[Scoffs]
[Clamoring]
[Coughing]
[Groaning]
Ah!
[Explosion]
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go!
You guys, pull the ceiling!
You two, in there!
I guess you thought I stood you up.
It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Mm-hmm.
[Helicopters Whirring]
Doug, those, uh... those helicopters, th-they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will, if there's not too much wind.
[Exhales] Some party.
Doug-
Hmm, da-dumm!
Can I get you anything else?
No?
[Coughing]
[Coughing]
Damn!
[Sirens Wailing] The choppers are here all right, but those high winds on the roof make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on the roof of the Peerless Building.
I wanna try to get a breeches buoy up to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that distance, not in this wind.
What's the matter with shooting' it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
Don?
Chief, uh, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
[Breathing Heavily]
[Coughing]
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
There's no way down.
Thank God you're all right.
Oh, Roger, what are we gonna do?
I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for all this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
Responsible?
Feeling!
Oh, you know a lot about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
The Duncans are very big in the responsibility department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of-of duty!
Sometimes... when you turn the exact same phrase, lift an eyebrow the exact same way,
I see, and I hear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a great big tree, and a little baby tree in its shade where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you... because I-I-I-I thought you might need me!
Right now, what I need most... is this.
I, um
- I promised myself that if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
But you don't know anything about me.
But I do.
You're penniless.
You have no villa in the south of France-
No antiques coming, no paintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn, a two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But don't you see?
Your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively if you don't really enjoy cheating them?
I brought you up here tonight to sell you a thousand shares... in Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light, only the certificate I had printed.
I must say, I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
I-It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
[Sighs]
Did you hear what I said?
Mm.
Every word.
Well, then, tell me you're shocked.
Or at least disappointed!
But I'm not.
You must be!
[Laughing] Harlee, I'm not.
[Exhales]
Okay.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
Oh, God, I wonder how many more'll be dead by tomorrow?
I thought we were building something that- where people could work and live and be safe!
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now, listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials... were made because I, as a builder, have a right to make those decisions-
If I remain within the building code.
And goddamn it, I did!
[Laughing] Building code.
Jesus.
Oh, the building code.
Come on, Dunc.
I mean, that's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble.
I was crawlin' around up there.
I mean, duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors, and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for startin' fires!
Hoo, boy.
Where was I when all this was goin' on?
'Cause I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
[Indistinct]
Come on!
Move it!
[Explosion]
Okay.
Who is it?
Chief O'Hallorhan.
What happened?
Part of the central core just blew.
Now, we've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
No, it's too windy.
They can't set down.
We want to set the breeches buoy up on the roof of the Peerless Building.
[Clamoring] Well, what can we do to help?
Move all your combustible material away from the window.
Okay.
Gotcha.
[Man] Come on.
Grab those tables and chairs.
[Chattering] [Clanking]
[Man] Pile 'em up away from the walls!
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get on 'em now.
Jake, give me a hand!
[Chattering]
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Well, just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how- how precious she is to us.
[Sighs] She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety-deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean, uh, if she should have to.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
Oh.
Here he is.
Chief, the wind velocity's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Gil, get Roberts.
Yeah.
Get 10 people up on the roof.
Have the rest of 'em stand by in groups of 10.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Patty, put these over there where they can get them easily.
Carlos, give me that pad of paper and a pencil.
Yes, sir.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
Right.
Doug, are they going to land?
They're gonna try.
Send the kids out first...
and then the women.
Number this up to- I don't know...
a hundred or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
Doug, there may not be time to tell you later.
There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
[Helicopter Whirring]
All right, there's gonna be a lot of wind up there, especially when that chopper lands.
So everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back!
Stay back!
[Whimpering]
[Pilot] Look out!
[Whimpering]
[Whimpering]
[Crying]
[Clamoring]
[Woman] I think so.
Roberts!
Mr. Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Pardon me.
Comin' through!
Comin' through!
Pardon me.
[Chattering]
Here he is now.
[Sighs] Yeah?
Now look, Roberts, I know those pilots are dead and-
[Clicks Tongue] God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I've told my two firemen up there to knock out a window.
We're gonna try to shoot a line to you from a chopper.
Okay.
[Sighs]
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
Uh, yeah, sure.
What do you want 'em for?
I wanna try somethin'.
[Chattering]
Step way back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back.
You won't get hurt.
[Glass Shatters]
[Indistinct]
[Chattering]
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people down to the street.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof.
And two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman.
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Here, take this.
Take it.
You can get out of here.
Go on!
Take it.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Listen.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me down there worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me now, baby.
Help me.
If you ask me to go to the North Pole, or even the cliffs of Mendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
Ma'am, I'll take her.
Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
All right.
Hey.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to, ever again.
I'll meet you in the lobby.
I'll be waiting.
Uh, we're still a lady short.
You've gotta go.
But I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
[Helicopters Whirring]
[Crowd Chattering]
[Screaming]
Hey, out of sight!
It's coming!
All right, let's untie this!
Take it all!
Pull in the rest of the line!
[Chattering]
All right, hold it.
Hold it right there!
Bring me in another 20 feet on that main line!
Hey, come here!
Tie this off, will you?
All right.
That's right.
There you go!
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more.
That's it.
Hold it now!
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
[Fireman] Grab it!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
Okay!
All right.
Let it go!
Let it go!
All right.
Go on!
Take it all!
Pull.
Come on.
Pull.
Okay, take up on it!
Make that line!
Fast!
How about the main line?
Secured?
Okay.
Good!

Explosion above 110.
Blew the scenic elevator right off its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
[Sighs] How many people in it?
Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
[Helmet Clatters]
What are you gonna do?
[Sighs]
[Exhales]
Flaker.
- Flaker?
- Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have 'em pick me up on the roof of the Peerless Building.
We got it.
Yeah.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator, drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
[Groans]
[Sobbing] Mommy, Mommy!
It's all right.
It's okay.
I won't let anything happen.
I promise.
[Whimpering]
I won't cry if you won't cry.
Oh.
[Fire Roaring]
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up the ladder there.
[Wind Howling]
Okay, get it over.
Come on.
Come on.
Get it up here.
[Wind Howling] [Helicopter Whirring]
[Shouting]
Okay!
Okay, let it go!
Look out below!
Come on!
[Man] Hey, make that chair fast!
[Helicopter Whirring]
[Chair Clanking]
All right!
Pull it right in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right!
Let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
All of us!
That's it!
[Pulley Jingling]
All right!
Keep it goin'!
All right!
Hold it right there!
- Who's next in order?
- I am.
I am!
- Come ahead.
- I can't do that.
[Man] Yes, you can.
I'll fall!
I can't!
I can't!
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.
Oh, God.
Don't let go of me.
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Ah!
Don't
- Don't let go of me!
Oh, oh!
All right!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
[Explosion] Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
God!
[Whimpering]
Okay.
Here she comes!
All right!
Pull that chair in!
Easy!
Easy!
[Chattering]
Hold it right there.
[Man] Okay, lower the cable!
Grab that hook!
Steady it.
Hook on the torch.
Lash it tight.
This is O'Hallorhan.
[Man] We read you, Chief.
I want you to pick me up with the hook and set me down on the scenic elevator.
Then you're gonna pick up the scenic elevator... and very gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Okay.
[Wind Howling]
Watch it.
[Helicopter Whirring] Okay, take it away!
How much time do we have?
Bob, I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
Don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
[Fireman] Let it go!
Think this'll hold it?
[O'Hallorhan] It better.
We're gonna have to cut the elevator cable.
What's your number?
Sixty-eight.
Forty-seven.

Please.
You'll be all right.
Please, tell my husband I'll be all right.
I will.
You tell him I'll be all right.
I-I...
I will.
I'll be able to see him at home later.
I will.
I will.
I promise.
[Grunts] Let's go.
[Chattering]
Here she is!
She's all right!
Watch the ladder!
[Man #1] Let's go!
[Man #2] Bring everything.
We're gonna need it!
[Chattering] [Oxygen Tanks Hissing]
[Sirens Wailing In Distance]
[Man Coughing]
[Sirens Continue In Distance]
Hey, Mike, deputy wants to see you.
Okay.
Yeah, Mike, look, we've been checking the situation up in the Promenade Room.
And we figure they've got only about 17, maybe 18, minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than three hours to get 'em all down by breeches buoy.
Those people are gonna die up there if something's not done.
Now, we might just have the answer.
Mr. Johnson's a structural engineer.
You tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists and risers up there in the Promenade Room, in my opinion, could definitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready out on the plaza.
Fireman, wait a minute.
Look, we'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold a million gallons of water.
That's more than enough to drown the fire.
- You're crazy.
- Mike, it's the only way.
Well, how do you know it'll work?
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think.
[Johnson] When you take into account... the stress and load factors, the building design-
Wait a minute.
Hold it.
Mike, look, we've already made the decision.
Now, someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow 'em.
Now, there's only two people in the department qualified for that.
That's you and Connors.
They just...
They just brought Connors down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Look, under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just layin' it out for you.
But you...
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
Huh.
[Chattering]
The women are gone.
We are going next.
[Groans, Coughs]
You've all got numbers, and you're gonna take your turn!
And if it's any consolation,
I'm going to be the last one outta here along with my son-in-law.
[Phone Rings]
[Ringing Continues]
[Ringing] Roberts.
It's outta control.
And it's comin' your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
They wanna try somethin'.
They wanna blow those water tanks two floors above you.
They think it might kill the fire.
How they gonna get the explosives up here?
Oh, they'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
[Sighs] Hang on, I'll tell 'em.
[Sets Receiver On Counter]
They wanna try to put out the fire by blowing up the water tanks above us.
It's gonna mean a lot of water and steel and concrete, but if they don't try it... we're all gonna burn.
The fire's out of control below us.
They figure we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
[Roger] Get that line!
- Get off!
- You crazy bastard!
Get off this line!
[Roger] Let go of me!
It's not gonna work!
[Grunting] Oh!
It won't hold everybody!
You!
Get off!
Get outta there!
Get the hell outta there!
No!
No!
No!
[Screaming]
Get off!
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
Chief.
Yeah.
Well, we just lost the breeches buoy.
There was panic up here.
It's under control now.
Okay.
I'm gonna try to set down on the roof.
I'm gonna need you up there.
Well, I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
Okay.
See you up there.
[Handset Clatters]
All right!
You're gonna have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts, anything you can find.
[Chattering] Carlos, get some knives.
For God's sakes, Carlos, don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass!
That's the '29!
Comin' through.
Comin' through.
Come on.
[Sirens Fade]
[Sirens Wail]
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug, I... never thought that a thing like this could happen.
Sure.
[Breathing Deeply]
[No Audible Dialogue]
Hey, how much time you think we got?
Ten minutes, maybe less.
We're gonna have to blow the floors out as well as the tanks, you know.
All right, this is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Now later on, after you throw the wire, we'll plug it and splice it into the timer, set it, and then it blows.
You set your explosive...
like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
Got it?
I got it.
Good luck.
See you later.
Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
How much you gonna set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
[Ticking] That's it.
[Chattering]
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Air.
Here.
[Breathing Deeply]
[Breathing Deeply]
I'm burning up!
Let's go.
Fireman.
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
[Groans]
[Grunts]
Bob!
Bob!
Oh, my God!
[Groaning]
[Grunting]
[Grunting]
[Sirens Wail In Distance] [Chattering]
[Chattering]
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry.
She's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Claiborne!
What?
[Meowing]
[Crying]
[Sobbing]
I didn't want you to see him.
You know there's nothing that any of us can do to bring back the dead.
[Sobbing Continues]
All I can do now is pray to God that...
I can stop this from ever happening again.
[Chattering]
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
A kind of shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
You know, one of these days, they're gonna kill 10,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'm gonna keep eatin' smoke and bringin' out bodies... until somebody asks us how to build 'em.
[Sighs]
Okay.
I'm askin'.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.
- So how was it?
- Good.
- You're gonna go ahead?
- Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying:
"No matter how hot it gets up there during the day there's not a..." - "Not a damn thing to do at night".
What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
Come in the office for a minute.
I got people waiting upstairs.
I wanted to tell you Senator Parker's coming to the dedication tonight.
He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them.
I'll build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'll never leave.
After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay opened.
Whatever happened to "hello"?
Hello.
- How are you?
- Good.
You look like it took.
Hi, Mr. Roberts.
Just a second.
We'll miss you.
- Duncan know?
- He's all smiles.
- What electromagnets went in?
- Doug?
Thompson G-4s.
Don't you think it should've been G-12s?
That's what comes from last-minute panic.
I'll fix it.
There's ground water on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in today.
How about Chicago specs?
- Philadelphia?
- In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Who's there?
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
All protein, no bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
I got about a $140 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will remember to tell them that it was my idea.
Got change for a 50?
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.
Not a chance!
Let's see what we got here...
Twenty-five, 50, 60 70, 75 85, 95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
All your security squad's up there...
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us?
Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Here, let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
- Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that?
- I said how are you?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Okay, I'll get on it right now.
I'll have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.
Mr. Callahan?
We still got any G-12 electrodes?
- Yeah, main storeroom.
- Right.
Okay, booster pump, zone one.
- One-ten.
- Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?
I wouldn't like that at all!
The business offices only go up to 80.
From the 81 st floor, here all the way up to 120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 8145...
Say, Bill?
Tune in the main utility room.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
The sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello?
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean...
I guess we've got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both.
Can I?
I don't know.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight.
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
What about that?
It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
Specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay, send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire from a burned-out circuit breaker isn't conclusive.
Maybe not.
But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will, Doug J.D., wait till you see this.
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?
We have an equipment problem.
- No problem in the tower, is there?
- Could be.
Come on.
You're just guessing.
I want to talk to your son-in-law.
I wanna talk to him right away.
- Get Roger Simmons.
-Yes, sir.
I guarantee I'll check this out.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah, a fire.
In this building?
Come on.
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
- The party should've been put off...
- Hold it, Will!
Everybody's overreacting.
Mr. Simmons is out, sir.
Out where?
They don't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'll decide what to do.
- That's okay, isn't it?
- Nope.
Won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it!
This is top priority.
We gotta get these electrical systems on.
Our security program's loused up without them.
Don't go away.
Doug!
Well, what a surprise!
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on, I'll get you a drink.
He must've done something.
My father called.
He hasn't been that upset in years.
Have any idea where he is?
Well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you wanna wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
- Honey.
- Hello.
- What are you drinking these days?
- Nothing, right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a systems failure.
How can that be?
It can't be, theoretically.
Unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours?
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
All the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!
I asked for installations way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
That would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have!
In my office!
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks even if that's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Nonsense.
Be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.
Here you are your original specs.
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
- Susan.
- Hello, Dan.
Good evening.
- How are you, dear?
- Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
I'll meet you out front.
- I'd like to talk to Susan.
- Right.
Find me the architect who designed you and who needs Doug Roberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who.
There are leaders from society and government stars of screen and television.
And now, just arriving, the Honorable Gary Parker chairman of the Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator's in from Washington to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark in a long succession of landmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
...being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. And Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
Later, I wanna ask you a few questions and I expect some straight answers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower tallest building in the world!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
After you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
I've never seen the bridge look like that.
- It's unbelievable!
- Astonishing!
- How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
- Fine, thank you.
Good night.
Shall I leave you a night line?
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Lorrie...
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
We almost missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
Hello.
Hi.
- Promise me something?
- What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
I promise.
We may never love like this again
Don't stop the flow
We can't let go
We may never love like this again
And touch the sky
Though we may try
So while we're here Let's give our all
Release the dreams inside us
And set them free
Oh, while we're here let's leave a mark
There's a candle in the dark
It's here to guide us
We may never love like this again
But through the days
Beyond the haze
I see you reaching out...
- How's the family?
- Fine, thank you.
Good.
Gary?
- Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
- Certainly.
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Politicians don't like surprises.
- Carlos?
- Yes, sir.
- What can I fix you?
- Meet Senator Parker.
- Great pleasure.
- It's an honor, senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
1929?
- That's all you'll drink tonight.
- A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'll ship to Washington.
- Open a bottle, will you?
- Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
I guess you're looking for someone.
I am.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?
- Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
- Susan, tell me...
What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man decides to leave for two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No headhunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
- You must miss your villa.
- Well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
- No false humility, please.
- Oh, shall we?
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco to regain my perspective and my humility and spend more time at the one thing I'm really good at:
The stock market.
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
You better leave it off.
Utility.
Wes.
Doug, I'm up on 83 with Will.
We got a wiring problem.
Overloads could be trouble.
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.
I can't do that.
All the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.
You mean the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
I didn't say all the power, just the overload!
Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81.
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.
- I'll be in 81.
- You got it.
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
Pull it around over here.
Put it all over him.
Come on!
Let's get some water onto that fire.
Turn it on!
Down, down!
Stay low!
Call an ambulance for this man.
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor!
- The fire department?
- On their way.
Get that ambulance.
Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.
All right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
This is 81.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes, right away.
Call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a lot of people up there.
- What?
- Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
An ambulance is coming, but you better think about getting those people down on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but...
Well, then why the urgency?
Urgency?
If fluky wiring in this building caused that fire fires could break out everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 because it can't possibly affect us up here not in this building.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and...
Oh, Jesus!
- The glass tower!
- What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being inside a chimney.
Jesus!
How in the hell did they get here before we did?
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
- Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.
- Eighty-first floor, right?
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
- Set up a Forward Command.
- Got it.
Chief this is Roberts, the architect.
- What do we got here, Kappy?
- Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.
It's bad.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
- Exhaust system?
- Should've reversed automatically.
It must be a motor burnout.
- Sprinklers?
- They're not working on 81.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
- Jim?
- Yes, sir?
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.
Floors have 3 and 1.5-inch outlets.
GPM?
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1000 from 68 to 100 and 500 from there to the roof.
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
- What floor are your plans on?
- 79.
My office.
That's two floors below the fire.
It'll be our Forward Command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
Architects!
Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.
But you keep building them as high as you can.
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?
What about the 81 st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.
Not live-ins.
Businesses.
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.
Those that have are off at night.
I wanna know who they are, not where.
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?
Any wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Any sporting-good manufacturers, like table-tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?
- One tenant list, coming up.
- Thank you.
What do we got?
Elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
- Pipe alleys here?
- One, two, three, four, five.
- This is south?
- South.
Have you got any construction on 81?
Anything that can blow up, like gasoline, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'll be up on 81.
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.
Jack?
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
- I'll be up topside.
- Right.
Jack watch yourself.
Keep it high.
- Looking for me, chief?
- Lf you're Duncan.
I am.
Everything under control?
Gotta move these people out of here.
Now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems we have designed into this building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.
I don't think you're listening.
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.
- I'll do it.
- Hold it, hold it.
Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I could tell them, but you ought to.
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests that the party's being moved down below the fire floor.
Now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now, don't leave this table.
You, I wanna talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
- I most certainly did.
- For God's sake, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire.
If it was caused by what you did, I'll hang you out to dry.
And then I'm going to hang you!
Would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire in one of our storage rooms 50 floors below.
I assure you there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders a purely precautionary procedure we're going to move the party down to the lobby for a while.
And we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators...
Now, ladies and gentlemen there's no reason to rush.
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
- Lisolette!
- Frank!
Lisolette!
- How's it going, chief?
- Better get ready.
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire lapping?
- Are your com lines tested?
- Phone jacks on every floor.
- I'm plugging into your PA system.
- No sweat.
- Emergency setup?
- Battery-powered standby system.
Splice these lines into our two-way communications van.
Sure.
- No problem?
- No problem.
- How long will this take?
- A minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
The fire's lapping up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
What was that?
- Come on!
- The ceiling's going!
Men trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
Pull them out, pull them out!
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!
Battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!
Forward Command, go ahead.
Explosion on 81, fire headed toward elevator banks!
We need more crews up here fast!
- They need relief on 81.
Hit it.
- They're on their way.
Done!
Tell Duncan to stop those Tower Room people from using that express elevator, or somebody'll get killed.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads and some choppers here.
We may need them to get those people down.
Come on, Park.
I'll be on 81.
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.
I don't like how you talk to me.
- You drunk?
- Not yet.
- Then get out of my way!
- You didn't talk like this before.
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?
Shut up and help these people!
- Let me ask, father-in-law...
- Excuse me.
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?
Please!
Please!
Hold everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Move back into the Promenade Room and we'll take you down by the scenic elevator.
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.
And with the probability of short circuits the cars might stop on the floor where the fire is.
So please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there.
For God's sake, get out of there!
Please, back!
It looks bad, Jack.
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
The fire's spreading.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
Firemen, let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out!
Take it down!
Empty all the water out.
Chief, it's out of control.
Bring in another line!
Get another tank!
Angela?
Angela?
Phillip?
Phillip, open the door!
What ideas can I use upstairs to explain where I've been all this time?
Well, what you might do is just walk right up to him and say, "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay but my secretary had an urgent personal problem."
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
He won't.
- You know what astonishes me?
- What?
You make love with a girl and there's no visible evidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
Look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus!
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan?
Right.
- What'd they say?
- Help's on the way.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Please.
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
- They're aware of that.
- She's wearing a purple dress.
- I've got to find her!
- I promise, they'll find her.
Now, only 12 at a time.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
We'll be in the next group, maybe.
It won't be too long.
What's she doing on 87?
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf!
Sure, the kids can hear!
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
You stay there.
I'll get them down!
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
-We'll send them right up.
- Still got people on 87.
I'll get them down.
I'll give you a hand.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
Well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
At least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.
Don't go!
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
You all right?
The mother and the two children are in there.
- Don't worry.
We'll get them out.
- Wait!
Please, Mrs. Mueller!
Please stay back.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
!
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
- Mom, Mom!
- Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
Anybody else?
My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela?
Angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay, Angela.
Thank God!
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
- All right!
- That's it.
Don't crush.
It'll take hours to get everyone down.
Those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs.
- That's 135 floors.
- All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos!
- Yes, sir.
- Help us get this thing open.
Is it stuck?
Here, let me try to kick it.
- I'll call security.
- Yes, sir.
Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
You want it easy, chief?
They should design a survival suit for us like for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Let's go to work.
I need two men up the stairwell to the tower.
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay, you got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?
Glass will be sailing everywhere.
Tell the police to move those barricades four blocks back.
- Got it.
- Let's hit it.
Yo!
Security guard.
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty, almost missed you.
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip!
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip!
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, boy.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip!
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy.
Easy.
Don't look down!
Come on.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had a...
I got up, but I'll have trouble getting down.
Can you help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck, real tight?
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Put her legs down.
Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.
Just hold on tight.
Hold on.
Hold on tight, now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
- Hold on, Angela.
- I've got ahold of you!
Get your arms around my neck!
Thattagirl.
Nurse?
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!
Take it slowly, now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt.
Try to get your hand over there.
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller!
Are you all right?
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God!
We're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on, let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
Inside, security phone on the right.
- Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
- I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
The fire's below us.
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.
It's the copter air-control officer.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.
I'm getting relief for you and your men.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.
Right away.
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs.
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby.
Thank you.
This ain't gonna help any!
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!
It's a fire door.
It's over 2.5 inches thick.
I could crawl through the duct.
Will we be able to go with you?
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right, I'll tell him.
Chief?
- How is it on 65?
- They're containing it.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown.
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold on to me a second.
Hold on!
Christ!
That's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.
- Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
- Not for us.
- Where've you been?
- We had trouble getting here.
The Navy flight commander needs you.
Just walk 65 floors down?
Only five.
A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.
- Got it controlled?
- Getting there.
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike...
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow".
Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another one there!
Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Anybody'll do.
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How...?
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.
- How're you doing?
- We're fine.
Glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
Mrs. Mueller?
It's Mr. Roberts!
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.
Okay, get down low.
- What kind of explosives are you using?
- It's plastic C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here, shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it up here.
Is there gonna be a bang?
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good going, Brian.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
- Hold it down!
- Listen!
I've been informed that there's no possibility of using this stairway to get out.
Now, I'm sorry.
Patty...
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
- I'm getting out.
- Roger, you...
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
- I guess you thought I stood you up.
- It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Can I get you anything else?
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the Peerless Building and get a breeches buoy to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
- Doc?
- Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
- There's no way down.
- Thank God you're all right.
- Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
- I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
- Responsible?
- Feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase lift an eyebrow in the exact same way I see and I hear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.
Right now what I need most is this.
I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
- But you don't know anything about me.
- But I do.
You're penniless you have no villa in the south of France no antiques coming, no paintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But you see, your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively if you don't enjoy cheating them?
I came here to sell you 1000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked or at least disappointed.
But I'm not.
You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
I thought we were building something where people could work, live and be safe.
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials were made because I, as a builder, have a right to make those decisions.
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
- Who is it?
- Chief O'Hallorhan.
What happened?
Part of the central corridor just blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
It's too windy.
We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.
What can we do to help?
Move your combustible material away from the window.
Okay, gotcha.
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.
Jake, give me a hand.
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean if she should have to.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
- Here he is.
- The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Get Roberts.
Get 10 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
- Doug, are they going to land?
- They're gonna try.
We'll send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 100 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
- There may not be time to tell you...
- There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'll be a lot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
Look out!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
Here he is now.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and I...
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
- Sure, what do you want them for?
- I want to try something.
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people out.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
Help me.
If you asked me to go to the North Pole or even the cliffs of Mendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
- Ma'am, I'll take her.
- Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- I'll be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
- You've gotta go.
- I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
All right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
All right, let it go!
Let it go!
All right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!
Explosion above 110 blew the elevator off its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
- How many people in it?
- Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
What're you gonna go?
Flaker.
Flaker!
Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up out of there.
Pull it.
Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, let her go!
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
All right!
There's one in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right, let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
All right, keep it going!
All right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
Come ahead!
I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
- I can't!
- Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
- This is O'Hallorhan.
-We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook and set me down on the scenic elevator.
Then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
You think this'll hold it?
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
- What's your number?
- 68.
47.
Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now.
- You'll be all right.
- Tell my husband I'm all right.
- Tell him I'll be all right.
- I will.
- And I'll see him at home later.
- I will.
Let's go.
Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
Watch the ladder.
Hey, Mike deputy wants to see you.
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 17 or 18 minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'll die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room could definitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
You're crazy.
Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design...
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you...
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation I'll be the last one out of here along with my son-in-law.
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'll kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'll burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line.
Get off!
You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
Let go of me!
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
- Get the hell out of there!
- Go!
Get off.
Chief.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
See you up there.
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts anything you can find!
- Carlos!
- Yes, sir.
Get some knives.
There we go.
For God's sakes, Carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug I never thought this could happen.
Sure.
- How much time you think we got?
- Ten minutes, maybe less.
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
All right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire we'll plug it and splice it into the timer, set it, and it blows.
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
- Got it?
- I got it.
- Good luck.
See you later.
- Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman?
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
- Claiborne!
- What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God that I can stop this from ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'll kill 10,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies until somebody asks us how to build them.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.
Easy now.
- Hold on, Angela.
- I've got ahold of you!
Get your arms around my neck!
Thattagirl.
Nurse?
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!
Take it slowly, now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt.
Try to get your hand over there.
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller!
Are you all right?
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God!
We're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on, let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
Inside, security phone on the right.
- Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
- I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
The fire's below us.
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.
It's the copter air-control officer.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.
I'm getting relief for you and your men.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.
Right away.
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs.
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby.
Thank you.
This ain't gonna help any!
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!
It's a fire door.
It's over 2.5 inches thick.
I could crawl through the duct.
Will we be able to go with you?
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right, I'll tell him.
Chief?
- How is it on 65?
- They're containing it.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown.
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold on to me a second.
Hold on!
Christ!
That's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.
- Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
- Not for us.
- Where've you been?
- We had trouble getting here.
The Navy flight commander needs you.
Just walk 65 floors down?
Only five.
A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.
- Got it controlled?
- Getting there.
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike...
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow".
Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another one there!
Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Anybody'll do.
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How...?
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.
- How're you doing?
- We're fine.
Glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
Mrs. Mueller?
It's Mr. Roberts!
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.
Okay, get down low.
- What kind of explosives are you using?
- It's plastic C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here, shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it up here.
Is there gonna be a bang?
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good going, Brian.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
- Hold it down!
- Listen!
I've been informed that there's no possibility of using this stairway to get out.
Now, I'm sorry.
Patty...
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
- I'm getting out.
- Roger, you...
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
- I guess you thought I stood you up.
- It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Can I get you anything else?
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the Peerless Building and get a breeches buoy to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
- Doc?
- Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
- There's no way down.
- Thank God you're all right.
- Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
- I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
- Responsible?
- Feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase lift an eyebrow in the exact same way I see and I hear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.
Right now what I need most is this.
I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
- But you don't know anything about me.
- But I do.
You're penniless you have no villa in the south of France no antiques coming, no paintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But you see, your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively if you don't enjoy cheating them?
I came here to sell you 1000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked or at least disappointed.
But I'm not.
You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
I thought we were building something where people could work, live and be safe.
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials were made because I, as a builder, have a right to make those decisions.
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
- Who is it?
- Chief O'Hallorhan.
What happened?
Part of the central corridor just blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
It's too windy.
We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.
What can we do to help?
Move your combustible material away from the window.
Okay, gotcha.
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.
Jake, give me a hand.
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean if she should have to.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
- Here he is.
- The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Get Roberts.
Get 10 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
- Doug, are they going to land?
- They're gonna try.
We'll send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 100 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
- There may not be time to tell you...
- There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'll be a lot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
Look out!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
Here he is now.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and I...
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
- Sure, what do you want them for?
- I want to try something.
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people out.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
Help me.
If you asked me to go to the North Pole or even the cliffs of Mendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
- Ma'am, I'll take her.
- Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- I'll be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
- You've gotta go.
- I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
All right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
All right, let it go!
Let it go!
All right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!
Explosion above 110 blew the elevator off its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
- How many people in it?
- Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
What're you gonna go?
Flaker.
Flaker!
Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up out of there.
Pull it.
Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, let her go!
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
All right!
There's one in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right, let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
All right, keep it going!
All right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
Come ahead!
I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
- I can't!
- Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
- This is O'Hallorhan.
-We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook and set me down on the scenic elevator.
Then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
You think this'll hold it?
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
- What's your number?
- 68.
47.
Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now.
- You'll be all right.
- Tell my husband I'm all right.
- Tell him I'll be all right.
- I will.
- And I'll see him at home later.
- I will.
Let's go.
Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
Watch the ladder.
Hey, Mike deputy wants to see you.
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 17 or 18 minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'll die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room could definitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
You're crazy.
Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design...
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you...
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation I'll be the last one out of here along with my son-in-law.
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'll kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'll burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line.
Get off!
You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
Let go of me!
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
- Get the hell out of there!
- Go!
Get off.
Chief.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
See you up there.
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts anything you can find!
- Carlos!
- Yes, sir.
Get some knives.
There we go.
For God's sakes, Carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug I never thought this could happen.
Sure.
- How much time you think we got?
- Ten minutes, maybe less.
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
All right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire we'll plug it and splice it into the timer, set it, and it blows.
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
- Got it?
- I got it.
- Good luck.
See you later.
- Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman?
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
- Claiborne!
- What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God that I can stop this from ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'll kill 10,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies until somebody asks us how to build them.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it!
:
D
- So how was it?
- Good.
- You're gonna go ahead?
- Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying:
"No matter how hot it gets up there during the day there's not a..." - "Not a damn thing to do at night".
What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
Come in the office for a minute.
I got people waiting upstairs.
I wanted to tell you Senator Parker's coming to the dedication tonight.
He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them.
I'll build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'll never leave.
After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay opened.
Whatever happened to "hello"?
Hello.
- How are you?
- Good.
You look like it took.
Hi, Mr. Roberts.
Just a second.
We'll miss you.
- Duncan know?
- He's all smiles.
- What electromagnets went in?
- Doug?
Thompson G-4s.
Don't you think it should've been G-12s?
That's what comes from last-minute panic.
I'll fix it.
There's ground water on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in today.
How about Chicago specs?
- Philadelphia?
- In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Who's there?
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
All protein, no bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
I got about a $140 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will remember to tell them that it was my idea.
Got change for a 50?
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.
Not a chance!
Let's see what we got here...
Twenty-five, 50, 60 70, 75 85, 95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
All your security squad's up there...
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us?
Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Here, let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
- Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that?
- I said how are you?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Okay, I'll get on it right now.
I'll have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.
Mr. Callahan?
We still got any G-12 electrodes?
- Yeah, main storeroom.
- Right.
Okay, booster pump, zone one.
- One-ten.
- Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?
I wouldn't like that at all!
The business offices only go up to 80.
From the 81 st floor, here all the way up to 120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 8145...
Say, Bill?
Tune in the main utility room.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
The sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello?
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean...
I guess we've got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both.
Can I?
I don't know.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight.
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
What about that?
It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
Specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay, send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire from a burned-out circuit breaker isn't conclusive.
Maybe not.
But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will, Doug J.D., wait till you see this.
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?
We have an equipment problem.
- No problem in the tower, is there?
- Could be.
Come on.
You're just guessing.
I want to talk to your son-in-law.
I wanna talk to him right away.
- Get Roger Simmons.
-Yes, sir.
I guarantee I'll check this out.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah, a fire.
In this building?
Come on.
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
- The party should've been put off...
- Hold it, Will!
Everybody's overreacting.
Mr. Simmons is out, sir.
Out where?
They don't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'll decide what to do.
- That's okay, isn't it?
- Nope.
Won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it!
This is top priority.
We gotta get these electrical systems on.
Our security program's loused up without them.
Don't go away.
Doug!
Well, what a surprise!
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on, I'll get you a drink.
He must've done something.
My father called.
He hasn't been that upset in years.
Have any idea where he is?
Well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you wanna wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
- Honey.
- Hello.
- What are you drinking these days?
- Nothing, right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a systems failure.
How can that be?
It can't be, theoretically.
Unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours?
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
All the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!
I asked for installations way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
That would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have!
In my office!
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks even if that's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Nonsense.
Be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.
Here you are your original specs.
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
- Susan.
- Hello, Dan.
Good evening.
- How are you, dear?
- Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
I'll meet you out front.
- I'd like to talk to Susan.
- Right.
Find me the architect who designed you and who needs Doug Roberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who.
There are leaders from society and government stars of screen and television.
And now, just arriving, the Honorable Gary Parker chairman of the Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator's in from Washington to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark in a long succession of landmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
...being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. And Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
Later, I wanna ask you a few questions and I expect some straight answers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower tallest building in the world!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
After you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
I've never seen the bridge look like that.
- It's unbelievable!
- Astonishing!
- How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
- Fine, thank you.
Good night.
Shall I leave you a night line?
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Lorrie...
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
We almost missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
Hello.
Hi.
- Promise me something?
- What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
I promise.
We may never love like this again
Don't stop the flow
We can't let go
We may never love like this again
And touch the sky
Though we may try
So while we're here Let's give our all
Release the dreams inside us
And set them free
Oh, while we're here let's leave a mark
There's a candle in the dark
It's here to guide us
We may never love like this again
But through the days
Beyond the haze
I see you reaching out...
- How's the family?
- Fine, thank you.
Good.
Gary?
- Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
- Certainly.
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Politicians don't like surprises.
- Carlos?
- Yes, sir.
- What can I fix you?
- Meet Senator Parker.
- Great pleasure.
- It's an honor, senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
1929?
- That's all you'll drink tonight.
- A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'll ship to Washington.
- Open a bottle, will you?
- Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
I guess you're looking for someone.
I am.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?
- Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
- Susan, tell me...
What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man decides to leave for two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No headhunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
- You must miss your villa.
- Well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
- No false humility, please.
- Oh, shall we?
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco to regain my perspective and my humility and spend more time at the one thing I'm really good at:
The stock market.
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
You better leave it off.
Utility.
Wes.
Doug, I'm up on 83 with Will.
We got a wiring problem.
Overloads could be trouble.
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.
I can't do that.
All the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.
You mean the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
I didn't say all the power, just the overload!
Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81.
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.
- I'll be in 81.
- You got it.
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
Pull it around over here.
Put it all over him.
Come on!
Let's get some water onto that fire.
Turn it on!
Down, down!
Stay low!
Call an ambulance for this man.
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor!
- The fire department?
- On their way.
Get that ambulance.
Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.
All right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
This is 81.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes, right away.
Call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a lot of people up there.
- What?
- Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
An ambulance is coming, but you better think about getting those people down on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but...
Well, then why the urgency?
Urgency?
If fluky wiring in this building caused that fire fires could break out everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 because it can't possibly affect us up here not in this building.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and...
Oh, Jesus!
- The glass tower!
- What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being inside a chimney.
Jesus!
How in the hell did they get here before we did?
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
- Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.
- Eighty-first floor, right?
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
- Set up a Forward Command.
- Got it.
Chief this is Roberts, the architect.
- What do we got here, Kappy?
- Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.
It's bad.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
- Exhaust system?
- Should've reversed automatically.
It must be a motor burnout.
- Sprinklers?
- They're not working on 81.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
- Jim?
- Yes, sir?
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.
Floors have 3 and 1.5-inch outlets.
GPM?
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1000 from 68 to 100 and 500 from there to the roof.
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
- What floor are your plans on?
- 79.
My office.
That's two floors below the fire.
It'll be our Forward Command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
Architects!
Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.
But you keep building them as high as you can.
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?
What about the 81 st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.
Not live-ins.
Businesses.
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.
Those that have are off at night.
I wanna know who they are, not where.
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?
Any wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Any sporting-good manufacturers, like table-tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?
- One tenant list, coming up.
- Thank you.
What do we got?
Elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
- Pipe alleys here?
- One, two, three, four, five.
- This is south?
- South.
Have you got any construction on 81?
Anything that can blow up, like gasoline, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'll be up on 81.
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.
Jack?
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
- I'll be up topside.
- Right.
Jack watch yourself.
Keep it high.
- Looking for me, chief?
- Lf you're Duncan.
I am.
Everything under control?
Gotta move these people out of here.
Now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems we have designed into this building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.
I don't think you're listening.
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.
- I'll do it.
- Hold it, hold it.
Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I could tell them, but you ought to.
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests that the party's being moved down below the fire floor.
Now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now, don't leave this table.
You, I wanna talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
- I most certainly did.
- For God's sake, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire.
If it was caused by what you did, I'll hang you out to dry.
And then I'm going to hang you!
Would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire in one of our storage rooms 50 floors below.
I assure you there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders a purely precautionary procedure we're going to move the party down to the lobby for a while.
And we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators...
Now, ladies and gentlemen there's no reason to rush.
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
- Lisolette!
- Frank!
Lisolette!
- How's it going, chief?
- Better get ready.
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire lapping?
- Are your com lines tested?
- Phone jacks on every floor.
- I'm plugging into your PA system.
- No sweat.
- Emergency setup?
- Battery-powered standby system.
Splice these lines into our two-way communications van.
Sure.
- No problem?
- No problem.
- How long will this take?
- A minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
The fire's lapping up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
What was that?
- Come on!
- The ceiling's going!
Men trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
Pull them out, pull them out!
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!
Battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!
Forward Command, go ahead.
Explosion on 81, fire headed toward elevator banks!
We need more crews up here fast!
- They need relief on 81.
Hit it.
- They're on their way.
Done!
Tell Duncan to stop those Tower Room people from using that express elevator, or somebody'll get killed.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads and some choppers here.
We may need them to get those people down.
Come on, Park.
I'll be on 81.
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.
I don't like how you talk to me.
- You drunk?
- Not yet.
- Then get out of my way!
- You didn't talk like this before.
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?
Shut up and help these people!
- Let me ask, father-in-law...
- Excuse me.
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?
Please!
Please!
Hold everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Move back into the Promenade Room and we'll take you down by the scenic elevator.
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.
And with the probability of short circuits the cars might stop on the floor where the fire is.
So please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there.
For God's sake, get out of there!
Please, back!
It looks bad, Jack.
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
The fire's spreading.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
Firemen, let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out!
Take it down!
Empty all the water out.
Chief, it's out of control.
Bring in another line!
Get another tank!
Angela?
Angela?
Phillip?
Phillip, open the door!
What ideas can I use upstairs to explain where I've been all this time?
Well, what you might do is just walk right up to him and say, "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay but my secretary had an urgent personal problem."
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
He won't.
- You know what astonishes me?
- What?
You make love with a girl and there's no visible evidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
Look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus!
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan?
Right.
- What'd they say?
- Help's on the way.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Please.
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
- They're aware of that.
- She's wearing a purple dress.
- I've got to find her!
- I promise, they'll find her.
Now, only 12 at a time.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
We'll be in the next group, maybe.
It won't be too long.
What's she doing on 87?
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf!
Sure, the kids can hear!
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
You stay there.
I'll get them down!
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
-We'll send them right up.
- Still got people on 87.
I'll get them down.
I'll give you a hand.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
Well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
At least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.
Don't go!
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
You all right?
The mother and the two children are in there.
- Don't worry.
We'll get them out.
- Wait!
Please, Mrs. Mueller!
Please stay back.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
!
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
- Mom, Mom!
- Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
Anybody else?
My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela?
Angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay, Angela.
Thank God!
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
- All right!
- That's it.
Don't crush.
It'll take hours to get everyone down.
Those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs.
- That's 135 floors.
- All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos!
- Yes, sir.
- Help us get this thing open.
Is it stuck?
Here, let me try to kick it.
- I'll call security.
- Yes, sir.
Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
You want it easy, chief?
They should design a survival suit for us like for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Let's go to work.
I need two men up the stairwell to the tower.
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay, you got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?
Glass will be sailing everywhere.
Tell the police to move those barricades four blocks back.
- Got it.
- Let's hit it.
Yo!
Security guard.
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty, almost missed you.
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip!
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip!
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, boy.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip!
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy.
Easy.
Don't look down!
Come on.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had a...
I got up, but I'll have trouble getting down.
Can you help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck, real tight?
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Put her legs down.
Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.
Just hold on tight.
Hold on.
Hold on tight, now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
- Hold on, Angela.
- I've got ahold of you!
Get your arms around my neck!
Thattagirl.
Nurse?
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!
Take it slowly, now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt.
Try to get your hand over there.
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller!
Are you all right?
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God!
We're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on, let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
Inside, security phone on the right.
- Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
- I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
The fire's below us.
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.
It's the copter air-control officer.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.
I'm getting relief for you and your men.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.
Right away.
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs.
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby.
Thank you.
This ain't gonna help any!
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!
It's a fire door.
It's over 2.5 inches thick.
I could crawl through the duct.
Will we be able to go with you?
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right, I'll tell him.
Chief?
- How is it on 65?
- They're containing it.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown.
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold on to me a second.
Hold on!
Christ!
That's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.
- Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
- Not for us.
- Where've you been?
- We had trouble getting here.
The Navy flight commander needs you.
Just walk 65 floors down?
Only five.
A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.
- Got it controlled?
- Getting there.
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike...
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow".
Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another one there!
Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Anybody'll do.
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How...?
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.
- How're you doing?
- We're fine.
Glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
Mrs. Mueller?
It's Mr. Roberts!
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.
Okay, get down low.
- What kind of explosives are you using?
- It's plastic C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here, shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it up here.
Is there gonna be a bang?
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good going, Brian.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
- Hold it down!
- Listen!
I've been informed that there's no possibility of using this stairway to get out.
Now, I'm sorry.
Patty...
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
- I'm getting out.
- Roger, you...
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
- I guess you thought I stood you up.
- It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Can I get you anything else?
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the Peerless Building and get a breeches buoy to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
- Doc?
- Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
- There's no way down.
- Thank God you're all right.
- Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
- I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
- Responsible?
- Feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase lift an eyebrow in the exact same way I see and I hear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.
Right now what I need most is this.
I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
- But you don't know anything about me.
- But I do.
You're penniless you have no villa in the south of France no antiques coming, no paintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But you see, your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively if you don't enjoy cheating them?
I came here to sell you 1000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked or at least disappointed.
But I'm not.
You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
I thought we were building something where people could work, live and be safe.
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials were made because I, as a builder, have a right to make those decisions.
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
- Who is it?
- Chief O'Hallorhan.
What happened?
Part of the central corridor just blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
It's too windy.
We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.
What can we do to help?
Move your combustible material away from the window.
Okay, gotcha.
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.
Jake, give me a hand.
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean if she should have to.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
- Here he is.
- The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Get Roberts.
Get 10 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
- Doug, are they going to land?
- They're gonna try.
We'll send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 100 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
- There may not be time to tell you...
- There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'll be a lot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
Look out!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
Here he is now.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and I...
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
- Sure, what do you want them for?
- I want to try something.
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people out.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
Help me.
If you asked me to go to the North Pole or even the cliffs of Mendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
- Ma'am, I'll take her.
- Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- I'll be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
- You've gotta go.
- I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
All right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
All right, let it go!
Let it go!
All right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!
Explosion above 110 blew the elevator off its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
- How many people in it?
- Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
What're you gonna go?
Flaker.
Flaker!
Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up out of there.
Pull it.
Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, let her go!
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
All right!
There's one in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right, let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
All right, keep it going!
All right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
Come ahead!
I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
- I can't!
- Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
- This is O'Hallorhan.
-We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook and set me down on the scenic elevator.
Then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
You think this'll hold it?
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
- What's your number?
- 68.
47.
Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now.
- You'll be all right.
- Tell my husband I'm all right.
- Tell him I'll be all right.
- I will.
- And I'll see him at home later.
- I will.
Let's go.
Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
Watch the ladder.
Hey, Mike deputy wants to see you.
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 17 or 18 minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'll die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room could definitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
You're crazy.
Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design...
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you...
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation I'll be the last one out of here along with my son-in-law.
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'll kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'll burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line.
Get off!
You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
Let go of me!
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
- Get the hell out of there!
- Go!
Get off.
Chief.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
See you up there.
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts anything you can find!
- Carlos!
- Yes, sir.
Get some knives.
There we go.
For God's sakes, Carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug I never thought this could happen.
Sure.
- How much time you think we got?
- Ten minutes, maybe less.
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
All right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire we'll plug it and splice it into the timer, set it, and it blows.
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
- Got it?
- I got it.
- Good luck.
See you later.
- Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman?
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
- Claiborne!
- What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God that I can stop this from ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'll kill 10,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies until somebody asks us how to build them.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.

-So how was it?
-Good.
-You're gonna go ahead?
-Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying:
"No matter how hot it gets up there during the day...
-... there'snota- -" -"Not a damn thing to do at night. "
What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
Come in the office for a minute.
I got people waiting upstairs.
I wanted to tell you...
... SenatorParker'scoming to the dedication tonight.
He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them.
I'll build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'll never leave.
After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay opened.
-Whatever happened to "hello"?
-Hello.
-How are you?
-Good.
You look like it took.
-Hi, Mr. Roberts.
-Just a second.
We'll miss you.
-Duncan know?
-He's all smiles.
-What electromagnets went in?
-Doug?
-Thompson G-4s.
-Don't you think they should be G-1 2s?
That's what comes from last-minute panic.
I'll fix it.
There's ground water on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in today.
How about Chicago specs?
-Philadelphia?
-In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Who's there?
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
All protein, no bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
I got about a $1 40 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will...
... remembertotellthemthat it was my idea.
Got change for a 50?
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.
Not a chance!
Let's see what we got here... .
Twenty-five, 50, 60...
... 70,75...
... 85,95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
All your security squad's up there... .
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us?
Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Here, let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
-Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that?
-I said how are you?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Okay, I'll get on it right now.
I'll have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.
Mr. Callahan?
We still got any G-1 2 electrodes?
-Yeah, main storeroom.
-Right.
Okay, booster pump, zone one.
-One-ten.
-Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?
I wouldn't like that at all!
The business offices only go up to 80.
From the 81 st floor, here...
... allthewayupto120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 81 45... .
Say, Bill?
Tune in the main utility room.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
The sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello?
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean-
- I guess we've got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both.
Can I?
I don't know.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight.
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
-What about that?
-It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
Specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay, send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire...
... froma burned-outcircuitbreaker isn't conclusive.
Maybe not.
But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will, Doug...
... J.D.,waittillyou see this.
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?
We have an equipment problem.
-No problem in the tower, is there?
-Could be.
Come on.
You're just guessing.
I want to talk to your son-in-law.
I wanna talk to him right away.
-Get Roger Simmons.
-Yes, sir.
I guarantee I'll check this out.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah, a fire.
In this building?
Come on.
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
-The party should've been put off--
-Hold it, Will!
Everybody's overreacting.
-Mr.
Simmons is out, sir.
-Out where?
They don 't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'll decide what to do.
-That's okay, isn't it?
-Nope.
Won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it!
This is top priority.
We gotta get these electrical systems on.
Our security program's loused up without them.
Don't go away.
Doug!
Well, what a surprise!
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on, I'll get you a drink.
He must've done something.
My father called.
He hasn't been that upset in years.
Have any idea where he is?
Well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you wanna wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
-Can I get you a drink?
-No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
-Honey.
-Hello.
-What are you drinking these days?
-Nothing, right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a systems failure.
How can that be?
It can't be, theoretically.
Unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours?
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
All the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!
I asked for installations way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
That would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have!
In my office!
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks...
... evenifthat's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Nonsense.
Be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.
Here you are...
... youroriginalspecs.
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
-Susan.
-Hello, Dan.
Good evening.
-How are you, dear?
-Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
I'll meet you out front.
-I'd like to talk to Susan.
-Right.
Find me the architect who designed you...
... andwhoneedsDougRoberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who.
There are leaders from society and government...
... starsofscreenand television.
And now, just arriving, the Honorable Gary Parker...
... chairmanofthe Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator's in from Washington to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark...
... ina longsuccessionoflandmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
--being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
Later, I wanna ask you a few questions...
... andI expect some straight answers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower...
... tallestbuildingin theworld!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
After you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
I've never seen the bridge look like that.
-It's unbelievable!
-Astonishing!
-How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
-Fine, thank you.
Good night.
Shall I leave you a night line?
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Lorrie... .
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
We almost missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
Hello.
Hi.
-Promise me something?
-What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
I promise.
-How's the family?
-Fine, thank you.
Good.
Gary?
-Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
-Certainly.
-I've got a surprise for you.
-Politicians don't like surprises.
-Carlos?
-Yes, sir.
-What can I fix you?
-Meet Senator Parker.
-Great pleasure.
-It's an honor, senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
1 929?
-That's all you'll drink tonight.
-A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'll ship to Washington.
-Open a bottle, will you?
-Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
I guess you're looking for someone.
I am.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?
-Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
-Susan, tell me... .
What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man...
... decidestoleavefor two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No headhunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
-You must miss your villa.
-Well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
-No false humility, please.
-Oh, shall we?
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco...
... toregainmy perspective and my humility...
... andspendmoretimeattheone thing I'm really good at:
The stock market.
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
You better leave it off.
Utility.
Wes.
Doug, I'm up on 83 with Will.
We got a wiring problem.
Overloads could be trouble.
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.
I can't do that.
All the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.
You mean the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
-Not all the power, just the overload!
-Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81 .
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.
-I'll be in 81 .
-You got it.
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
Pull it around over here.
Put it all over him.
Come on!
Let's get some water onto that fire.
Turn it on!
Down, down!
Stay low!
Call an ambulance for this man.
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor!
-The fire department?
-On their way.
Get that ambulance.
Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.
All right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
This is 81 .
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes, right away.
Call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a lot of people up there.
-What?
-Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
An ambulance is coming, but you better think about...
... gettingthosepeopledown on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but--
Well, then why the urgency?
Urgency?
If fluky wiring in this building caused that fire...
... firescouldbreakout everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 ...
... becauseitcan'tpossibly affect us up here...
... notinthisbuilding.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and--
Oh, Jesus!
-The glass tower!
-What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being inside a chimney.
Jesus!
How in the hell did they get here before we did?
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
-Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.
-Eighty-first floor, right?
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
-Set up a Forward Command.
-Got it.
Chief...
... thisisRoberts,the architect.
-What do we got here, Kappy?
-Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.
It's bad.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
-Exhaust system?
-Should've reversed automatically.
It must be a motor burnout.
-Sprinklers?
-They're not working on 81 .
-Why not?
-I don't know.
-Jim?
-Yes, sir?
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.
-Floors have 3 and 1 .5-inch outlets.
-GPM?
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1 000 from 68 to 1 00...
... and500fromtheretotheroof.
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
-What floor are your plans on?
-79.
My office.
That's two floors below the fire.
It'll be our Forward Command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
Architects!
Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.
But you keep building them as high as you can.
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?
What about the 81 st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.
Not live-ins.
Businesses.
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.
Those that have are off at night.
I wanna know who they are, not where.
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?
Any wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Any sporting-good manufacturers, like table-tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?
-One tenant list, coming up.
-Thank you.
What do we got?
Elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
-Pipe alleys here?
-One, two, three, four, five.
-This is south?
-South.
Have you got any construction on 81 ?
Anything that can blow up, like gasoline, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'll be up on 81 .
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.
Jack?
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
-I'll be up topside.
-Right.
Jack...
... watchyourself.
Keep it high.
-Looking for me, chief?
-If you're Duncan.
I am.
Everything under control?
Gotta move these people out of here.
Now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems...
... wehavedesignedintothis building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.
I don't think you're listening.
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.
-I'll do it.
-Hold it, hold it.
Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I could tell them, but you ought to.
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests...
... thattheparty'sbeingmoveddown below the fire floor.
Now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now, don't leave this table.
You, I wanna talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
-I most certainly did.
-For God's sake, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire.
If it was caused by what you did, I'll hang you out to dry.
And then I'm going to hang you!
Would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen... .
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire...
... inoneof ourstoragerooms...
... 50floorsbelow.
I assure you there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders...
... apurelyprecautionaryprocedure...
... we'regoingto movethe party down to the lobby for a while.
And we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators... .
Now, ladies and gentlemen...
... there'snoreasontorush .
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
-Lisolette!
-Frank!
Lisolette!
-How's it going, chief?
-Better get ready.
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire lapping?
-Are your com lines tested?
-Phone jacks on every floor.
-I'm plugging into your PA system.
-No sweat.
-Emergency setup?
-Battery-powered standby system.
Splice these lines into our two-way communications van.
Sure.
-No problem?
-No problem.
-How long will this take?
-A minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
The fire's lapping up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
What was that?
-Come on!
-The ceiling's going!
Men trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
Pull them out, pull them out!
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!
Battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!
Forward Command, go ahead.
Explosion on 81 , fire headed toward elevator banks!
We need more crews up here fast!
-They need relief on 81 .
Hit it.
-They're on their way.
Done!
Tell Duncan to stop those Tower Room people...
... fromusingthatexpresselevator, or somebody'll get killed.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads and some choppers here.
We may need them to get those people down.
Come on, Park.
I'll be on 81 .
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.
I don't like how you talk to me.
-You drunk?
-Not yet.
-Then get out of my way!
-You didn't talk like this before.
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?
Shut up and help these people!
-Let me ask, father-in-law--
-Excuse me.
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?
Please!
Please!
Hold everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Move back into the Promenade Room...
... andwe'lltakeyou downby the scenic elevator.
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.
And with the probability of short circuits...
... thecarsmightstop on the floor where the fire is.
So please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there.
For God's sake, get out of there!
Please, back!
It looks bad, Jack.
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
The fire's spreading.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
Firemen, let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out!
Take it down!
Empty all the water out.
Chief, it's out of control.
Bring in another line!
Get another tank!
Angela?
Angela?
Phillip?
Phillip, open the door!
What ideas can I use upstairs...
... toexplainwhereI'vebeen all this time?
Well, what you might do is just...
... walkrightup to himand say , "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay...
... butmysecretary had an urgent personal problem. "
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
He won't.
-You know what astonishes me?
-What?
You make love with a girl...
... andthere'sno visibleevidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
Look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus!
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan?
Right.
-What'd they say?
-Help's on the way.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Please.
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
-They're aware of that.
-She's wearing a purple dress.
-I've got to find her!
-I promise, they'll find her.
Now, only 1 2 at a time.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
We'll be in the next group, maybe.
It won't be too long.
What's she doing on 87?
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf!
Sure, the kids can hear!
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
You stay there.
I'll get them down!
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
-We'll send them right up.
-Still got people on 87.
I'll get them down.
I'll give you a hand.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
Well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
At least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 1 00 in 1 0 flat.
Don't go!
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
-You all right?
-The mother and children are in there.
-Don't worry.
We'll get them out.
-Wait!
Please, Mrs. Mueller!
Please stay back.
-What do you think?
-I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
!
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
-Mom, Mom!
-Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
Anybody else?
My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela?
Angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay, Angela.
Thank God!
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
-All right!
-That's it.
Don't crush.
It'll take hours to get everyone down.
Those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs.
-That's 1 35 floors.
-All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos!
-Yes, sir.
-Help us get this thing open.
Is it stuck?
Here, let me try to kick it.
-I'll call security.
-Yes, sir.
Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
You want it easy, chief?
They should design a survival suit for us like for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Let's go to work.
I need two men up the stairwell to the tower.
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay, you got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?
Glass will be sailing everywhere.
Tell the police to move those barricades four blocks back.
-Got it.
-Let's hit it.
Yo!
Security guard.
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty, almost missed you.
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip!
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip!
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, boy.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip!
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy.
Easy.
Don't look down!
Come on.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had a... .
I got up, but I'll have trouble getting down.
Can you help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck, real tight?
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Put her legs down.
Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.
Just hold on tight.
Hold on.
Hold on tight, now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
-Hold on, Angela.
-I've got ahold of you!
Get your arms around my neck!
Thattagirl.
Nurse?
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!
Take it slowly, now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt.
Try to get your hand over there.
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller!
Are you all right?
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God!
We're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on, let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
Inside, security phone on the right.
-Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
-I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
The fire's below us.
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.
It's the copter air-control officer.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.
I'm getting relief for you and your men.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.
Right away.
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs.
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby.
Thank you.
This ain't gonna help any!
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!
It's a fire door.
It's over 2.5 inches thick.
I could crawl through the duct.
Will we be able to go with you?
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 1 35 floors straight down.
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right, I'll tell him.
-How is it on 65?
-They're containing it.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown.
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold on to me a second.
Hold on!
Christ!
That's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.
-Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
-Not for us.
-Where've you been?
-We had trouble getting here.
The Navy flight commander needs you.
Just walk 65 floors down?
Only five.
A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.
-Got it controlled?
-Getting there.
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike... .
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow. " Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another one there!
Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Anybody'll do.
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How--?
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.
-How're you doing?
-We're fine.
Glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
Mrs. Mueller?
It's Mr. Roberts!
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.
Okay, get down low.
-What kind of explosives are you using?
-It's plastic C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here, shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it up here.
Is there gonna be a bang?
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good going, Brian.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
-Hold it down!
-Listen!
I've been informed that there's no possibility...
... ofusingthisstairwaytogetout.
Now, I'm sorry.
Patty... .
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
-I'm getting out.
-Roger, you... .
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
-I guess you thought I stood you up.
-It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Can I get you anything else?
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the Peerless Building...
... andgetabreechesbuoy to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
-Doc?
-Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
-There's no way down.
-Thank God you're all right.
-Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
-I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
-Responsible?
-Feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase...
... liftaneyebrow in the exact same way...
... IseeandIhear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.
Right now...
... whatI needmost...
... isthis.
I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
-But you don't know anything about me.
-But I do.
You're penniless...
... youhaveno villa in the south of France...
... noantiquescoming,nopaintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But you see, your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively...
... ifyoudon'tenjoycheatingthem?
I came here to sell you 1 000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked...
... oratleastdisappointed.
-But I'm not.
-You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
I thought we were building something...
... wherepeoplecouldwork, live and be safe.
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials...
... weremadebecauseI,asabuilder, have a right to make those decisions.
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
-Who is it?
-Chief O'Hallorhan.
-What happened?
-Part of the central corridor just blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
It's too windy.
We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.
What can we do to help?
Move your combustible material away from the window.
Okay, gotcha.
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.
Jake, give me a hand.
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean...
... ifsheshouldhaveto.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
-Here he is.
-The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Get Roberts.
Get 1 0 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
-Doug, are they going to land?
-They're gonna try.
We'll send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 100 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
-There may not be time to tell you--
-There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'll be a lot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
Look out!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
Here he is now.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and l--
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
-Sure, what do you want them for?
-I want to try something.
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 1 2 people out.
Which 1 2?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
Help me.
If you asked me to go to the North Pole...
... oreventhecliffsofMendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
-Ma'am, I'll take her.
-Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
-I'll meet you in the lobby.
-I'll be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
-You've gotta go.
-I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
All right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
All right, let it go!
Let it go!
All right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!
Explosion above 1 1 0...
... blewtheelevatoroff its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
-How many people in it?
-Loaded.
I'd say about 1 2.
What're you gonna go?
Flaker.
-Flaker!
-Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up out of there.
Pull it.
Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, let her go!
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
All right!
There's one in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right, let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
All right, keep it going!
All right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
-Come ahead!
-I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
-I can't!
-Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
-This is O'Hallorhan.
-We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook...
... andsetme downonthe scenic elevator.
Then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
You think this'll hold it?
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
-What's your number?
-68.
47.
Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now.
-You'll be all right.
-Tell my husband I'm all right.
-Tell him I'll be all right.
-I will.
-And I'll see him at home later.
-I will.
Let's go.
Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
Watch the ladder.
Hey, Mike...
... deputywantsto seeyou .
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 1 7 or 1 8 minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'll die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room...
... coulddefinitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1 ,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
-You're crazy.
-Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design--
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you... .
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation...
... I'llbethelastoneoutof here along with my son-in-law.
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 1 5 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'll kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'll burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 1 5 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line.
Get off!
-You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
-Let go of me!
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
-Get the hell out of there!
-Go!
Get off.
Chief.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
See you up there.
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts...
... anythingyoucanfind!
-Carlos!
-Yes, sir.
Get some knives.
There we go.
For God's sakes, Carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug...
... Ineverthoughtthiscouldhappen.
Sure.
-How much time you think we got?
-Ten minutes, maybe less.
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
All right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire...
... we'llplugit andspliceitinto the timer, set it, and it blows.
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
-Got it?
-I got it.
-Good luck.
See you later.
-Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman?
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
-Claiborne!
-What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God...
... thatI canstopthisfrom ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'll kill 1 0,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies...
... untilsomebodyasksus...
... howtobuildthem.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it!
:
D
- So how was it?
- Good.
- You're gonna go ahead?
- Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying:
"No matter how hot it gets up there during the day there's not a..." - "Not a damn thing to do at night".
What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
Come in the office for a minute.
I got people waiting upstairs.
I wanted to tell you Senator Parker's coming to the dedication tonight.
He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them.
I'll build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'll never leave.
After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay opened.
Whatever happened to "hello"?
Hello.
- How are you?
- Good.
You look like it took.
Hi, Mr. Roberts.
Just a second.
We'll miss you.
- Duncan know?
- He's all smiles.
- What electromagnets went in?
- Doug?
Thompson G-4s.
Don't you think it should've been G-12s?
That's what comes from last-minute panic.
I'll fix it.
There's ground water on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in today.
How about Chicago specs?
- Philadelphia?
- In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Who's there?
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
All protein, no bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
I got about a $140 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will remember to tell them that it was my idea.
Got change for a 50?
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.
Not a chance!
Let's see what we got here...
Twenty-five, 50, 60 70, 75 85, 95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
All your security squad's up there...
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us?
Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Here, let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
- Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that?
- I said how are you?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Okay, I'll get on it right now.
I'll have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.
Mr. Callahan?
We still got any G-12 electrodes?
- Yeah, main storeroom.
- Right.
Okay, booster pump, zone one.
- One-ten.
- Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?
I wouldn't like that at all!
The business offices only go up to 80.
From the 81 st floor, here all the way up to 120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 8145...
Say, Bill?
Tune in the main utility room.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
The sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello?
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean...
I guess we've got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both.
Can I?
I don't know.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight.
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
What about that?
It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
Specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay, send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire from a burned-out circuit breaker isn't conclusive.
Maybe not.
But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will, Doug J.D., wait till you see this.
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?
We have an equipment problem.
- No problem in the tower, is there?
- Could be.
Come on.
You're just guessing.
I want to talk to your son-in-law.
I wanna talk to him right away.
- Get Roger Simmons.
-Yes, sir.
I guarantee I'll check this out.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah, a fire.
In this building?
Come on.
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
- The party should've been put off...
- Hold it, Will!
Everybody's overreacting.
Mr. Simmons is out, sir.
Out where?
They don't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'll decide what to do.
- That's okay, isn't it?
- Nope.
Won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it!
This is top priority.
We gotta get these electrical systems on.
Our security program's loused up without them.
Don't go away.
Doug!
Well, what a surprise!
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on, I'll get you a drink.
He must've done something.
My father called.
He hasn't been that upset in years.
Have any idea where he is?
Well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you wanna wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
- Honey.
- Hello.
- What are you drinking these days?
- Nothing, right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a systems failure.
How can that be?
It can't be, theoretically.
Unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours?
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
All the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!
I asked for installations way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
That would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have!
In my office!
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks even if that's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Nonsense.
Be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.
Here you are your original specs.
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
- Susan.
- Hello, Dan.
Good evening.
- How are you, dear?
- Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
I'll meet you out front.
- I'd like to talk to Susan.
- Right.
Find me the architect who designed you and who needs Doug Roberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who.
There are leaders from society and government stars of screen and television.
And now, just arriving, the Honorable Gary Parker chairman of the Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator's in from Washington to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark in a long succession of landmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
...being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. And Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
Later, I wanna ask you a few questions and I expect some straight answers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower tallest building in the world!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
After you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
I've never seen the bridge look like that.
- It's unbelievable!
- Astonishing!
- How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
- Fine, thank you.
Good night.
Shall I leave you a night line?
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Lorrie...
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
We almost missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
Hello.
Hi.
- Promise me something?
- What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
I promise.
We may never love like this again
Don't stop the flow
We can't let go
We may never love like this again
And touch the sky
Though we may try
So while we're here Let's give our all
Release the dreams inside us
And set them free
Oh, while we're here let's leave a mark
There's a candle in the dark
It's here to guide us
We may never love like this again
But through the days
Beyond the haze
I see you reaching out...
- How's the family?
- Fine, thank you.
Good.
Gary?
- Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
- Certainly.
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Politicians don't like surprises.
- Carlos?
- Yes, sir.
- What can I fix you?
- Meet Senator Parker.
- Great pleasure.
- It's an honor, senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
1929?
- That's all you'll drink tonight.
- A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'll ship to Washington.
- Open a bottle, will you?
- Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
I guess you're looking for someone.
I am.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?
- Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
- Susan, tell me...
What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man decides to leave for two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No headhunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
- You must miss your villa.
- Well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
- No false humility, please.
- Oh, shall we?
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco to regain my perspective and my humility and spend more time at the one thing I'm really good at:
The stock market.
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
You better leave it off.
Utility.
Wes.
Doug, I'm up on 83 with Will.
We got a wiring problem.
Overloads could be trouble.
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.
I can't do that.
All the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.
You mean the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
I didn't say all the power, just the overload!
Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81.
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.
- I'll be in 81.
- You got it.
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
Pull it around over here.
Put it all over him.
Come on!
Let's get some water onto that fire.
Turn it on!
Down, down!
Stay low!
Call an ambulance for this man.
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor!
- The fire department?
- On their way.
Get that ambulance.
Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.
All right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
This is 81.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes, right away.
Call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a lot of people up there.
- What?
- Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
An ambulance is coming, but you better think about getting those people down on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but...
Well, then why the urgency?
Urgency?
If fluky wiring in this building caused that fire fires could break out everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 because it can't possibly affect us up here not in this building.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and...
Oh, Jesus!
- The glass tower!
- What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being inside a chimney.
Jesus!
How in the hell did they get here before we did?
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
- Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.
- Eighty-first floor, right?
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
- Set up a Forward Command.
- Got it.
Chief this is Roberts, the architect.
- What do we got here, Kappy?
- Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.
It's bad.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
- Exhaust system?
- Should've reversed automatically.
It must be a motor burnout.
- Sprinklers?
- They're not working on 81.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
- Jim?
- Yes, sir?
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.
Floors have 3 and 1.5-inch outlets.
GPM?
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1000 from 68 to 100 and 500 from there to the roof.
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
- What floor are your plans on?
- 79.
My office.
That's two floors below the fire.
It'll be our Forward Command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
Architects!
Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.
But you keep building them as high as you can.
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?
What about the 81 st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.
Not live-ins.
Businesses.
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.
Those that have are off at night.
I wanna know who they are, not where.
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?
Any wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Any sporting-good manufacturers, like table-tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?
- One tenant list, coming up.
- Thank you.
What do we got?
Elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
- Pipe alleys here?
- One, two, three, four, five.
- This is south?
- South.
Have you got any construction on 81?
Anything that can blow up, like gasoline, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'll be up on 81.
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.
Jack?
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
- I'll be up topside.
- Right.
Jack watch yourself.
Keep it high.
- Looking for me, chief?
- Lf you're Duncan.
I am.
Everything under control?
Gotta move these people out of here.
Now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems we have designed into this building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.
I don't think you're listening.
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.
- I'll do it.
- Hold it, hold it.
Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I could tell them, but you ought to.
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests that the party's being moved down below the fire floor.
Now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now, don't leave this table.
You, I wanna talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
- I most certainly did.
- For God's sake, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire.
If it was caused by what you did, I'll hang you out to dry.
And then I'm going to hang you!
Would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire in one of our storage rooms 50 floors below.
I assure you there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders a purely precautionary procedure we're going to move the party down to the lobby for a while.
And we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators...
Now, ladies and gentlemen there's no reason to rush.
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
- Lisolette!
- Frank!
Lisolette!
- How's it going, chief?
- Better get ready.
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire lapping?
- Are your com lines tested?
- Phone jacks on every floor.
- I'm plugging into your PA system.
- No sweat.
- Emergency setup?
- Battery-powered standby system.
Splice these lines into our two-way communications van.
Sure.
- No problem?
- No problem.
- How long will this take?
- A minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
The fire's lapping up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
What was that?
- Come on!
- The ceiling's going!
Men trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
Pull them out, pull them out!
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!
Battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!
Forward Command, go ahead.
Explosion on 81, fire headed toward elevator banks!
We need more crews up here fast!
- They need relief on 81.
Hit it.
- They're on their way.
Done!
Tell Duncan to stop those Tower Room people from using that express elevator, or somebody'll get killed.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads and some choppers here.
We may need them to get those people down.
Come on, Park.
I'll be on 81.
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.
I don't like how you talk to me.
- You drunk?
- Not yet.
- Then get out of my way!
- You didn't talk like this before.
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?
Shut up and help these people!
- Let me ask, father-in-law...
- Excuse me.
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?
Please!
Please!
Hold everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Move back into the Promenade Room and we'll take you down by the scenic elevator.
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.
And with the probability of short circuits the cars might stop on the floor where the fire is.
So please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there.
For God's sake, get out of there!
Please, back!
It looks bad, Jack.
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
The fire's spreading.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
Firemen, let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out!
Take it down!
Empty all the water out.
Chief, it's out of control.
Bring in another line!
Get another tank!
Angela?
Angela?
Phillip?
Phillip, open the door!
What ideas can I use upstairs to explain where I've been all this time?
Well, what you might do is just walk right up to him and say, "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay but my secretary had an urgent personal problem."
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
He won't.
- You know what astonishes me?
- What?
You make love with a girl and there's no visible evidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
Look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus!
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan?
Right.
- What'd they say?
- Help's on the way.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Please.
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
- They're aware of that.
- She's wearing a purple dress.
- I've got to find her!
- I promise, they'll find her.
Now, only 12 at a time.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
We'll be in the next group, maybe.
It won't be too long.
What's she doing on 87?
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf!
Sure, the kids can hear!
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
You stay there.
I'll get them down!
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
-We'll send them right up.
- Still got people on 87.
I'll get them down.
I'll give you a hand.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
Well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
At least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.
Don't go!
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
You all right?
The mother and the two children are in there.
- Don't worry.
We'll get them out.
- Wait!
Please, Mrs. Mueller!
Please stay back.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
!
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
- Mom, Mom!
- Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
Anybody else?
My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela?
Angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay, Angela.
Thank God!
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
- All right!
- That's it.
Don't crush.
It'll take hours to get everyone down.
Those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs.
- That's 135 floors.
- All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos!
- Yes, sir.
- Help us get this thing open.
Is it stuck?
Here, let me try to kick it.
- I'll call security.
- Yes, sir.
Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
You want it easy, chief?
They should design a survival suit for us like for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Let's go to work.
I need two men up the stairwell to the tower.
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay, you got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?
Glass will be sailing everywhere.
Tell the police to move those barricades four blocks back.
- Got it.
- Let's hit it.
Yo!
Security guard.
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty, almost missed you.
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip!
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip!
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, boy.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip!
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy.
Easy.
Don't look down!
Come on.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had a...
I got up, but I'll have trouble getting down.
Can you help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck, real tight?
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Put her legs down.
Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.
Just hold on tight.
Hold on.
Hold on tight, now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
- Hold on, Angela.
- I've got ahold of you!
Get your arms around my neck!
Thattagirl.
Nurse?
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!
Take it slowly, now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt.
Try to get your hand over there.
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller!
Are you all right?
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God!
We're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on, let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
Inside, security phone on the right.
- Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
- I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
The fire's below us.
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.
It's the copter air-control officer.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.
I'm getting relief for you and your men.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.
Right away.
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs.
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby.
Thank you.
This ain't gonna help any!
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!
It's a fire door.
It's over 2.5 inches thick.
I could crawl through the duct.
Will we be able to go with you?
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right, I'll tell him.
Chief?
- How is it on 65?
- They're containing it.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown.
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold on to me a second.
Hold on!
Christ!
That's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.
- Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
- Not for us.
- Where've you been?
- We had trouble getting here.
The Navy flight commander needs you.
Just walk 65 floors down?
Only five.
A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.
- Got it controlled?
- Getting there.
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike...
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow".
Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another one there!
Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Anybody'll do.
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How...?
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.
- How're you doing?
- We're fine.
Glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
Mrs. Mueller?
It's Mr. Roberts!
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.
Okay, get down low.
- What kind of explosives are you using?
- It's plastic C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here, shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it up here.
Is there gonna be a bang?
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good going, Brian.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
- Hold it down!
- Listen!
I've been informed that there's no possibility of using this stairway to get out.
Now, I'm sorry.
Patty...
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
- I'm getting out.
- Roger, you...
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
- I guess you thought I stood you up.
- It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Can I get you anything else?
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the Peerless Building and get a breeches buoy to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
- Doc?
- Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
- There's no way down.
- Thank God you're all right.
- Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
- I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
- Responsible?
- Feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase lift an eyebrow in the exact same way I see and I hear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.
Right now what I need most is this.
I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
- But you don't know anything about me.
- But I do.
You're penniless you have no villa in the south of France no antiques coming, no paintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But you see, your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively if you don't enjoy cheating them?
I came here to sell you 1000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked or at least disappointed.
But I'm not.
You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
I thought we were building something where people could work, live and be safe.
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials were made because I, as a builder, have a right to make those decisions.
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
- Who is it?
- Chief O'Hallorhan.
What happened?
Part of the central corridor just blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
It's too windy.
We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.
What can we do to help?
Move your combustible material away from the window.
Okay, gotcha.
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.
Jake, give me a hand.
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean if she should have to.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
- Here he is.
- The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Get Roberts.
Get 10 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
- Doug, are they going to land?
- They're gonna try.
We'll send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 100 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
- There may not be time to tell you...
- There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'll be a lot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
Look out!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
Here he is now.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and I...
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
- Sure, what do you want them for?
- I want to try something.
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people out.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
Help me.
If you asked me to go to the North Pole or even the cliffs of Mendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
- Ma'am, I'll take her.
- Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- I'll be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
- You've gotta go.
- I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
All right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
All right, let it go!
Let it go!
All right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!
Explosion above 110 blew the elevator off its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
- How many people in it?
- Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
What're you gonna go?
Flaker.
Flaker!
Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up out of there.
Pull it.
Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, let her go!
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
All right!
There's one in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right, let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
All right, keep it going!
All right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
Come ahead!
I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
- I can't!
- Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
- This is O'Hallorhan.
-We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook and set me down on the scenic elevator.
Then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
You think this'll hold it?
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
- What's your number?
- 68.
47.
Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now.
- You'll be all right.
- Tell my husband I'm all right.
- Tell him I'll be all right.
- I will.
- And I'll see him at home later.
- I will.
Let's go.
Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
Watch the ladder.
Hey, Mike deputy wants to see you.
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 17 or 18 minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'll die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room could definitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
You're crazy.
Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design...
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you...
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation I'll be the last one out of here along with my son-in-law.
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'll kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'll burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line.
Get off!
You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
Let go of me!
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
- Get the hell out of there!
- Go!
Get off.
Chief.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
See you up there.
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts anything you can find!
- Carlos!
- Yes, sir.
Get some knives.
There we go.
For God's sakes, Carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug I never thought this could happen.
Sure.
- How much time you think we got?
- Ten minutes, maybe less.
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
All right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire we'll plug it and splice it into the timer, set it, and it blows.
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
- Got it?
- I got it.
- Good luck.
See you later.
- Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman?
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
- Claiborne!
- What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God that I can stop this from ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'll kill 10,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies until somebody asks us how to build them.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.

-So how was it?
-Good.
-You're gonna go ahead?
-Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying:
"No matter how hot it gets up there during the day...
-...there's not a--" -"Not a damn thing to do at night. "
What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
Come in the office for a minute.
I got people waiting upstairs.
I wanted to tell you Senator Parker's coming to the dedication tonight.
He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them.
I'll build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'll never leave.
After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay opened.
-Whatever happened to "hello"?
-Hello.
-How are you?
-Good.
You look like it took.
-Hi, Mr. Roberts.
-Just a second.
We'll miss you.
-Duncan know?
-He's all smiles.
-What electromagnets went in?
-Doug?
-Thompson G-4s.
-Don't you think they should be G-12s?
That's what comes from last-minute panic.
I'll fix it.
There's ground water on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in today.
How about Chicago specs?
-Philadelphia?
-In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Who's there?
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
All protein, no bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
I got about a $140 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will remember to tell them that it was my idea.
Got change for a 50?
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.
Not a chance!
Let's see what we got here... .
Twenty-five, 50, 60 70, 75 85, 95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
All your security squad's up there... .
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us?
Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Here, let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
-Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that?
-I said how are you?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Okay, I'll get on it right now.
I'll have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.
Mr. Callahan?
We still got any G-12 electrodes?
-Yeah, main storeroom.
-Right.
Okay, booster pump, zone one.
-One-ten.
-Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?
I wouldn't like that at all!
The business offices only go up to 80.
From the 81 st floor, here all the way up to 120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 8145... .
Say, Bill?
Tune in the main utility room.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
The sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello?
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean-
- I guess we've got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both.
Can I?
I don't know.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight.
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
-What about that?
-It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
Specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay, send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire from a burned-out circuit breaker isn't conclusive.
Maybe not.
But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will, Doug J.D., wait till you see this.
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?
We have an equipment problem.
-No problem in the tower, is there?
-Could be.
Come on.
You're just guessing.
I want to talk to your son-in-law.
I wanna talk to him right away.
-Get Roger Simmons.
-Yes, sir.
I guarantee I'll check this out.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah, a fire.
In this building?
Come on.
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
-The party should've been put off--
-Hold it, Will!
Everybody's overreacting.
-Mr.
Simmons is out, sir.
-Out where?
They don 't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'll decide what to do.
-That's okay, isn't it?
-Nope.
Won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it!
This is top priority.
We gotta get these electrical systems on.
Our security program's loused up without them.
Don't go away.
Doug!
Well, what a surprise!
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on, I'll get you a drink.
He must've done something.
My father called.
He hasn't been that upset in years.
Have any idea where he is?
Well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you wanna wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
-Can I get you a drink?
-No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
-Honey.
-Hello.
-What are you drinking these days?
-Nothing, right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a systems failure.
How can that be?
It can't be, theoretically.
Unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours?
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
All the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!
I asked for installations way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
That would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have!
In my office!
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks even if that's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Nonsense.
Be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.
Here you are your original specs.
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
-Susan.
-Hello, Dan.
Good evening.
-How are you, dear?
-Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
I'll meet you out front.
-I'd like to talk to Susan.
-Right.
Find me the architect who designed you and who needs Doug Roberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who.
There are leaders from society and government stars of screen and television.
And now, just arriving, the Honorable Gary Parker chairman of the Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator's in from Washington to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark in a long succession of landmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
--being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
Later, I wanna ask you a few questions and I expect some straight answers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower tallest building in the world!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
After you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
I've never seen the bridge look like that.
-It's unbelievable!
-Astonishing!
-How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
-Fine, thank you.
Good night.
Shall I leave you a night line?
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Lorrie... .
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
We almost missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
Hello.
Hi.
-Promise me something?
-What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
I promise.
-How's the family?
-Fine, thank you.
Good.
Gary?
-Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
-Certainly.
-I've got a surprise for you.
-Politicians don't like surprises.
-Carlos?
-Yes, sir.
-What can I fix you?
-Meet Senator Parker.
-Great pleasure.
-It's an honor, senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
1929?
-That's all you'll drink tonight.
-A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'll ship to Washington.
-Open a bottle, will you?
-Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
I guess you're looking for someone.
I am.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?
-Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
-Susan, tell me... .
What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man decides to leave for two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No headhunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
-You must miss your villa.
-Well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
-No false humility, please.
-Oh, shall we?
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco to regain my perspective and my humility and spend more time at the one thing I'm really good at:
The stock market.
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
You better leave it off.
Utility.
Wes.
Doug, I'm up on 83 with Will.
We got a wiring problem.
Overloads could be trouble.
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.
I can't do that.
All the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.
You mean the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
-Not all the power, just the overload!
-Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81.
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.
-I'll be in 81.
-You got it.
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
Pull it around over here.
Put it all over him.
Come on!
Let's get some water onto that fire.
Turn it on!
Down, down!
Stay low!
Call an ambulance for this man.
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor!
-The fire department?
-On their way.
Get that ambulance.
Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.
All right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
This is 81.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes, right away.
Call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a lot of people up there.
-What?
-Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
An ambulance is coming, but you better think about getting those people down on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but--
Well, then why the urgency?
Urgency?
If fluky wiring in this building caused that fire fires could break out everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 because it can't possibly affect us up here not in this building.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and--
Oh, Jesus!
-The glass tower!
-What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being inside a chimney.
Jesus!
How in the hell did they get here before we did?
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
-Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.
-Eighty-first floor, right?
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
-Set up a Forward Command.
-Got it.
Chief this is Roberts, the architect.
-What do we got here, Kappy?
-Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.
It's bad.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
-Exhaust system?
-Should've reversed automatically.
It must be a motor burnout.
-Sprinklers?
-They're not working on 81.
-Why not?
-I don't know.
-Jim?
-Yes, sir?
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.
-Floors have 3 and 1.5-inch outlets.
-GPM?
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1,000 from 68 to 100 and 500 from there to the roof.
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
-What floor are your plans on?
-79.
My office.
That's two floors below the fire.
It'll be our Forward Command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
Architects!
Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.
But you keep building them as high as you can.
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?
What about the 81st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.
Not live-ins.
Businesses.
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.
Those that have are off at night.
I wanna know who they are, not where.
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?
Any wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Any sporting-good manufacturers, like table-tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?
-One tenant list, coming up.
-Thank you.
What do we got?
Elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
-Pipe alleys here?
-One, two, three, four, five.
-This is south?
-South.
Have you got any construction on 81?
Anything that can blow up, like gasoline, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'll be up on 81.
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.
Jack?
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
-I'll be up topside.
-Right.
Jack watch yourself.
Keep it high.
-Looking for me, chief?
-If you're Duncan.
I am.
Everything under control?
Gotta move these people out of here.
Now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems we have designed into this building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.
I don't think you're listening.
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.
-I'll do it.
-Hold it, hold it.
Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I could tell them, but you ought to.
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests that the party's being moved down below the fire floor.
Now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now, don't leave this table.
You, I wanna talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
-I most certainly did.
-For God's sake, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire.
If it was caused by what you did, I'll hang you out to dry.
And then I'm going to hang you!
Would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen... .
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire in one of our storage rooms 50 floors below.
I assure you there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders a purely precautionary procedure we're going to move the party down to the lobby for a while.
And we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators... .
Now, ladies and gentlemen there's no reason to rush.
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
-Lisolette!
-Frank!
Lisolette!
-How's it going, chief?
-Better get ready.
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire lapping?
-Are your com lines tested?
-Phone jacks on every floor.
-I'm plugging into your PA system.
-No sweat.
-Emergency setup?
-Battery-powered standby system.
Splice these lines into our two-way communications van.
Sure.
-No problem?
-No problem.
-How long will this take?
-A minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
The fire's lapping up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
What was that?
-Come on!
-The ceiling's going!
Men trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
Pull them out, pull them out!
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!
Battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!
Forward Command, go ahead.
Explosion on 81, fire headed toward elevator banks!
We need more crews up here fast!
-They need relief on 81.
Hit it.
-They're on their way.
Done!
Tell Duncan to stop those Tower Room people from using that express elevator, or somebody'll get killed.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads and some choppers here.
We may need them to get those people down.
Come on, Park.
I'll be on 81.
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.
I don't like how you talk to me.
-You drunk?
-Not yet.
-Then get out of my way!
-You didn't talk like this before.
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?
Shut up and help these people!
-Let me ask, father-in-law--
-Excuse me.
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?
Please!
Please!
Hold everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Move back into the Promenade Room and we'll take you down by the scenic elevator.
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.
And with the probability of short circuits the cars might stop on the floor where the fire is.
So please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there.
For God's sake, get out of there!
Please, back!
It looks bad, Jack.
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
The fire's spreading.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
Firemen, let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out!
Take it down!
Empty all the water out.
Chief, it's out of control.
Bring in another line!
Get another tank!
Angela?
Angela?
Phillip?
Phillip, open the door!
What ideas can I use upstairs to explain where I've been all this time?
Well, what you might do is just walk right up to him and say, "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay but my secretary had an urgent personal problem. "
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
He won't.
-You know what astonishes me?
-What?
You make love with a girl and there's no visible evidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
Look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus!
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan?
Right.
-What'd they say?
-Help's on the way.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Please.
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
-They're aware of that.
-She's wearing a purple dress.
-I've got to find her!
-I promise, they'll find her.
Now, only 12 at a time.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
We'll be in the next group, maybe.
It won't be too long.
What's she doing on 87?
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf!
Sure, the kids can hear!
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
You stay there.
I'll get them down!
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
-We'll send them right up.
-Still got people on 87.
I'll get them down.
I'll give you a hand.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
Well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
At least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.
Don't go!
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
-You all right?
-The mother and children are in there.
-Don't worry.
We'll get them out.
-Wait!
Please, Mrs. Mueller!
Please stay back.
-What do you think?
-I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
!
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
-Mom, Mom!
-Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
Anybody else?
My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela?
Angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay, Angela.
Thank God!
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
-All right!
-That's it.
Don't crush.
It'll take hours to get everyone down.
Those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs.
-That's 135 floors.
-All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos!
-Yes, sir.
-Help us get this thing open.
Is it stuck?
Here, let me try to kick it.
-I'll call security.
-Yes, sir.
Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
You want it easy, chief?
They should design a survival suit for us like for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Let's go to work.
I need two men up the stairwell to the tower.
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay, you got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?
Glass will be sailing everywhere.
Tell the police to move those barricades four blocks back.
-Got it.
-Let's hit it.
Yo!
Security guard.
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty, almost missed you.
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip!
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip!
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, boy.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip!
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy.
Easy.
Don't look down!
Come on.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had a... .
I got up, but I'll have trouble getting down.
Can you help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck, real tight?
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Put her legs down.
Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.
Just hold on tight.
Hold on.
Hold on tight, now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
-Hold on, Angela.
-I've got ahold of you!
Get your arms around my neck!
Thattagirl.
Nurse?
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!
Take it slowly, now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt.
Try to get your hand over there.
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller!
Are you all right?
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God!
We're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on, let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
Inside, security phone on the right.
-Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
-I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
The fire's below us.
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.
It's the copter air-control officer.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.
I'm getting relief for you and your men.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.
Right away.
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs.
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby.
Thank you.
This ain't gonna help any!
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!
It's a fire door.
It's over 2.5 inches thick.
I could crawl through the duct.
Will we be able to go with you?
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right, I'll tell him.
-How is it on 65?
-They're containing it.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown.
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold on to me a second.
Hold on!
Christ!
That's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.
-Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
-Not for us.
-Where've you been?
-We had trouble getting here.
The Navy flight commander needs you.
Just walk 65 floors down?
Only five.
A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.
-Got it controlled?
-Getting there.
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike... .
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow. " Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another one there!
Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Anybody'll do.
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How--?
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.
-How're you doing?
-We're fine.
Glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
Mrs. Mueller?
It's Mr. Roberts!
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.
Okay, get down low.
-What kind of explosives are you using?
-It's plastic C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here, shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it up here.
Is there gonna be a bang?
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good going, Brian.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
-Hold it down!
-Listen!
I've been informed that there's no possibility of using this stairway to get out.
Now, I'm sorry.
Patty... .
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
-I'm getting out.
-Roger, you... .
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
-I guess you thought I stood you up.
-It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Can I get you anything else?
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the Peerless Building and get a breeches buoy to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
-Doc?
-Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
-There's no way down.
-Thank God you're all right.
-Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
-I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
-Responsible?
-Feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase lift an eyebrow in the exact same way I see and I hear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.
Right now what I need most is this.
I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
-But you don't know anything about me.
-But I do.
You're penniless you have no villa in the south of France no antiques coming, no paintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But you see, your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively if you don't enjoy cheating them?
I came here to sell you 1 000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked or at least disappointed.
-But I'm not.
-You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
I thought we were building something where people could work, live and be safe.
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials were made because I, as a builder, have a right to make those decisions.
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
-Who is it?
-Chief O'Hallorhan.
-What happened?
-Part of the central corridor just blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
It's too windy.
We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.
What can we do to help?
Move your combustible material away from the window.
Okay, gotcha.
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.
Jake, give me a hand.
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean if she should have to.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
-Here he is.
-The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Get Roberts.
Get 10 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
-Doug, are they going to land?
-They're gonna try.
We'll send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 100 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
-There may not be time to tell you--
-There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'll be a lot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
Look out!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
Here he is now.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and l--
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
-Sure, what do you want them for?
-I want to try something.
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people out.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
Help me.
If you asked me to go to the North Pole or even the cliffs of Mendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
-Ma'am, I'll take her.
-Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
-I'll meet you in the lobby.
-I'll be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
-You've gotta go.
-I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
All right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
All right, let it go!
Let it go!
All right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!
Explosion above 110 blew the elevator off its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
-How many people in it?
-Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
What're you gonna go?
Flaker.
-Flaker!
-Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up out of there.
Pull it.
Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, let her go!
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
All right!
There's one in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right, let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
All right, keep it going!
All right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
-Come ahead!
-I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
-I can't!
-Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
-This is O'Hallorhan.
-We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook and set me down on the scenic elevator.
Then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
You think this'll hold it?
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
-What's your number?
-68.
47.
Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now.
-You'll be all right.
-Tell my husband I'm all right.
-Tell him I'll be all right.
-I will.
-And I'll see him at home later.
-I will.
Let's go.
Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
Watch the ladder.
Hey, Mike deputy wants to see you.
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 17 or 18 minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'll die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room could definitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
-You're crazy.
-Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design--
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you... .
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation I'll be the last one out of here along with my son-in-law.
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'll kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'll burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line.
Get off!
-You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
-Let go of me!
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
-Get the hell out of there!
-Go!
Get off.
Chief.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
See you up there.
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts anything you can find!
-Carlos!
-Yes, sir.
Get some knives.
There we go.
For God's sakes, Carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug I never thought this could happen.
Sure.
-How much time you think we got?
-Ten minutes, maybe less.
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
All right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire we'll plug it and splice it into the timer, set it, and it blows.
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
-Got it?
-I got it.
-Good luck.
See you later.
-Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman?
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
-Claiborne!
-What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God that I can stop this from ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'll kill 1 0,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies until somebody asks us how to build them.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.
-So how was it?
-Good.
-You're gonna go ahead?
-Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying:
"No matter how hot it gets up there during the day...
-... there'snota- -" -"Not a damn thing to do at night. "
What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
Come in the office for a minute.
I got people waiting upstairs.
I wanted to tell you...
... SenatorParker'scoming to the dedication tonight.
He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them.
I'll build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'll never leave.
After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay opened.
-Whatever happened to "hello"?
-Hello.
-How are you?
-Good.
You look like it took.
-Hi, Mr. Roberts.
-Just a second.
We'll miss you.
-Duncan know?
-He's all smiles.
-What electromagnets went in?
-Doug?
-Thompson G-4s.
-Don't you think they should be G-12s?
That's what comes from last-minute panic.
I'll fix it.
There's ground water on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in today.
How about Chicago specs?
-Philadelphia?
-In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Who's there?
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
All protein, no bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
I got about a $140 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will...
... remembertotellthemthat it was my idea.
Got change for a 50?
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.
Not a chance!
Let's see what we got here... .
Twenty-five, 50, 60...
... 70,75...
... 85,95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
All your security squad's up there... .
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us?
Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Here, let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
-Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that?
-I said how are you?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Okay, I'll get on it right now.
I'll have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.
Mr. Callahan?
We still got any G-12 electrodes?
-Yeah, main storeroom.
-Right.
Okay, booster pump, zone one.
-One-ten.
-Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?
I wouldn't like that at all!
The business offices only go up to 80.
From the 81 st floor, here...
... allthewayupto120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 8145... .
Say, Bill?
Tune in the main utility room.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
The sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello?
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean-
- I guess we've got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both.
Can I?
I don't know.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight.
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
-What about that?
-It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
Specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay, send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire...
... froma burned-outcircuitbreaker isn't conclusive.
Maybe not.
But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will, Doug...
... J.D.,waittillyou see this.
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?
We have an equipment problem.
-No problem in the tower, is there?
-Could be.
Come on.
You're just guessing.
I want to talk to your son-in-law.
I wanna talk to him right away.
-Get Roger Simmons.
-Yes, sir.
I guarantee I'll check this out.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah, a fire.
In this building?
Come on.
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
-The party should've been put off--
-Hold it, Will!
Everybody's overreacting.
-Mr.
Simmons is out, sir.
-Out where?
They don 't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'll decide what to do.
-That's okay, isn't it?
-Nope.
Won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it!
This is top priority.
We gotta get these electrical systems on.
Our security program's loused up without them.
Don't go away.
Doug!
Well, what a surprise!
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on, I'll get you a drink.
He must've done something.
My father called.
He hasn't been that upset in years.
Have any idea where he is?
Well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you wanna wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
-Can I get you a drink?
-No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
-Honey.
-Hello.
-What are you drinking these days?
-Nothing, right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a systems failure.
How can that be?
It can't be, theoretically.
Unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours?
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
All the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!
I asked for installations way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
That would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have!
In my office!
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks...
... evenifthat's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Nonsense.
Be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.
Here you are...
... youroriginalspecs.
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
-Susan.
-Hello, Dan.
Good evening.
-How are you, dear?
-Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
I'll meet you out front.
-I'd like to talk to Susan.
-Right.
Find me the architect who designed you...
... andwhoneedsDougRoberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who.
There are leaders from society and government...
... starsofscreenand television.
And now, just arriving, the Honorable Gary Parker...
... chairmanofthe Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator's in from Washington to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark...
... ina longsuccessionoflandmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
--being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
Later, I wanna ask you a few questions...
... andI expect some straight answers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower...
... tallestbuildingin theworld!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
After you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
I've never seen the bridge look like that.
-It's unbelievable!
-Astonishing!
-How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
-Fine, thank you.
Good night.
Shall I leave you a night line?
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Lorrie... .
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
We almost missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
Hello.
Hi.
-Promise me something?
-What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
I promise.
-How's the family?
-Fine, thank you.
Good.
Gary?
-Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
-Certainly.
-I've got a surprise for you.
-Politicians don't like surprises.
-Carlos?
-Yes, sir.
-What can I fix you?
-Meet Senator Parker.
-Great pleasure.
-It's an honor, senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
1929?
-That's all you'll drink tonight.
-A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'll ship to Washington.
-Open a bottle, will you?
-Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
I guess you're looking for someone.
I am.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?
-Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
-Susan, tell me... .
What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man...
... decidestoleavefor two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No headhunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
-You must miss your villa.
-Well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
-No false humility, please.
-Oh, shall we?
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco...
... toregainmy perspective and my humility...
... andspendmoretimeattheone thing I'm really good at:
The stock market.
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
You better leave it off.
Utility.
Wes.
Doug, I'm up on 83 with Will.
We got a wiring problem.
Overloads could be trouble.
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.
I can't do that.
All the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.
You mean the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
-Not all the power, just the overload!
-Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81.
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.
-I'll be in 81.
-You got it.
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
Pull it around over here.
Put it all over him.
Come on!
Let's get some water onto that fire.
Turn it on!
Down, down!
Stay low!
Call an ambulance for this man.
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor!
-The fire department?
-On their way.
Get that ambulance.
Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.
All right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
This is 81.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes, right away.
Call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a lot of people up there.
-What?
-Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
An ambulance is coming, but you better think about...
... gettingthosepeopledown on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but--
Well, then why the urgency?
Urgency?
If fluky wiring in this building caused that fire...
... firescouldbreakout everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 ...
... becauseitcan'tpossibly affect us up here...
... notinthisbuilding.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and--
Oh, Jesus!
-The glass tower!
-What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being inside a chimney.
Jesus!
How in the hell did they get here before we did?
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
-Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.
-Eighty-first floor, right?
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
-Set up a Forward Command.
-Got it.
Chief...
... thisisRoberts,the architect.
-What do we got here, Kappy?
-Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.
It's bad.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
-Exhaust system?
-Should've reversed automatically.
It must be a motor burnout.
-Sprinklers?
-They're not working on 81.
-Why not?
-I don't know.
-Jim?
-Yes, sir?
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.
-Floors have 3 and 1.5-inch outlets.
-GPM?
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1,000 from 68 to 100...
... and500fromtheretotheroof.
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
-What floor are your plans on?
-79.
My office.
That's two floors below the fire.
It'll be our Forward Command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
Architects!
Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.
But you keep building them as high as you can.
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?
What about the 81st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.
Not live-ins.
Businesses.
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.
Those that have are off at night.
I wanna know who they are, not where.
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?
Any wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Any sporting-good manufacturers, like table-tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?
-One tenant list, coming up.
-Thank you.
What do we got?
Elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
-Pipe alleys here?
-One, two, three, four, five.
-This is south?
-South.
Have you got any construction on 81?
Anything that can blow up, like gasoline, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'll be up on 81.
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.
Jack?
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
-I'll be up topside.
-Right.
Jack...
... watchyourself.
Keep it high.
-Looking for me, chief?
-If you're Duncan.
I am.
Everything under control?
Gotta move these people out of here.
Now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems...
... wehavedesignedintothis building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.
I don't think you're listening.
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.
-I'll do it.
-Hold it, hold it.
Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I could tell them, but you ought to.
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests...
... thattheparty'sbeingmoveddown below the fire floor.
Now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now, don't leave this table.
You, I wanna talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
-I most certainly did.
-For God's sake, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire.
If it was caused by what you did, I'll hang you out to dry.
And then I'm going to hang you!
Would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen... .
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire...
... inoneof ourstoragerooms...
... 50floorsbelow.
I assure you there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders...
... apurelyprecautionaryprocedure...
... we'regoingto movethe party down to the lobby for a while.
And we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators... .
Now, ladies and gentlemen...
... there'snoreasontorush .
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
-Lisolette!
-Frank!
Lisolette!
-How's it going, chief?
-Better get ready.
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire lapping?
-Are your com lines tested?
-Phone jacks on every floor.
-I'm plugging into your PA system.
-No sweat.
-Emergency setup?
-Battery-powered standby system.
Splice these lines into our two-way communications van.
Sure.
-No problem?
-No problem.
-How long will this take?
-A minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
The fire's lapping up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
What was that?
-Come on!
-The ceiling's going!
Men trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
Pull them out, pull them out!
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!
Battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!
Forward Command, go ahead.
Explosion on 81, fire headed toward elevator banks!
We need more crews up here fast!
-They need relief on 81.
Hit it.
-They're on their way.
Done!
Tell Duncan to stop those Tower Room people...
... fromusingthatexpresselevator, or somebody'll get killed.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads and some choppers here.
We may need them to get those people down.
Come on, Park.
I'll be on 81.
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.
I don't like how you talk to me.
-You drunk?
-Not yet.
-Then get out of my way!
-You didn't talk like this before.
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?
Shut up and help these people!
-Let me ask, father-in-law--
-Excuse me.
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?
Please!
Please!
Hold everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Move back into the Promenade Room...
... andwe'lltakeyou downby the scenic elevator.
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.
And with the probability of short circuits...
... thecarsmightstop on the floor where the fire is.
So please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there.
For God's sake, get out of there!
Please, back!
It looks bad, Jack.
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
The fire's spreading.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
Firemen, let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out!
Take it down!
Empty all the water out.
Chief, it's out of control.
Bring in another line!
Get another tank!
Angela?
Angela?
Phillip?
Phillip, open the door!
What ideas can I use upstairs...
... toexplainwhereI'vebeen all this time?
Well, what you might do is just...
... walkrightup to himand say , "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay...
... butmysecretary had an urgent personal problem. "
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
He won't.
-You know what astonishes me?
-What?
You make love with a girl...
... andthere'sno visibleevidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
Look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus!
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan?
Right.
-What'd they say?
-Help's on the way.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Please.
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
-They're aware of that.
-She's wearing a purple dress.
-I've got to find her!
-I promise, they'll find her.
Now, only 12 at a time.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
We'll be in the next group, maybe.
It won't be too long.
What's she doing on 87?
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf!
Sure, the kids can hear!
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
You stay there.
I'll get them down!
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
-We'll send them right up.
-Still got people on 87.
I'll get them down.
I'll give you a hand.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
Well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
At least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.
Don't go!
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
-You all right?
-The mother and children are in there.
-Don't worry.
We'll get them out.
-Wait!
Please, Mrs. Mueller!
Please stay back.
-What do you think?
-I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
!
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
-Mom, Mom!
-Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
Anybody else?
My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela?
Angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay, Angela.
Thank God!
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
-All right!
-That's it.
Don't crush.
It'll take hours to get everyone down.
Those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs.
-That's 135 floors.
-All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos!
-Yes, sir.
-Help us get this thing open.
Is it stuck?
Here, let me try to kick it.
-I'll call security.
-Yes, sir.
Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
You want it easy, chief?
They should design a survival suit for us like for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Let's go to work.
I need two men up the stairwell to the tower.
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay, you got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?
Glass will be sailing everywhere.
Tell the police to move those barricades four blocks back.
-Got it.
-Let's hit it.
Yo!
Security guard.
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty, almost missed you.
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip!
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip!
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, boy.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip!
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy.
Easy.
Don't look down!
Come on.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had a... .
I got up, but I'll have trouble getting down.
Can you help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck, real tight?
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Put her legs down.
Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.
Just hold on tight.
Hold on.
Hold on tight, now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
-Hold on, Angela.
-I've got ahold of you!
Get your arms around my neck!
Thattagirl.
Nurse?
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!
Take it slowly, now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt.
Try to get your hand over there.
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller!
Are you all right?
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God!
We're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on, let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
Inside, security phone on the right.
-Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
-I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
The fire's below us.
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.
It's the copter air-control officer.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.
I'm getting relief for you and your men.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.
Right away.
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs.
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby.
Thank you.
This ain't gonna help any!
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!
It's a fire door.
It's over 2.5 inches thick.
I could crawl through the duct.
Will we be able to go with you?
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right, I'll tell him.
-How is it on 65?
-They're containing it.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown.
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold on to me a second.
Hold on!
Christ!
That's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.
-Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
-Not for us.
-Where've you been?
-We had trouble getting here.
The Navy flight commander needs you.
Just walk 65 floors down?
Only five.
A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.
-Got it controlled?
-Getting there.
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike... .
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow. " Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another one there!
Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Anybody'll do.
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How--?
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.
-How're you doing?
-We're fine.
Glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
Mrs. Mueller?
It's Mr. Roberts!
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.
Okay, get down low.
-What kind of explosives are you using?
-It's plastic C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here, shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it up here.
Is there gonna be a bang?
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good going, Brian.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
-Hold it down!
-Listen!
I've been informed that there's no possibility...
... ofusingthisstairwaytogetout.
Now, I'm sorry.
Patty... .
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
-I'm getting out.
-Roger, you... .
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
-I guess you thought I stood you up.
-It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Can I get you anything else?
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the Peerless Building...
... andgetabreechesbuoy to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
-Doc?
-Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
-There's no way down.
-Thank God you're all right.
-Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
-I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
-Responsible?
-Feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase...
... liftaneyebrow in the exact same way...
... IseeandIhear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.
Right now...
... whatI needmost...
... isthis.
I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
-But you don't know anything about me.
-But I do.
You're penniless...
... youhaveno villa in the south of France...
... noantiquescoming,nopaintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But you see, your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively...
... ifyoudon'tenjoycheatingthem?
I came here to sell you 1 000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked...
... oratleastdisappointed.
-But I'm not.
-You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
I thought we were building something...
... wherepeoplecouldwork, live and be safe.
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials...
... weremadebecauseI,asabuilder, have a right to make those decisions.
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
-Who is it?
-Chief O'Hallorhan.
-What happened?
-Part of the central corridor just blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
It's too windy.
We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.
What can we do to help?
Move your combustible material away from the window.
Okay, gotcha.
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.
Jake, give me a hand.
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean...
... ifsheshouldhaveto.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
-Here he is.
-The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Get Roberts.
Get 10 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
-Doug, are they going to land?
-They're gonna try.
We'll send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 100 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
-There may not be time to tell you--
-There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'll be a lot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
Look out!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
Here he is now.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and l--
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
-Sure, what do you want them for?
-I want to try something.
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people out.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
Help me.
If you asked me to go to the North Pole...
... oreventhecliffsofMendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
-Ma'am, I'll take her.
-Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
-I'll meet you in the lobby.
-I'll be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
-You've gotta go.
-I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
All right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
All right, let it go!
Let it go!
All right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!
Explosion above 110...
... blewtheelevatoroff its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
-How many people in it?
-Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
What're you gonna go?
Flaker.
-Flaker!
-Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up out of there.
Pull it.
Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, let her go!
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
All right!
There's one in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right, let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
All right, keep it going!
All right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
-Come ahead!
-I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
-I can't!
-Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
-This is O'Hallorhan.
-We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook...
... andsetme downonthe scenic elevator.
Then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
You think this'll hold it?
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
-What's your number?
-68.
47.
Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now.
-You'll be all right.
-Tell my husband I'm all right.
-Tell him I'll be all right.
-I will.
-And I'll see him at home later.
-I will.
Let's go.
Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
Watch the ladder.
Hey, Mike...
... deputywantsto seeyou .
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 17 or 18 minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'll die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room...
... coulddefinitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
-You're crazy.
-Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design--
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you... .
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation...
... I'llbethelastoneoutof here along with my son-in-law.
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'll kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'll burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line.
Get off!
-You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
-Let go of me!
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
-Get the hell out of there!
-Go!
Get off.
Chief.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
See you up there.
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts...
... anythingyoucanfind!
-Carlos!
-Yes, sir.
Get some knives.
There we go.
For God's sakes, Carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug...
... Ineverthoughtthiscouldhappen.
Sure.
-How much time you think we got?
-Ten minutes, maybe less.
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
All right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire...
... we'llplugit andspliceitinto the timer, set it, and it blows.
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
-Got it?
-I got it.
-Good luck.
See you later.
-Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman?
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
-Claiborne!
-What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God...
... thatI canstopthisfrom ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'll kill 1 0,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies...
... untilsomebodyasksus...
... howtobuildthem.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it!
:
D
- So how was it?
- Good.
- You're gonna go ahead?
- Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying:
"No matter how hot it gets up there during the day there's not a..." - "Not a damn thing to do at night".
What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
Come in the office for a minute.
I got people waiting upstairs.
I wanted to tell you Senator Parker's coming to the dedication tonight.
He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them.
I'll build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'll never leave.
After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay opened.
Whatever happened to "hello"?
Hello.
- How are you?
- Good.
You look like it took.
Hi, Mr. Roberts.
Just a second.
We'll miss you.
- Duncan know?
- He's all smiles.
- What electromagnets went in?
- Doug?
Thompson G-4s.
Don't you think it should've been G-12s?
That's what comes from last-minute panic.
I'll fix it.
There's ground water on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in today.
How about Chicago specs?
- Philadelphia?
- In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Who's there?
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
All protein, no bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
I got about a $140 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will remember to tell them that it was my idea.
Got change for a 50?
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.
Not a chance!
Let's see what we got here...
Twenty-five, 50, 60 70, 75 85, 95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
All your security squad's up there...
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us?
Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Here, let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
- Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that?
- I said how are you?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Okay, I'll get on it right now.
I'll have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.
Mr. Callahan?
We still got any G-12 electrodes?
- Yeah, main storeroom.
- Right.
Okay, booster pump, zone one.
- One-ten.
- Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?
I wouldn't like that at all!
The business offices only go up to 80.
From the 81 st floor, here all the way up to 120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 8145...
Say, Bill?
Tune in the main utility room.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
The sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello?
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean...
I guess we've got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both.
Can I?
I don't know.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight.
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
What about that?
It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
Specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay, send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire from a burned-out circuit breaker isn't conclusive.
Maybe not.
But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will, Doug J.D., wait till you see this.
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?
We have an equipment problem.
- No problem in the tower, is there?
- Could be.
Come on.
You're just guessing.
I want to talk to your son-in-law.
I wanna talk to him right away.
- Get Roger Simmons.
-Yes, sir.
I guarantee I'll check this out.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah, a fire.
In this building?
Come on.
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
- The party should've been put off...
- Hold it, Will!
Everybody's overreacting.
Mr. Simmons is out, sir.
Out where?
They don't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'll decide what to do.
- That's okay, isn't it?
- Nope.
Won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it!
This is top priority.
We gotta get these electrical systems on.
Our security program's loused up without them.
Don't go away.
Doug!
Well, what a surprise!
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on, I'll get you a drink.
He must've done something.
My father called.
He hasn't been that upset in years.
Have any idea where he is?
Well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you wanna wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
- Honey.
- Hello.
- What are you drinking these days?
- Nothing, right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a systems failure.
How can that be?
It can't be, theoretically.
Unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours?
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
All the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!
I asked for installations way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
That would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have!
In my office!
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks even if that's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Nonsense.
Be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.
Here you are your original specs.
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
- Susan.
- Hello, Dan.
Good evening.
- How are you, dear?
- Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
I'll meet you out front.
- I'd like to talk to Susan.
- Right.
Find me the architect who designed you and who needs Doug Roberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who.
There are leaders from society and government stars of screen and television.
And now, just arriving, the Honorable Gary Parker chairman of the Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator's in from Washington to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark in a long succession of landmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
...being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. And Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
Later, I wanna ask you a few questions and I expect some straight answers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower tallest building in the world!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
After you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
I've never seen the bridge look like that.
- It's unbelievable!
- Astonishing!
- How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
- Fine, thank you.
Good night.
Shall I leave you a night line?
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Lorrie...
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
We almost missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
Hello.
Hi.
- Promise me something?
- What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
I promise.
We may never love like this again
Don't stop the flow
We can't let go
We may never love like this again
And touch the sky
Though we may try
So while we're here Let's give our all
Release the dreams inside us
And set them free
Oh, while we're here let's leave a mark
There's a candle in the dark
It's here to guide us
We may never love like this again
But through the days
Beyond the haze
I see you reaching out...
- How's the family?
- Fine, thank you.
Good.
Gary?
- Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
- Certainly.
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Politicians don't like surprises.
- Carlos?
- Yes, sir.
- What can I fix you?
- Meet Senator Parker.
- Great pleasure.
- It's an honor, senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
1929?
- That's all you'll drink tonight.
- A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'll ship to Washington.
- Open a bottle, will you?
- Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
I guess you're looking for someone.
I am.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?
- Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
- Susan, tell me...
What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man decides to leave for two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No headhunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
- You must miss your villa.
- Well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
- No false humility, please.
- Oh, shall we?
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco to regain my perspective and my humility and spend more time at the one thing I'm really good at:
The stock market.
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
You better leave it off.
Utility.
Wes.
Doug, I'm up on 83 with Will.
We got a wiring problem.
Overloads could be trouble.
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.
I can't do that.
All the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.
You mean the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
I didn't say all the power, just the overload!
Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81.
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.
- I'll be in 81.
- You got it.
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
Pull it around over here.
Put it all over him.
Come on!
Let's get some water onto that fire.
Turn it on!
Down, down!
Stay low!
Call an ambulance for this man.
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor!
- The fire department?
- On their way.
Get that ambulance.
Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.
All right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
This is 81.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes, right away.
Call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a lot of people up there.
- What?
- Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
An ambulance is coming, but you better think about getting those people down on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but...
Well, then why the urgency?
Urgency?
If fluky wiring in this building caused that fire fires could break out everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 because it can't possibly affect us up here not in this building.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and...
Oh, Jesus!
- The glass tower!
- What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being inside a chimney.
Jesus!
How in the hell did they get here before we did?
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
- Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.
- Eighty-first floor, right?
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
- Set up a Forward Command.
- Got it.
Chief this is Roberts, the architect.
- What do we got here, Kappy?
- Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.
It's bad.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
- Exhaust system?
- Should've reversed automatically.
It must be a motor burnout.
- Sprinklers?
- They're not working on 81.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
- Jim?
- Yes, sir?
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.
Floors have 3 and 1.5-inch outlets.
GPM?
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1000 from 68 to 100 and 500 from there to the roof.
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
- What floor are your plans on?
- 79.
My office.
That's two floors below the fire.
It'll be our Forward Command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
Architects!
Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.
But you keep building them as high as you can.
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?
What about the 81 st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.
Not live-ins.
Businesses.
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.
Those that have are off at night.
I wanna know who they are, not where.
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?
Any wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Any sporting-good manufacturers, like table-tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?
- One tenant list, coming up.
- Thank you.
What do we got?
Elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
- Pipe alleys here?
- One, two, three, four, five.
- This is south?
- South.
Have you got any construction on 81?
Anything that can blow up, like gasoline, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'll be up on 81.
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.
Jack?
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
- I'll be up topside.
- Right.
Jack watch yourself.
Keep it high.
- Looking for me, chief?
- Lf you're Duncan.
I am.
Everything under control?
Gotta move these people out of here.
Now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems we have designed into this building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.
I don't think you're listening.
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.
- I'll do it.
- Hold it, hold it.
Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I could tell them, but you ought to.
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests that the party's being moved down below the fire floor.
Now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now, don't leave this table.
You, I wanna talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
- I most certainly did.
- For God's sake, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire.
If it was caused by what you did, I'll hang you out to dry.
And then I'm going to hang you!
Would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire in one of our storage rooms 50 floors below.
I assure you there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders a purely precautionary procedure we're going to move the party down to the lobby for a while.
And we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators...
Now, ladies and gentlemen there's no reason to rush.
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
- Lisolette!
- Frank!
Lisolette!
- How's it going, chief?
- Better get ready.
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire lapping?
- Are your com lines tested?
- Phone jacks on every floor.
- I'm plugging into your PA system.
- No sweat.
- Emergency setup?
- Battery-powered standby system.
Splice these lines into our two-way communications van.
Sure.
- No problem?
- No problem.
- How long will this take?
- A minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
The fire's lapping up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
What was that?
- Come on!
- The ceiling's going!
Men trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
Pull them out, pull them out!
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!
Battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!
Forward Command, go ahead.
Explosion on 81, fire headed toward elevator banks!
We need more crews up here fast!
- They need relief on 81.
Hit it.
- They're on their way.
Done!
Tell Duncan to stop those Tower Room people from using that express elevator, or somebody'll get killed.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads and some choppers here.
We may need them to get those people down.
Come on, Park.
I'll be on 81.
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.
I don't like how you talk to me.
- You drunk?
- Not yet.
- Then get out of my way!
- You didn't talk like this before.
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?
Shut up and help these people!
- Let me ask, father-in-law...
- Excuse me.
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?
Please!
Please!
Hold everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Move back into the Promenade Room and we'll take you down by the scenic elevator.
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.
And with the probability of short circuits the cars might stop on the floor where the fire is.
So please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there.
For God's sake, get out of there!
Please, back!
It looks bad, Jack.
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
The fire's spreading.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
Firemen, let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out!
Take it down!
Empty all the water out.
Chief, it's out of control.
Bring in another line!
Get another tank!
Angela?
Angela?
Phillip?
Phillip, open the door!
What ideas can I use upstairs to explain where I've been all this time?
Well, what you might do is just walk right up to him and say, "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay but my secretary had an urgent personal problem."
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
He won't.
- You know what astonishes me?
- What?
You make love with a girl and there's no visible evidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
Look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus!
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan?
Right.
- What'd they say?
- Help's on the way.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Please.
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
- They're aware of that.
- She's wearing a purple dress.
- I've got to find her!
- I promise, they'll find her.
Now, only 12 at a time.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
We'll be in the next group, maybe.
It won't be too long.
What's she doing on 87?
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf!
Sure, the kids can hear!
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
You stay there.
I'll get them down!
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
-We'll send them right up.
- Still got people on 87.
I'll get them down.
I'll give you a hand.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
Well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
At least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.
Don't go!
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
You all right?
The mother and the two children are in there.
- Don't worry.
We'll get them out.
- Wait!
Please, Mrs. Mueller!
Please stay back.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
!
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
- Mom, Mom!
- Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
Anybody else?
My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela?
Angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay, Angela.
Thank God!
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
- All right!
- That's it.
Don't crush.
It'll take hours to get everyone down.
Those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs.
- That's 135 floors.
- All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos!
- Yes, sir.
- Help us get this thing open.
Is it stuck?
Here, let me try to kick it.
- I'll call security.
- Yes, sir.
Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
You want it easy, chief?
They should design a survival suit for us like for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Let's go to work.
I need two men up the stairwell to the tower.
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay, you got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?
Glass will be sailing everywhere.
Tell the police to move those barricades four blocks back.
- Got it.
- Let's hit it.
Yo!
Security guard.
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty, almost missed you.
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip!
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip!
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, boy.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip!
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy.
Easy.
Don't look down!
Come on.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had a...
I got up, but I'll have trouble getting down.
Can you help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck, real tight?
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Put her legs down.
Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.
Just hold on tight.
Hold on.
Hold on tight, now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
- Hold on, Angela.
- I've got ahold of you!
Get your arms around my neck!
Thattagirl.
Nurse?
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!
Take it slowly, now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt.
Try to get your hand over there.
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller!
Are you all right?
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God!
We're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on, let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
Inside, security phone on the right.
- Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
- I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
The fire's below us.
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.
It's the copter air-control officer.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.
I'm getting relief for you and your men.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.
Right away.
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs.
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby.
Thank you.
This ain't gonna help any!
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!
It's a fire door.
It's over 2.5 inches thick.
I could crawl through the duct.
Will we be able to go with you?
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right, I'll tell him.
Chief?
- How is it on 65?
- They're containing it.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown.
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold on to me a second.
Hold on!
Christ!
That's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.
- Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
- Not for us.
- Where've you been?
- We had trouble getting here.
The Navy flight commander needs you.
Just walk 65 floors down?
Only five.
A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.
- Got it controlled?
- Getting there.
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike...
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow".
Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another one there!
Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Anybody'll do.
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How...?
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.
- How're you doing?
- We're fine.
Glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
Mrs. Mueller?
It's Mr. Roberts!
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.
Okay, get down low.
- What kind of explosives are you using?
- It's plastic C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here, shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it up here.
Is there gonna be a bang?
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good going, Brian.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
- Hold it down!
- Listen!
I've been informed that there's no possibility of using this stairway to get out.
Now, I'm sorry.
Patty...
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
- I'm getting out.
- Roger, you...
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
- I guess you thought I stood you up.
- It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Can I get you anything else?
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the Peerless Building and get a breeches buoy to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
- Doc?
- Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
- There's no way down.
- Thank God you're all right.
- Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
- I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
- Responsible?
- Feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase lift an eyebrow in the exact same way I see and I hear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.
Right now what I need most is this.
I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
- But you don't know anything about me.
- But I do.
You're penniless you have no villa in the south of France no antiques coming, no paintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But you see, your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively if you don't enjoy cheating them?
I came here to sell you 1000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked or at least disappointed.
But I'm not.
You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
I thought we were building something where people could work, live and be safe.
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials were made because I, as a builder, have a right to make those decisions.
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
- Who is it?
- Chief O'Hallorhan.
What happened?
Part of the central corridor just blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
It's too windy.
We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.
What can we do to help?
Move your combustible material away from the window.
Okay, gotcha.
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.
Jake, give me a hand.
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean if she should have to.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
- Here he is.
- The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Get Roberts.
Get 10 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
- Doug, are they going to land?
- They're gonna try.
We'll send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 100 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
- There may not be time to tell you...
- There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'll be a lot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
Look out!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
Here he is now.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and I...
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
- Sure, what do you want them for?
- I want to try something.
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people out.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
Help me.
If you asked me to go to the North Pole or even the cliffs of Mendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
- Ma'am, I'll take her.
- Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- I'll be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
- You've gotta go.
- I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
All right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
All right, let it go!
Let it go!
All right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!
Explosion above 110 blew the elevator off its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
- How many people in it?
- Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
What're you gonna go?
Flaker.
Flaker!
Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up out of there.
Pull it.
Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, let her go!
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
All right!
There's one in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right, let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
All right, keep it going!
All right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
Come ahead!
I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
- I can't!
- Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
- This is O'Hallorhan.
-We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook and set me down on the scenic elevator.
Then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
You think this'll hold it?
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
- What's your number?
- 68.
47.
Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now.
- You'll be all right.
- Tell my husband I'm all right.
- Tell him I'll be all right.
- I will.
- And I'll see him at home later.
- I will.
Let's go.
Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
Watch the ladder.
Hey, Mike deputy wants to see you.
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 17 or 18 minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'll die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room could definitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
You're crazy.
Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design...
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you...
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation I'll be the last one out of here along with my son-in-law.
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'll kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'll burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line.
Get off!
You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
Let go of me!
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
- Get the hell out of there!
- Go!
Get off.
Chief.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
See you up there.
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts anything you can find!
- Carlos!
- Yes, sir.
Get some knives.
There we go.
For God's sakes, Carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug I never thought this could happen.
Sure.
- How much time you think we got?
- Ten minutes, maybe less.
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
All right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire we'll plug it and splice it into the timer, set it, and it blows.
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
- Got it?
- I got it.
- Good luck.
See you later.
- Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman?
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
- Claiborne!
- What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God that I can stop this from ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'll kill 10,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies until somebody asks us how to build them.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.
So, how was it?
Good.
You're gonna go ahead, huh?
Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying that, uh, no matter how hot it gets up there during the day, there's not...
Not a damn thing to do at night.
That's right.
Now just what the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
Can you come in the office for a minute?
I got people waiting upstairs.
Well, what I wanted to tell you is that, uh,
Senator Parker's flying in for the dedication tonight, and he's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Now, do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design 'em, I'll build 'em.
Jim, I think you suffer from an "edifice" complex.
You'll never leave.
Right after the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Sam.
It's Doug.
How are ya?
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay open.
Dampers?
Whatever happened to hello?
Hello.
How are ya?
Good.
You look like it took.
Yeah.
Hi, Mr. Roberts.
Hey, Doug.
Just a second.
We're gonna miss you.
Duncan know?
He's all smiles.
Mm-hmm.
Hey.
What electromagnets went in?
Doug.
Thompson G-4's.
Shouldn't they have been, like, G-12's?
Oh, no.
That's what comes from this damn last-minute panic.
I'll fix it, Doug.
Okay.
What?
We keep running into groundwater on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in sometime this afternoon.
Good to see you back, but how about Chicago specs?
Philadelphia.
In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Well, is there-
Mm-hmm.
No, I'm not taking any calls.
We gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Mmm.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
All protein.
No bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase over there.
What's in that suitcase?
I got about 140 dollars' worth of vulgar underwear for ya.
First things first.
It's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this- and they will- remember to tell them that it was my idea.
Right.
Got change for a 50?
- I'm sorry.
That's the smallest I have.
- Oh, not a chance.
Let's see what we got here.
Oh.
Uh, 25, 50, 60... 70,
75, 85, 95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
Tomorrow we're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us tonight.
Oh, thank you, but I'm going up to the party in the tower.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Oh, here.
Let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
Sorry, Mrs. Mueller.
What was that?
I said, "How are you?" Okay.
Good-bye.
Okay.
I'll get on it right now.
I'll have to check the panel.
Just leave all those fired up.
Mr. Callahan.
Yeah.
We still got any of those G-12 electrodes in stock?
Yeah.
Main storeroom.
Right.
Okay.
Booster pump, Zone 1.
110.
Check.
Main generator, Zone 1.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Ah.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor as well as apartments?
Oh, I wouldn't like that at all.
Oh, no, no.
The business offices only go as high as 80.
From the 81st floor here, all the way up to 120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 8145.
Say, Bill.
Tune in the main utility room.
Okay.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire department alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
Well, the sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello.
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean...
I guess we got ourselves a situation.
Seems.
See, Doug, I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
And I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I've wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have...
I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it.
Something that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both, can I?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight, hmm?
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
Yeah.
What about that?
It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now, just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ.
The specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Yeah.
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay.
Send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire from a burned-out circuit breaker is hardly conclusive.
Well, maybe not, but after that, I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will.
Doug.
J.D., wait till you see this.
What happened?
Somebody hang the wallpaper upside down?
We have an equipment problem.
No problem in the tower, is there?
Could be.
Come on, Doug.
You're just guessing.
All right.
I'm just guessing.
But I want to talk to that son-in-law of yours.
I want to talk to him right away.
Okay.
Get me Roger Simmons.
Yes, sir.
I'm gonna check this thing out, Mr. Duncan.
I guarantee you.
Sure, sure.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah.
A fire.
In this building?
Come on.
Do you know we haven't even finished installing the safety equipment?
The party should have been put off for at least another month.
Now, hold it, Will.
Hold it!
Everybody's overreacting.
Yes.
Mr. Simmons is out, sir.
- Out where?
- They don't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
Okay.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow, and then we'll decide what to do.
That's okay, isn't it?
Nope.
Won't wait.
Try Zone 1 again.
Damn it, Harry.
This is top priority.
We've got to get these electrical systems back on the beam.
Our whole security program's loused up without 'em.
Don't go away.
Doug.
Well, what a surprise.
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I mean, I called his office, the club, the marina- everywhere.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on.
I'll get you a drink.
He must have done something, 'cause my father called.
I haven't heard him that upset in years.
You have any idea where he is?
Well, my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's roughly equivalent to that of the timber wolf- anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you want to wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
Can I get you a drink?
No.
No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
Honey.
Hello.
What are you drinking these days?
Nothing right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a power surge and a systems failure.
How can that be?
Well, it can't be, theoretically.
Unless you've been screwing around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours anyway?
Well, I'm just wondering what kind of kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Now, listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
It looked to me like some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
Every piece of wire I put in that building is strictly up to code- inspected and approved.
The code's not enough for that building.
And you know it.
That's why I asked for installations that were way, way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dreamworld.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
It'd take weeks to get all that together- and someone with more clout than you to make me do it.
In my office, tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
Roger, if you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help.
Or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time daddy barks.
I mean, if that's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
But I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please.
All right.
Give me a wide camera angle.
Everybody, back of the rope.
Stand back.
Please.
Everybody, back of the rope.
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age...
I only care that they show up at all.
Oh, nonsense.
Now, you be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Well, did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but two bucks will get ya 10 he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
That's the only way he could've swung it.
Well, here you are.
Your original specs.
Zone 1 only, but we gotta start somewhere.
The son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
Susan.
Hello, Danny.
Good evening.
Good show.
How are you, dear?
Jim.
Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
Uh, I'll meet you out front.
I'd like to talk to Susan for a minute.
Right.
Find me the architect who designed you, and who needs Doug Roberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries tonight reads like a who's who.
There are leaders from society and government.
Stars of screen and television.
And now, just arriving, the honorable Gary Parker, chairman of the Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator flew in from Washington tonight to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him over to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I am honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark... in a long succession of landmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
I am deeply appreciative... of being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's Mr. and Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, Senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Ah, yes.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
When I get the time, I want to ask you a few questions, and I expect some straight answers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower... tallest building in the world.
Oh!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
Oh!
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
And you know, it's all...
After you.
This is really going to thrill you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
Oh, that's incredible.
I've never seen the bridge looking like that.
Oh, it's absolutely unbelievable.
It's astonishing!
How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
Fine.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
Shall I leave you a night line, Mr. Bigelow?
Uh, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Good night.
Good night.
Lorrie.
Yes.
Sorry to break into your evening, but I have one letter that's got to go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
You could have left 10 minutes ago and missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not going to do anything tonight.
Oh.
Hey.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
Hello.
Hi.
Promise me something?
What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Mm-hmm.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
Mmm.
I promise.
' We may never love like this again '
' Don't stop the flow '
' We can't let go '
' We may never love like this again '
' And touch the sky '
' Though we may try '
' So while we're here let's give our all '
' Release the dreams inside us '
' And set them free '
' Oh, while we're here let's leave a mark '
' There's a candle in the dark '
' It's here to guide us '
' We may never love like this again '
' But through the days '
' Beyond the haze '
' I see you reaching out ' Hi there.
Marge, how's the family?
They're just fine.
Thank you for asking.
Good.
Gary.
Yeah.
Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
Certainly.
I've got a surprise for you.
- Politicians don't like surprises.
- We'll love again
Carlos.
Yes, sir.
Oh.
What can I fix you, Mr. Duncan?
I want you to meet Senator Parker.
Carlos, a great pleasure.
Oh, it's a great honor, Senator.
Now, show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
Oh.
Twenty-nine?
That's all you're gonna drink tonight.
A whole case?
Well, what you don't drink, we'll ship the rest back to Washington.
Open a bottle, will you?
Yes, sir.
Uh, how did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
Oh, it's nothing.
Let me guess.
You're looking for someone.
I'm looking for someone.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty and me.
What can I get you?
Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
Susan.
Tell me.
Uh, what does a girl do in San Francisco when her, uh, old man decides to leave for two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No... head-hunting?
Well, I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at... at lunch?
No.
You must miss your villa.
Well, yes and no.
It, uh- It gets rather dull in the south of France.
It really does.
I mean, nothing but swimming... and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they, uh... they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
No false humility, please.
Oh.
Shall we?
I, uh-
I
- I decided to come back to the reality of an Francisco, uh, to regain my perspective and my humility... a-and spend more time at the one thing in this world that I'm really good at:
the stock market.
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you, uh...
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
Hmm?
It's too hot.
We'd better leave it off.
Utility.
Wes.
Doug.
I'm up on 83 with Will.
Listen.
We got a little wiring problem.
If we get an overload, it could be trouble.
Shut down as many Zone 1 systems as you can.
Afraid I can't do that, Mr. Roberts.
We've got all the lights on for the dedication ceremony.
All?
You mean the whole building?
Well, we're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
But I can't do that without a direct okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility for that.
Just turn off the goddamn lights.
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
- I didn't say kill all the power.
Just the overload.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts.
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
Okay.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81.
Bill, phone it in just in case our automatic lines to the fire department are out.
I'll be in 81.
Got it.
Hey!
Get those drapes!
Smother him!
Try to smother him!
Pull it around over here!
Pull it over him!
Come on!
Get some water on that fire!
Turn it on!
Will.
Down.
Down.
Stay low.
Call an ambulance for this man.
Damn it, man!
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor.
Yes, sir.
What about the fire department?
They're on their way.
Get that ambulance!
Give me a hand.
Let's get him in the elevator.
All right.
Try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
Hello.
This is 81.
We've had an accident up here.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes.
Right away.
Roberts, call Duncan in the tower.
We've got a lot of people up there.
What?
Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah.
Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
Everybody wants to know why the world's greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind about that.
Will Giddings has been pretty badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
Listen.
I've already got an ambulance coming, but you better think about getting those people upstairs down on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but-
Well, then, uh, why the urgency?
Urgency?
Hey, Dunc, if that fire was caused by fluky wiring in this building, we could get fires breaking out everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
Now, I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I am not going to concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81... because it can't possibly affect us up here.
Not in this building.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
In the meantime, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party.
Now, come on!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and-
Oh, Jesus.
The glass tower.
What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
You ever fight one in a high-rise?
Yeah.
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being' inside a chimney!
People.
Hell, they got here before we did.
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
Get some hands over here, and have 'em walk out there.
Okay.
Captain.
You understand?
I want you over that way.
Mike, she's throwin' a lot of smoke.
Eighty-first floor, right?
Right.
We've got lobby control.
Second alarm is in.
Set up a forward command.
Got it.
Chief, this is Roberts, the architect.
What've we got here, Kappy?
Fire started 81st floor.
Storage room.
This is a bad one.
The smoke is so thick we can't tell how far it's spread.
What about your exhaust system?
Well, it should've reversed automatically.
There must have been a motor burnout or somethin'.
Sprinklers?
They're not working on 81.
Why not?
I don't know.
Jim.
Yes, sir.
All right.
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe systems.
Well, we got outlets on every floor.
Both three and one-and-a-half inch.
G.P.M.?
1,500 from ground to 68, 1,000 from 68 to 100... and, uh, 500 from there to the roof.
All right.
And you're sure these elevators are programmed for emergency service?
These two are.
What floor do you keep your plans on?
Seventy-nine.
My office.
That's good.
That's two floors below the fire.
All right.
That'll be our forward command.
All right, men.
Take up the equipment.
Right.
Let's go.
Okay.
Architects.
Yeah.
It's all our fault.
Now, you know there's no sure way for us to fight a fire... in anything over the seventh floor, but you guys just keep buildin' em as high as you can.
Hey.
Are you here to take me on or the fire?
Okay.
Well, what about the 81st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I want to see all your floor plans.
Eighty-one through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what I'm worried about.
All those beams and that glass.
Chief.
Yeah.
81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
How long before you can give me a complete list of your tenants?
You don't have to worry about that.
We're movin' 'em out right now.
Not live-in.
Business tenants.
We kind of looked up there too.
The majority of them haven't moved in yet, and those that have aren't working tonight.
I want to know who they are, not where they are.
Now what does that got to do with anything- who they are?
Do you have any wool or silk manufacturers?
You see, in a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Do you have any, uh, sporting good manufacturers, like table tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Want me to keep goin' down the line?
No.
One list of tenants comin' right up.
Thank you.
Over here and here.
Here.
What have we got?
Well, elevator bank.
Central core.
Service elevators over here.
Air-conditioning duct, six inches.
Right.
Pipe alleys here?
One, two, three, four, five.
This is south.
South.
Have you got any construction going up in 81?
Nope.
Anything that could blow up, like gasoline, kerosene, uh, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'll be up on 81.
Okay.
For what it's worth, architect, this is one building that I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
- Party?
What party?
Where?
- In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get 'em the hell out of there?
Why don't you go on upstairs and talk to Duncan?
He ain't exactly listening to me.
I will.
Oh.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down.
Check that hallway.
Take it down to the other crew.
Jack.
Jack.
How bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Uh-huh.
Work it around.
Up there.
I'll be up topside.
Right.
Jack, watch yourself.
Keep it high.
You looking for me, Chief?
If you're Duncan, yeah.
I am.
Everything under control?
We've gotta move all these people out of here.
Oh, now just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
Well, uh, I don't believe that you're familiar with... the many modern safety systems we have designed into this building.
We've got 'em all.
All right.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now let's get these people the hell out of here.
I don't think you're listening, Chief.
There's no way for a fire on 81 to reach up here.
Not in this building.
Okay.
I'll do it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
The mayor's out there.
Do you want me to pull rank on you?
When there's a fire, I outrank everybody here.
Now, one thing we don't want is a panic.
Now, I could tell 'em, but you ought to do it.
Just make a nice cool announcement to all your guests... and tell 'em the party's being moved down below the fire floor... right now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now don't leave this table.
You I want to talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
I most certainly did.
For God sakes, why?
The reason should be obvious.
Especially to you.
We've got a fire.
And if it was caused by anything you did,
I'm going to hang you out to dry, and then I'm going to hang you!
Would you, uh, please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire... in one of our storage rooms, 50 floors below.
Now, I assure you, there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders, a purely precautionary procedure, we're going to move the party down to the lobby for a while, and we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.
But I promise you.
Dinner will not be delayed.
Now, if we can all move to the elevators.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, there's...
there's no reason to rush.
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
Lisolette.
Frank.
Lisolette.
How's it going, Chief?
Better get ready.
Kappy, pull out the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire lapping up?
Yeah.
Are your com lines all set up and tested?
Phone jacks on every floor.
I'm gonna plug into your P.A. system.
No sweat.
How about your emergency setup?
Battery-powered standby system.
Can you take these lines... and splice them into our two-way communications band?
Sure.
No problem?
No problem.
Okay.
How long will this take?
About a minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
Fire's lapping here.
It's going up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
Come on!
The ceiling's going!
They're trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
Pull 'em out!
Pull 'em out!
Drop the fire line!
Drop it low!
Battalion 2 to forward command, urgent!
Forward command.
Go ahead.
Explosion on 81.
Fire heading toward elevator banks.
We need more crews up here fast!
All right.
They need relief on 81.
Hit it.
They're on their way.
Done.
You better call Duncan, tell him to stop those people in the Tower Room... from using that express elevator, or somebody's gonna get killed.
Okay, Kappy.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads here, and I also want choppers.
We may need 'em if we're gonna get those people down.
All right.
Come on, fireman.
I'll be on 81.
Fine.
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload it.
Okay, Doug.
I don't like the way you talk to me.
You drunk?
Not yet.
Well, then get out of my way.
You didn't talk like this two years ago, did you?
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then how I could shave two million dollars of four electrical costs?
Shut up, and help me with these people.
And let me ask you, my dear father-in-law...
Excuse me.
Am I the only subcontractor you encouraged to cut corners?
Excuse me.
Where did you save the other four million in Doug's original budget?
Everybody.
Shh!
Please.
Please.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
You'll have to move back into the Promenade Room, and we'll be taking you down by the scenic elevator.
Now, these express elevators can be activated by fire, and with the probability of short circuits, the cars might stop on the floor where the fire is.
So, please, we'll use the scenic elevators.
Over there.
For God sakes, get out of there!
Please, back.
Looks bad, Jack.
Yeah, it is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
Fire's spreading down all corridors.
All right.
I got a third alarm in.
Now, what about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
All right.
Fireman, let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out!
Take it down.
Empty all the water out!
Fall back!
Chief, it's out of control.
We're losin' it!
Bring in another line!
Get another hose!
Angela.
Angela.
Phillip.
Phillip, open the door!
Do you have any brilliant ideas I can use upstairs... to explain where I've been all this time?
Mmm.
Well, I think what you might do is just, uh, walk right up to him and say, uh,
"J.D., I'm sorry for the delay, but my secretary had an urgent personal problem."
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
Hmm.
He won't.
You know what astonishes me?
What?
You make love with a girl- Mm-hmm.
and afterwards, there's no visible evidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
I mean, look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus.
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Right.
What did they say?
Help's on the way.
Oh.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, madam, please.
You must...
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
Oh.
But they're aware of that.
She's wearing a purple dress.
I've got to find her.
A purple dress.
I promise you.
They'll find her.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Now, only 12 at a time.
Hurry up.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
Well, be in the next group.
It won't be too long.
What's she doin' on 87?
Forward command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man.
You should've sent a man up there.
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf.
Sure the kids can hear.
I don't know.
Maybe they were in the shower or something when you called.
Forward command.
No.
You stay where you are.
I'll get 'em down.
No.
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
Now!
Okay, forward command.
Fresh crews coming right up.
Still got people on 87.
I'll get 'em down.
I'll give you a hand, Harry.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
Well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
For one thing, at least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.
Don't go.
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
On your mark.
Dan!
Down that corridor!
You all right?
They're in there.
I know it.
The mother and the two children.
Don't worry.
We'll get 'em out.
Wait a minute.
Please, Mrs. Mueller.
Please stay back.
What do you think?
I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
Mom.
Mom.
Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
She'll be all right.
Anybody else?
My sis
- My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela?
Angela?
Angela.
Angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.
It's all right.
Thank God.
Angela.
Come on.
Just take it easy.
Easy.
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
Hold it here.
All right!
That's it.
Don't press the plaza button.
Everybody just calm down.
At this rate it's gonna take a couple of hours to get everyone down.
So I would suggest that those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines... start using the stairs.
That's 135 floors.
Mm-hmm.
All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos.
Yes, sir.
Help us try to get this thing open.
It's stuck?
Yeah.
Here.
Let me try to kick it.
No.
I'll call security.
Yes, sir.
On the double.
Battalion 38, responding to fourth alarm.
Reporting to forward command.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
Hey.
You want it easy, Chief?
I don't see why they couldn't have designed a survival suit for us... like they did for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's go to work.
I need two men to go up the stairwell to the Tower Room.
There's a door jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay.
You got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men.
Make sure they've got 30 minutes of air.
Kappy.
Yeah.
Now there's gonna be glass sailing' all over this city.
Call the police downstairs.
Have them move those barricades four blocks back.
Got it.
Let's hit it.
Right.
Yo.
Security guard!
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty.
Almost missed ya, huh?
Ow!
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Can you get down?
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip.
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, now.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip.
Your foot's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy now.
Easy.
Don't look down.
That's right.
Come on.
I got ya.
I got ya.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
We were supposed to have fire drills.
That's what they said.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had- I got up all right, but I think I'm gonna have a lot of trouble gettin' down.
You think you could help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck real tight?
Oh, no.
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Okay?
Put her legs down.
Okay.
Hold on tight.
Put your legs around here.
Hold on real tight now.
Go on.
Hang on.
Just hold on tight, honey.
Hold on.
Hold on.
You're okay.
Hold on tight now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
Hold on, Angela.
I've got a hold of you.
Get your arms around my neck.
That-a-girl.
Nurse.
He stayed in too long.
Bring him right over here.
Mrs. Mueller, come on.
You've gotta try!
Take it slowly now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold onto that pole and grab a hold of my belt.
Try to get your left hand over there.
About half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller.
Are you all right?
Fine.
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm comin'.
I'm comin'.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God, we're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on.
Let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
O'Hallorhan.
Inside, security phone on the right.
Would you get me Chief O'Hallorhan right away?
I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
No, the fire's below us.
We have to go up.
This'll put us right underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
Jack?
Yeah?
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling and vent that other side.
It's for you, Chief.
The air control officer for the copter.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hittin' it.
I'm gonna get some relief for you and your men.
This is O'Hallorhan.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We could use your rescue choppers.
I'll order them right away.
I'd like to set up communications... next to the forward command center.
No, no, too dangerous.
Stay outta those elevators.
Well, then, sir, we'll just trot right up the stairs.
Yeah, you'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby, sir.
Thank you.
This isn't gonna help any.
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people.
It's a fire door.
It's over two and a half inches thick.
Maybe I could crawl through there.
Will we- Will we be able to go with you?
It leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
Use this.
Phillip, you take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right.
I'll tell him.
Chief?
Yeah.
How does it look on 65?
They're getting it contained.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown!
But the backup should've kicked on by now.
Go see what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
Well, what's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold onto me a second.
Hold on!
Jesus Christ, that's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Okay, okay.
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We're gonna rappel.
Down to 65.
Get on top of that elevator, use it for an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Okay.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room!
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Okay, open it up.
Of course I read you!
Look, I don't know where the hell he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him!
Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
Not for us.
Mike, where have you been?
We had a little trouble getting here.
The navy flight commander needs you down in the lobby right away.
Sixty-five floors?
Just walk right down?
No, it's only five.
They got a freight elevator on 60 on auxiliary power.
Okay.
You got this thing controlled?
Well, we're gettin' there.
All right, you men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike...
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow." Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Located O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another there.
Look.
It's too damn windy out there!
Hey, Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
Mr. Roberts.
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Well, that's okay.
Anybody'll do.
Listen.
The south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for Chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How...
Okay.
Oh.
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
Oh, it's okay, Mrs. Mueller.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
Oh, hello, ma'am.
Oh, hello.
How you doin'?
We're fine.
Glad to see you.
Yeah.
That's the door right here!
It's blocked with cement.
Okay.
Ah, we're gonna have to blow that thing.
Right.
Mrs. Mueller.
It's Mr. Roberts.
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you!
We're gonna blow this door!
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there outta the way.
Okay.
Everybody, could you please go back?
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back to the elevator.
We're blowing up the exit door.
Okay, get down low.
What kind of explosives are you using?
It's plastic, C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here.
Shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it on there.
Is there going to be a bang?
Ah, nothin' for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good goin', guys.
Hey.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
Hold it down!
Listen!
I've been informed by the fire department... that there's no possibility of using this stairway to get out.
Now, I'm-I'm sorry.
Patty.
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
We can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
No.
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
I'm getting out.
Roger.
You...
Ah!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go!
You guys, pull the ceiling!
You two, in there!
I guess you thought I stood you up.
It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Mm-hmm.
Doug, those, uh... those helicopters, th-they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will, if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Doug-
Hmm, da-dumm!
Can I get you anything else?
No?
Damn!
The choppers are here all right, but those high winds on the roof make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on the roof of the Peerless Building.
I wanna try to get a breeches buoy up to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that distance, not in this wind.
What's the matter with shooting' it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
Don?
Chief, uh, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
There's no way down.
Thank God you're all right.
Oh, Roger, what are we gonna do?
I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for all this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
Responsible?
Feeling!
Oh, you know a lot about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
The Duncans are very big in the responsibility department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of-of duty!
Sometimes... when you turn the exact same phrase, lift an eyebrow the exact same way,
I see, and I hear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a great big tree, and a little baby tree in its shade where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you... because I-I-I-I thought you might need me!
Right now, what I need most... is this.
I, um
- I promised myself that if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
But you don't know anything about me.
But I do.
You're penniless.
You have no villa in the south of France-
No antiques coming, no paintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn, a two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But don't you see?
Your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively if you don't really enjoy cheating them?
I brought you up here tonight to sell you a thousand shares... in Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light, only the certificate I had printed.
I must say, I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
I-It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Mm.
Every word.
Well, then, tell me you're shocked.
Or at least disappointed!
But I'm not.
You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
Oh, God, I wonder how many more'll be dead by tomorrow?
I thought we were building something that- where people could work and live and be safe!
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now, listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials... were made because I, as a builder, have a right to make those decisions-
If I remain within the building code.
And goddamn it, I did!
Building code.
Jesus.
Oh, the building code.
Come on, Dunc.
I mean, that's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble.
I was crawlin' around up there.
I mean, duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors, and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for startin' fires!
Hoo, boy.
Where was I when all this was goin' on?
'Cause I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
Come on!
Move it!
Okay.
Who is it?
Chief O'Hallorhan.
What happened?
Part of the central core just blew.
Now, we've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
No, it's too windy.
They can't set down.
We want to set the breeches buoy up on the roof of the Peerless Building.
Well, what can we do to help?
Move all your combustible material away from the window.
Okay.
Gotcha.
Come on.
Grab those tables and chairs.
Pile 'em up away from the walls!
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get on 'em now.
Jake, give me a hand!
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Well, just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how- how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety-deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean, uh, if she should have to.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
Oh.
Here he is.
Chief, the wind velocity's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Gil, get Roberts.
Yeah.
Get 10 people up on the roof.
Have the rest of 'em stand by in groups of 10.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Patty, put these over there where they can get them easily.
Carlos, give me that pad of paper and a pencil.
Yes, sir.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
Right.
Doug, are they going to land?
They're gonna try.
Send the kids out first...
and then the women.
Number this up to- I don't know...
a hundred or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
Doug, there may not be time to tell you later.
There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
All right, there's gonna be a lot of wind up there, especially when that chopper lands.
So everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back!
Stay back!
Look out!
I think so.
Roberts!
Mr. Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Pardon me.
Comin' through!
Comin' through!
Pardon me.
Here he is now.
Yeah?
Now look, Roberts, I know those pilots are dead and-
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I've told my two firemen up there to knock out a window.
We're gonna try to shoot a line to you from a chopper.
Okay.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
Uh, yeah, sure.
What do you want 'em for?
I wanna try somethin'.
Step way back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back.
You won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people down to the street.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof.
And two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman.
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Here, take this.
Take it.
You can get out of here.
Go on!
Take it.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Listen.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me down there worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me now, baby.
Help me.
If you ask me to go to the North Pole, or even the cliffs of Mendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
Ma'am, I'll take her.
Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
All right.
Hey.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to, ever again.
I'll meet you in the lobby.
I'll be waiting.
Uh, we're still a lady short.
You've gotta go.
But I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Hey, out of sight!
It's coming!
All right, let's untie this!
Take it all!
Pull in the rest of the line!
All right, hold it.
Hold it right there!
Bring me in another 20 feet on that main line!
Hey, come here!
Tie this off, will you?
All right.
That's right.
There you go!
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more.
That's it.
Hold it now!
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
Okay!
All right.
Let it go!
Let it go!
All right.
Go on!
Take it all!
Pull.
Come on.
Pull.
Okay, take up on it!
Make that line!
Fast!
How about the main line?
Secured?
Okay.
Good!
Chief!
Jonathan.
Explosion above 110.
Blew the scenic elevator right off its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
How many people in it?
Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
What are you gonna do?
Flaker.
- Flaker?
- Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have 'em pick me up on the roof of the Peerless Building.
We got it.
Yeah.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator, drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
It's all right.
It's okay.
I won't let anything happen.
I promise.
I won't cry if you won't cry.
Oh.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up the ladder there.
Okay, get it over.
Come on.
Come on.
Get it up here.
Okay!
Okay, let it go!
Look out below!
Come on!
Hey, make that chair fast!
All right!
Pull it right in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right!
Let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
All of us!
That's it!
All right!
Keep it goin'!
All right!
Hold it right there!
- Who's next in order?
- I am.
I am!
- Come ahead.
- I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
I'll fall!
I can't!
I can't!
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.
Oh, God.
Don't let go of me.
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Ah!
Don't
- Don't let go of me!
Oh, oh!
All right!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
God!
Okay.
Here she comes!
All right!
Pull that chair in!
Easy!
Easy!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable!
Grab that hook!
Steady it.
Hook on the torch.
Lash it tight.
This is O'Hallorhan.
We read you, Chief.
I want you to pick me up with the hook and set me down on the scenic elevator.
Then you're gonna pick up the scenic elevator... and very gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Okay.
Watch it.
Okay, take it away!
How much time do we have?
Bob, I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
Don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
Think this'll hold it?
It better.
We're gonna have to cut the elevator cable.
What's your number?
Sixty-eight.
Forty-seven.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, my God!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, no!
That was close.
Oh!
Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be- you'll be all right now.
Please.
You'll be all right.
Please, tell my husband I'll be all right.
I will.
You tell him I'll be all right.
I-I...
I will.
I'll be able to see him at home later.
I will.
I will.
I promise.
Let's go.
Here she is!
She's all right!
Watch the ladder!
Let's go!
Bring everything.
We're gonna need it!
Hey, Mike, deputy wants to see you.
Okay.
Yeah, Mike, look, we've been checking the situation up in the Promenade Room.
And we figure they've got only about 17, maybe 18, minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than three hours to get 'em all down by breeches buoy.
Those people are gonna die up there if something's not done.
Now, we might just have the answer.
Mr. Johnson's a structural engineer.
You tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists and risers up there in the Promenade Room, in my opinion, could definitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready out on the plaza.
Fireman, wait a minute.
Look, we'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold a million gallons of water.
That's more than enough to drown the fire.
- You're crazy.
- Mike, it's the only way.
Well, how do you know it'll work?
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think.
When you take into account... the stress and load factors, the building design-
Wait a minute.
Hold it.
Mike, look, we've already made the decision.
Now, someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow 'em.
Now, there's only two people in the department qualified for that.
That's you and Connors.
They just...
They just brought Connors down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Look, under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just layin' it out for you.
But you...
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
Huh.
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers, and you're gonna take your turn!
And if it's any consolation,
I'm going to be the last one outta here along with my son-in-law.
Roberts.
It's outta control.
And it's comin' your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
They wanna try somethin'.
They wanna blow those water tanks two floors above you.
They think it might kill the fire.
How they gonna get the explosives up here?
Oh, they'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell 'em.
They wanna try to put out the fire by blowing up the water tanks above us.
It's gonna mean a lot of water and steel and concrete, but if they don't try it... we're all gonna burn.
The fire's out of control below us.
They figure we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line!
- Get off!
- You crazy bastard!
Get off this line!
Let go of me!
It's not gonna work!
Oh!
It won't hold everybody!
You!
Get off!
Get outta there!
Get the hell outta there!
No!
No!
No!
Get off!
Chief.
Yeah.
Well, we just lost the breeches buoy.
There was panic up here.
It's under control now.
Okay.
I'm gonna try to set down on the roof.
I'm gonna need you up there.
Well, I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
Okay.
See you up there.
All right!
You're gonna have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts, anything you can find.
Carlos, get some knives.
For God's sakes, Carlos, don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass!
That's the '29!
Comin' through.
Comin' through.
Come on.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug, I... never thought that a thing like this could happen.
Sure.
Hey, how much time you think we got?
Ten minutes, maybe less.
We're gonna have to blow the floors out as well as the tanks, you know.
All right, this is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Now later on, after you throw the wire, we'll plug it and splice it into the timer, set it, and then it blows.
You set your explosive...
like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
Got it?
I got it.
Good luck.
See you later.
Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
How much you gonna set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Air.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go.
Fireman.
Bob!
Bob!
Oh, my God!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry.
She's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Claiborne!
What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know there's nothing that any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God that...
I can stop this from ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
A kind of shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
You know, one of these days, they're gonna kill 10,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'm gonna keep eatin' smoke and bringin' out bodies... until somebody asks us how to build 'em.
Okay.
I'm askin'.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.
-So how was it?
-Good.
-You're gonna go ahead?
-Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying:
"No matter how hot it gets up there during the day...
-... there'snota- -" -"Not a damn thing to do at night. "
What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
Come in the office for a minute.
I got people waiting upstairs.
I wanted to tell you...
... SenatorParker'scoming to the dedication tonight.
He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them.
I'll build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'll never leave.
After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay opened.
-Whatever happened to "hello"?
-Hello.
-How are you?
-Good.
You look like it took.
-Hi, Mr. Roberts.
-Just a second.
We'll miss you.
-Duncan know?
-He's all smiles.
-What electromagnets went in?
-Doug?
-Thompson G-4s.
-Don't you think they should be G-12s?
That's what comes from last-minute panic.
I'll fix it.
There's ground water on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in today.
How about Chicago specs?
-Philadelphia?
-In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Who's there?
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
All protein, no bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
I got about a $140 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will...
... remembertotellthemthat it was my idea.
Got change for a 50?
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.
Not a chance!
Let's see what we got here... .
Twenty-five, 50, 60...
... 70,75...
... 85,95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
All your security squad's up there... .
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us?
Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Here, let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
-Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that?
-I said how are you?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Okay, I'll get on it right now.
I'll have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.
Mr. Callahan?
We still got any G-12 electrodes?
-Yeah, main storeroom.
-Right.
Okay, booster pump, zone one.
-One-ten.
-Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?
I wouldn't like that at all!
The business offices only go up to 80.
From the 81 st floor, here...
... allthewayupto120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 8145... .
Say, Bill?
Tune in the main utility room.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
The sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello?
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean-
- I guess we've got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both.
Can I?
I don't know.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight.
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
-What about that?
-It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
Specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay, send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire...
... froma burned-outcircuitbreaker isn't conclusive.
Maybe not.
But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will, Doug...
... J.D.,waittillyou see this.
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?
We have an equipment problem.
-No problem in the tower, is there?
-Could be.
Come on.
You're just guessing.
I want to talk to your son-in-law.
I wanna talk to him right away.
-Get Roger Simmons.
-Yes, sir.
I guarantee I'll check this out.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah, a fire.
In this building?
Come on.
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
-The party should've been put off--
-Hold it, Will!
Everybody's overreacting.
-Mr.
Simmons is out, sir.
-Out where?
They don 't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'll decide what to do.
-That's okay, isn't it?
-Nope.
Won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it!
This is top priority.
We gotta get these electrical systems on.
Our security program's loused up without them.
Don't go away.
Doug!
Well, what a surprise!
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on, I'll get you a drink.
He must've done something.
My father called.
He hasn't been that upset in years.
Have any idea where he is?
Well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you wanna wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
-Can I get you a drink?
-No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
-Honey.
-Hello.
-What are you drinking these days?
-Nothing, right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a systems failure.
How can that be?
It can't be, theoretically.
Unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours?
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
All the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!
I asked for installations way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
That would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have!
In my office!
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks...
... evenifthat's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Nonsense.
Be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.
Here you are...
... youroriginalspecs.
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
-Susan.
-Hello, Dan.
Good evening.
-How are you, dear?
-Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
I'll meet you out front.
-I'd like to talk to Susan.
-Right.
Find me the architect who designed you...
... andwhoneedsDougRoberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who.
There are leaders from society and government...
... starsofscreenand television.
And now, just arriving, the Honorable Gary Parker...
... chairmanofthe Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator's in from Washington to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark...
... ina longsuccessionoflandmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
--being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
Later, I wanna ask you a few questions...
... andI expect some straight answers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower...
... tallestbuildingin theworld!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
After you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
I've never seen the bridge look like that.
-It's unbelievable!
-Astonishing!
-How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
-Fine, thank you.
Good night.
Shall I leave you a night line?
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Lorrie... .
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
We almost missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
Hello.
Hi.
-Promise me something?
-What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
I promise.
-How's the family?
-Fine, thank you.
Good.
Gary?
-Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
-Certainly.
-I've got a surprise for you.
-Politicians don't like surprises.
-Carlos?
-Yes, sir.
-What can I fix you?
-Meet Senator Parker.
-Great pleasure.
-It's an honor, senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
1929?
-That's all you'll drink tonight.
-A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'll ship to Washington.
-Open a bottle, will you?
-Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
I guess you're looking for someone.
I am.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?
-Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
-Susan, tell me... .
What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man...
... decidestoleavefor two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No headhunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
-You must miss your villa.
-Well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
-No false humility, please.
-Oh, shall we?
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco...
... toregainmy perspective and my humility...
... andspendmoretimeattheone thing I'm really good at:
The stock market.
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
You better leave it off.
Utility.
Wes.
Doug, I'm up on 83 with Will.
We got a wiring problem.
Overloads could be trouble.
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.
I can't do that.
All the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.
You mean the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
-Not all the power, just the overload!
-Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81.
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.
-I'll be in 81.
-You got it.
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
Pull it around over here.
Put it all over him.
Come on!
Let's get some water onto that fire.
Turn it on!
Down, down!
Stay low!
Call an ambulance for this man.
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor!
-The fire department?
-On their way.
Get that ambulance.
Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.
All right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
This is 81.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes, right away.
Call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a lot of people up there.
-What?
-Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
An ambulance is coming, but you better think about...
... gettingthosepeopledown on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but--
Well, then why the urgency?
Urgency?
If fluky wiring in this building caused that fire...
... firescouldbreakout everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 ...
... becauseitcan'tpossibly affect us up here...
... notinthisbuilding.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and--
Oh, Jesus!
-The glass tower!
-What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being inside a chimney.
Jesus!
How in the hell did they get here before we did?
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
-Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.
-Eighty-first floor, right?
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
-Set up a Forward Command.
-Got it.
Chief...
... thisisRoberts,the architect.
-What do we got here, Kappy?
-Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.
It's bad.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
-Exhaust system?
-Should've reversed automatically.
It must be a motor burnout.
-Sprinklers?
-They're not working on 81.
-Why not?
-I don't know.
-Jim?
-Yes, sir?
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.
-Floors have 3 and 1.5-inch outlets.
-GPM?
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1,000 from 68 to 100...
... and500fromtheretotheroof.
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
-What floor are your plans on?
-79.
My office.
That's two floors below the fire.
It'll be our Forward Command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
Architects!
Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.
But you keep building them as high as you can.
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?
What about the 81st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.
Not live-ins.
Businesses.
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.
Those that have are off at night.
I wanna know who they are, not where.
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?
Any wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Any sporting-good manufacturers, like table-tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?
-One tenant list, coming up.
-Thank you.
What do we got?
Elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
-Pipe alleys here?
-One, two, three, four, five.
-This is south?
-South.
Have you got any construction on 81?
Anything that can blow up, like gasoline, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'll be up on 81.
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.
Jack?
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
-I'll be up topside.
-Right.
Jack...
... watchyourself.
Keep it high.
-Looking for me, chief?
-If you're Duncan.
I am.
Everything under control?
Gotta move these people out of here.
Now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems...
... wehavedesignedintothis building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.
I don't think you're listening.
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.
-I'll do it.
-Hold it, hold it.
Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I could tell them, but you ought to.
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests...
... thattheparty'sbeingmoveddown below the fire floor.
Now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now, don't leave this table.
You, I wanna talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
-I most certainly did.
-For God's sake, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire.
If it was caused by what you did, I'll hang you out to dry.
And then I'm going to hang you!
Would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen... .
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire...
... inoneof ourstoragerooms...
... 50floorsbelow.
I assure you there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders...
... apurelyprecautionaryprocedure...
... we'regoingto movethe party down to the lobby for a while.
And we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators... .
Now, ladies and gentlemen...
... there'snoreasontorush .
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
-Lisolette!
-Frank!
Lisolette!
-How's it going, chief?
-Better get ready.
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire lapping?
-Are your com lines tested?
-Phone jacks on every floor.
-I'm plugging into your PA system.
-No sweat.
-Emergency setup?
-Battery-powered standby system.
Splice these lines into our two-way communications van.
Sure.
-No problem?
-No problem.
-How long will this take?
-A minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
The fire's lapping up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
What was that?
-Come on!
-The ceiling's going!
Men trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
Pull them out, pull them out!
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!
Battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!
Forward Command, go ahead.
Explosion on 81, fire headed toward elevator banks!
We need more crews up here fast!
-They need relief on 81.
Hit it.
-They're on their way.
Done!
Tell Duncan to stop those Tower Room people...
... fromusingthatexpresselevator, or somebody'll get killed.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads and some choppers here.
We may need them to get those people down.
Come on, Park.
I'll be on 81.
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.
I don't like how you talk to me.
-You drunk?
-Not yet.
-Then get out of my way!
-You didn't talk like this before.
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?
Shut up and help these people!
-Let me ask, father-in-law--
-Excuse me.
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?
Please!
Please!
Hold everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Move back into the Promenade Room...
... andwe'lltakeyou downby the scenic elevator.
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.
And with the probability of short circuits...
... thecarsmightstop on the floor where the fire is.
So please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there.
For God's sake, get out of there!
Please, back!
It looks bad, Jack.
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
The fire's spreading.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
Firemen, let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out!
Take it down!
Empty all the water out.
Chief, it's out of control.
Bring in another line!
Get another tank!
Angela?
Angela?
Phillip?
Phillip, open the door!
What ideas can I use upstairs...
... toexplainwhereI'vebeen all this time?
Well, what you might do is just...
... walkrightup to himand say , "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay...
... butmysecretary had an urgent personal problem. "
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
He won't.
-You know what astonishes me?
-What?
You make love with a girl...
... andthere'sno visibleevidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
Look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus!
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan?
Right.
-What'd they say?
-Help's on the way.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Please.
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
-They're aware of that.
-She's wearing a purple dress.
-I've got to find her!
-I promise, they'll find her.
Now, only 12 at a time.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
We'll be in the next group, maybe.
It won't be too long.
What's she doing on 87?
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf!
Sure, the kids can hear!
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
You stay there.
I'll get them down!
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
-We'll send them right up.
-Still got people on 87.
I'll get them down.
I'll give you a hand.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
Well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
At least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.
Don't go!
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
-You all right?
-The mother and children are in there.
-Don't worry.
We'll get them out.
-Wait!
Please, Mrs. Mueller!
Please stay back.
-What do you think?
-I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
!
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
-Mom, Mom!
-Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
Anybody else?
My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela?
Angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay, Angela.
Thank God!
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
-All right!
-That's it.
Don't crush.
It'll take hours to get everyone down.
Those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs.
-That's 135 floors.
-All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos!
-Yes, sir.
-Help us get this thing open.
Is it stuck?
Here, let me try to kick it.
-I'll call security.
-Yes, sir.
Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
You want it easy, chief?
They should design a survival suit for us like for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Let's go to work.
I need two men up the stairwell to the tower.
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay, you got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?
Glass will be sailing everywhere.
Tell the police to move those barricades four blocks back.
-Got it.
-Let's hit it.
Yo!
Security guard.
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty, almost missed you.
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip!
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip!
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, boy.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip!
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy.
Easy.
Don't look down!
Come on.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had a... .
I got up, but I'll have trouble getting down.
Can you help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck, real tight?
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Put her legs down.
Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.
Just hold on tight.
Hold on.
Hold on tight, now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
-Hold on, Angela.
-I've got ahold of you!
Get your arms around my neck!
Thattagirl.
Nurse?
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!
Take it slowly, now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt.
Try to get your hand over there.
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller!
Are you all right?
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God!
We're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on, let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
Inside, security phone on the right.
-Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
-I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
The fire's below us.
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.
It's the copter air-control officer.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.
I'm getting relief for you and your men.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.
Right away.
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs.
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby.
Thank you.
This ain't gonna help any!
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!
It's a fire door.
It's over 2.5 inches thick.
I could crawl through the duct.
Will we be able to go with you?
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right, I'll tell him.
-How is it on 65?
-They're containing it.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown.
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold on to me a second.
Hold on!
Christ!
That's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.
-Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
-Not for us.
-Where've you been?
-We had trouble getting here.
The Navy flight commander needs you.
Just walk 65 floors down?
Only five.
A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.
-Got it controlled?
-Getting there.
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike... .
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow. " Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another one there!
Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Anybody'll do.
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How--?
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.
-How're you doing?
-We're fine.
Glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
Mrs. Mueller?
It's Mr. Roberts!
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.
Okay, get down low.
-What kind of explosives are you using?
-It's plastic C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here, shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it up here.
Is there gonna be a bang?
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good going, Brian.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
-Hold it down!
-Listen!
I've been informed that there's no possibility...
... ofusingthisstairwaytogetout.
Now, I'm sorry.
Patty... .
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
-I'm getting out.
-Roger, you... .
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
-I guess you thought I stood you up.
-It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Can I get you anything else?
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the Peerless Building...
... andgetabreechesbuoy to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
-Doc?
-Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
-There's no way down.
-Thank God you're all right.
-Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
-I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
-Responsible?
-Feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase...
... liftaneyebrow in the exact same way...
... IseeandIhear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.
Right now...
... whatI needmost...
... isthis.
I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
-But you don't know anything about me.
-But I do.
You're penniless...
... youhaveno villa in the south of France...
... noantiquescoming,nopaintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But you see, your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively...
... ifyoudon'tenjoycheatingthem?
I came here to sell you 1 000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked...
... oratleastdisappointed.
-But I'm not.
-You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
I thought we were building something...
... wherepeoplecouldwork, live and be safe.
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials...
... weremadebecauseI,asabuilder, have a right to make those decisions.
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
-Who is it?
-Chief O'Hallorhan.
-What happened?
-Part of the central corridor just blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
It's too windy.
We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.
What can we do to help?
Move your combustible material away from the window.
Okay, gotcha.
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.
Jake, give me a hand.
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean...
... ifsheshouldhaveto.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
-Here he is.
-The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Get Roberts.
Get 10 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
-Doug, are they going to land?
-They're gonna try.
We'll send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 100 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
-There may not be time to tell you--
-There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'll be a lot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
Look out!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
Here he is now.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and l--
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
-Sure, what do you want them for?
-I want to try something.
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people out.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
Help me.
If you asked me to go to the North Pole...
... oreventhecliffsofMendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
-Ma'am, I'll take her.
-Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
-I'll meet you in the lobby.
-I'll be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
-You've gotta go.
-I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
All right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
All right, let it go!
Let it go!
All right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!
Explosion above 110...
... blewtheelevatoroff its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
-How many people in it?
-Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
What're you gonna go?
Flaker.
-Flaker!
-Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up out of there.
Pull it.
Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, let her go!
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
All right!
There's one in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right, let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
All right, keep it going!
All right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
-Come ahead!
-I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
-I can't!
-Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
-This is O'Hallorhan.
-We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook...
... andsetme downonthe scenic elevator.
Then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
You think this'll hold it?
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
-What's your number?
-68.
47.
Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now.
-You'll be all right.
-Tell my husband I'm all right.
-Tell him I'll be all right.
-I will.
-And I'll see him at home later.
-I will.
Let's go.
Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
Watch the ladder.
Hey, Mike...
... deputywantsto seeyou .
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 17 or 18 minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'll die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room...
... coulddefinitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
-You're crazy.
-Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design--
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you... .
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation...
... I'llbethelastoneoutof here along with my son-in-law.
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'll kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'll burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line.
Get off!
-You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
-Let go of me!
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
-Get the hell out of there!
-Go!
Get off.
Chief.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
See you up there.
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts...
... anythingyoucanfind!
-Carlos!
-Yes, sir.
Get some knives.
There we go.
For God's sakes, Carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug...
... Ineverthoughtthiscouldhappen.
Sure.
-How much time you think we got?
-Ten minutes, maybe less.
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
All right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire...
... we'llplugit andspliceitinto the timer, set it, and it blows.
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
-Got it?
-I got it.
-Good luck.
See you later.
-Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman?
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
-Claiborne!
-What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God...
... thatI canstopthisfrom ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'll kill 1 0,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies...
... untilsomebodyasksus...
... howtobuildthem.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.

- So how was it?
- Good.
- You're gonna go ahead?
- Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying:
"No matter how hot it gets up there during the day there's not a..." - "Not a damn thing to do at night."
What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
Come in the office for a minute.
I got people waiting upstairs.
I wanted to tell you Senator Parker's coming to the dedication tonight.
He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them.
I'll build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'll never leave.
After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay opened.
- Whatever happened to "hello"?
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Good.
You look like it took.
- Hi, Mr. Roberts.
- Just a second.
We'll miss you.
- Duncan know?
- He's all smiles.
- What electromagnets went in?
- Doug?
- Thompson G-4s.
- Don't you think they should be G-12s?
That's what comes from last-minute panic.
I'll fix it.
There's ground water on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in today.
How about Chicago specs?
- Philadelphia?
- In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Who's there?
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
All protein, no bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
I got about a $ 140 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will remember to tell them that it was my idea.
Got change for a 50?
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.
Not a chance!
Let's see what we got here...
Twenty-five, 50, 60 70, 75 85, 95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
All your security squad's up there...
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us?
Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Here, let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
- Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that?
- I said how are you?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Okay, I'll get on it right now.
I'll have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.
Mr. Callahan?
We still got any G-12 electrodes?
- Yeah, main storeroom.
- Right.
Okay, booster pump, zone one.
- One-ten.
- Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?
I wouldn't like that at all!
The business offices only go up to 80.
From the 81 st floor, here all the way up to 120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 8145...
Say, Bill?
Tune in the main utility room.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
The sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello?
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean...
I guess we've got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both.
Can I?
I don't know.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight.
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
- What about that?
- It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
Specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay, send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire from a burned-out circuit breaker isn't conclusive.
Maybe not.
But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will, Doug J.D., wait till you see this.
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?
We have an equipment problem.
- No problem in the tower, is there?
- Could be.
Come on.
You're just guessing.
I want to talk to your son-in-law.
I wanna talk to him right away.
- Get Roger Simmons.
- Yes, sir.
I guarantee I'll check this out.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah, a fire.
In this building?
Come on.
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
- The party should've been put off...
- Hold it, Will!
Everybody's overreacting.
- Mr. Simmons is out, sir.
- Out where?
They don 't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'll decide what to do.
- That's okay, isn't it?
- Nope.
Won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it!
This is top priority.
We gotta get these electrical systems on.
Our security program's loused up without them.
Don't go away.
Doug!
Well, what a surprise!
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on, I'll get you a drink.
He must've done something.
My father called.
He hasn't been that upset in years.
Have any idea where he is?
Well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you wanna wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
- Honey.
- Hello.
- What are you drinking these days?
- Nothing, right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a systems failure.
How can that be?
It can't be, theoretically.
Unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours?
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
All the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!
I asked for installations way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
That would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have!
In my office!
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks even if that's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Nonsense.
Be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.
Here you are your original specs.
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
- Susan.
- Hello, Dan.
Good evening.
- How are you, dear?
- Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
I'll meet you out front.
- I'd like to talk to Susan.
- Right.
Find me the architect who designed you and who needs Doug Roberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who.
There are leaders from society and government stars of screen and television.
And now, just arriving, the Honorable Gary Parker chairman of the Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator's in from Washington to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark in a long succession of landmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
- Being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. And Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
Later, I wanna ask you a few questions and I expect some straight answers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower tallest building in the world!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
After you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
I've never seen the bridge look like that.
- It's unbelievable!
- Astonishing!
- How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
- Fine, thank you.
Good night.
Shall I leave you a night line?
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Lorrie...
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
We almost missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
Hello.
Hi.
- Promise me something?
- What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
I promise.
- How's the family?
- Fine, thank you.
Good.
Gary?
- Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
- Certainly.
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Politicians don't like surprises.
- Carlos?
- Yes, sir.
- What can I fix you?
- Meet Senator Parker.
- Great pleasure.
- It's an honor, senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
1929?
- That's all you'll drink tonight.
- A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'll ship to Washington.
- Open a bottle, will you?
- Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
I guess you're looking for someone.
I am.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?
- Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
- Susan, tell me...
What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man decides to leave for two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No headhunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
- You must miss your villa.
- Well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
- No false humility, please.
- Oh, shall we?
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco to regain my perspective and my humility and spend more time at the one thing I'm really good at:
The stock market.
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
You better leave it off.
Utility.
Wes.
Doug, I'm up on 83 with Will.
We got a wiring problem.
Overloads could be trouble.
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.
I can't do that.
All the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.
You mean the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
- Not all the power, just the overload!
- Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81.
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.
- I'll be in 81.
- You got it.
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
Pull it around over here.
Put it all over him.
Come on!
Let's get some water onto that fire.
Turn it on!
Down, down!
Stay low!
Call an ambulance for this man.
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor!
- The fire department?
- On their way.
Get that ambulance.
Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.
All right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
This is 81.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes, right away.
Call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a lot of people up there.
- What?
- Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
An ambulance is coming, but you better think about getting those people down on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but...
Well, then why the urgency?
Urgency?
If fluky wiring in this building caused that fire fires could break out everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 because it can't possibly affect us up here not in this building.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and...
Oh, Jesus!
- The glass tower!
- What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being inside a chimney.
Jesus!
How in the hell did they get here before we did?
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
- Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.
- Eighty-first floor, right?
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
- Set up a Forward Command.
- Got it.
Chief this is Roberts, the architect.
- What do we got here, Kappy?
- Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.
It's bad.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
- Exhaust system?
- Should've reversed automatically.
It must be a motor burnout.
- Sprinklers?
- They're not working on 81.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
- Jim?
- Yes, sir?
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.
- Floors have 3 and 1.5- inch outlets.
- GPM?
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1000 from 68 to 100 and 500 from there to the roof.
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
- What floor are your plans on?
- 79.
My office.
That's two floors below the fire.
It'll be our Forward Command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
Architects!
Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.
But you keep building them as high as you can.
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?
What about the 81 st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.
Not live-ins.
Businesses.
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.
Those that have are off at night.
I wanna know who they are, not where.
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?
Any wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Any sporting-good manufacturers, like table-tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?
- One tenant list, coming up.
- Thank you.
What do we got?
Elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
- Pipe alleys here?
- One, two, three, four, five.
- This is south?
- South.
Have you got any construction on 81?
Anything that can blow up, like gasoline, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'll be up on 81.
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.
Jack?
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
- I'll be up topside.
- Right.
Jack watch yourself.
Keep it high.
- Looking for me, chief?
- If you're Duncan.
I am.
Everything under control?
Gotta move these people out of here.
Now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems we have designed into this building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.
I don't think you're listening.
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.
- I'll do it.
- Hold it, hold it.
Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I could tell them, but you ought to.
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests that the party's being moved down below the fire floor.
Now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now, don't leave this table.
You, I wanna talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
- I most certainly did.
- For God's sake, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire.
If it was caused by what you did, I'll hang you out to dry.
And then I'm going to hang you!
Would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire in one of our storage rooms 50 floors below.
I assure you there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders a purely precautionary procedure we're going to move the party down to the lobby for a while.
And we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators...
Now, ladies and gentlemen there's no reason to rush.
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
- Lisolette!
- Frank!
Lisolette!
- How's it going, chief?
- Better get ready.
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire lapping?
- Are your com lines tested?
- Phone jacks on every floor.
- I'm plugging into your PA system.
- No sweat.
- Emergency setup?
- Battery-powered standby system.
Splice these lines into our two-way communications van.
Sure.
- No problem?
- No problem.
- How long will this take?
- A minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
The fire's lapping up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
What was that?
- Come on!
- The ceiling's going!
Men trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
Pull them out, pull them out!
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!
Battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!
Forward Command, go ahead.
Explosion on 81, fire headed toward elevator banks!
We need more crews up here fast!
- They need relief on 81.
Hit it.
- They're on their way.
Done!
Tell Duncan to stop those Tower Room people from using that express elevator, or somebody'll get killed.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads and some choppers here.
We may need them to get those people down.
Come on, Park.
I'll be on 81.
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.
I don't like how you talk to me.
- You drunk?
- Not yet.
- Then get out of my way!
- You didn't talk like this before.
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?
Shut up and help these people!
- Let me ask, father-in-law...
- Excuse me.
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?
Please!
Please!
Hold everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Move back into the Promenade Room and we'll take you down by the scenic elevator.
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.
And with the probability of short circuits the cars might stop on the floor where the fire is.
So please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there.
For God's sake, get out of there!
Please, back!
It looks bad, Jack.
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
The fire's spreading.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
Firemen, let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out!
Take it down!
Empty all the water out.
Chief, it's out of control.
Bring in another line!
Get another tank!
Angela?
Angela?
Phillip?
Phillip, open the door!
What ideas can I use upstairs to explain where I've been all this time?
Well, what you might do is just walk right up to him and say, "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay but my secretary had an urgent personal problem."
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
He won't.
- You know what astonishes me?
- What?
You make love with a girl and there's no visible evidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
Look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus!
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan?
Right.
- What'd they say?
- Help's on the way.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Please.
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
- They're aware of that.
- She's wearing a purple dress.
- I've got to find her!
- I promise, they'll find her.
Now, only 12 at a time.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
We'll be in the next group, maybe.
It won't be too long.
What's she doing on 87?
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf!
Sure, the kids can hear!
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
You stay there.
I'll get them down!
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
- We'll send them right up.
- Still got people on 87.
I'll get them down.
I'll give you a hand.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
Well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
At least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.
Don't go!
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
- You all right?
- The mother and children are in there.
- Don't worry.
We'll get them out.
- Wait!
Please, Mrs. Mueller!
Please stay back.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
!
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
- Mom, Mom!
- Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
Anybody else?
My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela?
Angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay, Angela.
Thank God!
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
- All right!
- That's it.
Don't crush.
It'll take hours to get everyone down.
Those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs.
- That's 135 floors.
- All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos!
- Yes, sir.
- Help us get this thing open.
Is it stuck?
Here, let me try to kick it.
- I'll call security.
- Yes, sir.
Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
You want it easy, chief?
They should design a survival suit for us like for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Let's go to work.
I need two men up the stairwell to the tower.
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay, you got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?
Glass will be sailing everywhere.
Tell the police to move those barricades four blocks back.
- Got it.
- Let's hit it.
Yo!
Security guard.
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty, almost missed you.
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip!
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip!
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, boy.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip!
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy.
Easy.
Don't look down!
Come on.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had a...
I got up, but I'll have trouble getting down.
Can you help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck, real tight?
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Put her legs down.
Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.
Just hold on tight.
Hold on.
Hold on tight, now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
- Hold on, Angela.
- I've got ahold of you!
Get your arms around my neck!
Thattagirl.
Nurse?
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!
Take it slowly, now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt.
Try to get your hand over there.
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller!
Are you all right?
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God!
We're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on, let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
Inside, security phone on the right.
- Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
- I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
The fire's below us.
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.
It's the copter air-control officer.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.
I'm getting relief for you and your men.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.
Right away.
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs.
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby.
Thank you.
This ain't gonna help any!
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!
It's a fire door.
It's over 2.5 inches thick.
I could crawl through the duct.
Will we be able to go with you?
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right, I'll tell him.
- How is it on 65?
- They're containing it.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown.
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold on to me a second.
Hold on!
Christ!
That's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.
- Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
- Not for us.
- Where've you been?
- We had trouble getting here.
The Navy flight commander needs you.
Just walk 65 floors down?
Only five.
A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.
- Got it controlled?
- Getting there.
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike...
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow." Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another one there!
Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Anybody'll do.
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How...?
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.
- How're you doing?
- We're fine.
Glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
Mrs. Mueller?
It's Mr. Roberts!
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.
Okay, get down low.
- What kind of explosives are you using?
- It's plastic C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here, shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it up here.
Is there gonna be a bang?
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good going, Brian.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
- Hold it down!
- Listen!
I've been informed that there's no possibility of using this stairway to get out.
Now, I'm sorry.
Patty...
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
- I'm getting out.
- Roger, you...
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
- I guess you thought I stood you up.
- It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Can I get you anything else?
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the Peerless Building and get a breeches buoy to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
- Doc?
- Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
- There's no way down.
- Thank God you're all right.
- Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
- I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
- Responsible?
- Feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase lift an eyebrow in the exact same way I see and I hear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.
Right now what I need most is this.
I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
- But you don't know anything about me.
- But I do.
You're penniless you have no villa in the south of France no antiques coming, no paintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But you see, your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively if you don't enjoy cheating them?
I came here to sell you 1000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked or at least disappointed.
- But I'm not.
- You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
I thought we were building something where people could work, live and be safe.
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials were made because I, as a builder, have a right to make those decisions.
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
- Who is it?
- Chief O'Hallorhan.
- What happened?
- Part of the central corridor just blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
It's too windy.
We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.
What can we do to help?
Move your combustible material away from the window.
Okay, gotcha.
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.
Jake, give me a hand.
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean if she should have to.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
- Here he is.
- The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Get Roberts.
Get 10 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
- Doug, are they going to land?
- They're gonna try.
We'll send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 100 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
- There may not be time to tell you...
- There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'll be a lot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
Look out!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
Here he is now.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and I...
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
- Sure, what do you want them for?
- I want to try something.
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people out.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
Help me.
If you asked me to go to the North Pole or even the cliffs of Mendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
- Ma'am, I'll take her.
- Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- I'll be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
- You've gotta go.
- I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
All right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
All right, let it go!
Let it go!
All right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!
Explosion above 110 blew the elevator off its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
- How many people in it?
- Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
What're you gonna go?
Flaker.
- Flaker!
- Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up out of there.
Pull it.
Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, let her go!
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
All right!
There's one in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right, let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
All right, keep it going!
All right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
- Come ahead!
- I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
- I can't!
- Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
- This is O'Hallorhan.
- We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook and set me down on the scenic elevator.
Then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
You think this'll hold it?
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
- What's your number?
- 68.
47.
Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now.
- You'll be all right.
- Tell my husband I'm all right.
- Tell him I'll be all right.
- I will.
- And I'll see him at home later.
- I will.
Let's go.
Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
Watch the ladder.
Hey, Mike deputy wants to see you.
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 17 or 18 minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'll die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room could definitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
- You're crazy.
- Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design...
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you...
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation I'll be the last one out of here along with my son-in-law.
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'll kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'll burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line.
Get off!
- You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
- Let go of me!
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
- Get the hell out of there!
- Go!
Get off.
Chief.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
See you up there.
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts anything you can find!
- Carlos!
- Yes, sir.
Get some knives.
There we go.
For God's sakes, Carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug I never thought this could happen.
Sure.
- How much time you think we got?
- Ten minutes, maybe less.
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
All right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire we'll plug it and splice it into the timer, set it, and it blows.
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
- Got it?
- I got it.
- Good luck.
See you later.
- Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman?
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
- Claiborne!
- What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God that I can stop this from ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'll kill 10,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies until somebody asks us how to build them.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.

-So how was it?
-Good.
-You're gonna go ahead?
-full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying:
"No matter how hot it gets up there during the day...
-... there'snota- -" -" Not a damn thing to do at night. "
What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a Iow threshold of boredom.
You'II be back in two weeks.
Come in the office for a minute.
I got people waiting upstairs.
I wanted to tell you...
... SenatorParker'scoming to the dedication tonight.
He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them.
I'II build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'II never leave.
After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay opened.
-Whatever happened to " hello" ?
-hello.
-How are you?
-Good.
You look like it took.
-Hi, Mr. Roberts.
-Just a second.
We'II miss you.
-Duncan know?
-He's all smiles.
-What eIectromagnets went in?
-Doug?
-Thompson G-4s.
-Don't you think they should be G-1 2s?
That's what comes from Iast-minute panic.
I'II fix it.
There's ground water on that atlanta job.
Bring the designs in today.
How about Chicago specs?
-philadelphia?
-In a minute, guys.
well, hello.
welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Who's there?
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
AII protein, no bread.
AII I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
AII I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
I got about a $ 1 40 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will...
... remembertotellthemthat it was my idea.
Got change for a 50?
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.
Not a chance!
Let's see what we got here... .
Twenty-five, 50, 60...
... 70,75...
... 85,95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
AII your security squad's up there... .
hello, Mrs. AIIbright.
Hi, phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoaIs.
Mommy wants to know if you'II have dinner with us?
Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Here, Iet me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, phillip?
-Sorry, Mrs. MueIIer, what was that?
-I said how are you?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Okay, I'II get on it right now.
I'II have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.
Mr. CaIIahan?
We still got any G-1 2 electrodes?
-Yeah, main storeroom.
-Right.
Okay, booster pump, zone one.
-One-ten.
-Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?
I wouldn't like that at all!
The business offices only go up to 80.
From the 81 st floor, here...
... allthewayupto120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 81 45... .
Say, bill?
Tune in the main utility room.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
The sensor indicates there is.
plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
hello?
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean-
- I guess we've got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
I want the kind of Iife you're talking about.
I want that.
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both.
Can I?
I don't know.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight.
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
-What about that?
-It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
CaIIahan called me.
Now just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
Specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay, send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire...
... froma burned-outcircuitbreaker isn't conclusive.
Maybe not.
But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
will, Doug...
... J.D.,waittillyou see this.
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?
We have an equipment problem.
-No problem in the tower, is there?
-could be.
Come on.
You're just guessing.
I want to talk to your son-in-Iaw.
I wanna talk to him right away.
-Get Roger Simmons.
-Yes, sir.
I guarantee I'II check this out.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah, a fire.
In this building?
Come on.
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
-The party should've been put off--
-hold it, will!
Everybody's overreacting.
-Mr.
Simmons is out, sir.
-Out where?
They don 't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
We'II talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'II decide what to do.
-That's okay, isn't it?
-Nope.
Won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it!
This is top priority.
We gotta get these electrical systems on.
Our security program's Ioused up without them.
Don't go away.
Doug!
well, what a surprise!
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on, I'II get you a drink.
He must've done something.
My father called.
He hasn't been that upset in years.
Have any idea where he is?
well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-miIe radius.
But if you wanna wait, he'II show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
-Can I get you a drink?
-No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
-Honey.
-hello.
-What are you drinking these days?
-Nothing, right now.
well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
CaIIahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a systems failure.
How can that be?
It can't be, theoretically.
unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'II understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours?
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Listen.
We had an electrical fIare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
AII the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!
I asked for installations way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
That would take weeks and a Iot more clout than you have!
In my office!
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks...
... evenifthat's what you want me to do.
AII I want is the man I thought I married.
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you Iike your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Nonsense.
Be a good girl, elke.
I Ieft you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.
Here you are...
... youroriginalspecs.
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
-Susan.
-hello, Dan.
Good evening.
-How are you, dear?
-congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
I'II meet you out front.
-I'd Iike to talk to Susan.
-Right.
Find me the architect who designed you...
... andwhoneedsDougRoberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who.
There are leaders from society and government...
... starsofscreenand television.
And now, just arriving, the honorable Gary Parker...
... chairmanofthe federal Urban renewal Commission.
The senator's in from Washington to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'II try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark...
... ina Iongsuccessionoflandmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
--being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
Later, I wanna ask you a few questions...
... andI expect some straight answers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower...
... tallestbuildingin theworld!
We'II make it.
That's it.
AII right, CaIIahan?
Hit them.
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
After you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'II be up in a few minutes.
I've never seen the bridge look like that.
-It's unbelievable!
-Astonishing!
-How did it go down there, Mr. BigeIow?
-Fine, thank you.
Good night.
shall I leave you a night line?
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Lorrie... .
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
We almost missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
hello.
Hi.
-Promise me something?
-What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
I promise.
-How's the family?
-Fine, thank you.
Good.
Gary?
-would you excuse us, gentlemen?
-certainly.
-I've got a surprise for you.
-politicians don't like surprises.
-carlos?
-Yes, sir.
-What can I fix you?
-Meet Senator Parker.
-Great pleasure.
-It's an honor, senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
1 929?
-That's all you'II drink tonight.
-A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'II ship to Washington.
-Open a bottle, will you?
-Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
I guess you're looking for someone.
I am.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?
-Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
-Susan, tell me... .
What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man...
... decidestoleavefor two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No headhunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
-You must miss your villa.
-well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
-No false humility, please.
-Oh, shall we?
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco...
... toregainmy perspective and my humility...
... andspendmoretimeattheone thing I'm really good at:
The stock market.
Monte carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
You better leave it off.
utility.
Wes.
Doug, I'm up on 83 with will.
We got a wiring problem.
OverIoads could be trouble.
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.
I can't do that.
AII the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.
You mean the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'II accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
-Not all the power, just the overload!
-Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81 .
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.
-I'II be in 81 .
-You got it.
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
pull it around over here.
Put it all over him.
Come on!
Let's get some water onto that fire.
Turn it on!
Down, down!
Stay low!
call an ambulance for this man.
Get on the ball!
call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor!
-The fire department?
-On their way.
Get that ambulance.
Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.
AII right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
This is 81 .
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes, right away.
call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a Iot of people up there.
-What?
-Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
will Giddings has been badly burned.
will Giddings burned?
How?
An ambulance is coming, but you better think about...
... gettingthosepeopledown on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
well, I think it's under control, but--
well, then why the urgency?
Urgency?
If fIuky wiring in this building caused that fire...
... firescouldbreakout everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
I feel sorry for will Giddings, but he'II be taken care of.
But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 ...
... becauseitcan'tpossibly affect us up here...
... notinthisbuilding.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and--
Oh, Jesus!
-The glass tower!
-What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being inside a chimney.
Jesus!
How in the hell did they get here before we did?
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
-Mike, she's throwing a Iot of smoke.
-Eighty-first floor, right?
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
-Set up a Forward Command.
-Got it.
Chief...
... thisisRoberts,the architect.
-What do we got here, Kappy?
-Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.
It's bad.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
-Exhaust system?
-should've reversed automatically.
It must be a motor burnout.
-sprinklers?
-They're not working on 81 .
-Why not?
-I don't know.
-Jim?
-Yes, sir?
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.
-floors have 3 and 1 .5-inch outlets.
-GPM?
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1 000 from 68 to 1 00...
... and500fromtheretotheroof.
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
-What floor are your plans on?
-79.
My office.
That's two floors below the fire.
It'II be our Forward Command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
Architects!
Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.
But you keep building them as high as you can.
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?
What about the 81 st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.
Not Iive-ins.
Businesses.
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.
Those that have are off at night.
I wanna know who they are, not where.
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?
Any wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Any sporting-good manufacturers, Iike tabIe-tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?
-One tenant list, coming up.
-Thank you.
What do we got?
elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
-Pipe alleys here?
-One, two, three, four, five.
-This is south?
-South.
Have you got any construction on 81 ?
Anything that can blow up, Iike gasoline, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'II be up on 81 .
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'II watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.
Jack?
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
-I'II be up topside.
-Right.
Jack...
... watchyourself.
Keep it high.
-Looking for me, chief?
-If you're Duncan.
I am.
Everything under control?
Gotta move these people out of here.
Now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems...
... wehavedesignedintothis building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.
I don't think you're listening.
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.
-I'II do it.
-hold it, hold it.
Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I couId tell them, but you ought to.
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests...
... thattheparty'sbeingmoveddown below the fire floor.
Now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now, don't leave this table.
You, I wanna talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
-I most certainly did.
-For God's sake, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire.
If it was caused by what you did, I'II hang you out to dry.
And then I'm going to hang you!
would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen... .
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire...
... inoneof ourstoragerooms...
... 50floorsbelow.
I assure you there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders...
... apurelyprecautionaryprocedure...
... we'regoingto movethe party down to the lobby for a while.
And we'II be serving cocktails and champagne in our continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators... .
Now, ladies and gentlemen...
... there'snoreasontorush .
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'II be right back.
-LisoIette!
-Frank!
LisoIette!
-How's it going, chief?
-Better get ready.
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire Iapping?
-Are your com lines tested?
-Phone jacks on every floor.
-I'm plugging into your PA system.
-No sweat.
-Emergency setup?
-Battery-powered standby system.
splice these lines into our two-way communications van.
Sure.
-No problem?
-No problem.
-How long will this take?
-A minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
The fire's lapping up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
What was that?
-Come on!
-The ceiling's going!
Men trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
pull them out, pull them out!
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!
battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!
Forward Command, go ahead.
explosion on 81 , fire headed toward elevator banks!
We need more crews up here fast!
-They need relief on 81 .
Hit it.
-They're on their way.
Done!
tell Duncan to stop those Tower Room people...
... fromusingthatexpresselevator, or somebody'II get killed.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads and some choppers here.
We may need them to get those people down.
Come on, Park.
I'II be on 81 .
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.
I don't like how you talk to me.
-You drunk?
-Not yet.
-Then get out of my way!
-You didn't talk like this before.
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?
Shut up and help these people!
-Let me ask, father-in-Iaw--
-Excuse me.
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?
please!
please!
hold everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Move back into the Promenade Room...
... andwe'IItakeyou downby the scenic elevator.
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.
And with the probability of short circuits...
... thecarsmightstop on the floor where the fire is.
So please, we'II use the scenic elevators over there.
For God's sake, get out of there!
please, back!
It looks bad, Jack.
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
The fire's spreading.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'II check the other corridors.
Firemen, Iet's pull it down before it faIIs down.
Bring it out!
Take it down!
Empty all the water out.
Chief, it's out of control.
Bring in another line!
Get another tank!
angela?
angela?
phillip?
phillip, open the door!
What ideas can I use upstairs...
... toexplainwhereI'vebeen all this time?
well, what you might do is just...
... walkrightup to himand say , "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay...
... butmysecretary had an urgent personal problem. "
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
He won't.
-You know what astonishes me?
-What?
You make love with a girl...
... andthere'sno visibleevidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
Look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I Iove you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus!
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan?
Right.
-What'd they say?
-help's on the way.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'II just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, ma'am.
please.
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
-They're aware of that.
-She's wearing a purple dress.
-I've got to find her!
-I promise, they'II find her.
Now, only 1 2 at a time.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
We'II be in the next group, maybe.
It won't be too long.
What's she doing on 87?
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf!
Sure, the kids can hear!
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
You stay there.
I'II get them down!
AII my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
-We'll send them right up.
-still got people on 87.
I'II get them down.
I'II give you a hand.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
At least they'II never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 1 00 in 1 0 fIat.
Don't go!
I'II be back with the whole fire department.
-You all right?
-The mother and children are in there.
-Don't worry.
We'II get them out.
-Wait!
please, Mrs. MueIIer!
please stay back.
-What do you think?
-I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'II take the back.
I got Mrs. AIIbright.
Anybody in here?
!
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
-Mom, Mom!
-Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
Anybody else?
My sister.
Where's angela?
He'II get her.

angela?
angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay, angela.
Thank God!
hold it right here.
hold it right here.
-AII right!
-That's it.
Don't crush.
It'II take hours to get everyone down.
Those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs.
-That's 1 35 floors.
-AII downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
carlos!
-Yes, sir.
-help us get this thing open.
Is it stuck?
Here, Iet me try to kick it.
-I'II call security.
-Yes, sir.
battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
You want it easy, chief?
They should design a survival suit for us like for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Let's go to work.
I need two men up the stairwell to the tower.
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay, you got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?

-Got it.
-Let's hit it.
Yo!
Security guard.
Anyone here?
hello.
Security.
Say, kitty, almost missed you.
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
phillip!
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, phillip!
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, boy.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, phillip.
Come on, phillip!
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy.
Easy.
Don't look down!
Come on.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had a... .
I got up, but I'II have trouble getting down.
Can you help me?
could you just hold on around my neck, real tight?
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Put her legs down.
hold on tight.
hold on real tight, now.
Just hold on tight.

It's gonna be okay now.

Easy now.

Get your arms around my neck!
ThattagirI.
Nurse?
Mrs. MueIIer, come on!
You gotta try!
Take it slowly, now.
You've got about a foot to go.
feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt.
Try to get your hand over there.
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. MueIIer!
Are you all right?
AII right, Iet's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm coming.

Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God!
We're cut off.

Come on, Iet's go.
Chief O'HaIIorhan?
Inside, security phone on the right.
-Get me Chief O'HaIIorhan.
-I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
The fire's below us.
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
I'II send up another truck company.
pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.
It's the copter air-controI officer.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.
I'm getting relief for you and your men.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief FIaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.
Right away.
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then, sir, we'II just trot up the stairs.
You'II just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby.
Thank you.
This ain't gonna help any!
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!
It's a fire door.
It's over 2.5 inches thick.
I couId crawl through the duct.
will we be able to go with you?
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 1 35 floors straight down.
phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
AII right, I'II tell him.
-How is it on 65?
-They're containing it.
well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown.
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
What's the Iast report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
hold on to me a second.
hold on!
Christ!
That's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We'II rappeI down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'II fall.
I know I'II fall.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you faII, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'II tell him.
-Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
-Not for us.
-Where've you been?
-We had trouble getting here.
The Navy flight commander needs you.
Just walk 65 floors down?
only five.
A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.
-Got it controlled?
-Getting there.
You men stay here with the chief.
tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike... .
This one of your men?
"Dan BigeIow. " Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Okay to O'HaIIorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another one there!
carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
How'd you get in here?
I'II give it to you later.
Give me O'HaIIorhan.
Anybody'II do.
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How--?
Oh, my Lord, elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'II be all right.
-hello, ma'am.
-hello.
-How're you doing?
-We're fine.
glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
Mrs. MueIIer?
It's Mr. Roberts!
Mrs. MueIIer!
phillip!
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, Iet's get down there.
Out of the way.
please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.
Okay, get down low.
-What kind of explosives are you using?
-It's plastic C-4.
blow a hole in anything.
Here, shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it up here.
Is there gonna be a bang?
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'II be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good going, Brian.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
-hold it down!
-Listen!
I've been informed that there's no possibility...
... ofusingthisstairwaytogetout.
Now, I'm sorry.
Patty... .
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
-I'm getting out.
-Roger, you... .
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
-I guess you thought I stood you up.
-It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Those helicopters, they'II get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Can I get you anything else?
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the peerless building...
... andgetabreechesbuoy to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'II get right on it.
-Doc?
-Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
-There's no way down.
-Thank God you're all right.
-Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
-I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
-responsible?
-feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at Ieast on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase...
... liftaneyebrow in the exact same way...
... IseeandIhear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.
Right now...
... whatI needmost...
... isthis.
I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
-But you don't know anything about me.
-But I do.
You're penniless...
... youhaveno villa in the south of France...
... noantiquescoming,nopaintings.
But, HarIee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But you see, your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively...
... ifyoudon'tenjoycheatingthem?
I came here to sell you 1 000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
beautiful engraving.
I'd Iike to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked...
... oratIeastdisappointed.
-But I'm not.
-You must be!
HarIee, I'm not.
I'II be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
I thought we were building something...
... wherepeoplecouldwork, live and be safe.
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials...
... weremadebecauseI,asabuilder, have a right to make those decisions.
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-Iaw of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
-Who is it?
-Chief O'HaIIorhan.
-What happened?
-Part of the central corridor just blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
It's too windy.
We'II set up the breeches buoy on the peerless building.
What can we do to help?
Move your combustible material away from the window.
Okay, gotcha.
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.
Jake, give me a hand.
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'II all be home together.
If only I couId have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
told her how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean...
... ifsheshouldhaveto.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
-Here he is.
-The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Get Roberts.
Get 1 0 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
-Doug, are they going to land?
-They're gonna try.
We'II send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 1 00 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
-There may not be time to tell you--
-There will be.
I'II go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'II be a Iot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
Look out!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'HaIIorhan wants to speak to you.
AII right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
Here he is now.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and I--
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'II try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
-Sure, what do you want them for?
-I want to try something.
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at Ieast we can get 1 2 people out.
Which 1 2?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
AII right, Iet's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
help me.
If you asked me to go to the North pole...
... oreventhecliffsofMendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
please.
-Ma'am, I'II take her.
-Thank you.
Come on, phillip.
I'II never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
-I'II meet you in the lobby.
-I'II be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
-You've gotta go.
-I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'II make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
please.
AII set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
AII right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
AII right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
AII right, Iet it go!
Let it go!
AII right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!
explosion above 1 1 0...
... blewtheelevatoroff its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
-How many people in it?
-Loaded.
I'd say about 1 2.
What're you gonna go?
FIaker.
-FIaker!
-Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the peerless building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up out of there.
pull it.
Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, Iet her go!
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
AII right!
There's one in there!
Come on!

AII right, Iet's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
AII right, keep it going!
AII right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
-Come ahead!
-I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
-I can't!
-Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
-This is O'HaIIorhan.
-We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook...
... andsetme downonthe scenic elevator.
Then you'II pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'II let me stay.
Come on.
I'II see you soon.
I Iove you.
Let it go!
You think this'II hold it?
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
-What's your number?
-68.
47.
Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'II be all right now.
-You'II be all right.
-tell my husband I'm all right.
-tell him I'II be all right.
-I will.
-And I'II see him at home later.
-I will.
Let's go.
Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
Watch the ladder.
Hey, Mike...
... deputywantsto seeyou .
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 1 7 or 1 8 minutes left, if that.
It'II take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'II die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room...
... coulddefinitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'II handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1 ,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
-You're crazy.
-Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design--
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you... .
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation...
... I'IIbetheIastoneoutof here along with my son-in-Iaw.
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 1 5 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'II kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'II find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'II tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'II eat a Iot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'II burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 1 5 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line.
Get off!
-You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
-Let go of me!
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
-Get the hell out of there!
-Go!
Get off.
Chief.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'II try and set down on the roof.
I'II need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
See you up there.
You'II have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts...
... anythingyoucanfind!
-carlos!
-Yes, sir.
Get some knives.
There we go.
For God's sakes, carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a Iot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug...
... Ineverthoughtthiscouldhappen.
Sure.
-How much time you think we got?
-Ten minutes, maybe less.
We'II have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
AII right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire...
... we'IIplugit andspliceitinto the timer, set it, and it blows.
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
-Got it?
-I got it.
-Good luck.
See you later.
-Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'II never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman?
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-Iooking lady.
Mrs. MueIIer.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
-CIaiborne!
-What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
AII I can do now is pray to God...
... thatI canstopthisfrom ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'II kill 1 0,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'II keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies...
... untilsomebodyasksus...
... howtobuildthem.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.

[ENGLISH]
-So how was it?
-Good.
-You're gonna go ahead?
-full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying:
"No matter how hot it gets up there during the day...
-... there'snota- -" -" Not a damn thing to do at night. "
What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a Iow threshold of boredom.
You'II be back in two weeks.
DUNCAN:
Come in the office for a minute.
ROBERTS:
I got people waiting upstairs.
I wanted to tell you...
... SenatorParker'scoming to the dedication tonight.
He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them.
I'II build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'II never leave.
After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay opened.
-Whatever happened to " hello" ?
-hello.
-How are you?
-Good.
You look like it took.
WOMAN:
Hi, Mr. Roberts.
-Just a second.
We'II miss you.
-Duncan know?
-He's all smiles.
-What eIectromagnets went in?
TECHNICIAN 1 :
Doug?
Thompson G-4s.
Don't you think it should've been G-1 2s?
That's what comes from Iast-minute panic.
I'II fix it.
There's ground water on that atlanta job.
Bring the designs in today.
How about Chicago specs?
-philadelphia?
-In a minute, guys.
well, hello.
welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Who's there?
Mm-hm.
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
AII protein, no bread.
AII I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
AII I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
I got about a $ 1 40 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will...
... remembertotellthemthat it was my idea.
Got change for a 50?
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.
Not a chance!
Let's see what we got here... .
Twenty-five, 50, 60...
... 70,75...
... 85,95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
POLICE OFFICER:
AII your security squad's up there... .
hello, Mrs. AIIbright.
Hi, phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoaIs.
Mommy wants to know if you'II have dinner with us?
Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Here, Iet me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, phillip?
-Sorry, Mrs. MueIIer, what was that?
-I said how are you?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Okay, I'II get on it right now.
CALLAHAN:
I'II check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.
TECHNICIAN:
Mr. CaIIahan?
We still got any G-1 2 electrodes?
-Yeah, main storeroom.
-Right.
Okay, booster pump, zone one.
-One-ten.
-Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
CALLAHAN:
Go ahead.
AGENT:
Here we are.
MAN:
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?
WOMAN:
I wouldn't like that at all!
The business offices only go up to 80.
From the 81 st floor, here...
... allthewayupto120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 81 45... .
Say, bill?
Tune in the main utility room.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
The sensor indicates there is.
plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
hello?
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean-
- I guess we've got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
I want the kind of Iife you're talking about.
I want that.
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both.
Can I?
I don't know.
[PHONE RINGS]
Yeah?
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight.
What happened?
CALLAHAN:
We kicked on the auxiliary and this shorted out.
-Power off?
-Yeah.
What about that?
It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
CaIIahan called me.
Now just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
Specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
[BUZZER]
Yeah?
SECRETARY:
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay, send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire...
... froma burned-outcircuitbreaker isn't conclusive.
Maybe not.
But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
will, Doug...
... J.D.,waittillyou see this.
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?
We have an equipment problem.
-No problem in the tower, is there?
-could be.
Come on.
You're just guessing.
I want to talk to your son-in-Iaw.
I wanna talk to him right away.
Okay.
-Get Roger Simmons.
SECRETARY:
Yes, sir.
I guarantee I'II check this out.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah, a fire.
In this building?
Come on.
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
-The party should've been put off--
-hold it, will!
Everybody's overreacting.
SECRETARY:
Mr. Simmons is out, sir.
Out where?
They don 't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
We'II talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'II decide what to do.
-That's okay, isn't it?
-Nope.
Won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it!
This is top priority.
We gotta get these electrical systems on.
Our security program's Ioused up without them.
ROBERTS:
Don't go away.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Doug!
well, what a surprise!
ROBERTS:
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on, I'II get you a drink.
He must've done something.
My father called.
He hasn't been that upset in years.
ROBERTS:
Have any idea where he is?
well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-miIe radius.
But if you wanna wait, he'II show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
-Can I get you a drink?
-No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Hi, Doug.
ROGER:
Honey.
PATTY:
hello.
-What are you drinking these days?
-Nothing, right now.
ROGER:
well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
CaIIahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a systems failure.
How can that be?
ROBERTS:
It can't be, theoretically.
unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'II understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours?
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Listen.
We had an electrical fIare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
AII the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!
I asked for installations way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
That would take weeks and a Iot more clout than you have!
In my office!
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
probably in better condition.
ROGER:
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks...
... evenifthat's what you want me to do.
AII I want is the man I thought I married.
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you Iike your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Nonsense.
Be a good girl, elke.
I Ieft you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
GIDDINGS:
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
GIDDINGS:
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.
Here you are...
... youroriginalspecs.
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
-Susan.
-hello, Dan.
Good evening.
-How are you, dear?
-congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
I'II meet you out front.
-I'd Iike to talk to Susan.
-Right.
Find me the architect who designed you...

Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.

SENATOR:
How are you?
ROGER:
Nice to see you, senator.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
Later, I wanna ask you a few questions...
... andI expect some straight answers.
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower...
... tallestbuildingin theworld!
We'II make it.
That's it.
AII right, CaIIahan?
Hit them.
MAYOR:
This way.
PATTY:
It's really something, isn't it?
After you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'II be up in a few minutes.
SENATOR:
I've never seen the bridge look like that.
-It's unbelievable!
-Astonishing!
-How did it go down there, Mr. BigeIow?
-Fine, thank you.
Good night.
shall I leave you a night line?
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Lorrie... .
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
We almost missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
hello.
Hi.
-Promise me something?
-What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
I promise.
SINGER:
We may never love like this again
Don 't stop the flow
We can 't let go
We may never love like this again
And touch the sky
Though we may try
So while we're here, let's give our all
Release the dreams inside us
And set them free
Oh, while we're here let's leave a mark
There's a candle in the dark
It's here to guide us
We may never love like this again
But through the days
Beyond the haze
I see you reaching out....
DUNCAN:
How's the family?
WAITRESS:
Fine, thank you.
Good.
Gary?
-would you excuse us, gentlemen?
-certainly.
-I've got a surprise for you.
-politicians don't like surprises.
DUNCAN:
carlos?
CARLOS:
Yes, sir.
-What can I fix you?
-Meet Senator Parker.
-Great pleasure.
-It's an honor, senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
1 929?
-That's all you'II drink tonight.
-A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'II ship to Washington.
-Open a bottle, will you?
-Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
I guess you're looking for someone.
I am.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?
-Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
-Susan, tell me... .
What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man...
... decidestoleavefor two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No headhunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
-You must miss your villa.
-well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
-No false humility, please.
-Oh, shall we?
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco...
... toregainmy perspective and my humility...
... andspendmoretimeattheone thing I'm really good at:
The stock market.
Monte carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
You better leave it off.
[PHONE RINGS]
utility.
Wes.
Doug, I'm up on 83 with will.
We got a wiring problem.
OverIoads could be trouble.
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.
I can't do that.
AII the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.
You mean the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'II accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
I didn't say all the power, just the overload!
Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81 .
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.
-I'II be in 81 .
-You got it.
[FIRE ALARM WAILS]
[SIRENS]
Hey!
ROBERTS:
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
pull it around over here.
Put it all over him.
Come on!
Let's get some water onto that fire.
MAN:
Turn it on!
Down, down!
Stay low!
call an ambulance for this man.
Get on the ball!
call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor!
-The fire department?
-On their way.
Get that ambulance.
Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.
AII right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
This is 81 .
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes, right away.
call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a Iot of people up there.
ROBERTS:
What?
JERNIGAN:
Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
will Giddings has been badly burned.
will Giddings burned?
How?
An ambulance is coming, but you better think about...
... gettingthosepeopledown on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
well, I think it's under control, but--
well, then why the urgency?
Urgency?
If fIuky wiring in this building caused that fire...
... firescouldbreakout everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
I feel sorry for will Giddings, but he'II be taken care of.
But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 ...
... becauseitcan'tpossibly affect us up here...
... notinthisbuilding.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and--
Oh, Jesus!
-The glass tower!
-What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Yeah.
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being inside a chimney.
Jesus!
How in the hell did they get here before we did?
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
-Mike, she's throwing a Iot of smoke.
-Eighty-first floor, right?
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
-Set up a Forward Command.
-Got it.
Chief...
... thisisRoberts,the architect.
-What do we got here, Kappy?
-Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.
It's bad.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
-Exhaust system?
-should've reversed automatically.
It must be a motor burnout.
-sprinklers?
-They're not working on 81 .
-Why not?
-I don't know.
-Jim?
-Yes, sir?
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.
-floors have 3 and 1 .5-inch outlets.
-GPM?
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1 000 from 68 to 1 00...
... and500fromtheretotheroof.
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
-What floor are your plans on?
-79.
My office.
That's two floors below the fire.
It'II be our Forward Command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
Okay.
Architects!
Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.
But you keep building them as high as you can.
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?
What about the 81 st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.
Not Iive-ins.
Businesses.
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.
Those that have are off at night.
I wanna know who they are, not where.
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?
Any wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Any sporting-good manufacturers, Iike tabIe-tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?
-One tenant list, coming up.
-Thank you.
What do we got?
elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
-Pipe alleys here?
-One, two, three, four, five.
-This is south?
-South.
-Have you got any construction on 81 ?
-Nope.
Anything that can blow up, Iike gasoline, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'II be up on 81 .
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'II watch out for him.
Thank you.
O'HALLORHAN:
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.
Jack?
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
-I'II be up topside.
-Right.
O'HALLORHAN:
Jack...
... watchyourself.
JACK:
Keep it high.
-Looking for me, chief?
-If you're Duncan.
I am.
Everything under control?
Gotta move these people out of here.
Now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems...
... wehavedesignedintothis building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.
I don't think you're listening.
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.
-I'II do it.
-hold it, hold it.
Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I couId tell them, but you ought to.
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests...
... thattheparty'sbeingmoveddown below the fire floor.
Now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now don't leave this table.
You, I wanna talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
-I most certainly did.
-For God's sake, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire.
If it was caused by what you did, I'II hang you out to dry.
And then I'm going to hang you!
would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen... .
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire...
... inoneof ourstoragerooms...
... 50floorsbelow.
I assure you there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders...
... apurelyprecautionaryprocedure...
... we'regoingto movethe party down to the lobby for a while.
And we'II be serving cocktails and champagne in our continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators... .

-Better get ready.
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.

-Are your com lines tested?
-Phone jacks on every floor.
-I'm plugging into your PA system.
-No sweat.
-Emergency setup?
-Battery-powered standby system.

Sure.
-No problem?
-No problem.
-How long will this take?
-A minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.

We may need them to get those people down.
Come on, Park.

The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.
Okay, Doug.
I don't like how you talk to me.
-You drunk?
-Not yet.
-Then get out of my way!
-You didn't talk like this before.
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?
Shut up and help these people!
-Let me ask, father-in-Iaw-- DUNCAN:
Excuse me.
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?
DUNCAN:
please!
please!
hold everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Move back into the Promenade Room...
... andwe'IItakeyou downby the scenic elevator.
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.
And with the probability of short circuits...

So please, we'II use the scenic elevators over there.
DUNCAN:
For God's sake, get out of there!
please, back!
O'HALLORHAN:
It looks bad, Jack.
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
The fire's spreading.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'II check the other corridors.
O'HALLORHAN:
Firemen, Iet's pull it down before it faIIs down.
Bring it out!

What?
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf!

I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
You stay there.

I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.

Nobody's going to die.
At least they'II never find out about us, will they?

You can't get out that way.

-I guess you thought I stood you up.

Sure they will if there's not too much wind.

Can I get you anything else?
Damn!
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the peerless building...
... andgetabreechesbuoy to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'II get right on it.

By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
-There's no way down.
-Thank God you're all right.
-Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
-I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
-responsible?
-feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at Ieast on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.

Now listen.

If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!

And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-Iaw of yours!

-Who is it?

The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer and we'II all be home together.
If only I couId have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.

She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean...
... ifsheshouldhaveto.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
MAN:
Here he is.
FLAKER:
The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
O'HALLORHAN:
Get Roberts.
Get 1 0 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
-Doug, are they going to land?
-They're gonna try.
We'II send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 1 00 or so.
High-rise roulette.
-High-rise roulette.
That's right.
-Doug... .
-There may not be time to tell you--
-There will be.
I'II go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'II be a Iot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
PILOT:
Look out!
FIREFIGHTER 1 :
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'HaIIorhan wants to speak to you.
AII right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
FIREFIGHTER 1 :
Here he is now.
Yeah.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and I--
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'II try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Okay.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
-Sure, what do you want them for?
-I want to try something.
SENATOR:
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at Ieast we can get 1 2 people out.
SENATOR:
Which 1 2?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
AII right, Iet's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
help me.
If you asked me to go to the North pole...
... oreventhecliffsofMendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
please.
-Ma'am, I'II take her.
-Thank you.
Come on, phillip.
I'II never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
-I'II meet you in the lobby.
LISOLETTE:
I'II be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
-You've gotta go.
-I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'II make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
please.
FIREFIGHTER 1 :
AII set, everyone?
FIREFIGHTER 1 :
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
MAYOR:
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
DUNCAN:
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
AII right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
AII right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
AII right, Iet it go!
Let it go!
AII right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!

It's hanging by a cable.
-How many people in it?
-Loaded.
I'd say about 1 2.
What're you gonna go?
FIaker.
FIaker!
Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the peerless building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
MAN 1 :
Yeah, take it up out of there.

Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, Iet her go!
MAN 2:
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
AII right!
There's one in there!
Come on!
pull it in!
FIREFIGHTER 2:
AII right, Iet's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
AII right, keep it going!
AII right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
-I am.
I am!
-Come ahead!
I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
-I can't!
-Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
MAN:
hold it right there.
MAN:
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
-This is O'HaIIorhan.
PILOT:
We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook...
... andsetme downonthe scenic elevator.
Then you'II pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Okay.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'II let me stay.
Come on.
I'II see you soon.
PATTY:
I Iove you.
FIREFIGHTER 2:
Let it go!
FIREFIGHTER 1 :
You think this'II hold it?
O'HALLORHAN:
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
-What's your number?
-68.

Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'II be all right now.
-You'II be all right.
-tell my husband I'm all right.
-tell him I'II be all right.
-I will.
-And I'II see him at home later.
-I will.
FIREFIGHTER:
Let's go.

Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
FIREFIGHTER:
Watch the ladder.
FIREFIGHTER:
Hey, Mike...
... deputywantsto seeyou .
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 1 7 or 1 8 minutes left, if that.
It'II take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'II die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room...
... coulddefinitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'II handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1 ,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
You're crazy.
Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design--
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you... .
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation...
... I'IIbetheIastoneoutof here along with my son-in-Iaw.
[PHONE RINGS]
Roberts.
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 1 5 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'II kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'II find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'II tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'II eat a Iot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'II burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 1 5 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
ROGER:
Get that line.
Get off!
You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
Let go of me!
CARLOS:
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
CARLOS:
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
-Get the hell out of there!
-Go!
Get off.
[ROGER YELLS]
Chief.
Yeah.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'II try and set down on the roof.
I'II need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
Okay.
See you up there.
You'II have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts...
... anythingyoucanfind!
ROBERTS:
carlos!
CARLOS:
Yes, sir.
ROBERTS:
Get some knives.
CARLOS:
There we go.
For God's sakes, carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a Iot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug...
... Ineverthoughtthiscouldhappen.
Sure.
ROBERTS:
Hey!
ROBERTS:
How much time do we got?
O'HALLORHAN: 1 0 minutes, maybe less.
We'II have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
AII right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire...
... we'IIplugit andspliceitinto the timer, set it, and it blows.
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
-Got it?
-I got it.
-Good luck.
See you later.
-Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'II never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
O'HALLORHAN:
Fireman?
[YELLS]
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-Iooking lady.
Mrs. MueIIer.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
JERNIGAN:
CIaiborne!
-What?
[PATTY CRIES]
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
AII I can do now is pray to God...
... thatI canstopthisfrom ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'II kill 1 0,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'II keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies...
... untilsomebodyasksus...
... howtobuildthem.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.
subtitles by SDI Media Group
[ENGLISH SDH]
So, how was it?
Good.
You're gonna go ahead, huh?
Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying that, uh, no matter how hot it gets up there during the day, there's not...
Not a damn thing to do at night.
That's right.
Now just what the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
Can you come in the office for a minute?
I got people waiting upstairs.
Well, what I wanted to tell you is that, uh,
Senator Parker's flying in for the dedication tonight, and he's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Now, do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design 'em, I'll build 'em.
Jim, I think you suffer from an "edifice" complex.
You'll never leave.
Right after the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Sam.
It's Doug.
How are ya?
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay open.
Dampers?
Whatever happened to hello?
Hello.
How are ya?
Good.
You look like it took.
Yeah.
Hi, Mr. Roberts.
Hey, Doug.
Just a second.
We're gonna miss you.
Duncan know?
He's all smiles.
Mm-hmm.
Hey.
What electromagnets went in?
Doug.
Thompson G-4's.
Shouldn't they have been, like, G-12's?
Oh, no.
That's what comes from this damn last-minute panic.
I'll fix it, Doug.
Okay.
What?
We keep running into groundwater on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in sometime this afternoon.
Good to see you back, but how about Chicago specs?
Philadelphia.
In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Well, is there-
Mm-hmm.
No, I'm not taking any calls.
We gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Mmm.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
All protein.
No bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase over there.
What's in that suitcase?
I got about 140 dollars' worth of vulgar underwear for ya.
First things first.
It's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this- and they will- remember to tell them that it was my idea.
Right.
Got change for a 50?
- I'm sorry.
That's the smallest I have.
- Oh, not a chance.
Let's see what we got here.
Oh.
Uh, 25, 50, 60... 70,
75, 85, 95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
Tomorrow we're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us tonight.
Oh, thank you, but I'm going up to the party in the tower.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Oh, here.
Let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
Sorry, Mrs. Mueller.
What was that?
I said, "How are you?" Okay.
Good-bye.
Okay.
I'll get on it right now.
I'll have to check the panel.
Just leave all those fired up.
Mr. Callahan.
Yeah.
We still got any of those G-12 electrodes in stock?
Yeah.
Main storeroom.
Right.
Okay.
Booster pump, Zone 1.
110.
Check.
Main generator, Zone 1.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Ah.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor as well as apartments?
Oh, I wouldn't like that at all.
Oh, no, no.
The business offices only go as high as 80.
From the 81st floor here, all the way up to 120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 8145.
Say, Bill.
Tune in the main utility room.
Okay.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire department alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
Well, the sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello.
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean...
I guess we got ourselves a situation.
Seems.
See, Doug, I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
And I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I've wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have...
I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it.
Something that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both, can I?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight, hmm?
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
Yeah.
What about that?
It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now, just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ.
The specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Yeah.
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay.
Send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire from a burned-out circuit breaker is hardly conclusive.
Well, maybe not, but after that, I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will.
Doug.
J.D., wait till you see this.
What happened?
Somebody hang the wallpaper upside down?
We have an equipment problem.
No problem in the tower, is there?
Could be.
Come on, Doug.
You're just guessing.
All right.
I'm just guessing.
But I want to talk to that son-in-law of yours.
I want to talk to him right away.
Okay.
Get me Roger Simmons.
Yes, sir.
I'm gonna check this thing out, Mr. Duncan.
I guarantee you.
Sure, sure.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah.
A fire.
In this building?
Come on.
Do you know we haven't even finished installing the safety equipment?
The party should have been put off for at least another month.
Now, hold it, Will.
Hold it!
Everybody's overreacting.
Yes.
Mr. Simmons is out, sir.
- Out where?
- They don't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
Okay.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow, and then we'll decide what to do.
That's okay, isn't it?
Nope.
Won't wait.
Try Zone 1 again.
Damn it, Harry.
This is top priority.
We've got to get these electrical systems back on the beam.
Our whole security program's loused up without 'em.
Don't go away.
Doug.
Well, what a surprise.
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I mean, I called his office, the club, the marina- everywhere.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on.
I'll get you a drink.
He must have done something, 'cause my father called.
I haven't heard him that upset in years.
You have any idea where he is?
Well, my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's roughly equivalent to that of the timber wolf- anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you want to wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
Can I get you a drink?
No.
No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
Honey.
Hello.
What are you drinking these days?
Nothing right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a power surge and a systems failure.
How can that be?
Well, it can't be, theoretically.
Unless you've been screwing around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours anyway?
Well, I'm just wondering what kind of kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Now, listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
It looked to me like some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
Every piece of wire I put in that building is strictly up to code- inspected and approved.
The code's not enough for that building.
And you know it.
That's why I asked for installations that were way, way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dreamworld.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
It'd take weeks to get all that together- and someone with more clout than you to make me do it.
In my office, tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
Roger, if you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help.
Or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time daddy barks.
I mean, if that's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
But I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please.
All right.
Give me a wide camera angle.
Everybody, back of the rope.
Stand back.
Please.
Everybody, back of the rope.
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age...
I only care that they show up at all.
Oh, nonsense.
Now, you be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Well, did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but two bucks will get ya 10 he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
That's the only way he could've swung it.
Well, here you are.
Your original specs.
Zone 1 only, but we gotta start somewhere.
The son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
Susan.
Hello, Danny.
Good evening.
Good show.
How are you, dear?
Jim.
Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
Uh, I'll meet you out front.
I'd like to talk to Susan for a minute.
Right.
Find me the architect who designed you, and who needs Doug Roberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries tonight reads like a who's who.
There are leaders from society and government.
Stars of screen and television.
And now, just arriving, the honorable Gary Parker, chairman of the Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator flew in from Washington tonight to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him over to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I am honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark... in a long succession of landmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
I am deeply appreciative... of being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's Mr. and Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, Senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Ah, yes.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
When I get the time, I want to ask you a few questions, and I expect some straight answers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower... tallest building in the world.
Oh!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
Oh!
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
And you know, it's all...
After you.
This is really going to thrill you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
Oh, that's incredible.
I've never seen the bridge looking like that.
Oh, it's absolutely unbelievable.
It's astonishing!
How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
Fine.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
Shall I leave you a night line, Mr. Bigelow?
Uh, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Good night.
Good night.
Lorrie.
Yes.
Sorry to break into your evening, but I have one letter that's got to go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
You could have left 10 minutes ago and missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not going to do anything tonight.
Oh.
Hey.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
Hello.
Hi.
Promise me something?
What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Mm-hmm.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
Mmm.
I promise.

I've got a surprise for you.
- Politicians don't like surprises.
- We'll love again
Carlos.
Yes, sir.
Oh.
What can I fix you, Mr. Duncan?
I want you to meet Senator Parker.
Carlos, a great pleasure.
Oh, it's a great honor, Senator.
Now, show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
Oh.
Twenty-nine?
That's all you're gonna drink tonight.
A whole case?
Well, what you don't drink, we'll ship the rest back to Washington.
Open a bottle, will you?
Yes, sir.
Uh, how did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
Oh, it's nothing.
Let me guess.
You're looking for someone.
I'm looking for someone.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty and me.
What can I get you?
Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
Susan.
Tell me.
Uh, what does a girl do in San Francisco when her, uh, old man decides to leave for two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No... head-hunting?
Well, I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at... at lunch?
No.
You must miss your villa.
Well, yes and no.
It, uh- It gets rather dull in the south of France.
It really does.
I mean, nothing but swimming... and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they, uh... they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
No false humility, please.
Oh.
Shall we?
I, uh-
I
- I decided to come back to the reality of an Francisco, uh, to regain my perspective and my humility... a-and spend more time at the one thing in this world that I'm really good at:
the stock market.
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you, uh...
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
Hmm?
It's too hot.
We'd better leave it off.
Utility.
Wes.
Doug.
I'm up on 83 with Will.
Listen.
We got a little wiring problem.
If we get an overload, it could be trouble.
Shut down as many Zone 1 systems as you can.
Afraid I can't do that, Mr. Roberts.
We've got all the lights on for the dedication ceremony.
All?
You mean the whole building?
Well, we're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
But I can't do that without a direct okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility for that.
Just turn off the goddamn lights.
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
- I didn't say kill all the power.
Just the overload.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts.
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
Okay.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81.
Bill, phone it in just in case our automatic lines to the fire department are out.
I'll be in 81.
Got it.
Hey!
Get those drapes!
Smother him!
Try to smother him!
Pull it around over here!
Pull it over him!
Come on!
Get some water on that fire!
Turn it on!
Will.
Down.
Down.
Stay low.
Call an ambulance for this man.
Damn it, man!
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor.
Yes, sir.
What about the fire department?
They're on their way.
Get that ambulance!
Give me a hand.
Let's get him in the elevator.
All right.
Try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
Hello.
This is 81.
We've had an accident up here.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes.
Right away.
Roberts, call Duncan in the tower.
We've got a lot of people up there.
What?
Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah.
Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
Everybody wants to know why the world's greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind about that.
Will Giddings has been pretty badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
Listen.
I've already got an ambulance coming, but you better think about getting those people upstairs down on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but-
Well, then, uh, why the urgency?
Urgency?
Hey, Dunc, if that fire was caused by fluky wiring in this building, we could get fires breaking out everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
Now, I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I am not going to concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81... because it can't possibly affect us up here.
Not in this building.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
In the meantime, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party.
Now, come on!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and-
Oh, Jesus.
The glass tower.
What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
You ever fight one in a high-rise?
Yeah.
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being' inside a chimney!
People.
Hell, they got here before we did.
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
Get some hands over here, and have 'em walk out there.
Okay.
Captain.
You understand?
I want you over that way.
Mike, she's throwin' a lot of smoke.
Eighty-first floor, right?
Right.
We've got lobby control.
Second alarm is in.
Set up a forward command.
Got it.
Chief, this is Roberts, the architect.
What've we got here, Kappy?
Fire started 81st floor.
Storage room.
This is a bad one.
The smoke is so thick we can't tell how far it's spread.
What about your exhaust system?
Well, it should've reversed automatically.
There must have been a motor burnout or somethin'.
Sprinklers?
They're not working on 81.
Why not?
I don't know.
Jim.
Yes, sir.
All right.
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe systems.
Well, we got outlets on every floor.
Both three and one-and-a-half inch.
G.P.M.?
1,500 from ground to 68, 1,000 from 68 to 100... and, uh, 500 from there to the roof.
All right.
And you're sure these elevators are programmed for emergency service?
These two are.
What floor do you keep your plans on?
Seventy-nine.
My office.
That's good.
That's two floors below the fire.
All right.
That'll be our forward command.
All right, men.
Take up the equipment.
Right.
Let's go.
Okay.
Architects.
Yeah.
It's all our fault.
Now, you know there's no sure way for us to fight a fire... in anything over the seventh floor, but you guys just keep buildin' em as high as you can.
Hey.
Are you here to take me on or the fire?
Okay.
Well, what about the 81st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I want to see all your floor plans.
Eighty-one through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what I'm worried about.
All those beams and that glass.
Chief.
Yeah.
81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
How long before you can give me a complete list of your tenants?
You don't have to worry about that.
We're movin' 'em out right now.
Not live-in.
Business tenants.
We kind of looked up there too.
The majority of them haven't moved in yet, and those that have aren't working tonight.
I want to know who they are, not where they are.
Now what does that got to do with anything- who they are?
Do you have any wool or silk manufacturers?
You see, in a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Do you have any, uh, sporting good manufacturers, like table tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Want me to keep goin' down the line?
No.
One list of tenants comin' right up.
Thank you.
Over here and here.
Here.
What have we got?
Well, elevator bank.
Central core.
Service elevators over here.
Air-conditioning duct, six inches.
Right.
Pipe alleys here?
One, two, three, four, five.
This is south.
South.
Have you got any construction going up in 81?
Nope.
Anything that could blow up, like gasoline, kerosene, uh, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'll be up on 81.
Okay.
For what it's worth, architect, this is one building that I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
- Party?
What party?
Where?
- In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get 'em the hell out of there?
Why don't you go on upstairs and talk to Duncan?
He ain't exactly listening to me.
I will.
Oh.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down.
Check that hallway.
Take it down to the other crew.
Jack.
Jack.
How bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Uh-huh.
Work it around.
Up there.
I'll be up topside.
Right.
Jack, watch yourself.
Keep it high.
You looking for me, Chief?
If you're Duncan, yeah.
I am.
Everything under control?
We've gotta move all these people out of here.
Oh, now just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
Well, uh, I don't believe that you're familiar with... the many modern safety systems we have designed into this building.
We've got 'em all.
All right.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now let's get these people the hell out of here.
I don't think you're listening, Chief.
There's no way for a fire on 81 to reach up here.
Not in this building.
Okay.
I'll do it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
The mayor's out there.
Do you want me to pull rank on you?
When there's a fire, I outrank everybody here.
Now, one thing we don't want is a panic.
Now, I could tell 'em, but you ought to do it.
Just make a nice cool announcement to all your guests... and tell 'em the party's being moved down below the fire floor... right now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now don't leave this table.
You I want to talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
I most certainly did.
For God sakes, why?
The reason should be obvious.
Especially to you.
We've got a fire.
And if it was caused by anything you did,
I'm going to hang you out to dry, and then I'm going to hang you!
Would you, uh, please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire... in one of our storage rooms, 50 floors below.
Now, I assure you, there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders, a purely precautionary procedure, we're going to move the party down to the lobby for a while, and we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.
But I promise you.
Dinner will not be delayed.
Now, if we can all move to the elevators.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, there's...
there's no reason to rush.
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
Lisolette.
Frank.
Lisolette.
How's it going, Chief?
Better get ready.
Kappy, pull out the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire lapping up?
Yeah.
Are your com lines all set up and tested?
Phone jacks on every floor.
I'm gonna plug into your P.A. system.
No sweat.
How about your emergency setup?
Battery-powered standby system.
Can you take these lines... and splice them into our two-way communications band?
Sure.
No problem?
No problem.
Okay.
How long will this take?
About a minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
Fire's lapping here.
It's going up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
Come on!
The ceiling's going!
They're trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
Pull 'em out!
Pull 'em out!
Drop the fire line!
Drop it low!
Battalion 2 to forward command, urgent!
Forward command.
Go ahead.
Explosion on 81.
Fire heading toward elevator banks.
We need more crews up here fast!
All right.
They need relief on 81.
Hit it.
They're on their way.
Done.
You better call Duncan, tell him to stop those people in the Tower Room... from using that express elevator, or somebody's gonna get killed.
Okay, Kappy.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads here, and I also want choppers.
We may need 'em if we're gonna get those people down.
All right.
Come on, fireman.
I'll be on 81.
Fine.
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload it.
Okay, Doug.
I don't like the way you talk to me.
You drunk?
Not yet.
Well, then get out of my way.
You didn't talk like this two years ago, did you?
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then how I could shave two million dollars of four electrical costs?
Shut up, and help me with these people.
And let me ask you, my dear father-in-law...
Excuse me.
Am I the only subcontractor you encouraged to cut corners?
Excuse me.
Where did you save the other four million in Doug's original budget?
Everybody.
Shh!
Please.
Please.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
You'll have to move back into the Promenade Room, and we'll be taking you down by the scenic elevator.
Now, these express elevators can be activated by fire, and with the probability of short circuits, the cars might stop on the floor where the fire is.
So, please, we'll use the scenic elevators.
Over there.
For God sakes, get out of there!
Please, back.
Looks bad, Jack.
Yeah, it is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
Fire's spreading down all corridors.
All right.
I got a third alarm in.
Now, what about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
All right.
Fireman, let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out!
Take it down.
Empty all the water out!
Fall back!
Chief, it's out of control.
We're losin' it!
Bring in another line!
Get another hose!
Angela.
Angela.
Phillip.
Phillip, open the door!
Do you have any brilliant ideas I can use upstairs... to explain where I've been all this time?
Mmm.
Well, I think what you might do is just, uh, walk right up to him and say, uh,
"J.D., I'm sorry for the delay, but my secretary had an urgent personal problem."
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
Hmm.
He won't.
You know what astonishes me?
What?
You make love with a girl- Mm-hmm.
and afterwards, there's no visible evidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
I mean, look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus.
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Right.
What did they say?
Help's on the way.
Oh.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, madam, please.
You must...
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
Oh.
But they're aware of that.
She's wearing a purple dress.
I've got to find her.
A purple dress.
I promise you.
They'll find her.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Now, only 12 at a time.
Hurry up.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
Well, be in the next group.
It won't be too long.
What's she doin' on 87?
Forward command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man.
You should've sent a man up there.
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf.
Sure the kids can hear.
I don't know.
Maybe they were in the shower or something when you called.
Forward command.
No.
You stay where you are.
I'll get 'em down.
No.
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
Now!
Okay, forward command.
Fresh crews coming right up.
Still got people on 87.
I'll get 'em down.
I'll give you a hand, Harry.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
Well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
For one thing, at least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.
Don't go.
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
On your mark.
Dan!
Down that corridor!
You all right?
They're in there.
I know it.
The mother and the two children.
Don't worry.
We'll get 'em out.
Wait a minute.
Please, Mrs. Mueller.
Please stay back.
What do you think?
I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
Mom.
Mom.
Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
She'll be all right.
Anybody else?
My sis
- My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela?
Angela?
Angela.
Angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.
It's all right.
Thank God.
Angela.
Come on.
Just take it easy.
Easy.
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
Hold it here.
All right!
That's it.
Don't press the plaza button.
Everybody just calm down.
At this rate it's gonna take a couple of hours to get everyone down.
So I would suggest that those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines... start using the stairs.
That's 135 floors.
Mm-hmm.
All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos.
Yes, sir.
Help us try to get this thing open.
It's stuck?
Yeah.
Here.
Let me try to kick it.
No.
I'll call security.
Yes, sir.
On the double.
Battalion 38, responding to fourth alarm.
Reporting to forward command.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
Hey.
You want it easy, Chief?
I don't see why they couldn't have designed a survival suit for us... like they did for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's go to work.
I need two men to go up the stairwell to the Tower Room.
There's a door jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay.
You got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men.
Make sure they've got 30 minutes of air.
Kappy.
Yeah.
Now there's gonna be glass sailing' all over this city.
Call the police downstairs.
Have them move those barricades four blocks back.
Got it.
Let's hit it.
Right.
Yo.
Security guard!
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty.
Almost missed ya, huh?
Ow!
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Can you get down?
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip.
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, now.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip.
Your foot's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy now.
Easy.
Don't look down.
That's right.
Come on.
I got ya.
I got ya.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
We were supposed to have fire drills.
That's what they said.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had- I got up all right, but I think I'm gonna have a lot of trouble gettin' down.
You think you could help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck real tight?
Oh, no.
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Okay?
Put her legs down.
Okay.
Hold on tight.
Put your legs around here.
Hold on real tight now.
Go on.
Hang on.
Just hold on tight, honey.
Hold on.
Hold on.
You're okay.
Hold on tight now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
Hold on, Angela.
I've got a hold of you.
Get your arms around my neck.
That-a-girl.
Nurse.
He stayed in too long.
Bring him right over here.
Mrs. Mueller, come on.
You've gotta try!
Take it slowly now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold onto that pole and grab a hold of my belt.
Try to get your left hand over there.
About half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller.
Are you all right?
Fine.
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm comin'.
I'm comin'.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God, we're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on.
Let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
O'Hallorhan.
Inside, security phone on the right.
Would you get me Chief O'Hallorhan right away?
I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
No, the fire's below us.
We have to go up.
This'll put us right underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
Jack?
Yeah?
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling and vent that other side.
It's for you, Chief.
The air control officer for the copter.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hittin' it.
I'm gonna get some relief for you and your men.
This is O'Hallorhan.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We could use your rescue choppers.
I'll order them right away.
I'd like to set up communications... next to the forward command center.
No, no, too dangerous.
Stay outta those elevators.
Well, then, sir, we'll just trot right up the stairs.
Yeah, you'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby, sir.
Thank you.
This isn't gonna help any.
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people.
It's a fire door.
It's over two and a half inches thick.
Maybe I could crawl through there.
Will we- Will we be able to go with you?
It leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
Use this.
Phillip, you take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right.
I'll tell him.
Chief?
Yeah.
How does it look on 65?
They're getting it contained.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown!
But the backup should've kicked on by now.
Go see what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
Well, what's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold onto me a second.
Hold on!
Jesus Christ, that's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Okay, okay.
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We're gonna rappel.
Down to 65.
Get on top of that elevator, use it for an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Okay.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room!
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Okay, open it up.
Of course I read you!
Look, I don't know where the hell he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him!
Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
Not for us.
Mike, where have you been?
We had a little trouble getting here.
The navy flight commander needs you down in the lobby right away.
Sixty-five floors?
Just walk right down?
No, it's only five.
They got a freight elevator on 60 on auxiliary power.
Okay.
You got this thing controlled?
Well, we're gettin' there.
All right, you men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike...
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow." Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Located O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another there.
Look.
It's too damn windy out there!
Hey, Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
Mr. Roberts.
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Well, that's okay.
Anybody'll do.
Listen.
The south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for Chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How...
Okay.
Oh.
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
Oh, it's okay, Mrs. Mueller.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
Oh, hello, ma'am.
Oh, hello.
How you doin'?
We're fine.
Glad to see you.
Yeah.
That's the door right here!
It's blocked with cement.
Okay.
Ah, we're gonna have to blow that thing.
Right.
Mrs. Mueller.
It's Mr. Roberts.
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you!
We're gonna blow this door!
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there outta the way.
Okay.
Everybody, could you please go back?
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back to the elevator.
We're blowing up the exit door.
Okay, get down low.
What kind of explosives are you using?
It's plastic, C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here.
Shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it on there.
Is there going to be a bang?
Ah, nothin' for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good goin', guys.
Hey.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
Hold it down!
Listen!
I've been informed by the fire department... that there's no possibility of using this stairway to get out.
Now, I'm-I'm sorry.
Patty.
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
We can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
No.
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
I'm getting out.
Roger.
You...
Ah!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go!
You guys, pull the ceiling!
You two, in there!
I guess you thought I stood you up.
It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Mm-hmm.
Doug, those, uh... those helicopters, th-they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will, if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Doug-
Hmm, da-dumm!
Can I get you anything else?
No?
Damn!
The choppers are here all right, but those high winds on the roof make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on the roof of the Peerless Building.
I wanna try to get a breeches buoy up to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that distance, not in this wind.
What's the matter with shooting' it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
Don?
Chief, uh, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
There's no way down.
Thank God you're all right.
Oh, Roger, what are we gonna do?
I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for all this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
Responsible?
Feeling!
Oh, you know a lot about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
The Duncans are very big in the responsibility department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of-of duty!
Sometimes... when you turn the exact same phrase, lift an eyebrow the exact same way,
I see, and I hear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a great big tree, and a little baby tree in its shade where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you... because I-I-I-I thought you might need me!
Right now, what I need most... is this.
I, um
- I promised myself that if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
But you don't know anything about me.
But I do.
You're penniless.
You have no villa in the south of France-
No antiques coming, no paintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn, a two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But don't you see?
Your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively if you don't really enjoy cheating them?
I brought you up here tonight to sell you a thousand shares... in Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light, only the certificate I had printed.
I must say, I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
I-It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Mm.
Every word.
Well, then, tell me you're shocked.
Or at least disappointed!
But I'm not.
You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
Oh, God, I wonder how many more'll be dead by tomorrow?
I thought we were building something that- where people could work and live and be safe!
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now, listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials... were made because I, as a builder, have a right to make those decisions-
If I remain within the building code.
And goddamn it, I did!
Building code.
Jesus.
Oh, the building code.
Come on, Dunc.
I mean, that's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble.
I was crawlin' around up there.
I mean, duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors, and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for startin' fires!
Hoo, boy.
Where was I when all this was goin' on?
'Cause I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
Come on!
Move it!
Okay.
Who is it?
Chief O'Hallorhan.
What happened?
Part of the central core just blew.
Now, we've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
No, it's too windy.
They can't set down.
We want to set the breeches buoy up on the roof of the Peerless Building.
Well, what can we do to help?
Move all your combustible material away from the window.
Okay.
Gotcha.
Come on.
Grab those tables and chairs.
Pile 'em up away from the walls!
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get on 'em now.
Jake, give me a hand!
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Well, just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how- how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety-deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean, uh, if she should have to.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
Oh.
Here he is.
Chief, the wind velocity's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Gil, get Roberts.
Yeah.
Get 10 people up on the roof.
Have the rest of 'em stand by in groups of 10.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Patty, put these over there where they can get them easily.
Carlos, give me that pad of paper and a pencil.
Yes, sir.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
Right.
Doug, are they going to land?
They're gonna try.
Send the kids out first...
and then the women.
Number this up to- I don't know...
a hundred or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
Doug, there may not be time to tell you later.
There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
All right, there's gonna be a lot of wind up there, especially when that chopper lands.
So everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back!
Stay back!
Look out!
I think so.
Roberts!
Mr. Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Pardon me.
Comin' through!
Comin' through!
Pardon me.
Here he is now.
Yeah?
Now look, Roberts, I know those pilots are dead and-
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I've told my two firemen up there to knock out a window.
We're gonna try to shoot a line to you from a chopper.
Okay.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
Uh, yeah, sure.
What do you want 'em for?
I wanna try somethin'.
Step way back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back.
You won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people down to the street.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof.
And two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman.
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Here, take this.
Take it.
You can get out of here.
Go on!
Take it.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Listen.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me down there worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me now, baby.
Help me.
If you ask me to go to the North Pole, or even the cliffs of Mendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
Ma'am, I'll take her.
Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
All right.
Hey.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to, ever again.
I'll meet you in the lobby.
I'll be waiting.
Uh, we're still a lady short.
You've gotta go.
But I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Hey, out of sight!
It's coming!
All right, let's untie this!
Take it all!
Pull in the rest of the line!
All right, hold it.
Hold it right there!
Bring me in another 20 feet on that main line!
Hey, come here!
Tie this off, will you?
All right.
That's right.
There you go!
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more.
That's it.
Hold it now!
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
Okay!
All right.
Let it go!
Let it go!
All right.
Go on!
Take it all!
Pull.
Come on.
Pull.
Okay, take up on it!
Make that line!
Fast!
How about the main line?
Secured?
Okay.
Good!
Chief!
Jonathan.
Explosion above 110.
Blew the scenic elevator right off its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
How many people in it?
Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
What are you gonna do?
Flaker.
- Flaker?
- Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have 'em pick me up on the roof of the Peerless Building.
We got it.
Yeah.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator, drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
It's all right.
It's okay.
I won't let anything happen.
I promise.
I won't cry if you won't cry.
Oh.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up the ladder there.
Okay, get it over.
Come on.
Come on.
Get it up here.
Okay!
Okay, let it go!
Look out below!
Come on!
Hey, make that chair fast!
All right!
Pull it right in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right!
Let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
All of us!
That's it!
All right!
Keep it goin'!
All right!
Hold it right there!
- Who's next in order?
- I am.
I am!
- Come ahead.
- I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
I'll fall!
I can't!
I can't!
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.
Oh, God.
Don't let go of me.
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Ah!
Don't
- Don't let go of me!
Oh, oh!
All right!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
God!
Okay.
Here she comes!
All right!
Pull that chair in!
Easy!
Easy!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable!
Grab that hook!
Steady it.
Hook on the torch.
Lash it tight.
This is O'Hallorhan.
We read you, Chief.
I want you to pick me up with the hook and set me down on the scenic elevator.
Then you're gonna pick up the scenic elevator... and very gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Okay.
Watch it.
Okay, take it away!
How much time do we have?
Bob, I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
Don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
Think this'll hold it?
It better.
We're gonna have to cut the elevator cable.
What's your number?
Sixty-eight.
Forty-seven.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, my God!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, no!
That was close.
Oh!
Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be- you'll be all right now.
Please.
You'll be all right.
Please, tell my husband I'll be all right.
I will.
You tell him I'll be all right.
I-I...
I will.
I'll be able to see him at home later.
I will.
I will.
I promise.
Let's go.
Here she is!
She's all right!
Watch the ladder!
Let's go!
Bring everything.
We're gonna need it!
Hey, Mike, deputy wants to see you.
Okay.
Yeah, Mike, look, we've been checking the situation up in the Promenade Room.
And we figure they've got only about 17, maybe 18, minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than three hours to get 'em all down by breeches buoy.
Those people are gonna die up there if something's not done.
Now, we might just have the answer.
Mr. Johnson's a structural engineer.
You tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists and risers up there in the Promenade Room, in my opinion, could definitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready out on the plaza.
Fireman, wait a minute.
Look, we'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold a million gallons of water.
That's more than enough to drown the fire.
- You're crazy.
- Mike, it's the only way.
Well, how do you know it'll work?
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think.
When you take into account... the stress and load factors, the building design-
Wait a minute.
Hold it.
Mike, look, we've already made the decision.
Now, someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow 'em.
Now, there's only two people in the department qualified for that.
That's you and Connors.
They just...
They just brought Connors down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Look, under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just layin' it out for you.
But you...
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
Huh.
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers, and you're gonna take your turn!
And if it's any consolation,
I'm going to be the last one outta here along with my son-in-law.
Roberts.
It's outta control.
And it's comin' your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
They wanna try somethin'.
They wanna blow those water tanks two floors above you.
They think it might kill the fire.
How they gonna get the explosives up here?
Oh, they'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell 'em.
They wanna try to put out the fire by blowing up the water tanks above us.
It's gonna mean a lot of water and steel and concrete, but if they don't try it... we're all gonna burn.
The fire's out of control below us.
They figure we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line!
- Get off!
- You crazy bastard!
Get off this line!
Let go of me!
It's not gonna work!
Oh!
It won't hold everybody!
You!
Get off!
Get outta there!
Get the hell outta there!
No!
No!
No!
Get off!
Chief.
Yeah.
Well, we just lost the breeches buoy.
There was panic up here.
It's under control now.
Okay.
I'm gonna try to set down on the roof.
I'm gonna need you up there.
Well, I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
Okay.
See you up there.
All right!
You're gonna have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts, anything you can find.
Carlos, get some knives.
For God's sakes, Carlos, don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass!
That's the '29!
Comin' through.
Comin' through.
Come on.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug, I... never thought that a thing like this could happen.
Sure.
Hey, how much time you think we got?
Ten minutes, maybe less.
We're gonna have to blow the floors out as well as the tanks, you know.
All right, this is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Now later on, after you throw the wire, we'll plug it and splice it into the timer, set it, and then it blows.
You set your explosive...
like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
Got it?
I got it.
Good luck.
See you later.
Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
How much you gonna set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Air.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go.
Fireman.
Bob!
Bob!
Oh, my God!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry.
She's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Claiborne!
What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know there's nothing that any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God that...
I can stop this from ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
A kind of shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
You know, one of these days, they're gonna kill 10,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'm gonna keep eatin' smoke and bringin' out bodies... until somebody asks us how to build 'em.
Okay.
I'm askin'.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.
Help me...
Jesus.
- Please...
- It's okay.
You're safe.
Don't worry.
Here.
Drink.
Easy...
He seems to have a normal pupil response.
No sign of brain damage... but I think you should really get a scan.
Brain damage?
What happened out there?
Did you get in an accident?
Where am I?
This is Mexico, son.
This is Mexico?
You're in San Felipe.
Don't you remember where you are?
Mexico... ?
Woman :
Is there someone we should call?
A friend?
Anybody?
Man :
I will drive you to a hospital.
It shouldn't take more than three hours.
No, maybe I should.
No -
- I'm gonna be fine.
I'll be fine.
Once this clears up, I'll remember.
Do you remember your name?
I don't even remember my face.
Try not to worry.
Temporary memory loss... sometimes happens with a bang on the head.
But, it usually comes back pretty quickly.
Don't worry.
Doc knows what he's talking about.
Like, usually... ?
Usually it'll come back, but there's no guarantee... ?
Well, that depends.
Memories usually come back in a piecemeal fashion.
You know...
little islands of memories in a big black sea of nothing.
Are you remembering something?
I was making a phone call, right here.
This is Jaime.
He seems to know you.
He wants to know who trashed the phone booth.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Entonces...
you come for your car?
Oye, amigo...
I find this next to the telephone.
Is yours, si?
"Jack Kelly." All right, I'm Jack Kelly.
See the money?
It's all there.
No touch.
Real estate agent, Boston, Massachusetts.
Jack Kelly... okay.
I wonder what I'm doing here?
Maybe I'm here for business.
If this is your car, how come you ended up in the desert?
I have no idea.
"Motel La Immaculata."
It's a rundown place on the other side of town.
"Stubbs" -- do you know a "Stubbs"?
"Stubbs"... no.
Never heard of him.
Okay.
I'd probably be dead if it wasn't for you.
What's your name?
- I'm Vicky.
- Vicky...
I'm Jack.
Right.
Thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.
- Take care.
- Yeah.
Ah, Senyor Kelly.
I thought you got lost.
No, I've just been busy.
Senyor, what happened to you?
It's nothing.
Just a little accident.
That's too bad.
You had a caller last night.
I told him, I don't know when you are back.
Who called?
Didn't leave no name.
You know what?
I lost my key.
Senyor... keys cost a lot of money.
Seeing as it's you...
Okay.
Thanks.
How long have I been here?
How long?
You know how long.
Remind me.
Is this a joke, or... ?
Please, please.
Remind me.
Two days.
Two days.
Did I say what I was doing in town?
You said something about "a change of scenery."
Okay...
Gracias.
"You have reached Richard Stubbs.
I'm not here right now, but leave a message, and I'll get back to you."
Shit.
- Motel La Immaculata.
- Si, senyor.
Jack Kelly.
- Ah, Senyor Kelly...
- Hello.
Give me -
- I want my office in Boston, okay?
Area code 61 7... 555-01 00.
Jack Kelly.
Okay, Mr. Kelly.
Seeing as it's you...
Oh, my God... !
Hello?
I'm sorry, Mr. Kelly, but the international lines are busy.
You want I should try again later?
Mr. Kelly?
Mr. Kelly?
Yeah.
Senyor Kelly!
Are you checking out?
No.
Not yet.
Stubbs.
Hi.
I clean...
No, that's okay.
It's clean.
- It's better I clean...
- No, no.
It's fine.
Gracias.
You are bleeding, Senyor --
It's just an accident.
It's okay.
Gracias.
Okay.
Yeah?
This is your wake-up call, Jack.
In more ways than one.
- Who is this?
- Very funny.
I'll see you in hell, 1 2 noon.
Who is it -- ?
Fuck.
Please, can I just pay for my gas, please?
It'll only take...
Okay, sorry, sorry.
Ma'am, please, it'll only take me one minute...
Let me just pay for my gas.
Sir, I'm in a rush --
Here, here.
Take it.
Take it.
It's all yours, all right?
Son of a bitch.
Violating a traffic regulation.
What?
You're violating a traffic regulation.
Oh...
I'm sorry.
I ran out of gas.
No gasoline.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
I don't mind paying... an on the spot fine.
Let me see some ID.
Okay... here you go.
Next time, you better watch out.
Oh, yeah, of course.
Yeah, definitely.
Don't park in this area.
Yeah... okay.
Gracias.
Have a nice day.
You got a leak.
No, I spilled the gas.
It's hard to do without a funnel.
Dropped my keys.
- Better watch out next time.
- I will, I will.
Gracias.
- Motel La Immaculata.
- Yeah, this is Jack Kelly.
Get my bill ready.
I'm ready to check out, okay?
I'm a real estate agent from Boston.
Business must be good.
Hola, Senyor.
How far is the border?
You think I'm some kind of idiot?
What?
What's the problem?
- That's the problem.
- What?
I got through to your office.
- What did they say?
- They say you are dead.
They said you died two years ago.
Dead?
How can I be dead?
Look, here's my driver's license.
- It says "Jack Kelly".
I'm not dead.
- You pay cash, or I call the police.
- I'm not dead !
- Cash, or the police!
Oh, my God.
Here.
If you're not a dead man, who the hell are you?
What the hell is this?
We've been set up!
Hey!
What's going on?
Hola.
Five dollars.
He's clean.
Would you excuse us?
Sit down.
Please, sit down.
Your meeting with Mr. Hogan... was a bruising experience.
You must have been surprised to see him down here.
Me, on the other hand, you must have known I'd find you.
There is nothing you can hide from me.
I always know where the bodies are buried.
I always know where all the bodies are buried.
After everything I told you about covering your ass, you go and trust Stubbs.
That is a bad slip, Jack.
I did you a big favor.
But right now...
I'm only interested in one thing, getting back what belongs to me.
Where is it?
I just need some more time.
Jack, I'd be sorry to lose you.
Yeah...
I'd be sorry.
Decision time.
You look like hell.
What's the point of threatening to kill you, if you're going to die on me, anyway?
That's better, eh?
We're supposed to be on the same side.
You got itchy and made a run for it.
We all make mistakes.
That -- was your last mistake.
I...
like I said, I just need a little more time.
There better not be a problem.
No, no problems.
So, my friend here has a place on the beach.
That's where we're staying.
You got three hours.
I'll be waiting for you.
Thank you.
She's cute.
Don't be a disappointment to me...
Mr. Morrissey.
"Morrissey"?
Morrissey...
Excuse me...
- I'm off work...
- Please, I need to ask a question.
- I don't think so.
- A minute of your time...
- I'm going home.
I'm sorry.
- Just one question.
Having a problem, Vicky?
Nothing I can't handle.
The boss has a special guest that wants to buy you a drink.
Rafa, you know I buy my own drinks.
Hey, Vicky...
No.
Consider it a career opportunity.
I don't need a career opportunity.
Hey, hey!
She said she doesn't want to go --
Que te pasa, pendejo?
Rafa!
Stop it.
Enough !
Can we please talk, now?
Yeah.
So, your name's not "Jack Kelly", it's "Morrissey".
Gracias.
That's what he called me.
"Morrissey".
Who is that guy?
I don't know.
I don't know, but...
he sure as hell knows me.
You do know Stubbs, don't you?
Yeah.
I don't really know him, I know his wife, Heidi.
She works in the club, waiting tables.
- Heidi.
- Yeah.
She's been kinda scared these last few days.
I guess he told her there were some dangerous men coming into town.
And now, he's missing.
When I asked about Stubbs, you thought I was one of them?
Well, yeah, I thought that.
So, was I wrong?
I don't know.
I don't know.
And that's why I need your help.
I live alone, I work so I can paint,
I occasionally have a wild game of Scrabble.
That's it.
That's my life.
How could I help you?
You could tell me where Stubbs lived.
- "Lived"?
- Lived.
Listen...
I'm pretty sure it was the guy in the club.
It's not me.
But I gotta find out what's goin' on.
Please.
Just give me one good reason why I should think about helping you.
Truthfully?
'Cause if you don't, I'll be dead in three hours.
Hello?
It's 1 0:30.
Where the hell are you?
I told you I had to have it tonight.
I can't wait another day.
I'll give you ten minutes, then I'm gonna go back to...
Stubbs?
It's Hogan.
He was there, all right, but the bastard got away.
If he contacts you, string him along, and I'll be in touch.
Woman :
Smile!
You guys, smile.
You look terrible.
Why don't you go get us some beers, honey?
And while you're at it, why don't you cover up a bit?
You're gonna fry out here.
You want a clean ID?
Yeah, I can do it, Jack.
Takes three weeks.
You sure you wanna do this?
Yeah.
Means no more Macauley.
It means getting up in the morning, and doing whatever you want.
Good for you, Jack.
You got it.
Jack... !
Heidi?
Where's Stubbs, Jack?
Is he alive?
Jack...
Heidi...
He's not dead, he's not dead...
Heidi, listen to me.
I need to talk to you, okay?
What I want to ask you is gonna seem very weird, but you have to answer these questions for me, okay?
Okay, come on, let's get a drink.
I remember this picture.
I'm not sure exactly why --
I took it.
That's when he began to get suspicious.
You see, he never knew that we... had a thing before he married me.
Heidi, you must know me very well, then.
God, Jack -- even after all those times we were together,
I'm not sure I ever did.
Did I ever tell you anything about myself?
My family, my friends?
Where I was from?
- Anything?
- The way I remember it,
I did most of the talking.
Stubbsy was making me something.
Did he make it?
Do you know that, or was he gonna sell me out the whole time?
I don't know, Jack.
I swear, I don't know.
But, he didn't sell you out for money, or nothing.
You know, he always liked you.
When I knew you were coming to see us again... we had a big fight, the worst one we've ever had.
I never seen him so crazy.
He just kept asking over and over, do I still have a thing for you?
Finally, I got mad, and I said...
"Yes...
I do."
"I do."
Oh, God.
I think it broke his heart.
If only I hadn't said anything...
Heidi... whatever happened to Stubbs... had nothing to do with you.
Goodbye, Jack.
Maybe it's not such a bad thing, if you forgot who you were.
You're much nicer, now.
Bye.
I know, I know.
It's Hogan.
Your local people fucked up.
Hogan slipped through their fingers.
But my boy's on it here.
He never lets me down.
Listen, don't you threaten me.
I know what the funds are intended for.
I said, it's being dealt with !
Can you believe this shit?
Very impressive, Jack.
You see how good he is?
Real professional.
Yeah, he's clean.
Did you think you could delete your file that easily?
This is what you're looking for.
It's portable this way.
Easy to turn over to whomever I want.
I mean, if necessary.
I hope you haven't come empty-handed.
- We need to talk.
- Good.
I'm listening.
Alone.
I don't believe that.
You wouldn't lose that kind of money.
I didn't say it was lost.
I'll get it back.
I tried to give you a little rope.
I figured you went a little crazy, and needed some time to think about things.
But... enough is enough.
- Have I ever let you down before?
- You lied to me.
You steal from me... and now you have the audacity to ask me that?
Answer my question.
Have I ever let you down before?
Yes, or no?
"Yes, or no?"
You don't think I'm capable of having you killed?
Is that it?
I just need 24 hours.
Give me 24 hours, you'll get it.
I want you to think about... all the people you've betrayed, and lied to, all the people you've stabbed in the back.
All I have to do is turn over the file, and -- the real you gets exposed.
You're the best liar I've ever met.
You're a natural born liar.
And you know what makes you so good?
That's all you are, a liar.
A bunch of lies, that's all you are.
Because that's how you wanted me.
Oh, yes, absolutely.
But now, you've changed.
You've started lying to me.
How do you think that makes me feel?
I don't know.
I'll be honest with you.
I am in trouble.
If my superiors knew that you had deliberately... screwed up the last operation, there'd be nothing... nothing I can do to save you.
Jack...
You've got 24 hours.
Go.
Get out of my sight.
Oh -
- God !
Sorry.
It's you.
- It's me.
- Whoever that is.
Very cute.
Well, you're alive.
This is good.
You must have found what you were looking for at Stubbs'.
Yes, and no.
"Yes and no"?
What does that mean?
It means I need your help again.
U h-huh.
What can I do?
I think I buried a suitcase in the desert, next to a very big cactus.
And I can't remember where it is.
Why'd you do that?
What's in it?
It's a long story.
But if I don't find it, I'm in big shit.
So, what do you want from me?
Do you remember when you first found me?
Do you think you could take me back to that place?
If I could at least start from there, maybe that would trigger something.
Wait, wait, stop the car.
... it's 1 0:30.
Where the hell are you?
I told you I had to have it tonight.
I can't wait around another day.
I'll give you ten minutes, then I'm gonna go back --
I'm not quite as dumb as you thought.
Eh, Jack?
- Where's my goddamned money?
- Fuck you !
Very funny, Jack.
You think this is funny?
I jumped out of the car right here.
I thought they were gonna kill me.
I jumped out here.
Same guys who killed Stubbs?
No.
- What is it?
- It's a luggage claim.
Maybe it's for the suitcase.
I thought you said you buried it under a cactus.
Maybe I was wrong.
The only place that does that is the bus station.
Do you mind?
Are you gonna open it?
Sorry.
It's those guys.
Let's get out of here.
Man :
Stay away from me!
I'm gonna kill him !
Jack, back off, Jack!
Back off!
Hey, you all right?
You okay?
No.
What's in it?
Clothes.
Just clothes and stuff.
Nothin', really.
- That's it?
- And this.
- But I thought that --
- I know.
So, are you... ?
I don't know.
Well... if it ain't Jumpin' Jack Flash.
You're a hard man to find, Jack.
It's almost like you're tryin' to avoid me.
Cool it.
Whoa... you haven't introduced me to your friend.
Cleopatra.
"Cleopatra"?
Well, Cleopatra... what's a nice...
Egyptian girl doing with a piece of white trash like Jack?
Go wait out in the car.
You see, me and Jack... we recently embarked upon a little business venture together,
in the world of high finance, you might say.
But, Jack -
- Jack just isn't a team player.
Isn't that so, Jack?
Let go of her hand.
She has nothing to do with this.
Let go of her hand, and you and I will talk.
I think our relationship has gone way past the talking stage.
- Our what?
- Relationship.
What do you know about our relationship?
You don't even know who I am.
Who do you think I am?
I think you're a lying, devious, piece of shit.
- Ever hear of a guy named Macauley?
- Should I?
- Never heard of Macauley?
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Do you know who Macauley is?
- I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck who Macauley is, and I don't have time for this.
I want my money!
Jack:
Go, go, go!
- Truck.
- Okay.
Take that guy out!
What the fuck... ?
Keep him down !
Get out of the car!
Get out!
Come on !
Stay down.
Stay low.
Thanks.
Get the car!
- You wanna go to a hospital?
- No.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Just keep driving.
Shit.
Right.
Damn it.
Go!
Go!
Move!
- They're too fast.
- Go to the desert.
Okay, okay.
- That's it.
- What is it?
Stop the car.
That's it.
That's the cactus.
This is what I saw in my dream.
I was looking in the wrong place.
I buried it here.
I had to wait in town, because Stubbs didn't have my papers ready.
I didn't want to be carrying around that kind of money with me.
This is it.
Jack, they're coming.
- This is it...
- We'll get the money later.
Come on.
Look out!
Shit.
That's it.
We're walking.
Think we lost 'em?
I hope so.
Let's get off this road.
How far is your place?
It's just a couple of miles this way.
Why don't you dump the suitcase?
It's just clothes.
No, I can't do that.
You came here to break away from your old life.
That's what I did.
I was becoming someone I didn't like.
One day, when I woke up next to a dead man with a needle stuck in his arm, I knew I had to get out.
Yeah, but I didn't make it.
I just ended up lost.
That scares me.
What I'm remembering about my life scares me.
And what scares me more... is what I can't remember.
I can't promise anything.
Me neither.
Jack:
Smells nice.
Hey.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- How are you doing?
- Good.
Good.
I gotta walk the dog.
- Want some coffee?
- Sounds great.
Vicky:
Come here, boy.
Mac:
We all make mistakes.
But that was your last.
Jack:
It wasn't a mistake.
I robbed an armored car with these guys.
I was supposed to bring the money to Mac... but I didn't.
Not this time.
Mac:
There is nothing you can hide from me...
I always know where the bodies are buried.
A bunch of lies, that's all you are!
Yeah, I can do it, Jack.
Takes three weeks.
It means no more Macauley.
Sure you wanna do this?
Hey, boy.
Come here.
What's going on?
It all came back to me.
I kill...
I cheat...
I steal... and I lie.
That's what I do.
That's who I am.
Thanks for your help.
Don't mention it.
- I don't care about that.
- Sit the fuck down, motherfucker.
I can't hear you...
Shut up!
I'm on the fuckin' phone to my broker.
- Tell him to put his gun down.
- I don't think so.
Put your gun down, now !
- Do what he says.
- Sit down.
Put the magazine down, take the gun out of your lap... put it on the table.
Now.
Sit down.
Think you're pretty clever, huh?
Smarter than the average criminal, right?
You're so fuckin' dead, Jack.
Sit back.
Now.
Let's put our personal feelings aside for a second, okay?
Just listen to me.
The only way you're going to see any of that money... is if you and I go into business together.
I don't have very good memories of the last time we did that.
You listen to me.
Remember the guy I was talking about?
Macauley?
He and his men got the money, all of it.
The only way we'll see a cent of it, is if we hit him together.
You and I.
Now.
We split it 50/50.
Decision time.
You gonna be clever, Hogan?
Or are you gonna remain unpaid labor?
Get in.
I thought it would be better if you were a silent partner this time.
You better pray Macauley has the money.
Hogan :
Tell Macauley I want the money, or I'll torch this place!
Man, you could have killed me!
Wasn't even close.
Clean yourself up.
Mac wants us.
What the hell are you doing?
Trying to get us all killed?
- You know me, don't you?
- Of course, I know you.
Let go of me.
Am I "Jack Ford"?
Richards, tell me.
There's only one guy who knows for sure -
- Macauley.
Stop asking me this shit.
Are you ready?
Let's go get these guys.
Go!
When you made a break for it, I was kind of envious.
Why don't you just walk away from him, then?
He's got me by the balls, like everyone who works for him.
He's got a file on you, too?
He's got a file on all of us.
"Fifty-fifty", eh, Jack?
Were you lyin' again, Jack?
Jack, you...
You all right?
Oh, yeah.
I'll live.
Hey, man, I got something for you.
It's from Stubbs.
I got to Stubbs' house before Mac did.
- Richards... !
- Yeah.
I figured, why should he have everyone by the balls?
Where's Macauley now?
Jack, forget him.
You're finally away from him.
Please, where's Mac?
He went to get the girl.
He figured that --
- The girl... ?
- Vicky.
How long ago?
An hour.
Call an ambulance.
- Jack...
- Thank you.
Nothing.
- So, where is it?
- I don't know.
Where the hell is it?
- He said he buried it here...
- Maybe he was lying.
Maybe you are lying.
Maybe you are trying to help him.
Mac!
Ah, Mr. Ford.
How nice to see you again.
What's goin' on?
Didn't I tell you I'd get you your money?
You're late.
I told you 24 hours.
Well, I'm here now.
Let her go.
Your gun, please.
Thank you.
Doesn't matter... she's dead, anyway.
Fuck you.
Fuck you both.
I like her, Jack.
Under different circumstances, I'd even say I approved.
I know what you are, honey.
You are a 28-year-old, college dropout... who spent nine months in prison on a possessions charge.
I still get a kick out of the look on their faces when I do that.
- I wanna make a deal with you.
- A deal?
No.
I have had enough of your deals.
In fact, I'm coming to the conclusion... that I've had enough of you.
You thought you could kill us all.
You thought you could kill me.
I could be across the border by now, but I'm not.
I'm here.
Well... you're here because you can't run.
You're here because Stubbs didn't deliver your new life.
No, you're wrong.
Stubbs delivered.
Posthumously.
Birth certificate, passport, everything.
Stubbs...
"Pilgrim".
That's cute.
You could have vanished.
I made a mistake.
I'm back.
Tell Sanchez where the money is, and we can get out of this lousy country.
You let her go, then you get your money.
That's the deal.
You know, things don't work that way, Jack.
Well, they do now.
What the hell is this?
What do you care what happens to some junkie?
It's just the way I want it, Mac.
Okay, okay.
Let's deal with the money first.
The money, Jack.
Let her go, then you get me, and the money.
Go on.
Get in the car.
Go ahead.
If that's what Jack wants.
See?
I can be reasonable.
I'm not --
I'm not a monster.
- Sanchez --
- I'll do it.
You realize that the girl won't make it as far as the border.
I can't let that happen.
But, it was the principle of the thing, right?
Careful, careful.
Slowly, please.
Careful.
What's so funny?
Nothin'.
What is this?
Don't fuck with me.
Why not?
I don't know you.
What are you talking about?
Where's the money?
I don't remember.
That's bullshit!
That's bullshit, right?
No... it's not.
That crack you took on the head?
Yeah.
Tell me who I am, Mac.
Maybe then I'll remember where the money is.
Tell me.
Mac:
Get the file from my case.
In the meantime, we can start with a little overview.
You are human garbage.
I picked you out of juvenile prison, because one thing separated you... from the rest of the scum you lived with.
You had potential.
You were intelligent, and very violent.
Thank you.
Here, Jack.
This is your life.
Great reading.
Really, it is.
When I first read it at the beginning, I knew you were something I wanted.
Because... because no one else did.
No one else.
It starts here with your birth certificate.
Hello, Jack.
You don't know me, but I made it my business to know you.
Come on, kid.
Today's your lucky day.
When I first read your file, I knew you were something I wanted.
Because no one else did.
No one else.
Decision time.
Do we have a deal?
Jack.
Is this what you want?
There you go, Jack.
Say goodbye.
Pull that trigger, and you might be able to get that file.
But you'll never know what I know.
I'll make it easier.
Kill me.
Kill me, and it's yours.
Can't do it?
Of course you can't.
I'm more to you than what's in that file.
I'm the only flesh and blood you've ever had.
I'm the only person... who ever gave a shit about you.
Nothing -- nothing in that file matters.
I'm what matters!
You, me... that's it.
Mac:
Jesus Christ, Jack...
Sorry, Mac.
What's in there?
Nothing.
You never had a name to begin with.
Nope.
We should probably get out of here.
So, where is the money, Jack?
It's gotta be out there somewhere.
- So, how was it?
- Good.
- You're going to go ahead?
- Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying that, uh... no matter how hot it gets up there during the day... there's not a damn thing to do at night.
That's right.
What are you going to do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold for boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
MAN:
Can you come in the office a minute?
DOUG:
I got people waiting upstairs.
What I wanted to tell you is that...
Senator Parker's flying in for the dedication tonight, and he's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them, I'll build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'll never leave.
Right after the party, watch me burn my black tie.
MAN:
Glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay open.
Whatever happened to hello?
Hello.
- How are you?
- Good.
- You look like it took.
- Hi, Mr. Roberts.
Just a second.
We're going to miss you.
Duncan know?
He's all smiles.
- What electromagnets went in?
- Doug.
- Thompson g-4s.
- Shouldn't they be g-12s?
Oh, no.
That's what comes from this damn last-minute panic.
I'll fix it.
Keep running into groundwater on that Atlanta job.
- Bring the designs in.
- How about Chicago's specs?
[Everyone talking]
In a minute, guys.
- Well, hello.
- Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
- She's here?
- Mm-hmm.
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we going to talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
WOMAN, LAUGHING:
You're better.
All protein, no bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
What's in that suitcase?
I got about $140 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this... and they will... remember to tell them that it was my idea.
You got change for a 50?
Sorry.
That's the smallest I have.
Not a chance.
Let's see what we got here.
Oh, um... 25... 50... 60... 70... 75... 85... 95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
[Trolley bell clanging]
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
Tomorrow we'll try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us tonight.
Thank you, but I'm going up to the party in the tower.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since daddy died.
Here, let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
[LOUD MUSIC PLAYING] Sorry.
What was that?
- I said how are you?
- OK.
[Woman laughs]
Good-bye.
OK.
I'll get on it right now.
Mr. Callahan, we still got any g-12 electrodes in stock?
Yeah.
Main storeroom.
OK.
Booster pump, zone one.
110.
Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell...
Go ahead.
Ah, here we are.
Are there offices on this floor as well as apartments?
I wouldn't like that.
No.
The business offices only go as high as 80.
From the 81st floor here up to 120, it's exclusively residential.
The apartment I want to show you is 8145.
Say, Bill, tune in the main utility room.
OK.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire department alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself...
there's no fire.
Well, the sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
They're having wiring problems.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello?
Dave's leaving.
They offered me Managing Editor.
Oh, that's nice.
I mean...
Well, I guess we got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
See, Doug, I want the kind of life you're talking about, a place where our kids can run around, grow, and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I've wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
You see, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both, can I?
I don't know.
[Telephone beeps]
Yeah.
Where?
I'll be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight, hmm?
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
- Power off?
- Yeah.
- What about that?
- It should have been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
JIM:
I know.
I know.
Callahan called me.
Now, just how bad is it?
DOUG:
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
The specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
[Lntercom buzzes]
- Yeah.
- Mr. Bigelow's here, sir.
OK.
Send him in.
One piece of scorched wire from a burned-out circuit breaker... is hardly conclusive.
Maybe not, but I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will...
Doug...
J. D...
Wait till you see this.
What happened?
Somebody hang the wallpaper upside down?
We have an equipment problem.
- No problem in the tower?
- Could be.
Doug, you're just guessing.
All right, but I want to talk to your son-in-law right away.
OK.
- Get me Roger Simmons.
- Yes, sir.
We'll check this out, I guarantee you.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah.
A fire.
In this building?
Come on.
You know we haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
The party should've been put off.
Hold it, Will.
[Lntercom buzzes] Everybody's overreacting.
- Yes?
- Mr. Simmons is out, sir.
Out where?
WOMAN:
They don't know, but I left word for him to call.
JIM:
OK.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow, then we'll decide what to do.
- That's OK, isn't it?
- No.
It won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it, we've got to get these electrical systems on the beam.
Our whole security program's loused up without them.
Don't go away.
[Doorbell chimes]
Doug!
Well, what a surprise.
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina, everywhere... no luck.
What's he done?
I'll get you a drink.
He must have done something because my father called.
I haven't heard him that upset in years.
DOUG:
Any idea where he is?
Well, my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's roughly equivalent to that of the timber wolf... anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you want to wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
[Door closes]
Hi, Doug.
ROGER:
Honey.
WOMAN:
Hello.
What are you drinking these days?
DOUG:
Nothing right now.
ROGER:
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
DOUG:
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a power surge and a systems failure.
- How can that be?
- It can't be, theoretically... unless you've been screwing with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours, anyway?
I'm just wondering what kind of kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
Every wire is strictly up to code:
Inspected and approved.
The code's not enough for that building, and you know it.
I asked for installations way, way above standard.
You live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
It would take weeks and someone with more clout to make me.
In my office.
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then, probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do, punch him in the nose?
Roger, if you've done anything to dad's building, God help you.
Maybe I don't need God's help, or your old man's, not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks... even if that's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
But we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
We mustn't miss the party.
[Trolley bell clanging]
OFFICER:
Stand back, please!
MAN:
Give me a wide camera angle.
OFFICER:
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes.
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Oh, nonsense.
You be a good girl, Elke.
I left some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
- Did you find Simmons?
- Yeah, I found him.
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but 2 bucks will get you 10 he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks are the only way he could have swung it.
Well... here you are.
Your original specs.
Zone one only, but we got to start somewhere.
The son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
- Susan.
- Hello, Dan.
Good show.
- How are you, dear?
- Jim, congratulations.
- It's magnificent.
- Thank you.
Uh, I'll meet you out front.
I'd like to talk to Susan for a minute.
Right.
Find me the architect who designed you, and who needs Doug Roberts?
I do.
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries tonight reads like a "who's who."
There are leaders from society and government, stars of screen and television.
And now just arriving, the honorable Gary Parker, chairman of the Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator flew in from Washington for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words.
PARKER:
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents another landmark... in a long succession of landmarks for this great city.
You got him in the bag.
I'm deeply appreciative of being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
[Applause]
Thank you.
MAN:
Now, ladies and gentlemen, it's Mr. And Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
PARKER:
How are you?
JIM:
Nice to see you, senator.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
When I get time, I want to ask you a few questions, and I expect some straight answers.
MAN:
Now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
[Applause and whistling]
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent Glass Tower... tallest building in the world.
Oh...
Ha ha!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
Oh!
This way.
JIM:
After you.
MRS. SIMMONS:
This is really going to thrill you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
That's incredible.
I've never seen the bridge like that.
[Everyone talking excitedly]
- It's absolutely unbelievable!
- It's astonishing!
WOMAN:
How did it go, Mr. Bigelow?
- Fine, thank you.
Good night.
- Good night.
SECOND WOMAN:
Shall I leave you a night line?
You can disconnect.
I've had it with phones today.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Lorrie, sorry to break into your evening, but one letter has got to go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
I never thought he'd come back before the party.
You could've left 10 minutes ago and missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not doing anything tonight.
- Have a nice weekend.
- Thanks.
You, too.
Hello.
Hi.
- Promise me something?
- What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
- Cut off the phone lines.
- Mm-hmm.
Pour coffee down my neck.
- Tweak my nose?
- Mmm.
I promise.
WOMAN, SINGING:
We may never love like this again
Don't stop the flow
We can't let go
We may never love like this again
And touch the sky
Though we may try
So while we're here, let's give our all
Release the dreams inside us
And set them free
Oh, while we're here, let's leave a mark
There's a candle in the dark
It's here to guide us
We may never love like this again
But through the days
Beyond the haze
I see you...
- Hi there.
- Marge, how's the family?
- Just fine, thank you.
- Good.
Gary.
GARY:
Yeah.
JIM:
Would you excuse us?
MAN:
See you later.
I've got a surprise.
Politicians don't like surprises.
- Carlos.
- Yes, sir.
Oh.
What can I fix you, Mr. Duncan?
I want you to meet Senator Parker.
- Carlos, great pleasure.
- A great honor, Senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
Oh.
'29!
That's all you're going to drink tonight.
A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'll ship back to Washington.
- Open a bottle.
- Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
Let me guess:
You're looking for someone?
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty and me.
What can I get you?
Nothing now, thank you, Roger.
Susan, tell me, what does a girl do in San Francisco... when her old man decides to leave for two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No head-hunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
You must miss your villa.
Well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming, yachting, partying, and that sort of thing.
Believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors, even such old scraps as I.
- No false humility, please.
- Shall we?
I, uh...
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco... to regain my perspective and my humility... and spend more time at the one thing I'm good at... the stock market.
Monte Carlo's loss is San Francisco's gain.
Thank you.
Do you, uh...
do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
We better leave it off.
[Telephone rings]
Utility.
Wes.
Doug.
I'm on 83 with Will.
We've got a wiring problem.
An overload could be trouble.
Shut down as many zone-one systems as you can.
I can't.
We've got all the lights on for the ceremony.
All... you mean, the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without a direct OKfrom Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility.
Turn off the goddamn lights.
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
I didn't say kill all the power, just the overload.
Yes, sir.
We better get down to 81 and check the relay system.
They turned on everything in the building.
There's something on 81.
[Alarm sounds]
Bill, phone it in just in case our automatic lines are out.
- I'll be in 81.
- Got it.
[Alarm rings]
[Sirens]
[Horns honking]
[Alarm beeps]
Hey!
Aah!
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
Pull it around.
Pull it over him!
Come on!
Get some water on that fire!
Turn it on!
Oh, my God.
Oh.
Down.
Duck.
Stay low.
Call an ambulance for this man.
Damn it, man!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor.
- What about the fire department?
- They're on their way.
Get that ambulance!
Let's get him in the elevator.
Try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
Hello.
This is 81.
We've had an accident.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
- Yes, right away.
- Call Duncan in the tower.
You got a lot of people up there.
- What?
- Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
Everybody wants to know why the great architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been pretty badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
I've got an ambulance coming, but get those people upstairs down on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but...
Well, then, why the urgency?
Urgency?
Dunc, if that fire was caused by fluky wiring, we could get fires breaking out everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
Now, I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I am not going to concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 because it can't possibly affect us up here, not in this building.
Have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
Meantime, get in your dinner jacket and come join the party.
Now, come on!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and...
Oh, Jesus.
- The Glass Tower.
- What?
The Glass Tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Yeah.
Is it as rough as I hear?
It's like being inside a chimney.
[Horn honking]
People!
Hell, they got here before we did.
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
- Get some hands over here.
- Yeah.
You understand I want you over that way?
Mike, she's running a lot of smoke.
- 81st floor, right?
- Right.
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
- Set up a forward command.
- Got it.
- Chief.
This is Roberts, the architect.
What have we got, Kappy?
Fire started 81st floor, storage room.
A bad one.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
What about your exhaust system?
Should have reversed.
Must have been a motor burnout.
- Sprinklers?
- They're not working on 81.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
- Jim?
- Yes, sir.
Give us a refresher on your stand pipe system.
We got outlets on every floor...
3 and 1.5 inch.
GPM?
1,500 from ground to 68, 1,000 from 68 to 100, and 500 from there to the roof.
These elevators are programmed for emergency service?
- These two are.
- What floor are your plans on?
79.
My office.
That's 2 floors below the fire.
That'll be our forward command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
OK.
- Whew.
Architects.
- Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know there's no sure way to fight fires over the 7th floor, but you guys keep building them as high as you can.
Hey, are you here to take me on or the fire?
What about the 81st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I want to see all your floor plans... 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
I'm worried about all those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 is evacuated, but it doesn't look good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry about that.
We're moving them out now.
Not live-ins, business tenants.
We looked up there, too.
The majority haven't moved in.
Those that have aren't working at night.
I want to know who they are, not where.
What does that got to do with anything?
Do you have wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Do you have any sporting goods manufacturers?
Table tennis balls give off toxic gases.
- You want me to keep going?
- One list of tenants coming up.
Thank you.
What have we got?
Elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators over here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
- Pipe alleys here?
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- This is south?
- South.
- Any construction in 81?
- Nope.
Anything that could blow up... like gasoline, kerosene, fabric cleaner?
- I don't think so.
- Good.
I'll be up on 81.
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating...
a party.
Party?
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down.
Check that hallway.
Jack.
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
- I'll be up topside.
- Right.
Jack.
Watch yourself.
Keep it high.
- You looking for me, Chief?
- Lf you're Duncan, yeah.
I am.
Everything under control?
You've got to move these people out.
Oh, now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister.
All fires are bad.
Well, I don't believe you're familiar... with the many safety systems we designed into this building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
- Let's get these people out.
- I don't think you're listening.
There's no way for a fire on 81 to reach here in this building.
OK, I'll do it.
Hold it.
The mayor's out there.
Do you want me to pull rank?
When there's a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I could tell them, but you ought to.
Make a cool announcement to all your guests... and tell them the party's being moved below the fire floor.
Right now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Don't leave this table.
You I want to talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
- I most certainly did.
- For God's sakes, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire, and if it was caused by anything you did,
I'm going to hang you out to dry and then hang you.
Would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire... in one of our storage rooms 50 floors below.
Now, I assure you there's no danger, but in accordance with the fire department's orders... a purely precautionary procedure... we're going to move the party down to the lobby for a while and we'll be serving cocktails and champagne... in our Continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, there's no reason to rush.
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
Lisolette!
Lisolette.
- How's it going, Chief?
- Better get ready.
Pull out the floor plans on 82.
- We got problems.
- Fire lapping up?
- Yeah.
Are com lines set up?
- Phone jacks on every floor.
I'm going to plug into your P.A. System.
- How about your emergency setup?
- Battery-powered standby system.
Can you splice these lines into our 2-way communication panel?
- Sure.
- No problem?
- No problem.
- How long will this take?
- A minute.
- Not bad.
Here's our problem.
The fire's lapping here, going up through the window.
Get down!
What the hell was that?
Come on!
The building's going!
They're trapped.
We need help.
Bring a line!
Pull them out.
Pull them out.
Put the fire out.
Knock it out.
Battalion two to forward command.
Urgent.
Forward command.
Go ahead.
Explosion on 81.
Fire headed toward elevator vents.
We need more crews fast.
They need relief on 81.
Hit it.
They're on their way.
- Done.
- You better call Duncan.
Tell him to stop people from using that express elevator, or somebody's going to get killed.
Kappy, ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads here and choppers.
We're going to need them to get...
Come on, fireman.
[Firemen coughing]
- I'll be on 81.
- Fine.
Fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload it.
OK, Doug.
I don't like the way you talked to me.
- You drunk?
- Not yet.
Out of my way.
You didn't talk like this two years ago, running over budget, out of money?
Did you ask me how I could shave $2 million off electrical costs?
Shut up and help with these people.
Let me ask you, dear father, am I the only subcontractor you encouraged to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4 million... in Doug's original budget?
[Everyone talking]
DUNCAN:
Everyone!
PEOPLE:
Shh!
Please.
Please.
Hold it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
You'll have to move back into the Promenade Room.
We'll be taking you down by the scenic elevator.
These express elevators can be activated by fire.
With the probability of short circuits, the cars might stop on the floor where the fire is.
So, please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there.
[People yelling]
DUNCAN:
For God's sakes, get out of there!
Please.
Back.
[Sirens wailing and horns honking]
- Looks bad, Jack.
- It is.
I got a couple men hurt.
Fire's spreading down all corridors.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
Let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out.
Take it down.
Empty all the water out.
Pull them down.
Chief, it's out of control.
We're losing it.
Bring in another line.
[Tank alarm bell rings]
Get another tank.
[People screaming]
[Coughing]
Angela.
Angela.
Phillip!
Phillip, open the door!
[People screaming]
Do you have any brilliant ideas I can use upstairs... to explain where I've been all this time?
I think what you might do is walk right up to him... and say, "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay,
"but my secretary had an urgent personal problem."
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
Hmm.
[Dan laughs]
He won't.
- You know what astonishes me?
- What?
- You make love with a girl...
- Mm-hmm.
And afterwards there's no visible evidence, nothing to mark the event.
I mean, look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus.
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
- Dan.
- Yeah.
OK.
Yeah.
Right.
What did they say?
- Help is on the way.
- Oh.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please just join the end of the line.
SUSAN:
Oh, no, madam.
Please.
WOMAN:
I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
- They're aware of that.
- She's wearing a purple dress.
- I've got to find her.
- I promise you they'll find her.
Now, only 12 at a time.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
It won't be too long.
MAN:
What's she doing on 87?
Forward command?
I want to speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man, you should have sent a man up there.
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf.
Sure, the kids can hear.
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
Stay where you are.
I'll get them down.
MAN:
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews now!
HARRY:
Still got people on 87.
I'll get them down.
I'll give you a hand.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
At least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.
[Fire roaring]
Don't go.
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
On your mark.
Dan!
Aah!
[Coughing]
Aah!
Aah!
It's going down that corridor!
[Coughing]
- You all right?
- They're in there!
- The mother and two children.
- We'll get them.
Wait a minute.
Please, Mrs. Mueller, please stay back.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
[Coughing]
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
[Coughing]
It's OK, kid.
It's OK.
Come on.
He's OK.
- Mo-mom.
- Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
Anybody else?
My si... my sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela.
Angela?
Angela.
Angela, where are you?
[Crying]
It's going to be OK, Angela.
Oh, thank God you're all right, Angela.
Got to get away.
[Sirens]
[Alarm rings]
[Sirens]
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
All right.
Don't press the pause button.
[Riders gasp]
Everybody, just calm down.
Take it easy.
It'll take a couple hours to get everyone down.
I suggest those with stout hearts and trim waistlines... start using the stairs.
- That's 135 floors.
- All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos.
Help us try to get this thing open.
- It's stuck?
- Yeah.
Let me try to kick it.
- I'll call security.
- Yes, sir.
Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
The Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
You want it easy, Chief?
I don't see why they couldn't design a survival suit for us... like they did for football players.
- Who pays to see us play?
- Yeah, yeah.
Let's go to work.
I need two men to go to the tower room.
A door's jammed I want cleared.
OK, you got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men... make sure they got 30 minutes of air.
There's going to be glass sailing all over this city.
Call the police, have them move those barricades 4 blocks back.
- Got it.
- Let's hit it.
Yo!
Security guard!
Anyone here?
Hello?
Security.
Say, kitty, I almost missed you.
PHILLIP:
Ow!
Keep away from the walls.
There's a fire on the other side.
[Hissing]
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Aah!
Oh, my God!
Is there any way you can get down?
- I think I can.
- Phillip!
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip, come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, boy.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip.
Your foot's just a couple inches away.
There you go.
Easy, now.
Easy, now.
Don't look down.
That-a boy.
Come on.
I got you.
I got you.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
[Coughing]
We were supposed to have fire drills, they said, but they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
Are you all right?
I got up all right, but I'll have trouble getting down.
You think you could help me?
Could you hold on around my neck real tight?
Oh, no.
Come on, give it a try.
Put your arms around me and tell me what to do, OK?
Put her legs down.
[Angela whimpering]
OK, Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.
Come on.
Hang on.
Just hold on tight, honey.
Hold on.
Hold on.
OK.
Hold on tight, now.
It's going to be OK, now.
PHILLIP:
Hold on.
DOUG:
Easy, now.
PHILLIP:
Hold on, Angela.
DOUG:
I've got ahold of you.
PHILLIP:
Arms around my neck.
That-a girl.
Nurse!
Bring him over here.
[Coughing]
Mrs. Mueller, you've got to try.
Take it slowly, now.
You got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet, now.
Can you see it?
Hold on to that pole and grab my belt.
Try to get your left hand over there.
A half a foot.
6 inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on, just get to me over here.
ANGELA:
Mrs. Mueller!
Are you all right?
All right, let's go.
[Fire roaring]
[Angela crying]
Come on.
Come on.
[Exhaustedly] I'm coming.
I'm coming.
MAN:
Are you OK?
Nobody's going to get down this way.
Oh, God, we're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on.
Let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan.
Inside.
Security phone.
On the right.
- Chief O'Hallorhan right away.
- I'm trying to get through now.
[Angela crying]
- Can't we go down?
- No.
The fire's below us.
This will put us right underneath under the promenade.
Come on!
[Telephone rings]
Jim, get that phone.
Check the ventilating systems over here.
Jack.
Yeah?
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling and vent that other side.
It's for you... the air patrol officer for the copters.
Thank you.
Jack, I'm going to get some relief for you and your men.
This is O'Hallorhan.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy air rescue.
It's about time.
We could use rescue choppers.
I'll order them right away.
I'd like to set up next to the forward command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then we'll trot right up the stairs.
Just trot right up to 79, huh?
- Standing by in the lobby, sir.
- Thank you.
How the hell...
They won't hear us.
There's 300 people.
It's a fire door.
It's over 21/2 inches thick.
- Maybe I could crawl through.
- Will we be able to go with you?
It leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
PHILLIP:
Use this.
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
I'll tell him.
- Chief?
- How does it look on 65?
- They're getting it contained.
- It's still below us.
Let's take a look.
OK, watch the electrics.
[Whistles]
Come here!
The generator's blown, but the backup should have kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
[Everyone talking]
- Push it!
- I'm pushing.
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
Whole system's failed.
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold on to me a second.
Hold on.
- Christ, it's one of our men!
- Oh, God.
OK, OK.
We'll go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We're going to rappel to 65, get on top of that elevator, use it for an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
OK... then you better go first.
When you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
OK, open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.
Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
- Not for us.
- Mike, where have you been?
We had a little trouble.
Navy flight commander needs you in the lobby.
65 floors, just walk right down?
Only 5.
An elevator on 60 is running on auxiliary power.
- You've got this controlled?
- We're getting there.
You men stay with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike...
This one of your men?
MIKE: "Dan Bigelow." Nope.
Must be a civilian.
O'Hallorhan's on his way.
- Look!
- There's another one there!
Hey, Carlos, give me that security phone.
- Mr. Roberts, how'd you get in?
- I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
That's OK.
Anybody will do.
The south stairwell is blocked with cement, for Christ's sake.
Can you send somebody to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How...
OK.
Oh... oh, my lord.
Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get that high.
She'll be all right.
[Footsteps]
- Oh, hello, ma'am.
- Oh, hello.
- How are you doing?
- Fine.
We're glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
OK.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
DOUG:
Mrs. Mueller?
PHILLIP:
It's Mr. Roberts.
DOUG:
Mrs. Mueller?
Phillip?
FIREFIGHTER:
We hear you!
We're going to blow this door!
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood.
OK, ma'am, let's get down there out of the way.
Please go back.
They're going to dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing up the exit door.
OK, get down low.
What explosives are you using?
It's plastic.
C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here.
Shine this on the bag.
That's it.
Keep it over here.
- Is there going to be a bang?
- Nothing to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
OK.
Everybody ready?
DOUG:
Good going, guys.
Hey!
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
Not a chance.
The stairway below is completely gone.
[Everyone talking]
DUNCAN:
Everyone, listen!
CARLOS:
Hold it down.
DUNCAN:
Listen!
I've been informed by the fire department... that there's no possibility of using this stairway to get out.
[Crowd sighs]
Now, I'm...
I'm sorry.
Patty!
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear my father?
We can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
No.
If you have to have permission to save your life, go ahead.
- I'm getting out.
- Roger, you...
WOMAN:
We're going to die.
I know it!
[Coughing]
Aah!
Aah!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
I guess you thought I stood you up.
It crossed my mind.
- You sure you're all right?
- Mm-hmm.
Doug, those helicopters...
they'll get us out, won't they?
Sure, if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Doug...
Hmm.
Ta-da!
Can I get you anything else?
No?
[Coughing]
Damn!
The choppers are here, but those high winds make landing risky.
Get some men on the roof of the Peerless Building.
I want a breeches buoy up to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that distance in this wind.
- Shoot it from a chopper.
- I'll get right on it.
Don?
Chief, the ceiling fell on him.
By the time I got there, he was covered with hot stuff.
[Coughing]
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
- There's no way down.
- Thank God you're all right.
- Roger, what are we going to do?
- I know what I'm going to do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
- Responsible?
- Feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
The Duncans are big on responsibility, on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase, lift an eyebrow the same way,
I see and I hear your father.
The two of you... one!
Like a great big tree and a baby tree where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here because I thought you might need me.
Right now...
What I need most... is this.
L...
I promised myself if I ever saw you again,
I'd make a full confession.
No.
But thank you.
But you don't know anything about me.
But I do.
You're penniless, you have no villa in the south of France, no antiques coming, no paintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But don't you see?
Your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively... if you don't enjoy cheating?
I brought you up here tonight to sell you 1,000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power Light.
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power Light.
Only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked, or at least disappointed.
- But I'm not.
- You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
OK.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, dear.
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
Oh, I wonder how many more will be dead by tomorrow.
I thought we were building something... where people could work, live, and be safe!
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now, listen...
any decisions that were made... for the use of alternate building materials... were made because I have a right to make those decisions... if I remain within the code, and goddamn it, I did!
[Laughing] The building code.
Jesus.
The building code.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble.
I crawled around up there.
Duct holes weren't fire stopped!
Corridors without fire doors, and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
It's good for starting fires.
Hoo!
Where was I when this was going on?
I'm as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours.
What do they call it when you kill people?
Come on, move it!
- Who is it?
- Chief O'Hallorhan.
What happened?
Part of the central core blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters.
It's too windy.
We want to set the breeches buoy up on the Peerless Building.
What can we do?
Move all combustible material away from the window.
OK, gotcha.
- Nobody's on those drapes.
- Right.
Let's get on it.
Jake, give me a hand.
- Did you reach her?
- The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could've talked to her, let her know we were thinking of her... told her how...
how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know... where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she get into it?
I mean, uh... if she should have to.
The things you think of.
You want to help me?
Here he is.
Chief, wind velocity's down.
We're going to try a landing.
Bill, get Roberts.
- Yeah.
- Get 10 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by in groups of 10 for airlifting.
Will do.
Put these where they can get them easily.
Get me paper and a pencil, that brandy snifter, too.
- Are they going to land?
- They're going to try.
We'll send the kids first, and then the women.
Number this up to 100 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
Doug, there may not be time to tell you...
There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There's going to be a lot of wind when that chopper lands, so stay in one group.
Stay back!
Stay back!
Look out!
[Angela crying]
MAN:
Paula!
WOMAN:
David!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Pardon me.
Coming through!
Here he is now.
Yeah.
Now, look, Roberts, I know those pilots are dead and...
It was just awful up there.
Our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my firemen to knock out a window.
They'll shoot a line from a chopper.
OK.
You guys got a pair of clippers?
- Uh, yeah.
Sure.
What for?
- I want to try something.
Step back.
They're going to knock out the windows.
Step back.
Oh...
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it up, but we can get 12 people down.
PARKER:
Which 12?
The same group from the roof, and two additions... the woman who saved the children's lives... and a fireman...
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move out.
Marge.
Here, take this.
You can get out of here.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying?
What about me worrying for you?
It's the only way you can help me.
Help me.
If you... if you ask me to go to the North Pole or even the cliffs of Mendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
- Ma'am, I'll take her.
- Thank you.
- Come on, Phillip.
- All right.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to, ever again.
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- I'll be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
- You've got to go.
- I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
All right, here we go.
Hey, out of sight.
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this!
Pull in the rest of the line!
Hold it right there!
We need another 20 feet of that main line!
Tie this off!
That's it!
Bring it in a little more.
That's it.
Hold it.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
OK.
All right.
Let it go.
Let it go.
Go on!
Take it out!
OK.
Take up on it.
How about the main line... secured?
Good!
Aah!
Chief!
Explosion above 110 blew the scenic elevator off its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
- How many people in it?
- Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
What are you going to do?
Flaker.
- Flaker!
- Sir.
Can you get me a chopper with a winch and cable?
Have them pick me up on the roof of the Peerless Building.
- We got it.
- Yeah.
We'll try and get a hitch on that elevator, drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
OK!
OK.
Let her go!
Look out below!
All right.
Let's pull it in here!
Pull it in!
Let's haul that chair in!
Come on, haul it!
That's it!
All right.
Keep her going!
Hold it right there!
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
- Come ahead.
- I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
I'm going to fall.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
Don't let go of me.
Don't let me fall.
Don't let go!
Aah!
Aah!
Don't, please.
Don't let go of me.
Oh... oh...
All right!
OK, here she comes.
All right, bring that chair in easy.
Easy, lady.
That's it.
OK, hold it right there.
OK.
Lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady it.
Hook on the torch.
Lash it tight.
This is O'Hallorhan.
We read you, Chief.
I want you to pick me up... and set me down on the scenic elevator.
Then pick up the scenic elevator... and very gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can.
We'll find out in a hurry.
OK.
Hook it.
OK.
Take it away.
How much time do we have?
Bob, I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place.
I just don't think all of us are going to make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
FIREFIGHTER:
Will this hold it?
O'HALLORHAN:
It better.
We have to cut the cable.
- What's your number?
- 68.
47.
Aah!
Aah.
Aah!
That was close.
[Siren]
Here.
Mrs. Ramsay.
You'll be all right.
Oh, please.
Please, tell my husband I'll be all right.
- Tell him I'll be all right.
- I will.
I'll be seeing him at home later.
I will.
I promise.
MAN:
Let's go.
Oh, there she is!
She's all right!
Watch the ladder.
Move out!
[Coughing]
Hey, Mike!
The deputy wants to see you.
Mike, look, we've been checking... the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they have 17, maybe 18 minutes left.
It'll take three hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They're going to die if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Mr. Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the risers in the Promenade Room, in my opinion, could withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready on the plaza.
We'll handle that.
Do your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold more than enough water to drown the fire.
- You're crazy.
- It's the only way.
How do you know it'll work?
You could kill everybody there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress and load factors...
Wait a minute.
Hold it.
Mike, we've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges, and blow them.
Only two people are qualified for that... you and Connors.
They just brought Connors down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Now, under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you... you see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit.
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers, and you're going to take your turn.
And if it's any consolation...
I'm going to be the last one out along with my son-in-law.
[Telephone rings]
[Ring]
[Ring]
Roberts.
It's out of control, and it's coming your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They want to blow those water tanks above you... to kill the fire.
How will they get the explosives up here?
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on.
I'll tell them.
They want to try blowing up the water tanks above us.
It'll mean water, steel, and concrete.
If they don't try, we'll burn.
The fire's out of control.
They figure we got 15 minutes.
Some of us might survive.
We got no options.
[Explosion]
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line!
Get off!
Crazy bastards.
Drop this line!
- Let go!
- It's not going to work!
- Oh!
- It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
Get the hell out of there.
No!
No!
Get off!
Aaah!
Chief!
Yeah.
We just lost the breeches buoy.
There was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'm going to set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.
I know where to place charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
OK.
See you up there.
You're going to have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts, anything you can find.
For God's sakes, don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's OK.
Doug, I... never thought a thing like this could happen.
Sure.
ROBERTS:
Hey!
How much time do you think we got?
O'HALLORHAN:
10 minutes.
Maybe less.
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks.
All right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous, I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
After you throw the wire, we'll splice it into the timer, set it, then it blows.
You set your explosive... like this.
Take your detonator... pull the plug... toss it.
Got it?
I got it.
- Good luck.
See you later.
- OK.
Thanks.
Here you go.
- How much you setting it for?
- 5?
I think we can make that.
[Ticking]
That's it.
Tie yourself down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
31/2.
Air.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman.
Aah!
Bob!
Bob!
Oh, God!
[Groaning]
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you, the fine-looking lady...
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry.
She's dead.
Lise.
Lise!
Lise!
- Claiborne.
- What?
[Crying]
I didn't want you to see him.
You know there's nothing that any of us can do... to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God that... he can stop this from ever happening again.
I don't know, maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is, a kind of shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
We were lucky tonight.
The body count's less than 200.
One of these days they're going to kill 10,000... in one of these firetraps, and I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies... until somebody asks us... how to build them.
OK.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.
-So how was it?
-Good.
-You're gonna go ahead?
-Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying:
"No matter how hot it gets up there during the day...
-... there'snota- -" -"Not a damn thing to do at night. "
What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
Sleep like a winner.
Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom.
You'll be back in two weeks.
Come in the office for a minute.
I got people waiting upstairs.
I wanted to tell you...
... SenatorParker'scoming to the dedication tonight.
He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract.
Do you know what that means?
Skyscrapers like this all over the country.
You design them.
I'll build them.
Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex.
You'll never leave.
After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.
Glad to see you back.
Doug, I can't understand it.
The dampers won't stay opened.
-Whatever happened to "hello"?
-Hello.
-How are you?
-Good.
You look like it took.
-Hi, Mr. Roberts.
-Just a second.
We'll miss you.
-Duncan know?
-He's all smiles.
-What electromagnets went in?
-Doug?
-Thompson G-4s.
-Don't you think they should be G-1 2s?
That's what comes from last-minute panic.
I'll fix it.
There's ground water on that Atlanta job.
Bring the designs in today.
How about Chicago specs?
-Philadelphia?
-In a minute, guys.
Well, hello.
Welcome back.
Are you taking any calls?
Who's there?
No, I'm not taking any calls.
Are we gonna talk at all?
No.
It's my lunch hour.
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.
You're better.
All protein, no bread.
All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase.
I got about a $1 40 worth of vulgar underwear for you.
First things first.
That's nice.
Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will...
... remembertotellthemthat it was my idea.
Got change for a 50?
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.
Not a chance!
Let's see what we got here... .
Twenty-five, 50, 60...
... 70,75...
... 85,95.
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.
All your security squad's up there... .
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.
Hi, Phillip.
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoals.
Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us?
Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party.
Aren't you coming?
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died.
Here, let me take that paint off.
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?
-Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that?
-I said how are you?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Okay, I'll get on it right now.
I'll have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.
Mr. Callahan?
We still got any G-1 2 electrodes?
-Yeah, main storeroom.
-Right.
Okay, booster pump, zone one.
-One-ten.
-Check.
Main generator, zone one.
I don't get any reading.
Try the auxiliary generator.
What the hell?
Go ahead.
Here we are.
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?
I wouldn't like that at all!
The business offices only go up to 80.
From the 81 st floor, here...
... allthewayupto120, it's exclusively residential.
Now, the apartment I want to show you is 81 45... .
Say, Bill?
Tune in the main utility room.
Something's screwed up.
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
The sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.
He said they're having wiring problems down there.
You better stay with it.
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.
What's the matter?
Hello?
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.
That's nice.
I mean-
- I guess we've got ourselves a situation.
It seems.
I want the kind of life you're talking about.
I want that.
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.
But?
I want this job.
I wanted it for five years.
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.
See, I have ideas, Doug.
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.
I guess I want both, and I can't have both.
Can I?
I don't know.
Where?
Be right there.
Let's hold this off till tonight.
What happened?
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.
Power off?
-What about that?
-It should've been conduit.
Give me a pair of dikes.
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.
Now just how bad is it?
Depends on how good your imagination is.
Jesus Christ!
Specs called for conduit safety covering.
How many fuse terminals did you check?
How many do I have to?
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.
Okay, send him in.
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire...
... froma burned-outcircuitbreaker isn't conclusive.
Maybe not.
But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will, Doug...
... J.D.,waittillyou see this.
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?
We have an equipment problem.
-No problem in the tower, is there?
-Could be.
Come on.
You're just guessing.
I want to talk to your son-in-law.
I wanna talk to him right away.
-Get Roger Simmons.
-Yes, sir.
I guarantee I'll check this out.
We're all going to check it out.
I'm missing something.
We damn near had a fire.
Yeah, a fire.
In this building?
Come on.
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.
-The party should've been put off--
-Hold it, Will!
Everybody's overreacting.
-Mr.
Simmons is out, sir.
-Out where?
They don 't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'll decide what to do.
-That's okay, isn't it?
-Nope.
Won't wait.
Try zone one again.
Damn it!
This is top priority.
We gotta get these electrical systems on.
Our security program's loused up without them.
Don't go away.
Doug!
Well, what a surprise!
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I called his office, the club, the marina.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on, I'll get you a drink.
He must've done something.
My father called.
He hasn't been that upset in years.
Have any idea where he is?
Well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you wanna wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
-Can I get you a drink?
-No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
Hi, Doug.
-Honey.
-Hello.
-What are you drinking these days?
-Nothing, right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a systems failure.
How can that be?
It can't be, theoretically.
Unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours?
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
All the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!
I asked for installations way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
That would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have!
In my office!
Tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks...
... evenifthat's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!
Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age?
I only care that they show up at all.
Nonsense.
Be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.
Here you are...
... youroriginalspecs.
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
-Susan.
-Hello, Dan.
Good evening.
-How are you, dear?
-Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
I'll meet you out front.
-I'd like to talk to Susan.
-Right.
Find me the architect who designed you...
... andwhoneedsDougRoberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who.
There are leaders from society and government...
... starsofscreenand television.
And now, just arriving, the Honorable Gary Parker...
... chairmanofthe Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator's in from Washington to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark...
... ina longsuccessionoflandmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
--being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
Later, I wanna ask you a few questions...
... andI expect some straight answers.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower...
... tallestbuildingin theworld!
We'll make it.
That's it.
All right, Callahan?
Hit them.
This way.
It's really something, isn't it?
After you.
Come on, Dan.
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
I've never seen the bridge look like that.
-It's unbelievable!
-Astonishing!
-How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
-Fine, thank you.
Good night.
Shall I leave you a night line?
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.
Lorrie... .
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.
See you Monday, Janet.
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.
We almost missed him.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.
Have a nice weekend.
Thanks.
You too.
Hello.
Hi.
-Promise me something?
-What?
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.
And what do you suggest?
Cut off the phone lines.
Pour coffee down my neck.
Tweak my nose?
I promise.
-How's the family?
-Fine, thank you.
Good.
Gary?
-Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
-Certainly.
-I've got a surprise for you.
-Politicians don't like surprises.
-Carlos?
-Yes, sir.
-What can I fix you?
-Meet Senator Parker.
-Great pleasure.
-It's an honor, senator.
Show him what you've been hiding back there.
Yes, sir.
1 929?
-That's all you'll drink tonight.
-A whole case?
What you don't drink, we'll ship to Washington.
-Open a bottle, will you?
-Yes, sir.
How did you ever come by a whole case?
Come on, Jim.
It's nothing.
I guess you're looking for someone.
I am.
Have you seen him?
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?
-Nothing right now.
Thank you, Roger.
-Susan, tell me... .
What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man...
... decidestoleavefor two years?
Beats me, buddy.
No headhunting?
I've had a little trouble making that work.
Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
No.
-You must miss your villa.
-Well, yes and no.
It gets rather dull in the south of France.
Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing.
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.
Even such old scraps as I.
-No false humility, please.
-Oh, shall we?
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco...
... toregainmy perspective and my humility...
... andspendmoretimeattheone thing I'm really good at:
The stock market.
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.
Thank you.
Do you believe in destiny?
I believe in all good things.
There must be a reason for my coming back home.
Meeting you.
This can't be right.
It's too hot.
You better leave it off.
Utility.
Wes.
Doug, I'm up on 83 with Will.
We got a wiring problem.
Overloads could be trouble.
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.
I can't do that.
All the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.
You mean the whole building?
We're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
-Not all the power, just the overload!
-Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81 .
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.
-I'll be in 81 .
-You got it.
Get those drapes!
Smother it!
Try to smother it!
Pull it around over here.
Put it all over him.
Come on!
Let's get some water onto that fire.
Turn it on!
Down, down!
Stay low!
Call an ambulance for this man.
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!
I want everybody off this floor!
-The fire department?
-On their way.
Get that ambulance.
Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.
All right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
This is 81 .
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes, right away.
Call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a lot of people up there.
-What?
-Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
An ambulance is coming, but you better think about...
... gettingthosepeopledown on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but--
Well, then why the urgency?
Urgency?
If fluky wiring in this building caused that fire...
... firescouldbreakout everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 ...
... becauseitcan'tpossibly affect us up here...
... notinthisbuilding.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and--
Oh, Jesus!
-The glass tower!
-What?
The glass tower!
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?
Is it as rough as I hear?
Like being inside a chimney.
Jesus!
How in the hell did they get here before we did?
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
-Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.
-Eighty-first floor, right?
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.
-Set up a Forward Command.
-Got it.
Chief...
... thisisRoberts,the architect.
-What do we got here, Kappy?
-Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.
It's bad.
Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.
-Exhaust system?
-Should've reversed automatically.
It must be a motor burnout.
-Sprinklers?
-They're not working on 81 .
-Why not?
-I don't know.
-Jim?
-Yes, sir?
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.
-Floors have 3 and 1 .5-inch outlets.
-GPM?
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1 000 from 68 to 1 00...
... and500fromtheretotheroof.
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
-What floor are your plans on?
-79.
My office.
That's two floors below the fire.
It'll be our Forward Command.
Men, take up the equipment.
Let's go.
Architects!
Yeah, it's all our fault.
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.
But you keep building them as high as you can.
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?
What about the 81 st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
Give me a list of your tenants.
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.
Not live-ins.
Businesses.
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.
Those that have are off at night.
I wanna know who they are, not where.
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?
Any wool or silk manufacturers?
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Any sporting-good manufacturers, like table-tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?
-One tenant list, coming up.
-Thank you.
What do we got?
Elevator bank, central core.
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.
-Pipe alleys here?
-One, two, three, four, five.
-This is south?
-South.
Have you got any construction on 81 ?
Anything that can blow up, like gasoline, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
Good.
I'll be up on 81 .
For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
What party?
Where?
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get them out?
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.
I will.
Here he is now.
This is Duncan.
A battalion chief?
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.
Jack?
Jack, how bad?
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.
Work it around.
Up there.
-I'll be up topside.
-Right.
Jack...
... watchyourself.
Keep it high.
-Looking for me, chief?
-If you're Duncan.
I am.
Everything under control?
Gotta move these people out of here.
Now, just how bad is it?
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems...
... wehavedesignedintothis building.
We've got them all.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.
I don't think you're listening.
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.
-I'll do it.
-Hold it, hold it.
Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.
One thing we don't want is a panic.
I could tell them, but you ought to.
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests...
... thattheparty'sbeingmoveddown below the fire floor.
Now.
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.
Now, don't leave this table.
You, I wanna talk to.
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?
-I most certainly did.
-For God's sake, why?
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.
We've got a fire.
If it was caused by what you did, I'll hang you out to dry.
And then I'm going to hang you!
Would you please stop playing?
Stop playing, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen... .
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
It seems that we have a small fire...
... inoneof ourstoragerooms...
... 50floorsbelow.
I assure you there's no danger.
But in accordance with the fire department's orders...
... apurelyprecautionaryprocedure...
... we'regoingto movethe party down to the lobby for a while.
And we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.
Now if we can all move to the elevators... .
Now, ladies and gentlemen...
... there'snoreasontorush .
Senator Parker, you and your party.
It's really all right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
-Lisolette!
-Frank!
Lisolette!
-How's it going, chief?
-Better get ready.
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.
Fire lapping?
-Are your com lines tested?
-Phone jacks on every floor.
-I'm plugging into your PA system.
-No sweat.
-Emergency setup?
-Battery-powered standby system.
Splice these lines into our two-way communications van.
Sure.
-No problem?
-No problem.
-How long will this take?
-A minute.
Not bad.
Here's our problem.
The fire's lapping up through the windows.
Get down!
Get down!
What was that?
-Come on!
-The ceiling's going!
Men trapped!
We need help!
Bring a line!
Pull them out, pull them out!
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!
Battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!
Forward Command, go ahead.
Explosion on 81 , fire headed toward elevator banks!
We need more crews up here fast!
-They need relief on 81 .
Hit it.
-They're on their way.
Done!
Tell Duncan to stop those Tower Room people...
... fromusingthatexpresselevator, or somebody'll get killed.
Ring in a third alarm.
I want some rescue squads and some choppers here.
We may need them to get those people down.
Come on, Park.
I'll be on 81 .
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.
I don't like how you talk to me.
-You drunk?
-Not yet.
-Then get out of my way!
-You didn't talk like this before.
Running over budget and out of money.
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?
Shut up and help these people!
-Let me ask, father-in-law--
-Excuse me.
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?
Please!
Please!
Hold everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Move back into the Promenade Room...
... andwe'lltakeyou downby the scenic elevator.
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.
And with the probability of short circuits...
... thecarsmightstop on the floor where the fire is.
So please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there.
For God's sake, get out of there!
Please, back!
It looks bad, Jack.
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.
The fire's spreading.
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.
Firemen, let's pull it down before it falls down.
Bring it out!
Take it down!
Empty all the water out.
Chief, it's out of control.
Bring in another line!
Get another tank!
Angela?
Angela?
Phillip?
Phillip, open the door!
What ideas can I use upstairs...
... toexplainwhereI'vebeen all this time?
Well, what you might do is just...
... walkrightup to himand say , "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay...
... butmysecretary had an urgent personal problem. "
What happens if he asks what the problem was?
He won't.
-You know what astonishes me?
-What?
You make love with a girl...
... andthere'sno visibleevidence.
Nothing to mark the event.
Look at you.
You look like you could be going to church.
In this outfit?
I love you.
Did you leave a cigarette burning?
That's not a cigarette.
Jesus!
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.
Dan?
Right.
-What'd they say?
-Help's on the way.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.
I won't panic.
Not to worry, baby.
Please, just join the end of the line.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Please.
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.
-They're aware of that.
-She's wearing a purple dress.
-I've got to find her!
-I promise, they'll find her.
Now, only 1 2 at a time.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
We'll be in the next group, maybe.
It won't be too long.
What's she doing on 87?
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.
Harry.
Jernigan.
What?
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!
How do you expect her to hear a phone call?
She's deaf!
Sure, the kids can hear!
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.
You stay there.
I'll get them down!
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!
-We'll send them right up.
-Still got people on 87.
I'll get them down.
I'll give you a hand.
Turn your face away.
There never were any firemen, were there?
I said that to make it easier on you.
I switched off the phones.
There's no way to call out.
Nobody knows we're up here.
Well, I always did want to die in bed.
Nobody's going to die.
At least they'll never find out about us, will they?
I used to run the 1 00 in 1 0 flat.
Don't go!
I'll be back with the whole fire department.
-You all right?
-The mother and children are in there.
-Don't worry.
We'll get them out.
-Wait!
Please, Mrs. Mueller!
Please stay back.
-What do you think?
-I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
!
It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
He's okay.
-Mom, Mom!
-Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
Anybody else?
My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
Angela?
Angela?
Angela, where are you?
It's gonna be okay, Angela.
Thank God!
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
-All right!
-That's it.
Don't crush.
It'll take hours to get everyone down.
Those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs.
-That's 1 35 floors.
-All downhill.
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos!
-Yes, sir.
-Help us get this thing open.
Is it stuck?
Here, let me try to kick it.
-I'll call security.
-Yes, sir.
Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
You want it easy, chief?
They should design a survival suit for us like for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Let's go to work.
I need two men up the stairwell to the tower.
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay, you got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?
Glass will be sailing everywhere.
Tell the police to move those barricades four blocks back.
-Got it.
-Let's hit it.
Yo!
Security guard.
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty, almost missed you.
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
Wait a minute.
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
Oh, my God!
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip!
Let him try.
There's no other way.
Come on, Phillip!
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, boy.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip!
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy.
Easy.
Don't look down!
Come on.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
You all right?
You know, I had a... .
I got up, but I'll have trouble getting down.
Can you help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck, real tight?
Come on.
Give it a try.
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Put her legs down.
Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.
Just hold on tight.
Hold on.
Hold on tight, now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
-Hold on, Angela.
-I've got ahold of you!
Get your arms around my neck!
Thattagirl.
Nurse?
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!
Take it slowly, now.
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt.
Try to get your hand over there.
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
Mrs. Mueller!
Are you all right?
All right, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God!
We're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on, let's go.
Chief O'Hallorhan?
Inside, security phone on the right.
-Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
-I'm trying to get through now.
Can't we go down?
The fire's below us.
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.
It's the copter air-control officer.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.
I'm getting relief for you and your men.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.
Right away.
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.
Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs.
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby.
Thank you.
This ain't gonna help any!
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!
It's a fire door.
It's over 2.5 inches thick.
I could crawl through the duct.
Will we be able to go with you?
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 1 35 floors straight down.
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
All right, I'll tell him.
-How is it on 65?
-They're containing it.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
Come here!
The master generator's blown.
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold on to me a second.
Hold on!
Christ!
That's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room.
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Open it up.
Of course I read you!
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.
-Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
-Not for us.
-Where've you been?
-We had trouble getting here.
The Navy flight commander needs you.
Just walk 65 floors down?
Only five.
A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.
-Got it controlled?
-Getting there.
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike... .
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow. " Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
Look!
There's another one there!
Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Anybody'll do.
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How--?
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.
-How're you doing?
-We're fine.
Glad to see you.
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.
We're gonna have to blow that thing.
Mrs. Mueller?
It's Mr. Roberts!
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.
Okay, get down low.
-What kind of explosives are you using?
-It's plastic C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
Here, shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it up here.
Is there gonna be a bang?
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
Good going, Brian.
You all right?
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
-Hold it down!
-Listen!
I've been informed that there's no possibility...
... ofusingthisstairwaytogetout.
Now, I'm sorry.
Patty... .
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
-I'm getting out.
-Roger, you... .
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
You guys, hose the ceiling.
You two, in there!
-I guess you thought I stood you up.
-It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.
Some party.
Can I get you anything else?
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on top of the Peerless Building...
... andgetabreechesbuoy to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.
Why not shoot it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
-Doc?
-Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
-There's no way down.
-Thank God you're all right.
-Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
-I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
-Responsible?
-Feeling!
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase...
... liftaneyebrow in the exact same way...
... IseeandIhear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.
Right now...
... whatI needmost...
... isthis.
I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
-But you don't know anything about me.
-But I do.
You're penniless...
... youhaveno villa in the south of France...
... noantiquescoming,nopaintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But you see, your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively...
... ifyoudon'tenjoycheatingthem?
I came here to sell you 1 000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Only the certificate I had printed.
I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
Did you hear what I said?
Every word.
Then tell me you're shocked...
... oratleastdisappointed.
-But I'm not.
-You must be!
Harlee, I'm not.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
I thought we were building something...
... wherepeoplecouldwork, live and be safe.
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials...
... weremadebecauseI,asabuilder, have a right to make those decisions.
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!
Oh, here we go again!
The building code.
Come on.
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!
I was crawling around up there.
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for starting fires!
Where was I when all this was going on?
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
-Who is it?
-Chief O'Hallorhan.
-What happened?
-Part of the central corridor just blew.
We've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
It's too windy.
We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.
What can we do to help?
Move your combustible material away from the window.
Okay, gotcha.
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.
Jake, give me a hand.
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how precious she is to us.
She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean...
... ifsheshouldhaveto.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
-Here he is.
-The wind's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Get Roberts.
Get 1 0 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Put these over there.
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
-Doug, are they going to land?
-They're gonna try.
We'll send the kids out first, then the women.
Number these up to 1 00 or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
-There may not be time to tell you--
-There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
There'll be a lot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back, stay back!
Look out!
Roberts!
Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!
Here he is now.
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and l--
God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.
We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper.
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
-Sure, what do you want them for?
-I want to try something.
Step back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back and you won't get hurt.
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 1 2 people out.
Which 1 2?
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Take this.
Take it!
You can get out!
Go on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me.
Help me.
If you asked me to go to the North Pole...
... oreventhecliffsofMendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
-Ma'am, I'll take her.
-Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to.
Ever again.
-I'll meet you in the lobby.
-I'll be waiting.
We're still a lady short.
-You've gotta go.
-I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
Out of sight!
Yeah, it's coming.
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.
All right, hold it right there!
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more!
That's it.
Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
All right, let it go!
Let it go!
All right, go on!
Take it out!
Okay, take ahold.
How about the main line?
Secured?
Good!
Chief!
Explosion above 1 1 0...
... blewtheelevatoroff its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
-How many people in it?
-Loaded.
I'd say about 1 2.
What're you gonna go?
Flaker.
-Flaker!
-Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building.
Got it.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
Mommy, Mommy!
I won't cry if you won't cry.
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up out of there.
Pull it.
Come on!
Tie it over there.
Okay, let her go!
Look out below!
Come on.
Okay, that's it.
All right!
There's one in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right, let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
That's it!
All right, keep it going!
All right, hold it right there.
Who's next in order?
I am.
I am!
-Come ahead!
-I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
-I can't!
-Yes, you can.
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Don't let go of me!
Get me out, please!
Hold it right there.
Okay, lower the cable.
Grab that hook!
Steady.
What about the torch?
Lash it tight.
-This is O'Hallorhan.
-We read you, chief.
Pick me up with the hook...
... andsetme downonthe scenic elevator.
Then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Watch it!
Take it away!
How much time do we have?
I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Let it go!
You think this'll hold it?
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.
-What's your number?
-68.
47.
Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now.
-You'll be all right.
-Tell my husband I'm all right.
-Tell him I'll be all right.
-I will.
-And I'll see him at home later.
-I will.
Let's go.
Oh, my God, you're all right!
Thank God you're all right!
Watch the ladder.
Hey, Mike...
... deputywantsto seeyou .
Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room.
We figure they've got 1 7 or 1 8 minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.
They'll die up there if something's not done.
We might have the answer.
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists in that room...
... coulddefinitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready.
Wait a minute.
We'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold 1 ,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.
-You're crazy.
-Mike, it's the only way.
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think?
When you take into account the stress factors, the design--
Wait a minute.
Just hold it.
We've already made the decision.
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.
There's only two people qualified for that.
You and Conners.
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just laying it out for you.
But you... .
You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
The women are gone.
We are going next.
You've all got numbers.
And you're gonna take your turn.
And if it's any consolation...
... I'llbethelastoneoutof here along with my son-in-law.
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.
You got about 1 5 minutes.
Now, they want to try something.
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.
They think it'll kill the fire.
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
Hang on, I'll tell them.
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'll burn.
The fire's out of control.
They think we got maybe 1 5 minutes.
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get that line.
Get off!
-You crazy bastards!
Drop this line!
-Let go of me!
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.
It won't hold everybody!
Get off!
Get off!
-Get the hell out of there!
-Go!
Get off.
Chief.
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.
It's under control now.
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
See you up there.
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts...
... anythingyoucanfind!
-Carlos!
-Yes, sir.
Get some knives.
There we go.
For God's sakes, Carlos.
Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.
That's the '29.
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug...
... Ineverthoughtthiscouldhappen.
Sure.
-How much time you think we got?
-Ten minutes, maybe less.
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.
All right.
This is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Later on, after you throw the wire...
... we'llplugit andspliceitinto the timer, set it, and it blows.
Set your explosive like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
-Got it?
-I got it.
-Good luck.
See you later.
-Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
What will you set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
That's it.
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Here.
Here.
I'm burning up!
Let's go!
Fireman?
Bob!
Bob!
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry, she's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
-Claiborne!
-What?
I didn't want you to see him.
You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead.
All I can do now is pray to God...
... thatI canstopthisfrom ever happening again.
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
One of these days, they'll kill 1 0,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies...
... untilsomebodyasksus...
... howtobuildthem.
Okay.
I'm asking.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.

You're gonna go ahead, huh?
Full steam.
Anything I can do to change your mind?
Nope.
No way.
You know, there's an old saying that, uh, no matter how hot it gets up there during the day, there's not— Not a damn thing to do at night.

Just leave all those fired up.
Mr. Callahan.

The sensor didn't trip the fire department alarm.
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
Well, the sensor indicates there is.

Well, maybe not, but after that, I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.
Will.

Do you know we haven't even finished installing the safety equipment?
The party should have been put off for at least another month.
Now, hold it, Will.
Hold it!
Everybody's overreacting.
[Buzzes]
Yes.
Mr. Simmons is out, sir.
- Out where?
- [Woman] They don't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.
[Duncan] Okay.
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow, and then we'll decide what to do.
That's okay, isn't it?
Nope.
Won't wait.
Try Zone 1 again.
Damn it, Harry.
This is top priority.
We've got to get these electrical systems back on the beam.
Our whole security program's loused up without 'em.
Don't go away.
[Doorbell Chimes]
Doug.
Well, what a surprise.
Where's that electrical genius of yours?
I mean, I called his office, the club, the marina- everywhere.
No luck.
What's he done?
Come on.
I'll get you a drink.
He must have done something, 'cause my father called.
I haven't heard him that upset in years.
You have any idea where he is?
Well, my husband's territory ranges rather widely.
It's roughly equivalent to that of the timber wolf- anywhere within a 50-mile radius.
But if you want to wait, he'll show up.
He has to.
His clothes are here.
Can I get you a drink?
No.
No, thanks.
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.
[Door Opens]
[Door Closes]
Hi, Doug.
Honey.
Hello.
What are you drinking these days?
Nothing right now.
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Callahan was testing a backup generator.
There was a power surge and a systems failure.
How can that be?
Well, it can't be, theoretically.
Unless you've been screwing around with the electrical specifications.
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?
You betcha.
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.
What the hell business is it of yours anyway?
Well, I'm just wondering what kind of kickbacks were involved.
I don't have to take crap from you.
Now, listen.
We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.
It looked to me like some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.
Every piece of wire I put in that building is strictly up to code- inspected and approved.
The code's not enough for that building.
And you know it.
That's why I asked for installations that were way, way above standard.
Buddy, you live in a dreamworld.
I deal in realities.
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.
It'd take weeks to get all that together- and someone with more clout than you to make me do it.
In my office, tomorrow, 9:00.
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.
[Door Closes] Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.
No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
Roger, if you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.
Baby, I don't need God's help.
Or your old man's.
Not anymore.
So don't expect me to shake every time daddy barks.
I mean, if that's what you want me to do.
All I want is the man I thought I married.
But I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?
It's getting late.
Mustn't miss the party.

Hi.
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.
At my age...
I only care that they show up at all.
Oh, nonsense.
Now, you be a good girl, Elke.
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.
Did you find Simmons?
Yeah, I found him.
Well, did he or didn't he change your specs?
He didn't admit it, but two bucks will get ya 10 he did.
Payoffs and kickbacks.
That's the only way he could've swung it.
Well, here you are.
Your original specs.
Zone 1 only, but we gotta start somewhere.
The son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.
Susan.
Hello, Danny.
Good evening.
Good show.
How are you, dear?
Jim.
Congratulations.
It's magnificent.
Thank you.
Uh, I'll meet you out front.
I'd like to talk to Susan for a minute.
Right.
Find me the architect who designed you, and who needs Doug Roberts?
I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.
The entire city is in a holiday mood.
The list of luminaries tonight reads like a who's who.
There are leaders from society and government.
Stars of screen and television.
And now, just arriving, the honorable Gary Parker, chairman of the Federal Urban Renewal Commission.
The senator flew in from Washington tonight to be here for the dedication.
Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll try to get him over to the microphone to say a few words for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I am honored to be here tonight.
This magnificent building represents yet another landmark... in a long succession of landmarks for this great city.
I think you've got him in the bag, Jim.
I am deeply appreciative... of being here at this historic moment.
Thank you.
[Applause]
Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's Mr. and Mrs. Roger Simmons.
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan.
How are you?
Nice to see you, Senator.
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.
Ah, yes.
Where were you all day?
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.
When I get the time, I want to ask you a few questions, and I expect some straight answers.
[Announcer] And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.
[Crowd Whistling]
I thank you very much.
I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower... tallest building in the world.
Oh!

We'll make it.
That's it.

We'd better leave it off.
[Rings] Utility.
Wes.
Doug.
I'm up on 83 with Will.
Listen.
We got a little wiring problem.
If we get an overload, it could be trouble.
Shut down as many Zone 1 systems as you can.
Afraid I can't do that, Mr. Roberts.
We've got all the lights on for the dedication ceremony.
All?
You mean the whole building?
Well, we're taking the overload just fine.
Well, shut it down right away.
But I can't do that without a direct okay from Mr. Duncan himself.
I'll accept the responsibility for that.
Just turn off the goddamn lights.
What about the lights in the tower for the party?
- I didn't say kill all the power.
Just the overload.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts.
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.
Okay.
They turned on everything in the whole building.
There's something on 81.
[Beeping]
Bill, phone it in just in case our automatic lines to the fire department are out.
I'll be in 81.

Let's get him in the elevator.
All right.
Try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.
[Groans]
Hello.
This is 81.
We've had an accident up here.
A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.
Yes.
Right away.
Roberts, call Duncan in the tower.
We've got a lot of people up there.
What?
Do it now!
It's Mr. Roberts.
Yeah.
Doug.
We were getting worried about you.
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.
Everybody wants to know why the world's greatest architect isn't here.
Never mind about that.
Will Giddings has been pretty badly burned.
Will Giddings burned?
How?
Listen.
I've already got an ambulance coming, but you better think about getting those people upstairs down on the ground floor.
What for?
We got a fire here!
Well, I think it's under control, but-
Well, then, uh, why the urgency?
Urgency?
Hey, Dunc, if that fire was caused by fluky wiring in this building, we could get fires breaking out everywhere!
Doug, I think you're overreacting.
Now, I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of.
But I am not going to concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81... because it can't possibly affect us up here.
Not in this building.
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.
In the meantime, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party.
Now, come on!

Oh, Jesus.

Okay.
Captain.
You understand?
I want you over that way.
Mike, she's throwin' a lot of smoke.
Eighty-first floor, right?
Right.
We've got lobby control.
Second alarm is in.
Set up a forward command.
Got it.
[Siren Wailing]
Chief, this is Roberts, the architect.
What've we got here, Kappy?
Fire started 81st floor.
Storage room.
This is a bad one.
The smoke is so thick we can't tell how far it's spread.
What about your exhaust system?
Well, it should've reversed automatically.
There must have been a motor burnout or somethin'.
Sprinklers?
They're not working on 81.
Why not?
I don't know.
Jim.
Yes, sir.
All right.
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe systems.
Well, we got outlets on every floor.
Both three and one-and-a-half inch.
G.P.M.?
1,500 from ground to 68, 1,000 from 68 to 100... and, uh, 500 from there to the roof.
All right.
And you're sure these elevators are programmed for emergency service?
These two are.
What floor do you keep your plans on?
Seventy-nine.
My office.
That's good.
That's two floors below the fire.
All right.
That'll be our forward command.
All right, men.
Take up the equipment.
Right.
Let's go.
Okay.
[Sighs] Architects.
Yeah.
It's all our fault.
Now, you know there's no sure way for us to fight a fire... in anything over the seventh floor, but you guys just keep buildin' em as high as you can.
Hey.
Are you here to take me on or the fire?
Okay.
Well, what about the 81st floor?
You got everybody out of there?
[Elevator Door Opens]
I want to see all your floor plans.
Eighty-one through 85.
Gotcha.
This is what I'm worried about.
All those beams and that glass.
Chief.
Yeah.
81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.
How long before you can give me a complete list of your tenants?
You don't have to worry about that.
We're movin' 'em out right now.
Not live-in.
Business tenants.
We kind of looked up there too.
The majority of them haven't moved in yet, and those that have aren't working tonight.
I want to know who they are, not where they are.
Now what does that got to do with anything- who they are?
Do you have any wool or silk manufacturers?
You see, in a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.
Do you have any, uh, sporting good manufacturers, like table tennis balls?
They give off toxic gases.
Want me to keep goin' down the line?
No.
One list of tenants comin' right up.
Thank you.
Over here and here.
Here.
What have we got?
Well, elevator bank.
Central core.
Service elevators over here.
Air-conditioning duct, six inches.
Right.
Pipe alleys here?
One, two, three, four, five.
This is south.
South.
Have you got any construction going up in 81?
Nope.
Anything that could blow up, like gasoline, kerosene, uh, fabric cleaner?
I don't think so.
[Sighs] Good.
I'll be up on 81.
[Kappy] Okay.
For what it's worth, architect, this is one building that I figured wouldn't burn.
Neither did I.
And they're celebrating.
A party.
- Party?
What party?
Where?
- In the Promenade Room.
300 people.
Why didn't you get 'em the hell out of there?
Why don't you go on upstairs and talk to Duncan?
He ain't exactly listening to me.
I will.
Oh.

Well, uh, I don't believe that you're familiar with... the many modern safety systems we have designed into this building.
We've got 'em all.
All right.
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now let's get these people the hell out of here.
I don't think you're listening, Chief.
There's no way for a fire on 81 to reach up here.
Not in this building.
Okay.

Please, Mrs. Mueller.
Please stay back.
What do you think?
I don't know.
Give it a kick.
I'll take the back.
[Coughing]
I got Mrs. Allbright.
Anybody in here?
[Phillip Coughs]
[Coughing]

♪♪ [Rock On Headset] It's okay, kid.
It's okay.
Come on.
[Coughing]
[Coughing]
[Coughing]
[Coughs]
He's okay.
Mom.
Mom.
Your mom's all right.
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.
She'll be all right.
Anybody else?
My sis
- My sister.
Where's Angela?
He'll get her.
[Coughing]
Angela?
Angela?
Angela?
Angela.
Angela, where are you?
[Angela Sobbing]
[Sobbing]
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.
It's all right.
[Sobbing]
Thank God.
Angela.

Come on.
[Sirens Wailing]
[Alarm Ringing]
[Sirens Wailing]
[Chattering]
Just take it easy.
Easy.
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.
Hold it here.
All right!
That's it.
Don't press the plaza button.
Everybody just calm down.
[Chattering]
At this rate it's gonna take a couple of hours to get everyone down.
So I would suggest that those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines... start using the stairs.
That's 135 floors.
Mm-hmm.
All downhill.
[Chattering]
It's closer than they told us.
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.
Carlos.
Yes, sir.
Help us try to get this thing open.
It's stuck?
Yeah.
Here.
Let me try to kick it.
No.
I'll call security.
Yes, sir.
[Sirens Wailing]
[Horn Blowing]
[Siren Wailing]
[Man Shouting, Indistinct]
On the double.
[Man] Battalion 38, responding to fourth alarm.
Reporting to forward command.
Where are those choppers, Kappy?
Navy's been alerted.
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
Hey.
You want it easy, Chief?
I don't see why they couldn't have designed a survival suit for us... like they did for football players.
Who pays to see us play?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's go to work.
I need two men to go up the stairwell to the Tower Room.
There's a door jammed.
I want it cleared.
Okay.
You got it.
Timmy, I want you with me.
Get two men.
Make sure they've got 30 minutes of air.
Kappy.
Yeah.
Now there's gonna be glass sailing' all over this city.
Call the police downstairs.
Have them move those barricades four blocks back.
Got it.
Let's hit it.
Right.
Yo.
Security guard!
Anyone here?
Hello.
Security.
Say, kitty.
Almost missed ya, huh?
[Phillip] Ow!
Keep away from the walls.
There's fire on the other side.
[Hissing]
Wait a minute.
[Hissing Continues]
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!
[Screams]
[Screams]
[Screams]
Oh, my God!
Can you get down?
Is there any way you can get down?
I think I can.
Phillip.
Let him try.
There's no other way.
[Angela Whimpering]
[Doug] Come on, Phillip.
Come on.
That part's easy.
Come on, now.
Easy does it.
Get your foot over there.
[Creaking]
Ease down.
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip.
[Creaking]
Your foot's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.
Easy now.
Easy.
Don't look down.
That's right.
Come on.
I got ya.
I got ya.
[Chattering]
[Sirens Wailing In Distance]
We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything.
[Coughs]
We were supposed to have fire drills.
That's what they said.
But they never did.
[Sirens Continue]
[Whispers] It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
[Angela Whimpering]
You all right?
You know, I had- I got up all right, but I think I'm gonna have a lot of trouble gettin' down.
You think you could help me?
Could you just hold on around my neck real tight?
[Sobs] Oh, no.
Come on.
Give it a try.
[Mouths Word]
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.
Okay?
Put her legs down.
[Whimpering]
Okay.
Hold on tight.
Put your legs around here.
Hold on real tight now.
Go on.
Hang on.
[Whimpering]
Just hold on tight, honey.
Hold on.
[Sobbing]
Hold on.
You're okay.
Hold on tight now.
It's gonna be okay now.
Hold on!
Easy now.
Hold on, Angela.
I've got a hold of you.
Get your arms around my neck.
That-a-girl.
Nurse.
He stayed in too long.
Bring him right over here.
[Panting]
[Coughing]
Mrs. Mueller, come on.
You've gotta try!
Take it slowly now.
[Breathing Heavily]
You've got about a foot to go.
Feel around with your feet now.
Can you see it?
Hold onto that pole and grab a hold of my belt.
Try to get your left hand over there.
About half a foot.
Six inches.
Try to swing now.
Just try to pendulum.
Can you swing?
Come on.
Just get to me over here.
[Angela] Mrs. Mueller.
[Grunts]
Are you all right?
Fine.
All right, let's go.
[Angela Whimpering]
[Whimpering]
Come on.
Come on.
I'm comin'.
I'm comin'.
[Breathing Heavily]
[Clattering]
You okay?
Nobody's gonna get down this way.
Oh, God, we're cut off.
Well, the only way is up.
Come on.
Let's go.
[Sirens Wail]
Chief O'Hallorhan?
O'Hallorhan.
Inside, security phone on the right.
[Sirens Continue]
Would you get me Chief O'Hallorhan right away?
I'm trying to get through now.
[Sobbing]
Can't we go down?
No, the fire's below us.
We have to go up.
This'll put us right underneath the Promenade Room.
Come on!
[Whimpering]
[Phone Rings] Tim, get that phone.
Check your ventilating systems over here.
Jack?
Yeah?
I'll send up another truck company.
Pull this ceiling and vent that other side.
It's for you, Chief.
The air control officer for the copter.
Thank you.
Jack, I know you've been hittin' it.
I'm gonna get some relief for you and your men.
This is O'Hallorhan.
Who am I speaking to?
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.
It's about time.
We could use your rescue choppers.
I'll order them right away.
I'd like to set up communications... next to the forward command center.
No, no, too dangerous.
Stay outta those elevators.
Well, then, sir, we'll just trot right up the stairs.
Yeah, you'll just trot right up to 79, huh?
Standing by in the lobby, sir.
Thank you.
[Coughing]
[Breathing Heavily]
This isn't gonna help any.
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people.
It's a fire door.
It's over two and a half inches thick.
Maybe I could crawl through there.
Will we- Will we be able to go with you?
It leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.
[Metal Clanks] Use this.
Phillip, you take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.
[Metal Thuds]
[Heavy Breathing]
[Exhales]
All right.
I'll tell him.
Chief?
Yeah.
How does it look on 65?
They're getting it contained.
Well, it's still below us.
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.
[Electrical Crackling]
[Whistling] Come here!
The master generator's blown!
But the backup should've kicked on by now.
Go see what's holding up our starters.
[Motor Slows] [Brakes Squeal]
What happened?
Where the hell are we?
[Clamoring]
[Clamor Continues]
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?
The whole system's failed.
Well, what's the last report on the firemen getting here?
Are they on their way?
Hold onto me a second.
[Rattling]
[Chattering]
[Metal Clattering]
Hold on!
Jesus Christ, that's one of our men!
Oh, God!
Okay, okay.
Go down by rope.
Better get it.
Sir?
We're gonna rappel.
Down to 65.
Get on top of that elevator, use it for an exit.
Why not pry open the doors at this level?
I don't think so.
I can't make it.
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.
Okay.
Then you better go first.
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.
Let's go to work.
Check all rooms in that corridor.
Check this room!
Tear it down.
See?
Just like we taught you in training.
Okay, open it up.
Of course I read you!
Look, I don't know where the hell he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him!
Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
Not for us.
Mike, where have you been?
We had a little trouble getting here.
The navy flight commander needs you down in the lobby right away.
Sixty-five floors?
Just walk right down?
No, it's only five.
They got a freight elevator on 60 on auxiliary power.
Okay.
You got this thing controlled?
Well, we're gettin' there.
All right, you men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Oh, Mike—
This one of your men?
"Dan Bigelow." Nope.
Must be a civilian.
Located O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.
[Chattering]
[Helicopter Whirring]
Look!
There's another there.
Look.
[Chattering] [Exhales]
[Chattering] [Man] It's too damn windy out there!
Hey, Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?
Mr. Roberts.
How'd you get in here?
I'll give it to you later.
Give me O'Hallorhan.
Well, that's okay.
Anybody'll do.
Listen.
The south stairwell is blocked.
Cement, for Chrissake!
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?
They're on their way?
How—
Okay.
Oh.
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.
She's still in the apartment.
Oh, it's okay, Mrs. Mueller.
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.
She'll be all right.
[Footsteps Approaching]
Oh, hello, ma'am.
Oh, hello.
How you doin'?
We're fine.
Glad to see you.
Yeah.
That's the door right here!
It's blocked with cement.
Okay.
Ah, we're gonna have to blow that thing.
Right.
[Doug] Mrs. Mueller.
It's Mr. Roberts.
Mrs. Mueller!
Phillip!
We hear you!
We're gonna blow this door!
Get everybody clear.
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?
Understood!
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there outta the way.
Okay.
Everybody, could you please go back?
They're gonna dynamite this door.
Step back to the elevator.
We're blowing up the exit door.
Okay, get down low.
What kind of explosives are you using?
It's plastic, C-4.
Blow a hole in anything.
[Gasps]
Here.
Shine this on the bag for me.
That's it.
Keep it on there.
Is there going to be a bang?
Ah, nothin' for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.
Okay, everybody ready?
[Clamoring]
Good goin', guys.
Hey.
[Chuckling] You all right?
[Chattering]
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.
Everyone, listen!
[Man] Hold it down!
Listen!
I've been informed by the fire department... that there's no possibility of using this stairway to get out.
[Crowd Groans] Now, I'm-I'm sorry.
Patty.
There's still a chance we can get out of here.
Didn't you hear what my father said?
We can't get out that way.
Are you coming or not?
No.
[Sighs]
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.
I'm getting out.
Roger.
You— [Scoffs]
[Clamoring]
[Coughing]
[Groaning]
Ah!
[Explosion]
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go!
You guys, pull the ceiling!
You two, in there!
I guess you thought I stood you up.
It crossed my mind.
You sure you're all right?
Mm-hmm.
[Helicopters Whirring]
Doug, those, uh— those helicopters, th-they'll get us out of here, won't they?
Sure they will, if there's not too much wind.
[Exhales] Some party.
Doug-
Hmm, da-dumm!
Can I get you anything else?
No?
[Coughing]
[Coughing]
Damn!
[Sirens Wailing] The choppers are here all right, but those high winds on the roof make a landing attempt too risky.
Get some men on the roof of the Peerless Building.
I wanna try to get a breeches buoy up to the Promenade Room.
We can't shoot a line that distance, not in this wind.
What's the matter with shooting' it from a chopper?
I'll get right on it.
Don?
Chief, uh, the ceiling fell in on him.
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.
[Breathing Heavily]
[Coughing]
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?
There's no way down.
Thank God you're all right.
Oh, Roger, what are we gonna do?
I know what I'm gonna do.
Get quietly drunk.
If you're responsible for all this, I know what you must be feeling.
You don't know the meaning of the word.
Responsible?
Feeling!
Oh, you know a lot about responsibility.
It's a family trait.
The Duncans are very big in the responsibility department, at least on the surface.
That's not fair!
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of-of duty!
Sometimes... when you turn the exact same phrase, lift an eyebrow the exact same way,
I see, and I hear your father.
The two of you, one!
Like a great big tree, and a little baby tree in its shade where the acorn fell.
Roger, I came over here to you... because I-I-I-I thought you might need me!
Right now, what I need most... is this.
I, um
- I promised myself that if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession.
No, but thank you.
But you don't know anything about me.
But I do.
You're penniless.
You have no villa in the south of France-
No antiques coming, no paintings.
But, Harlee, I don't care.
I'm a cheap tinhorn, a two-bit con man.
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.
But don't you see?
Your heart isn't in it.
How can you cheat people effectively if you don't really enjoy cheating them?
I brought you up here tonight to sell you a thousand shares... in Greater Anaheim Power and Light.
Is it a good investment?
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light, only the certificate I had printed.
I must say, I think you'd have admired the artwork.
Beautiful engraving.
I'd like to see it.
It's in my jacket.
I took the jacket off.
I-It was needed elsewhere.
You see what I mean?
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.
[Sighs]
Did you hear what I said?
Mm.
Every word.
Well, then, tell me you're shocked.
Or at least disappointed!
But I'm not.
You must be!
[Laughing] Harlee, I'm not.
[Exhales]
Okay.
I'll be right back.
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?
Sure.
Will Giddings is dead.
He died 20 minutes ago.
Oh, boy.
Oh, God, I wonder how many more'll be dead by tomorrow?
I thought we were building something that- where people could work and live and be safe!
If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
Now, listen.
Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials... were made because I, as a builder, have a right to make those decisions-
If I remain within the building code.
And goddamn it, I did!
[Laughing] Building code.
Jesus.
Oh, the building code.
Come on, Dunc.
I mean, that's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble.
I was crawlin' around up there.
I mean, duct holes weren't fire-stopped!
Corridors without fire doors, and the sprinklers won't work.
And an electrical system that's good for what?
I mean, it's good for startin' fires!
Hoo, boy.
Where was I when all this was goin' on?
'Cause I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!
What do they call it when you kill people?
[Indistinct]
Come on!
Move it!
[Explosion]
Okay.
Who is it?
Chief O'Hallorhan.
What happened?
Part of the central core just blew.
Now, we've got in the fifth alarm.
The helicopters?
No, it's too windy.
They can't set down.
We want to set the breeches buoy up on the roof of the Peerless Building.
[Clamoring] Well, what can we do to help?
Move all your combustible material away from the window.
Okay.
Gotcha.
[Man] Come on.
Grab those tables and chairs.
[Chattering] [Clanking]
[Man] Pile 'em up away from the walls!
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get on 'em now.
Jake, give me a hand!
[Chattering]
Did you reach her?
The phones are all out.
Well, just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.
If only I could have talked to her.
Let her know we were thinking of her.
Told her how- how precious she is to us.
[Sighs] She's still such a child.
She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety-deposit box.
How will she be able to get into it?
I mean, uh, if she should have to.
The things you think of.
Do you wanna help me?
Oh.
Here he is.
Chief, the wind velocity's down a little.
We're gonna try for a landing.
Gil, get Roberts.
Yeah.
Get 10 people up on the roof.
Have the rest of 'em stand by in groups of 10.
We're gonna start airlifting.
Will do.
Patty, put these over there where they can get them easily.
Carlos, give me that pad of paper and a pencil.
Yes, sir.
Give me that brandy snifter too.
Right.
Doug, are they going to land?
They're gonna try.
Send the kids out first...
and then the women.
Number this up to- I don't know— a hundred or so.
High-rise roulette.
High-rise roulette.
That's right.
Doug, there may not be time to tell you later.
There will be.
I'll go tell everybody.
Pass those out when you're ready.
[Helicopter Whirring]
All right, there's gonna be a lot of wind up there, especially when that chopper lands.
So everybody stay in one group.
Come on.
Stay back!
Stay back!
[Whimpering]
[Pilot] Look out!
[Whimpering]
[Whimpering]
[Crying]
[Clamoring]
[Woman] I think so.
Roberts!
Mr. Roberts!
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.
All right, make way.
Pardon me.
Comin' through!
Comin' through!
Pardon me.
[Chattering]
Here he is now.
[Sighs] Yeah?
Now look, Roberts, I know those pilots are dead and-
[Clicks Tongue] God, it was just awful up there.
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.
I've told my two firemen up there to knock out a window.
We're gonna try to shoot a line to you from a chopper.
Okay.
[Sighs]
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
Uh, yeah, sure.
What do you want 'em for?
I wanna try somethin'.
[Chattering]
Step way back.
The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.
Step back.
You won't get hurt.
[Glass Shatters]
[Indistinct]
[Chattering]
May I have your attention, please?
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people down to the street.
Which 12?
The same group that was up on the roof.
And two additions.
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman.
I want a trained man in there.
All right, let's move it out!
Marge!
Here, take this.
Take it.
You can get out of here.
Go on!
Take it.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Listen.
I want you out of here.
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me down there worrying about you?
It's the only way you can help me now, baby.
Help me.
If you ask me to go to the North Pole, or even the cliffs of Mendocino, I'd go.
What if I ask you tomorrow?
Please.
Ma'am, I'll take her.
Thank you.
Come on, Phillip.
All right.
Hey.
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.
I don't want to, ever again.
I'll meet you in the lobby.
I'll be waiting.
Uh, we're still a lady short.
You've gotta go.
But I don't want to leave you.
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.
Have I ever broken a promise to you?
Good luck, honey.
Please.
All set, everyone?
Okay, here we go.
[Helicopters Whirring]
[Crowd Chattering]
[Screaming]
Hey, out of sight!
It's coming!
All right, let's untie this!
Take it all!
Pull in the rest of the line!
[Chattering]
All right, hold it.
Hold it right there!
Bring me in another 20 feet on that main line!
Hey, come here!
Tie this off, will you?
All right.
That's right.
There you go!
That's it.
All right, bring in a little more.
That's it.
Hold it now!
Brace yourselves.
Watch your heads!
[Fireman] Grab it!
Grab it!
Take it back and secure it!
Okay!
All right.
Let it go!
Let it go!
All right.
Go on!
Take it all!
Pull.
Come on.
Pull.
Okay, take up on it!
Make that line!
Fast!
How about the main line?
Secured?
Okay.
Good!

Explosion above 110.
Blew the scenic elevator right off its track.
It's hanging by a cable.
[Sighs] How many people in it?
Loaded.
I'd say about 12.
[Helmet Clatters]
What are you gonna do?
[Sighs]
[Exhales]
Flaker.
- Flaker?
- Sir?
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
Have 'em pick me up on the roof of the Peerless Building.
We got it.
Yeah.
Try and get a hitch on that elevator, drop it down to the deck by the chopper.
[Groans]
[Sobbing] Mommy, Mommy!
It's all right.
It's okay.
I won't let anything happen.
I promise.
[Whimpering]
I won't cry if you won't cry.
Oh.
[Fire Roaring]
It's all right.
Yeah, take it up the ladder there.
[Wind Howling]
Okay, get it over.
Come on.
Come on.
Get it up here.
[Wind Howling] [Helicopter Whirring]
[Shouting]
Okay!
Okay, let it go!
Look out below!
Come on!
[Man] Hey, make that chair fast!
[Helicopter Whirring]
[Chair Clanking]
All right!
Pull it right in there!
Come on!
Pull it in!
All right!
Let's haul that chair in!
Come on!
All of us!
That's it!
[Pulley Jingling]
All right!
Keep it goin'!
All right!
Hold it right there!
- Who's next in order?
- I am.
I am!
- Come ahead.
- I can't do that.
[Man] Yes, you can.
I'll fall!
I can't!
I can't!
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.
Oh, God.
Don't let go of me.
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!
Don't let go!
Ah!
Don't
- Don't let go of me!
Oh, oh!
All right!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
[Explosion] Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
God!
[Whimpering]
Okay.
Here she comes!
All right!
Pull that chair in!
Easy!
Easy!
[Chattering]
Hold it right there.
[Man] Okay, lower the cable!
Grab that hook!
Steady it.
Hook on the torch.
Lash it tight.
This is O'Hallorhan.
[Man] We read you, Chief.
I want you to pick me up with the hook and set me down on the scenic elevator.
Then you're gonna pick up the scenic elevator... and very gently set it down on the street.
Can you handle the weight?
I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Okay.
[Wind Howling]
Watch it.
[Helicopter Whirring] Okay, take it away!
How much time do we have?
Bob, I wish I knew.
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.
Well, I guess I'm next.
Don't suppose you'll let me stay.
Come on.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
[Fireman] Let it go!
Think this'll hold it?
[O'Hallorhan] It better.
We're gonna have to cut the elevator cable.
What's your number?
Sixty-eight.
Forty-seven.

I will.
You tell him I'll be all right.
I-I— I will.
I'll be able to see him at home later.
I will.
I will.
I promise.
[Grunts] Let's go.
[Chattering]
Here she is!
She's all right!
Watch the ladder!
[Man #1] Let's go!
[Man #2] Bring everything.
We're gonna need it!
[Chattering] [Oxygen Tanks Hissing]

[Sirens Continue In Distance]
Hey, Mike, deputy wants to see you.
Okay.
Yeah, Mike, look, we've been checking the situation up in the Promenade Room.
And we figure they've got only about 17, maybe 18, minutes left, if that.
It'll take more than three hours to get 'em all down by breeches buoy.
Those people are gonna die up there if something's not done.
Now, we might just have the answer.
Mr. Johnson's a structural engineer.
You tell the chief your calculations.
The structural strength of the joists and risers up there in the Promenade Room, in my opinion, could definitely withstand the explosion.
What explosion?
Chief, we've got the copter ready out on the plaza.
Fireman, wait a minute.
Look, we'll handle that.
Just get back to your job.
Yes, sir.
What explosion?
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.
They hold a million gallons of water.
That's more than enough to drown the fire.
- You're crazy.
- Mike, it's the only way.
Well, how do you know it'll work?
You could kill everybody up there.
I don't think so.
You don't think.
[Johnson] When you take into account... the stress and load factors, the building design-
Wait a minute.
Hold it.
Mike, look, we've already made the decision.
Now, someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow 'em.
Now, there's only two people in the department qualified for that.
That's you and Connors.
They just— They just brought Connors down.
He's on his way to the burn center.
Look, under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.
I'm just layin' it out for you.
But you— You see how it is, don't you?
How do I get back down?
Oh, shit!
Huh.
[Chattering]
The women are gone.
We are going next.
[Groans, Coughs]
You've all got numbers, and you're gonna take your turn!
And if it's any consolation,
I'm going to be the last one outta here along with my son-in-law.
[Phone Rings]
[Ringing Continues]
[Ringing] Roberts.
It's outta control.
And it's comin' your way.
You got about 15 minutes.
They wanna try somethin'.
They wanna blow those water tanks two floors above you.
They think it might kill the fire.
How they gonna get the explosives up here?
Oh, they'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.
[Sighs] Hang on, I'll tell 'em.
[Sets Receiver On Counter]
They wanna try to put out the fire by blowing up the water tanks above us.
It's gonna mean a lot of water and steel and concrete, but if they don't try it... we're all gonna burn.
The fire's out of control below us.
They figure we got maybe 15 minutes.
This way some of us might survive.
We got no options.
Come on.
Let's go.
[Roger] Get that line!
- Get off!
- You crazy bastard!
Get off this line!
[Roger] Let go of me!
It's not gonna work!
[Grunting] Oh!
It won't hold everybody!
You!
Get off!
Get outta there!
Get the hell outta there!
No!
No!
No!
[Screaming]
Get off!
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
Chief.
Yeah.
Well, we just lost the breeches buoy.
There was panic up here.
It's under control now.
Okay.
I'm gonna try to set down on the roof.
I'm gonna need you up there.
Well, I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.
I know how.
Okay.
See you up there.
[Handset Clatters]
All right!
You're gonna have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts, anything you can find.
[Chattering] Carlos, get some knives.
For God's sakes, Carlos, don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass!
That's the '29!
Comin' through.
Comin' through.
Come on.
[Sirens Fade]
[Sirens Wail]
Try it.
It's okay.
Doug, I... never thought that a thing like this could happen.
Sure.
[Breathing Deeply]
[No Audible Dialogue]
Hey, how much time you think we got?
Ten minutes, maybe less.
We're gonna have to blow the floors out as well as the tanks, you know.
All right, this is your detonator.
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed.
Here you go.
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.
Now later on, after you throw the wire, we'll plug it and splice it into the timer, set it, and then it blows.
You set your explosive...
like this.
Take your detonator, pull the plug.
Toss it.
Got it?
I got it.
Good luck.
See you later.
Okay, thanks.
Here you go.
How much you gonna set it for?
Five.
I think we can make that.
[Ticking] That's it.
[Chattering]
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?
Three and a half.
Air.
Here.
[Breathing Deeply]
[Breathing Deeply]
I'm burning up!
Let's go.
Fireman.
[Screaming]
[Screaming]

Oh, my God!

[Chattering]
Excuse me.
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady.
Mrs. Mueller.
Have you seen her?
I'm sorry.
She's dead.
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Claiborne!
What?
[Meowing]
[Crying]
[Sobbing]
I didn't want you to see him.
You know there's nothing that any of us can do to bring back the dead.
[Sobbing Continues]
All I can do now is pray to God that...
I can stop this from ever happening again.
[Chattering]
I don't know.
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.
A kind of shrine to all the bullshit in the world.
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.
You know, one of these days, they're gonna kill 10,000 in one of these firetraps.
And I'm gonna keep eatin' smoke and bringin' out bodies... until somebody asks us how to build 'em.
[Sighs]
Okay.
I'm askin'.
You know where to reach me.
So long, architect.

Reading my mail, Albert?
Forgive me, sir.
I couldn't help it
Terrible business, that man who steals brains
Yes.
Leave me now, Albert
If you don't mind, I would like leave to go to the dentist this morning
I was in agony all night
Yes, yes, off you go, Albert
Thank you very much, sir
Good day, sir.
What can I do for you?
I'm here on behalf of Mr Nodo
Ah, yes
Nodo warned me
You're late
Go on through to the back
So you tried to extort 5,000 francs out of Mr Nodo but he refused because you couldn't give him a satisfactory guarantee
He's a real shark, a filthy usurer.
The interest he was asking for...
So what do you want from me?
Well, Mr Nodo told me that if I had any interesting information you might buy it off me
What sort of information do you have to sell me?
My master owns certain documents concerning some treasure
I tried to open the drawer this morning but he turned up
What is this treasure?
The treasure of the Knight Templars
Oh, that old joke.
Sit down
I'm listening
It's like this.
Ever since I began working for him... he's immersed himself in the history of the Templars
He's published books on the subject but I am sure
And don't forget, from now on you must do as you are told, without asking any questions
We will check out your story and if we think it's worth it you will get your money
Very well, madam.
Thank you
Come
Compress
Scalpel
Forceps
Clamp
Compress
Scalpel

Excellent, excellent
So, Doctor, where are we at?
My expectations have been exceeded
There is no catalepsy or catatonia
The patients' brains are totally inactive something we have never achieved before
Look, the EEG is completely flat as it is with corpses
It is as if they were dead except for the heartbeat, which is naturally fainter and which is transcribed here
The subjects are totally inert
They are beyond hypnosis even
I still haven't managed...
I'm not your patron, Doctor, as you well know
I didn't snatch you from the hands of the police to suffer a psychology lesson
You promised me killers who would obey me blindly
You'll have your killers
And will they carry out all my orders, without exception?
Without exception
I hope, for your sake, that you are not mistaken
The file on the treasure of the Templars
Coming right up
Do you have a file on this Maxime de Borrego?
Yes, he's a specialist on the Templars and a historian of some repute but he doesn't appear to believe in the treasure
We will check it out
Who are you?
I have been told that you hold the secret of the treasure of the Templars
I have come to confirm that information
My dear sir, judging from your strange get-up I am in the presence of a hoax er or a mental patient
Either way, your conversation is of no interest to me
Be so good as to leave
If you really hold this secret I would be happy to share it with you
I don't know how you managed to get in but your exit is there
Leave immediately.
Leave or I will call for help
I wouldn't do anything if I were you
Anyway, your butler is in his room.
He won't hear you
So, this treasure...
I assure you, there is no such thing as the treasure of the Templars
It's a myth
This is your nephew, Paul de Borrego, the sailor, isn't it?
You see?
I know everything
Except for one thing
Where is the treasure of the Templars?
Don't take me for a fool.
I have done some research, too
I am convinced the treasure exists and I want to know where it is so you're going to tell me all you know
You will never find out
Oh, but I will.
I will
You will talk
Leave this house quickly
You have just enough time before...
You have no idea of the terrible acts of revenge that would ensue if you were to succeed in dragging this secret out of me
The ciborium in the display cabinet is made of solid gold with genuine rubies
I assure you, it's worth a fortune
It's yours.
Now go
I swear, I won't say a word to the police
I'll take the ciborium since you're offering it to me but I will not leave
I have decided that you will talk
My decisions are always irrevocable
You're a madman
Are you ready?
Lord...
O, Lord give me the strength, I beg you, to say nothing
- Sir?
- I live here
In that case, go and see my colleague back there
Excuse me, Inspector.
There's a man who wants to come in
- He says he lives here
- Show him in
Oh, God, Mr Paul, there's been a terrible tragedy
- Who are you, sir?
- It's Mr Paul
This poor man's nephew
That's correct
I am Superintendent Sorbier from the Criminal Investigation Department
Superintendent
- I understand you are a sailor
- Yes
I am a solo navigator and submarine archaeologist
Your uncle was murdered last night
I know.
I have just been informed
You don't seem too upset
My personal feelings are my business, Superintendent
Incorrect
Under such circumstances, everything is police business
Especially the question of who will inherit, for example
I will, obviously
I have a number of questions to ask you
- Please accompany me to my office
- Gladly
- You, too.
Follow me
- Very well, Superintendent
Come along
The time has come for you to make your decision, Brother Amory
I accept.
I will take the place of our murdered brother and I won't rest until the murder of Maxime de Borrego has been avenged
Stand up, Brother Amory
Seneschal of the Order of the Templars accept the tributes from your Brothers
Send me your report as soon as possible.
Thank you
Come in
There's a man here who wants to talk to you urgently about the Borrego case
- Show him in
- Right away, boss
Sit down.
I'm listening
Superintendent, I have just got off a plane at Orly from Spain
It wasn't until I left the airport that I was able to buy a paper
Imagine my surprise when I came across this article
I knew nothing of the murder
I am Paul de Borrego
You are dealing with an impostor
That butler really conned me.
I walked right into the trap
Accessory to murder.
He'll pay for that
I have a key to the house
- Mr Paul
- Albert
Go to your room.
Stay there, Leblanc
Welcome, Superintendent.
Whisky?
There are a few details I would like you to clarify
I've had a few minor problems
I'm at 38, Rue Lasalle at the crossroads at the building site
Come in, Mrs Albert
Say, Mrs Martin, there's something going on in that house
There are broken windows and I can hear moaning
- At the crime scene?
- Yes
Martin, perhaps you could go and have a look
OK
Right
No doubt about it, we'd better call the police
BORREGO C AS E:
RITU AL KI LLI NG?
IS TH E BOG US PAU L DE BORREGO TH E KI LLER?
"Is the bogus Paul de Borrego the killer?
"Was Maxime de Borrego the victim of a ritual killing?"
Tell me, Mr de Borrego...
Mr de Borrego?
Sorry
"For over 600 years...
"...the Templars have been avenging the murder of their master...
"...who was burnt at the stake on 19 March 1314
"Borrego:
Victim of Baphomet, the idol of the Templars?"
Another question mark
"Knights of the Templars practise black magic:
Terrible story of witchcraft"
No question mark
That journalist seems sure of his story
So?
Journalists have been gleaning titbits on this question for over six centuries
All these stories on the treasure of the Knight Templars prove that it exists
Any serious historian will tell you it's a myth born of the fact that individually the Knights pledged poverty whereas the Order was hugely rich
Perhaps the murderer hadn't read what the reliable historians had to say
But one thing is certain
Your uncle was tortured to make him say something
But what?
I haven't the faintest idea
- Here's your man, sir
- Thank you
We were just talking about the treasure of the Templars
So, my dear Albert, be so kind as to shed some light on the subject will you?
I don't know anything about all that, Superintendent
I won't answer your questions until my lawyer is present
Go ahead, Doctor
Look, it's him
That's your man
That's your man
That's your man
The murderer didn't even need to force the lock
You opened the door to him, didn't you?
Even if you're not the killer you must be his accomplice
How many men did you open the door to on the night of the crime?
Listen to me, Albert I'm sure you didn't want my uncle to die
But the man or men who tortured him to death are free and they could commit other atrocities
If you hide the truth, you will be responsible for those crimes
Oh, Mr Paul, if only you knew
That's all we were asking for
I won't speak unless my lawyer is present
He wanted to kill you, too, yesterday
Why are you protecting him?
Too bad
You'll go before a judge if that's what you want
But believe me, you will regret not having spoken, with or without a lawyer
Give me that
Here, sign here
Jobert?
- Yes, sir?
- Lock him up
Very well, Superintendent
That's it, then
What's going on?
They shot him
What's wrong with them?
Go back into your office and call an ambulance
Tell us the name of the man who wanted you dead
I don't know
But you've seen his face, his real face?
He doesn't have a face
Poor Maxime
He led such a peaceful, secluded life
He never hurt anyone
To be finished off in that way...
I can't believe it
Whoever did this is a maniac
No, Professor.
The police no longer believe it was the crime of a maniac
Your uncle always refused to talk about the treasure in his works
I myself have never really known his real thoughts on the matter
Our research related to a different aspect of the history of the Temple
Precisely.
I am unable to tell the police whether the documents were stolen from Maxime's archives
Perhaps you could help me, seeing as you worked with my uncle
Of course.
I'll have to think about it
I'll come to Paris as soon as possible
I have delved into your uncle's library so many times, I know it by heart
But in a crypt here in London I have found some amazing inscribed stones and I must record them
Think of your old friend, too
In his collection there are some coins that might be of interest to you
I could give you those coins to keep as a souvenir
N EXT D AY I N PARIS
I've got him.
In a few minutes, we're going to have a chat
- I think we're being followed
- What?
The white Simca behind us
Get closer
I recognise him.
He's one of the policemen at Borrego's house
We must shake them off
I didn't think the nephew was being watched
My informants have let me down.
Those responsible will be killed
We've been spotted.
Don't let them catch us
Why chase him?
He was in Spain at the time of the murder
Borrego's Spanish alibi hasn't been confirmed
And all these stories about the Templars the crimes and what's more, a real and a bogus Borrego it's so confused that Sorbier suspects everyone
I order you to stop.
Are you mad?
Stop.
What's got into you?
Are you mad?
Stop!
We're going to have to turn back, sir.
The car is too far away
At this speed, in three minutes it will be out of our control
I'll let Borrego go.
We can always find another opportunity to get him
I'll destroy the taxi
Martine Leduc, friend of Paul de Borrego
Lives at 15, Rue de Bon Secours
Borrego confides in her
- Does she go out?
- Yes
Every day between 3:00 and 5:00
Interesting
MARTIN ELEDUC EMBROIDERER
Just in time.
I think I just passed her on the stairs
Yes, I just heard her coming back
- Perfect timing
- She usually comes back later
Here he comes
Paul
I'm so happy you're here.
You're always away
Darling Martine, you shouldn't worry so much
I travel but I always come back
Come in quickly
In the end I was ejected onto the roadside
The police car was found in a field and the false taxi exploded
This story is unbelievable
Are you still in touch with that poet detective?
- What's his name?
- Séraphin Beauminon
Can you ask him to come round as soon as possible?
Hello.
I would like to speak to Mr Beauminon, please
Hello, Séraphin
OK, I'll wait
They're just going to get him
Here are fruits, flowers Leaves and twigs
- And here is my heart
- Keep your heart, S éraphin
- Paul de Borrego
- Hello, how do you do?
- Let me take those
- No, my darling Martine
I can manage
- They need water
- You're too kind.
You shouldn't have
Of course
The idiot.
He's filling the vase I hid the microphone in with water
There's only one mic left
Do you know Paul de Borrego?
Of course I do
Everybody knows Paul de Borrego these days
Mr de Borrego, may I offer you my condolences?
Let's not stand on ceremony, Mr Beauminon
Please call me S éraphin.
Everyone does
Very well.
In that case, call me Paul
S éraphin it was me who asked Martine to call you
I'm going to tell you a secret a secret of the utmost importance that I didn't want to reveal to the police
You have my undivided attention
May I?
That's better
What's happening?
Well?
The second mic has been covered as well
Do you know what some historians think?
That two or three centuries before Christopher Columbus... the French Templars went to America and brought back a cargo of gold
The idea was to build up a war chest with a view to financing a crusade which would put the holy places in the possession of Christianity for ever
This silence... it's infuriating!
The research project I have just completed was entirely financed by my Uncle Maxime
One evening he called me into his study and asked me, as if simply requesting a box of matches to go and search the shallow seas of the Caribbean... at a latitude of approximately 18 degrees 43 north
and a longitude of 88 degrees 52 west
Rather surprised, I asked him what I'd be looking for
He replied that he had good reason to think that a Templar ship carrying gold was shipwrecked at that location between 14th and 19th January 1297
The ship was called the Sancta Maria
He wouldn't hear of any obstacles
When I explained my reservations, he replied...
Paul, I'm asking you.
If you feel any affection for your uncle I beg you not to ask any more questions
Do as I say without arguing
I'll do it
And?
The shallows exist almost exactly where he said they would
There is a platform about 10m below sea level
It was a chance in a million, but I found the wreck what was left of the lost ship
I searched it and I retrieved
...this
But it's gold
It's gold
Yes, but much more solid than ordinary gold
One side bears the motto of the Order of the Templars and the other the name of the ship Sancta Maria
Martine, can I entrust this key to you?
Of course
I'm going to need your help to carry out this enquiry, S éraphin
And also as my bodyguard, I'm afraid
- Will you do it?
- OK, boss.
When do we start?
As soon as possible
We'll start by sorting out my uncle's library
Then we'll check if anything other than the ciborium was stolen
At your service
He would never forgive me but we'll have to delve into his past
As far as I know, Uncle Maxime didn't have a love life to speak of but his research life was very full it'll be difficult to penetrate
Yet I think it's the only way to shed any light on this mystery surrounding us to uncover the motive for this crime and perhaps...
What is it, S éraphin?
What's happening now?
I had no idea that someone had been in here.
It's unbelievable
There's no mistaking it.
They're after you, hot on your heels
You can say that again
It's one of two things.
Either those who are spying on me heard everything in which case we should tell the police everything right away or S éraphin's jacket muffled our voices and they know nothing
- It's a chance to set them a trap
- What sort of trap?
It's a toss-up, but we'll need the help of the police
Explain what you mean
Paul, they tortured your uncle in order to extract a secret from him
That's also why they tried to kidnap you
What would our unknown enemies do if they found out that Martine knew the whole story?
They'd try to kidnap her, too, wouldn't they?
With this mic we can convey false information to them and get the kidnapping to happen at a time and place of our choice
With all the work I have on, I simply can't leave Paris
But your life is at stake They killed Uncle Maxime because of this treasure
They obviously wanted to kidnap me to try and get me to talk
I don't want you taking any risks
But no one knows that I know the secret of the Templars' treasure
This Martine Leduc I need her
Everything's ready
Over to you
We're on our way
Come on, let's go
Where do you think you're going with that?
Hands up!
Help!
Quick, open the door.
Give me the key.
Quickly
Quick, the key.
I must open this door
No, I don't have it
Get a move on, you idiot
- Well?
- Up there
Quickly.
Get me a ladder, a step ladder
Get this out of me.
Pull it out!
Careful.
Get down.
He's dangerous
- What sort of weapon has he got?
- An airgun
Or some blade
What's that?
Don't be afraid.
It's the police.
Has someone been in here?
Yes, a man in black.
He left through that door
Come on, let's hurry
Excuse us, Miss
It's her, boss.
It's her!
S OS, get ready to make your move
SOS, get ready to make your move
The police are blocking my retreat
I'm coming down through the studio
Roger
Over here.
Over here.
I've got her
Give her to me, S éraphin
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I feel so sleepy
What's this?
A blowpipe, eh?
The game's up, honey
Sorry, Superintendent
Keep your smartarse ideas to yourself, Mr Beauminon
Don't involve me next time
Poor old S éraphin
Alas, your ideas aren't always good ones
Wait, Superintendent
Setting a trap wasn't such a bad idea after all
See?
- Not you as well, Mr de Borrego?
- Just hear me out
What if I were to organise an auction for everything here at Hôtel Drouot?
- But you told me...
- What if we spread the word that certain lots contain the secret of the treasure of the Templars?
If that is really what our murderer is looking for I think he will buy it at any price
His remote-controlled taxi is proof that he has vast wealth at his disposal
I'm convinced he will reveal himself, one way or another
The problem with all that is that the murderer knows your uncle's library as well as you do and didn't find anything of interest there
But we might have documents he doesn't know about
We might have found them hidden somewhere secret
And where will you really find them?
I have no idea.
We could forge them ourselves
And you think he'll fall for it?
Yes, if they're authenticated by a specialist
But I absolutely can't stoop to such methods
My professional honour is at stake
Not at all.
Think of the fame
Once the murderer has been arrested, the press will talk only of your courage
What wonderful publicity for you.
Your books will sell by the thousands
And no one will question your opinion.
You're the only person who can help us
You can authenticate our forgeries
Yes, yes...
Authenticate them, yes
After all, why not?
We might as well try our luck
Considering where we're at, why not?
Why not indeed?
Miss, do you really think you need me?
You're indispensable, Professor
Let's give it a go, then
- Yes?
- The television programme, sir
Thank you
The news today is brought to you from the Hotel Drouot
This is Professor Petrie, English historian of repute member of London's Royal Academy who has agreed to evaluate the objects which will go on sale tomorrow and can be viewed by the public at Hotel Drouot from 2:00 this afternoon
Which do you think is the rarest and most interesting object in this auction?
There isn't just one object but three which together make up one single lot
I say three:
Three medallions three wax seals
We found them in an old shoebox in a cupboard
By chance, they had escaped the notice of the murderer
Evidently Maxime de Borrego hid them there
I remember him showing them to me
He believed that these three medallions represent in a symbolic form, naturally, the key to the secret of this famous treasure
I personally do not believe that the treasure exists but there is no denying that these medallions are most curious and seem to contain a sort of message
Look at this one, for example
We have a horseman
His lance in itself definitely implies a certain direction
And it goes without saying that the medallions are authentic?
Thank you, Professor
I need those seals
- It's a trap.
Be careful
- A trap?
There must be some rat skilful enough to take the bait without getting caught
All the subjects you have entrusted to me have been operated on
Yes, and as you can see, we are feeding them through a drip
It is essential to wake them up from time to time to give them solid food and at the same time make them take ex ercise to avoid any muscular atrophy
Our subjects are in excellent physical condition, ready to be put to work
Look at them.
They are the solution for the future
For industry, for the army
No more unemployment or benefits
In the event of an economic recession, back in the box
We'll get them back out when things pick up again
And there is really very little upkeep
Every factory could have its own supply
Same thing for the army.
There would be no need for mobilisation
Human silos near every border
It amuses me to hear people say that modern man behaves and lives as if he were a robot
If only that were true
Then the great minds would rule the world
FU RN ITU RE AUCTION HOUS E
- Would you mind, Professor?
- It would be a pleasure, Mrs...?
Florence Mercet Gisencourt
Florence?
That's the name of a beautiful city, too
Thank you, Professor
Are you quite sure that you have this covered?
You have my word.
There is no one hiding inside and the doors are locked
The station is 50m away and manned all night
What more could you need?
Give yourself up or I'll shoot
Stop!
Stop or I'll shoot.
Stop!
Shit, I didn't load it
Kill them.
Kill them all
Help!
Help!
Help me, S éraphin
Police!
Help, police!
Police, help!
Help!
They're calling us
Police!
Help!
Help!
The red on their arms must be their sign of recognition
It's a pity you forgot to load your gun, poet
Listen, both of you
I'm telling you this so you don't take any uncalculated risks
The auction will take place as planned
With his wounded wrist there is no chance that our man the man without a face, as the press calls him, will come to the auction
- He could send someone
- That's unlikely
We think he'll try to steal the seals from the new owner instead
He seems to have risen to the bait
Assuming there is a buyer.
People will be scared now
Yes, but one of our men will buy them
The seals will be taken to a place of our choosing in the provinces that is easy to guard and we will wait for him there
For 500 francs, going going gone
The next lot contains three seals each bearing an obscure emblem from the Order of the Templars dating from around 1300
Reserve price: 1,000 francs
1,000 francs
Reserve price: 1,000 francs
Any advance?
1, 100 francs 1, 100 francs to the gentleman opposite
Any advance?
For 1, 100 francs...
Any advance?
1, 100 francs to the gentleman opposite
No advance?
For 1, 100 francs, going going gone
No, believe me
No, I do not know anything at all about the Templars
I have no intention of deciphering these scribbles
Since you're so curious, let me tell you something that will be of more interest to you than the contents of this suitcase
I will find the key to the treasure without translating the signs on the seals
I will apply a much better method...
dowsing
I will load up my pendulums with a charge from these medallions
Then I will wave my pendulums with their charge over a big map
That way I will explore the whole world until my pendulums spring into action
It's quite simple really.
Goodbye
Look
Notice how the antenna is moving towards the medallion
This medallion, just like the pendants we wear and the key to the inner crypt are made of alchemical gold
This gold, as you know is radioactive up to a point
It emits a special radiation
I think we are going to have to put this device to good use
The ciborium that the killer stole from our late brother, Maxime de Borrego is also made of alchemical gold
Thanks to this device, we will be able to find it again, wherever it is
And wherever the ciborium is our man cannot be far away
This has just come in, sir
Professor Petrie is declaring that the seals of the Templars are fake
"I authenticated them to help the law...
"...to catch the killer of my friend, Maxime de Borrego"
He has made a fool of me
He must have thought he could get away with it
I condemn Professor Petrie to death for his lack of scientific integrity
Send out a press release
Warn the London offices that the deed will be done as soon as possible
- Is the plane ready?
- As always
I'll leave right away
I want to oversee things for myself
Professor Petrie is very clever
He has told the press that the Templar objects are fakes
The thief will want his revenge and we'll have another case on our hands
Have you seen this, boss?
Special edition
TH E MAN WITHOUT A FACE I condemn Professor Petrie to death
Just as I was saying
It's in the hands of the English now
I must phone Scotland Yard right away
- You're phoning direct?
- We have no time for formalities
Hello?
Get me Scotland Yard, please
Superintendent Sorbier speaking This is urgent
Professor Louis Petrie is in danger He has receiv ed a death threat
I'll call back later
The crypt is deep underground and difficult to get to
They'll get there too late
But...
Just a minute, please, sir.
I'm taking a photo
But...
Sir...
Paul, we are to blame for the death of poor Professor Petrie
Those seals were our idea
- It was me who forged them
- No, Martine
No one forced him to join the fight
And why did he have to go proclaiming to everyone that the seals were fakes?
This man without a face is everywhere
In Paris, in London
Paul, we have to get far away from here, anywhere, or he'll kill us, too
I'm sure of it, Paul.
Let's leave
She's right
Hello?
- That's right
- Mr de Borrego?
This is Borrego speaking
- A call from the provinces
- I'll put you through to the police
Hello?
Superintendent Sorbier.
What's going on?
I'm phoning from a small village in Burgundy 300m outside the village are the ruins of a Templar master's residence
We have just found your uncle's corpse there
But that's unbelievable
It's true Come here right away with your friends
I've ordered a car for you It should be waiting outside your door
Pick up Inspector Péclet on your way He's on another case
The driver has been warned
What on earth is going on?
- Mr de Borrego?
- That's right
Superintendent Sorbier sent me
He won't escape me this time
I'm pleased with my impersonation skills
Even Mrs Sorbier was taken in
Brothers, in a few hours we will have found Maxime de Borrego's killer
We have pinpointed the neighbourhood he is hiding in
The hour of vengeance is nigh
Brother Templar
This is Marc calling
Templar here I'm listening
We have located our enemy
Intervening group to go to 13, Rue Fantôme in front the Sidi Brahim café
Bring a box of ammunition.
You never know
Over and out
I always keep my promises
I promised to spare your life if you told me everything you knew
But I never promised not to entrust you to the good doctor
He's going to give the three of you a very special treatment
Stop!
Danger!
We are under attack Stand by, all stations!
Carry on without me, Doctor.
Let's go
They're going to take me again
They'll say I'm crazy
They'll try and lock me up
They'll stop my work
But they'll never catch me
I will escape them again.
I will escape
Police car sighted
Withdraw immediately
Police car sighted
Withdraw immediately
How did you find us?
Our radios have for some time now been picking up radio signals that acted as guides
Following the lead of those radio waves we were led right here
CLOS ED DU E TO I LLN ESS
Miss Ermance
Oh, Mrs Lépié
So you're back, Miss Ermance?
I just came back to collect a few belongings
My niece has come to help me.
Excuse us, we have a train to catch
- Goodbye, Mrs Lépié
- Goodbye, Miss Ermance
See you very soon, I hope
Oh, yes, very soon, I think
Very soon
The End
Reading my mail, Albert?
Forgive me, sir.
I couldn't help it
Terrible business, that man who steals brains
Yes.
Leave me now, Albert
If you don't mind, I would like leave to go to the dentist this morning
I was in agony all night
Yes, yes, off you go, Albert
Thank you very much, sir
Good day, sir.
What can I do for you?
I'm here on behalf of Mr Nodo
Ah, yes
Nodo warned me
You're late
Go on through to the back
So you tried to extort 5,000 francs out of Mr Nodo but he refused because you couldn't give him a satisfactory guarantee
He's a real shark, a filthy usurer.
The interest he was asking for...
So what do you want from me?
Well, Mr Nodo told me that if I had any interesting information you might buy it off me
What sort of information do you have to sell me?
My master owns certain documents concerning some treasure
I tried to open the drawer this morning but he turned up
What is this treasure?
The treasure of the Knight Templars
Oh, that old joke.
Sit down
I'm listening
It's like this.
Ever since I began working for him... he's immersed himself in the history of the Templars
He's published books on the subject but I am sure
And don't forget, from now on you must do as you are told, without asking any questions
We will check out your story and if we think it's worth it you will get your money
Very well, madam.
Thank you
Come
Compress
Scalpel
Forceps
Clamp
Compress
Scalpel

Excellent, excellent
So, Doctor, where are we at?
My expectations have been exceeded
There is no catalepsy or catatonia
The patients' brains are totally inactive something we have never achieved before
Look, the EEG is completely flat as it is with corpses
It is as if they were dead except for the heartbeat, which is naturally fainter and which is transcribed here
The subjects are totally inert
They are beyond hypnosis even
I still haven't managed...
I'm not your patron, Doctor, as you well know
I didn't snatch you from the hands of the police to suffer a psychology lesson
You promised me killers who would obey me blindly
You'll have your killers
And will they carry out all my orders, without exception?
Without exception
I hope, for your sake, that you are not mistaken
The file on the treasure of the Templars
Coming right up
Do you have a file on this Maxime de Borrego?
Yes, he's a specialist on the Templars and a historian of some repute but he doesn't appear to believe in the treasure
We will check it out
Who are you?
I have been told that you hold the secret of the treasure of the Templars
I have come to confirm that information
My dear sir, judging from your strange get-up I am in the presence of a hoax er or a mental patient
Either way, your conversation is of no interest to me
Be so good as to leave
If you really hold this secret I would be happy to share it with you
I don't know how you managed to get in but your exit is there
Leave immediately.
Leave or I will call for help
I wouldn't do anything if I were you
Anyway, your butler is in his room.
He won't hear you
So, this treasure...
I assure you, there is no such thing as the treasure of the Templars
It's a myth
This is your nephew, Paul de Borrego, the sailor, isn't it?
You see?
I know everything
Except for one thing
Where is the treasure of the Templars?
Don't take me for a fool.
I have done some research, too
I am convinced the treasure exists and I want to know where it is so you're going to tell me all you know
You will never find out
Oh, but I will.
I will
You will talk
Leave this house quickly
You have just enough time before...
You have no idea of the terrible acts of revenge that would ensue if you were to succeed in dragging this secret out of me
The ciborium in the display cabinet is made of solid gold with genuine rubies
I assure you, it's worth a fortune
It's yours.
Now go
I swear, I won't say a word to the police
I'll take the ciborium since you're offering it to me but I will not leave
I have decided that you will talk
My decisions are always irrevocable
You're a madman
Are you ready?
Lord...
O, Lord give me the strength, I beg you, to say nothing
- Sir?
- I live here
In that case, go and see my colleague back there
Excuse me, Inspector.
There's a man who wants to come in
- He says he lives here
- Show him in
Oh, God, Mr Paul, there's been a terrible tragedy
- Who are you, sir?
- It's Mr Paul
This poor man's nephew
That's correct
I am Superintendent Sorbier from the Criminal Investigation Department
Superintendent
- I understand you are a sailor
- Yes
I am a solo navigator and submarine archaeologist
Your uncle was murdered last night
I know.
I have just been informed
You don't seem too upset
My personal feelings are my business, Superintendent
Incorrect
Under such circumstances, everything is police business
Especially the question of who will inherit, for example
I will, obviously
I have a number of questions to ask you
- Please accompany me to my office
- Gladly
- You, too.
Follow me
- Very well, Superintendent
Come along
The time has come for you to make your decision, Brother Amory
I accept.
I will take the place of our murdered brother and I won't rest until the murder of Maxime de Borrego has been avenged
Stand up, Brother Amory
Seneschal of the Order of the Templars accept the tributes from your Brothers
Send me your report as soon as possible.
Thank you
Come in
There's a man here who wants to talk to you urgently about the Borrego case
- Show him in
- Right away, boss
Sit down.
I'm listening
Superintendent, I have just got off a plane at Orly from Spain
It wasn't until I left the airport that I was able to buy a paper
Imagine my surprise when I came across this article
I knew nothing of the murder
I am Paul de Borrego
You are dealing with an impostor
That butler really conned me.
I walked right into the trap
Accessory to murder.
He'll pay for that
I have a key to the house
- Mr Paul
- Albert
Go to your room.
Stay there, Leblanc
Welcome, Superintendent.
Whisky?
There are a few details I would like you to clarify
I've had a few minor problems
I'm at 38, Rue Lasalle at the crossroads at the building site
Come in, Mrs Albert
Say, Mrs Martin, there's something going on in that house
There are broken windows and I can hear moaning
- At the crime scene?
- Yes
Martin, perhaps you could go and have a look
OK
Right
No doubt about it, we'd better call the police
BORREGO CASE:
RITUAL KILLING?
IS THE BOGUS PAUL DE BORREGO THE KILLER?
"Is the bogus Paul de Borrego the killer?
"Was Maxime de Borrego the victim of a ritual killing?"
Tell me, Mr de Borrego...
Mr de Borrego?
Sorry
"For over 600 years...
"...the Templars have been avenging the murder of their master...
"...who was burnt at the stake on 19 March 1314
"Borrego:
Victim of Baphomet, the idol of the Templars?"
Another question mark
"Knights of the Templars practise black magic:
Terrible story of witchcraft"
No question mark
That journalist seems sure of his story
So?
Journalists have been gleaning titbits on this question for over six centuries
All these stories on the treasure of the Knight Templars prove that it exists
Any serious historian will tell you it's a myth born of the fact that individually the Knights pledged poverty whereas the Order was hugely rich
Perhaps the murderer hadn't read what the reliable historians had to say
But one thing is certain
Your uncle was tortured to make him say something
But what?
I haven't the faintest idea
- Here's your man, sir
- Thank you
We were just talking about the treasure of the Templars
So, my dear Albert, be so kind as to shed some light on the subject will you?
I don't know anything about all that, Superintendent
I won't answer your questions until my lawyer is present
Go ahead, Doctor
Look, it's him
That's your man
That's your man
That's your man
The murderer didn't even need to force the lock
You opened the door to him, didn't you?
Even if you're not the killer you must be his accomplice
How many men did you open the door to on the night of the crime?
Listen to me, Albert I'm sure you didn't want my uncle to die
But the man or men who tortured him to death are free and they could commit other atrocities
If you hide the truth, you will be responsible for those crimes
Oh, Mr Paul, if only you knew
That's all we were asking for
I won't speak unless my lawyer is present
He wanted to kill you, too, yesterday
Why are you protecting him?
Too bad
You'll go before a judge if that's what you want
But believe me, you will regret not having spoken, with or without a lawyer
Give me that
Here, sign here
Jobert?
- Yes, sir?
- Lock him up
Very well, Superintendent
That's it, then
What's going on?
They shot him
What's wrong with them?
Go back into your office and call an ambulance
Tell us the name of the man who wanted you dead
I don't know
But you've seen his face, his real face?
He doesn't have a face
Poor Maxime
He led such a peaceful, secluded life
He never hurt anyone
To be finished off in that way...
I can't believe it
Whoever did this is a maniac
No, Professor.
The police no longer believe it was the crime of a maniac
Your uncle always refused to talk about the treasure in his works
I myself have never really known his real thoughts on the matter
Our research related to a different aspect of the history of the Temple
Precisely.
I am unable to tell the police whether the documents were stolen from Maxime's archives
Perhaps you could help me, seeing as you worked with my uncle
Of course.
I'll have to think about it
I'll come to Paris as soon as possible
I have delved into your uncle's library so many times, I know it by heart
But in a crypt here in London I have found some amazing inscribed stones and I must record them
Think of your old friend, too
In his collection there are some coins that might be of interest to you
I could give you those coins to keep as a souvenir
NEXT DAY IN PARIS
I've got him.
In a few minutes, we're going to have a chat
- I think we're being followed
- What?
The white Simca behind us
Get closer
I recognise him.
He's one of the policemen at Borrego's house
We must shake them off
I didn't think the nephew was being watched
My informants have let me down.
Those responsible will be killed
We've been spotted.
Don't let them catch us
Why chase him?
He was in Spain at the time of the murder
Borrego's Spanish alibi hasn't been confirmed
And all these stories about the Templars the crimes and what's more, a real and a bogus Borrego it's so confused that Sorbier suspects everyone
I order you to stop.
Are you mad?
Stop.
What's got into you?
Are you mad?
Stop!
We're going to have to turn back, sir.
The car is too far away
At this speed, in three minutes it will be out of our control
I'll let Borrego go.
We can always find another opportunity to get him
I'll destroy the taxi
Martine Leduc, friend of Paul de Borrego
Lives at 15, Rue de Bon Secours
Borrego confides in her
- Does she go out?
- Yes
Every day between 3:00 and 5:00
Interesting
MARTINE LEDUC EMBROIDERER
Just in time.
I think I just passed her on the stairs
Yes, I just heard her coming back
- Perfect timing
- She usually comes back later
Here he comes
Paul
I'm so happy you're here.
You're always away
Darling Martine, you shouldn't worry so much
I travel but I always come back
Come in quickly
In the end I was ejected onto the roadside
The police car was found in a field and the false taxi exploded
This story is unbelievable
Are you still in touch with that poet detective?
- What's his name?
- Séraphin Beauminon
Can you ask him to come round as soon as possible?
Hello.
I would like to speak to Mr Beauminon, please
Hello, Séraphin
OK, I'll wait
They're just going to get him
Here are fruits, flowers Leaves and twigs
- And here is my heart
- Keep your heart, Séraphin
- Paul de Borrego
- Hello, how do you do?
- Let me take those
- No, my darling Martine
I can manage
- They need water
- You're too kind.
You shouldn't have
Of course
The idiot.
He's filling the vase I hid the microphone in with water
There's only one mic left
Do you know Paul de Borrego?
Of course I do
Everybody knows Paul de Borrego these days
Mr de Borrego, may I offer you my condolences?
Let's not stand on ceremony, Mr Beauminon
Please call me Séraphin.
Everyone does
Very well.
In that case, call me Paul
Séraphin it was me who asked Martine to call you
I'm going to tell you a secret a secret of the utmost importance that I didn't want to reveal to the police
You have my undivided attention
May I?
That's better
What's happening?
Well?
The second mic has been covered as well
Do you know what some historians think?
That two or three centuries before Christopher Columbus... the French Templars went to America and brought back a cargo of gold
The idea was to build up a war chest with a view to financing a crusade which would put the holy places in the possession of Christianity for ever
This silence... it's infuriating!
The research project I have just completed was entirely financed by my Uncle Maxime
One evening he called me into his study and asked me, as if simply requesting a box of matches to go and search the shallow seas of the Caribbean... at a latitude of approximately 18 degrees 43 north
and a longitude of 88 degrees 52 west
Rather surprised, I asked him what I'd be looking for
He replied that he had good reason to think that a Templar ship carrying gold was shipwrecked at that location between 14th and 19th January 1297
The ship was called the Sancta Maria
He wouldn't hear of any obstacles
When I explained my reservations, he replied...
Paul, I'm asking you.
If you feel any affection for your uncle I beg you not to ask any more questions
Do as I say without arguing
I'll do it
And?
The shallows exist almost exactly where he said they would
There is a platform about 10m below sea level
It was a chance in a million, but I found the wreck what was left of the lost ship
I searched it and I retrieved
...this
But it's gold
It's gold
Yes, but much more solid than ordinary gold
One side bears the motto of the Order of the Templars and the other the name of the ship Sancta Maria
Martine, can I entrust this key to you?
Of course
I'm going to need your help to carry out this enquiry, S éraphin
And also as my bodyguard, I'm afraid
- Will you do it?
- OK, boss.
When do we start?
As soon as possible
We'll start by sorting out my uncle's library
Then we'll check if anything other than the ciborium was stolen
At your service
He would never forgive me but we'll have to delve into his past
As far as I know, Uncle Maxime didn't have a love life to speak of but his research life was very full it'll be difficult to penetrate
Yet I think it's the only way to shed any light on this mystery surrounding us to uncover the motive for this crime and perhaps...
What is it, Séraphin?
What's happening now?
I had no idea that someone had been in here.
It's unbelievable
There's no mistaking it.
They're after you, hot on your heels
You can say that again
It's one of two things.
Either those who are spying on me heard everything in which case we should tell the police everything right away or S éraphin's jacket muffled our voices and they know nothing
- It's a chance to set them a trap
- What sort of trap?
It's a toss-up, but we'll need the help of the police
Explain what you mean
Paul, they tortured your uncle in order to extract a secret from him
That's also why they tried to kidnap you
What would our unknown enemies do if they found out that Martine knew the whole story?
They'd try to kidnap her, too, wouldn't they?
With this mic we can convey false information to them and get the kidnapping to happen at a time and place of our choice
With all the work I have on, I simply can't leave Paris
But your life is at stake They killed Uncle Maxime because of this treasure
They obviously wanted to kidnap me to try and get me to talk
I don't want you taking any risks
But no one knows that I know the secret of the Templars' treasure
This Martine Leduc I need her
Everything's ready
Over to you
We're on our way
Come on, let's go
Where do you think you're going with that?
Hands up!
Help!
Quick, open the door.
Give me the key.
Quickly
Quick, the key.
I must open this door
No, I don't have it
Get a move on, you idiot
- Well?
- Up there
Quickly.
Get me a ladder, a step ladder
Get this out of me.
Pull it out!
Careful.
Get down.
He's dangerous
- What sort of weapon has he got?
- An airgun
Or some blade
What's that?
Don't be afraid.
It's the police.
Has someone been in here?
Yes, a man in black.
He left through that door
Come on, let's hurry
Excuse us, Miss
It's her, boss.
It's her!
S OS, get ready to make your move
SOS, get ready to make your move
The police are blocking my retreat
I'm coming down through the studio
Roger
Over here.
Over here.
I've got her
Give her to me, S éraphin
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I feel so sleepy
What's this?
A blowpipe, eh?
The game's up, honey
Sorry, Superintendent
Keep your smartarse ideas to yourself, Mr Beauminon
Don't involve me next time
Poor old Séraphin
Alas, your ideas aren't always good ones
Wait, Superintendent
Setting a trap wasn't such a bad idea after all
See?
- Not you as well, Mr de Borrego?
- Just hear me out
What if I were to organise an auction for everything here at Hôtel Drouot?
- But you told me...
- What if we spread the word that certain lots contain the secret of the treasure of the Templars?
If that is really what our murderer is looking for I think he will buy it at any price
His remote-controlled taxi is proof that he has vast wealth at his disposal
I'm convinced he will reveal himself, one way or another
The problem with all that is that the murderer knows your uncle's library as well as you do and didn't find anything of interest there
But we might have documents he doesn't know about
We might have found them hidden somewhere secret
And where will you really find them?
I have no idea.
We could forge them ourselves
And you think he'll fall for it?
Yes, if they're authenticated by a specialist
But I absolutely can't stoop to such methods
My professional honour is at stake
Not at all.
Think of the fame
Once the murderer has been arrested, the press will talk only of your courage
What wonderful publicity for you.
Your books will sell by the thousands
And no one will question your opinion.
You're the only person who can help us
You can authenticate our forgeries
Yes, yes...
Authenticate them, yes
After all, why not?
We might as well try our luck
Considering where we're at, why not?
Why not indeed?
Miss, do you really think you need me?
You're indispensable, Professor
Let's give it a go, then
- Yes?
- The television programme, sir
Thank you
The news today is brought to you from the Hotel Drouot
This is Professor Petrie, English historian of repute member of London's Royal Academy who has agreed to evaluate the objects which will go on sale tomorrow and can be viewed by the public at Hotel Drouot from 2:00 this afternoon
Which do you think is the rarest and most interesting object in this auction?
There isn't just one object but three which together make up one single lot
I say three:
Three medallions three wax seals
We found them in an old shoebox in a cupboard
By chance, they had escaped the notice of the murderer
Evidently Maxime de Borrego hid them there
I remember him showing them to me
He believed that these three medallions represent in a symbolic form, naturally, the key to the secret of this famous treasure
I personally do not believe that the treasure exists but there is no denying that these medallions are most curious and seem to contain a sort of message
Look at this one, for example
We have a horseman
His lance in itself definitely implies a certain direction
And it goes without saying that the medallions are authentic?
Thank you, Professor
I need those seals
- It's a trap.
Be careful
- A trap?
There must be some rat skilful enough to take the bait without getting caught
All the subjects you have entrusted to me have been operated on
Yes, and as you can see, we are feeding them through a drip
It is essential to wake them up from time to time to give them solid food and at the same time make them take ex ercise to avoid any muscular atrophy
Our subjects are in excellent physical condition, ready to be put to work
Look at them.
They are the solution for the future
For industry, for the army
No more unemployment or benefits
In the event of an economic recession, back in the box
We'll get them back out when things pick up again
And there is really very little upkeep
Every factory could have its own supply
Same thing for the army.
There would be no need for mobilisation
Human silos near every border
It amuses me to hear people say that modern man behaves and lives as if he were a robot
If only that were true
Then the great minds would rule the world
FURNITURE AUCTION HOUSE
- Would you mind, Professor?
- It would be a pleasure, Mrs...?
Florence Mercet Gisencourt
Florence?
That's the name of a beautiful city, too
Thank you, Professor
Are you quite sure that you have this covered?
You have my word.
There is no one hiding inside and the doors are locked
The station is 50m away and manned all night
What more could you need?
Give yourself up or I'll shoot
Stop!
Stop or I'll shoot.
Stop!
Shit, I didn't load it
Kill them.
Kill them all
Help!
Help!
Help me, S éraphin
Police!
Help, police!
Police, help!
Help!
They're calling us
Police!
Help!
Help!
The red on their arms must be their sign of recognition
It's a pity you forgot to load your gun, poet
Listen, both of you
I'm telling you this so you don't take any uncalculated risks
The auction will take place as planned
With his wounded wrist there is no chance that our man the man without a face, as the press calls him, will come to the auction
- He could send someone
- That's unlikely
We think he'll try to steal the seals from the new owner instead
He seems to have risen to the bait
Assuming there is a buyer.
People will be scared now
Yes, but one of our men will buy them
The seals will be taken to a place of our choosing in the provinces that is easy to guard and we will wait for him there
For 500 francs, going going gone
The next lot contains three seals each bearing an obscure emblem from the Order of the Templars dating from around 1300
Reserve price: 1,000 francs
1,000 francs
Reserve price: 1,000 francs
Any advance?
1, 100 francs 1, 100 francs to the gentleman opposite
Any advance?
For 1, 100 francs...
Any advance?
1, 100 francs to the gentleman opposite
No advance?
For 1, 100 francs, going going gone
No, believe me
No, I do not know anything at all about the Templars
I have no intention of deciphering these scribbles
Since you're so curious, let me tell you something that will be of more interest to you than the contents of this suitcase
I will find the key to the treasure without translating the signs on the seals
I will apply a much better method...
dowsing
I will load up my pendulums with a charge from these medallions
Then I will wave my pendulums with their charge over a big map
That way I will explore the whole world until my pendulums spring into action
It's quite simple really.
Goodbye
Look
Notice how the antenna is moving towards the medallion
This medallion, just like the pendants we wear and the key to the inner crypt are made of alchemical gold
This gold, as you know is radioactive up to a point
It emits a special radiation
I think we are going to have to put this device to good use
The ciborium that the killer stole from our late brother, Maxime de Borrego is also made of alchemical gold
Thanks to this device, we will be able to find it again, wherever it is
And wherever the ciborium is our man cannot be far away
This has just come in, sir
Professor Petrie is declaring that the seals of the Templars are fake
"I authenticated them to help the law...
"...to catch the killer of my friend, Maxime de Borrego"
He has made a fool of me
He must have thought he could get away with it
I condemn Professor Petrie to death for his lack of scientific integrity
Send out a press release
Warn the London offices that the deed will be done as soon as possible
- Is the plane ready?
- As always
I'll leave right away
I want to oversee things for myself
Professor Petrie is very clever
He has told the press that the Templar objects are fakes
The thief will want his revenge and we'll have another case on our hands
Have you seen this, boss?
Special edition
THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE I condemn Professor Petrie to death
Just as I was saying
It's in the hands of the English now
I must phone Scotland Yard right away
- You're phoning direct?
- We have no time for formalities
Hello?
Get me Scotland Yard, please
Superintendent Sorbier speaking This is urgent
Professor Louis Petrie is in danger He has receiv ed a death threat
I'll call back later
The crypt is deep underground and difficult to get to
They'll get there too late
But...
Just a minute, please, sir.
I'm taking a photo
But...
Sir...
Paul, we are to blame for the death of poor Professor Petrie
Those seals were our idea
- It was me who forged them
- No, Martine
No one forced him to join the fight
And why did he have to go proclaiming to everyone that the seals were fakes?
This man without a face is everywhere
In Paris, in London
Paul, we have to get far away from here, anywhere, or he'll kill us, too
I'm sure of it, Paul.
Let's leave
She's right
Hello?
- That's right
- Mr de Borrego?
This is Borrego speaking
- A call from the provinces
- I'll put you through to the police
Hello?
Superintendent Sorbier.
What's going on?
I'm phoning from a small village in Burgundy 300m outside the village are the ruins of a Templar master's residence
We have just found your uncle's corpse there
But that's unbelievable
It's true Come here right away with your friends
I've ordered a car for you It should be waiting outside your door
Pick up Inspector Péclet on your way He's on another case
The driver has been warned
What on earth is going on?
- Mr de Borrego?
- That's right
Superintendent Sorbier sent me
He won't escape me this time
I'm pleased with my impersonation skills
Even Mrs Sorbier was taken in
Brothers, in a few hours we will have found Maxime de Borrego's killer
We have pinpointed the neighbourhood he is hiding in
The hour of vengeance is nigh
Brother Templar
This is Marc calling
Templar here I'm listening
We have located our enemy
Intervening group to go to 13, Rue Fantôme in front the Sidi Brahim café
Bring a box of ammunition.
You never know
Over and out
I always keep my promises
I promised to spare your life if you told me everything you knew
But I never promised not to entrust you to the good doctor
He's going to give the three of you a very special treatment
Stop!
Danger!
We are under attack Stand by, all stations!
Carry on without me, Doctor.
Let's go
They're going to take me again
They'll say I'm crazy
They'll try and lock me up
They'll stop my work
But they'll never catch me
I will escape them again.
I will escape
Police car sighted
Withdraw immediately
Police car sighted
Withdraw immediately
How did you find us?
Our radios have for some time now been picking up radio signals that acted as guides
Following the lead of those radio waves we were led right here
CLOSED DUE TO ILLNESS
Miss Ermance
Oh, Mrs Lépié
So you're back, Miss Ermance?
I just came back to collect a few belongings
My niece has come to help me.
Excuse us, we have a train to catch
- Goodbye, Mrs Lépié
- Goodbye, Miss Ermance
See you very soon, I hope
Oh, yes, very soon, I think
Very soon

Original Screenplay, Adaptation and Dialogue by Jacques Champreux
Produced by Raymond Froment
Reading my mail, Albert?
Forgive me, sir.
I couldn't help it
Terrible business, that man who steals brains
Yes.
Leave me now, Albert
If you don't mind, I would like leave to go to the dentist this morning
I was in agony all night
Yes, yes, off you go, Albert
Thank you very much, sir
Good day, sir.
What can I do for you?
I'm here on behalf of Mr Nodo
Ah, yes
Nodo warned me
You're late
Go on through to the back
So you tried to extort 5,000 francs out of Mr Nodo but he refused because you couldn't give him a satisfactory guarantee
He's a real shark, a filthy usurer.
The interest he was asking for...
So what do you want from me?
Well, Mr Nodo told me that if I had any interesting information you might buy it off me
What sort of information do you have to sell me?
My master owns certain documents concerning some treasure
I tried to open the drawer this morning but he turned up
What is this treasure?
The treasure of the Knight Templars
Oh, that old joke.
Sit down
I'm listening
It's like this.
Ever since I began working for him he's immersed himself in the history of the Templars
He's published books on the subject but I am sure...
And don't forget, from now on you must do as you are told, without asking any questions
We will check out your story and if we think it's worth it you will get your money
Very well, madam.
Thank you
Come
Compress

Excellent, excellent
So, Doctor, where are we at?
My expectations have been exceeded
There is no catalepsy or catatonia
The patients' brains are totally inactive something we have never achieved before
Look, the EEG is completely flat as it is with corpses
It is as if they were dead except for the heartbeat, which is naturally fainter and which is transcribed here
The subjects are totally inert
They are beyond hypnosis even
I still haven't managed...
I'm not your patron, Doctor, as you well know
I didn't snatch you from the hands of the police to suffer a psychology lesson
You promised me killers who would obey me blindly
You'll have your killers
And will they carry out all my orders, without exception?
Without exception
I hope, for your sake, that you are not mistaken
The file on the treasure of the Templars
Coming right up
Do you have a file on this Maxime de Borrego?
Yes, he's a specialist on the Templars and a historian of some repute but he doesn't appear to believe in the treasure
We will check it out
Who are you?
I have been told that you hold the secret of the treasure of the Templars
I have come to confirm that information
My dear sir, judging from your strange get-up I am in the presence of a hoaxer or a mental patient
Either way, your conversation is of no interest to me
Be so good as to leave
If you really hold this secret I would be happy to share it with you
I don't know how you managed to get in but your exit is there
Leave immediately.
Leave or I will call for help
I wouldn't do anything if I were you
Anyway, your butler is in his room.
He won't hear you
So, this treasure...
I assure you, there is no such thing as the treasure of the Templars
It's a myth
This is your nephew, Paul de Borrego, the sailor, isn't it?
You see?
I know everything
Except for one thing
Where is the treasure of the Templars?
Don't take me for a fool.
I have done some research, too
I am convinced the treasure exists and I want to know where it is so you're going to tell me all you know
You will never find out
Oh, but I will.
I will
You will talk
Leave this house quickly
You have just enough time before...
You have no idea of the terrible acts of revenge that would ensue if you were to succeed in dragging this secret out of me
The ciborium in the display cabinet is made of solid gold with genuine rubies
I assure you, it's worth a fortune
It's yours.
Now go
I swear, I won't say a word to the police
I'll take the ciborium since you're offering it to me but I will not leave
I have decided that you will talk
My decisions are always irrevocable
You're a madman
Are you ready?
Lord...
O, Lord give me the strength, I beg you, to say nothing
- Sir?
- I live here
In that case, go and see my colleague back there
Excuse me, Inspector.
There's a man who wants to come in
- He says he lives here
- Show him in
Oh, God, Mr Paul, there's been a terrible tragedy
- Who are you, sir?
- It's Mr Paul
This poor man's nephew
That's correct
I am Superintendent Sorbier from the Criminal Investigation Department
Superintendent
- I understand you are a sailor
- Yes
I am a solo navigator and submarine archaeologist
Your uncle was murdered last night
I know.
I have just been informed
You don't seem too upset
My personal feelings are my business, Superintendent
Incorrect
Under such circumstances, everything is police business
Especially the question of who will inherit, for example
I will, obviously
I have a number of questions to ask you
- Please accompany me to my office
- Gladly
- You, too.
Follow me
- Very well, Superintendent
Come along
The time has come for you to make your decision, Brother Amory
I accept.
I will take the place of our murdered brother and I won't rest until the murder of Maxime de Borrego has been avenged
Stand up, Brother Amory
Seneschal of the Order of the Templars accept the tributes from your Brothers
Send me your report as soon as possible.
Thank you
Come in
There's a man here who wants to talk to you urgently about the Borrego case
- Show him in
- Right away, boss
Sit down.
I'm listening
Superintendent, I have just got off a plane at Orly from Spain
It wasn't until I left the airport that I was able to buy a paper
Imagine my surprise when I came across this article
I knew nothing of the murder
I am Paul de Borrego
You are dealing with an impostor
That butler really conned me.
I walked right into the trap
Accessory to murder.
He'll pay for that
I have a key to the house
- Mr Paul
- Albert
Go to your room.
Stay there, Leblanc
Welcome, Superintendent.
Whisky?
There are a few details I would like you to clarify
I've had a few minor problems
I'm at 38, Rue Lasalle at the crossroads at the building site
Come in, Mrs Albert
Say, Mrs Martin, there's something going on in that house
There are broken windows and I can hear moaning
- At the crime scene?
- Yes
Martin, perhaps you could go and have a look
OK
Right
No doubt about it, we'd better call the police
BORREGO CASE:
RITU AL KILLING?
IS THE BOGUS PAUL DE BORREGO THE KILLER?
"Is the bogus Paul de Borrego the killer?
"Was Maxime de Borrego the victim of a ritual killing?"
Tell me, Mr de Borrego...
Mr de Borrego?
Sorry
"For over 600 years...
"...the Templars have been avenging the murder of their master...
"...who was burnt at the stake on 19 March 1314
"Borrego:
Victim of Baphomet, the idol of the Templars?"
Another question mark
"Knights of the Templars practise black magic:
Terrible story of witchcraft"
No question mark
That journalist seems sure of his story
So?
Journalists have been gleaning titbits on this question for over six centuries
All these stories on the treasure of the Knight Templars prove that it exists
Any serious historian will tell you it's a myth born of the fact that individually the Knights pledged poverty whereas the Order was hugely rich
Perhaps the murderer hadn't read what the reliable historians had to say
But one thing is certain
Your uncle was tortured to make him say something
But what?
I haven't the faintest idea
- Here's your man, sir
- Thank you
We were just talking about the treasure of the Templars
So, my dear Albert, be so kind as to shed some light on the subject will you?
I don't know anything about all that, Superintendent
I won't answer your questions until my lawyer is present
Go ahead, Doctor
Look, it's him
That's your man
That's your man
That's your man
The murderer didn't even need to force the lock
You opened the door to him, didn't you?
Even if you're not the killer you must be his accomplice
How many men did you open the door to on the night of the crime?
Listen to me, Albert I'm sure you didn't want my uncle to die
But the man or men who tortured him to death are free and they could commit other atrocities
If you hide the truth, you will be responsible for those crimes
Oh, Mr Paul, if only you knew
That's all we were asking for
I won't speak unless my lawyer is present
He wanted to kill you, too, yesterday
Why are you protecting him?
Too bad
You'll go before a judge if that's what you want
But believe me, you will regret not having spoken, with or without a lawyer
Give me that
Here, sign here
Jobert?
- Yes, sir?
- Lock him up
Very well, Superintendent
That's it, then
What's going on?
They shot him
What's wrong with them?
Go back into your office and call an ambulance
Tell us the name of the man who wanted you dead
I don't know
But you've seen his face, his real face?
He doesn't have a face
Poor Maxime
He led such a peaceful, secluded life
He never hurt anyone
To be finished off in that way...
I can't believe it
Whoever did this is a maniac
No, Professor.
The police no longer believe it was the crime of a maniac
Your uncle always refused to talk about the treasure in his works
I myself have never really known his real thoughts on the matter
Our research related to a different aspect of the history of the Temple
Precisely.
I am unable to tell the police whether the documents were stolen from Maxime's archives
Perhaps you could help me, seeing as you worked with my uncle
Of course.
I'll have to think about it
I'll come to Paris as soon as possible
I have delved into your uncle's library so many times, I know it by heart
But in a crypt here in London I have found some amazing inscribed stones and I must record them
Think of your old friend, too
In his collection there are some coins that might be of interest to you
I could give you those coins to keep as a souvenir
NEXT DAY IN PARIS
I've got him.
In a few minutes, we're going to have a chat
- I think we're being followed
- What?
The white Simca behind us
Get closer
I recognise him.
He's one of the policemen at Borrego's house
We must shake them off
I didn't think the nephew was being watched
My informants have let me down.
Those responsible will be killed
We've been spotted.
Don't let them catch us
Why chase him?
He was in Spain at the time of the murder
Borrego's Spanish alibi hasn't been confirmed
And all these stories about the Templars the crimes and what's more, a real and a bogus Borrego it's so confused that Sorbier suspects everyone
I order you to stop.
Are you mad?
Stop.
What's got into you?
Are you mad?
Stop!
We're going to have to turn back, sir.
The car is too far away
At this speed, in three minutes it will be out of our control
I'll let Borrego go.
We can always find another opportunity to get him
I'll destroy the taxi
Martine Leduc, frhhhend of Pauhhh de Borrego
Lives at 15, Rue de Bon Secours
Borrego confides in her
- Does she go out?
- Yes
Every day between 3:00 and 5:00
Interesting
MARTINE LEDUC EMBROIDERER
Just in time.
I think I just passed her on the stairs
Yes, I just heard her coming back
- Perfect timing
- She usually comes back later
Here he comes
Paul
I'm so happy you're here.
You're always away
Darling Martine, you shouldn't worry so much
I travel but I always come back
Come in quickly
In the end I was ejected onto the roadside
The police car was found in a field and the false taxi exploded
This story is unbelievable
Are you still in touch with that poet detective?
- What's his name?
- Séraphin Beauminon
Can you ask him to come round as soon as possible?
Hello.
I would like to speak to Mr Beauminon, please
Hello, Séraphin
OK, I'll wait
They're just going to get him
Here are fruits, flowers Leaves and twigs
- And here is my heart
- Keep your heart, Séraphin
- Paul de Borrego
- Hello, how do you do?
- Let me take those
- No, my darling Martine
I can manage
- They need water
- You're too kind.
You shouldn't have
Of course
The idiot.
He's filling the vase I hid the microphone in with water
There's only one mic left
Do you know Paul de Borrego?
Of course I do
Everybody knows Paul de Borrego these days
Mr de Borrego, may I offer you my condolences?
Let's not stand on ceremony, Mr Beauminon
Please call me Séraphin.
Everyone does
Very well.
In that case, call me Paul
Séraphin it was me who asked Martine to call you
I'm going to tell you a secret a secret of the utmost importance that I didn't want to reveal to the police
You have my undivided attention
May I?
That's better
What's happening?
Well?
The second mic has been covered as well
Do you know what some historians think?
That two or three centuries before Christopher Columbus the French Templars went to America and brought back a cargo of gold
The idea was to build up a war chest with a view to financing a crusade which would put the holy places in the possession of Christianity for ever
This silence... it's infuriating!
The research project I have just completed was entirely financed by my Uncle Maxime
One evening he called me into his study and asked me, as if simply requesting a box of matches to go and search the shallow seas of the Caribbean at a latitude of approximately 18 degrees 43 north and a longitude of 88 degrees 52 west
Rather surprised, I asked him what I'd be looking for
He replied that he had good reason to think that a Templar ship carrying gold was shipwrecked at that location between 14th and 19th January 1297
The ship was called the Sancta Maria
He wouldn't hear of any obstacles
When I explained my reservations, he replied...
Paul, I'm asking you.
If you feel any affection for your uncle I beg you not to ask any more questions
Do as I say without arguing
I'll do it
And?
The shallows exist almost exactly where he said they would
There is a platform about 10m below sea level
It was a chance in a million, but I found the wreck what was left of the lost ship
I searched it and I retrieved this
But it's gold
It's gold
Yes, but much more solid than ordinary gold
One side bears the motto of the Order of the Templars and the other the name of the ship Sancta Maria
Martine, can I entrust this key to you?
Of course
I'm going to need your help to carry out this enquiry, Séraphin
And also as my bodyguard, I'm afraid
- Will you do it?
- OK, boss.
When do we start?
As soon as possible
We'll start by sorting out my uncle's library
Then we'll check if anything other than the ciborium was stolen
At your service
He would never forgive me but we'll have to delve into his past
As far as I know, Uncle Maxime didn't have a love life to speak of but his research life was very full
It'll be difficult to penetrate
Yet I think it's the only way to shed any light on this mystery surrounding us to uncover the motive for this crime and perhaps...
What is it, Séraphin?
What's happening now?
I had no idea that someone had been in here.
It's unbelievable
There's no mistaking it.
They're after you, hot on your heels
You can say that again
It's one of two things.
Either those who are spying on me heard everything in which case we should tell the police everything right away or Séraphin's jacket muffled our voices and they know nothing
- It's a chance to set them a trap
- What sort of trap?
It's a toss-up, but we'll need the help of the police
Explain what you mean
Paul, they tortured your uncle in order to extract a secret from him
That's also why they tried to kidnap you
What would our unknown enemies do if they found out that Martine knew the whole story?
They'd try to kidnap her, too, wouldn't they?
With this mic we can convey false information to them and get the kidnapping to happen at a time and place of our choice
With all the work I have on, I simply can't leave Paris
But your life is at stake.
They killed Uncle Maxime because of this treasure
They obviously wanted to kidnap me to try and get me to talk
I don't want you taking any risks
But no one knows that I know the secret of the Templars' treasure
This Martine Leduc I need her
Everything's ready
Over to you
We're on our way
Come on, let's go
Where do you think you're going with that?
Hands up!
Help!
Quick, open the door.
Give me the key.
Quickly
Quick, the key.
I must open this door
No, I don't have it
Get a move on, you idiot
- Well?
- Up there
Quickly.
Get me a ladder, a step ladder
Get this out of me.
Pull it out!
Careful.
Get down.
He's dangerous
- What sort of weapon has he got?
- An airgun
Or some blade
What's that?
Don't be afraid.
It's the police.
Has someone been in here?
Yes, a man in black.
He left through that door
Come on, let's hurry
Excuse us, Miss
It's her, boss.
It's her!
SOS, get ready to make your move
SOS, get ready to make your move
The police are blocking my retreat
I'm coming down through the studio
Roger
Over here.
Over here.
I've got her
Give her to me, Séraphin
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I feel so sleepy
What's this?
A blowpipe, eh?
The game's up, honey
Sorry, Superintendent
Keep your smartarse ideas to yourself, Mr Beauminon
Don't involve me next time
Poor old Séraphin
Alas, your ideas aren't always good ones
Wait, Superintendent
Setting a trap wasn't such a bad idea after all
See?
- Not you as well, Mr de Borrego?
- Just hear me out
What if I were to organise an auction for everything here at Hôtel Drouot?
- But you told me...
- What if we spread the word that certain lots contain the secret of the treasure of the Templars?
If that is really what our murderer is looking for I think he will buy it at any price
His remote-controlled taxi is proof that he has vast wealth at his disposal
I'm convinced he will reveal himself, one way or another
The problem with all that is that the murderer knows your uncle's library as well as you do and didn't find anything of interest there
But we might have documents he doesn't know about
We might have found them hidden somewhere secret
And where will you really find them?
I have no idea.
We could forge them ourselves
And you think he'll fall for it?
Yes, if they're authenticated by a specialist
But I absolutely can't stoop to such methods
My professional honour is at stake
Not at all.
Think of the fame
Once the murderer has been arrested, the press will talk only of your courage
What wonderful publicity for you.
Your books will sell by the thousands
And no one will question your opinion.
You're the only person who can help us
You can authenticate our forgeries
Yes, yes...
Authenticate them, yes
After all, why not?
We might as well try our luck
Considering where we're at, why not?
Why not indeed?
Miss, do you really think you need me?
You're indispensable, Professor
Let's give it a go, then
- Yes?
- The television programme, sir
Thank you
The news today is brought to you from the Hôtel Drouot
This is Professor Petrie, English historian of repute member of London's Royal Academy who has agreed to evaluate the objects which will go on sale tomorrow and can be viewed by the public at Hôtel Drouot from 2:00 this afternoon
Whichdo you think is the rarest and most interesting object in this auction?
There isn't just one object but three which together make up one single lot
I say three:
Three medallions three wax seals
We found them in an old shoebox in a cupboard
By chance, they had escaped the notice of the murderer
Evidently Maxime de Borrego hid them there
I remember him showing them to me
He believed thhhat these three medallions represent in a symbolic form, naturally, the key to the secret of this famous treasure
I personally do not believe that the treasure exists but there is no denying that these medallions are most curious and seem to contain a sort of message
Look at this one, for example
We have a horseman
His lance in itself definitely implies a certain direction
And it goes without saying that the medallions are authentic?
Thank you, Professor
I need those seals
- It's a trap.
Be careful
- A trap?
There must be some rat skilful enough to take the bait without getting caught
All the subjects you have entrusted to me have been operated on
Yes, and as you can see, we are feeding them through a drip
It is essential to wake them up from time to time to give them solid food and at the same time make them take exercise to avoid any muscular atrophy
Our subjects are in excellent physical condition, ready to be put to work
Look at them.
They are the solution for the future
For industry, for the army
No more unemployment or benefits
In the event of an economic recession, back in the box
We'll get them back out when things pick up again
And there is really very little upkeep
Every factory could have its own supply
Same thing for the army.
There would be no need for mobilisation
Human silos near every border
It amuses me to hear people say that modern man behaves and lives as if he were a robot
If only that were true
Then the great minds would rule the world
FURNITURE AUCTION HOUSE
- Would you mind, Professor?
- It would be a pleasure, Mrs...?
Florence Mercet Gisencourt
Florence?
That's the name of a beautiful city, too
Thank you, Professor
Are you quite sure that you have this covered?
You have my word.
There is no one hiding inside and the doors are locked
The station is 50m away and manned all night
What more could you need?
Give yourself up or I'll shoot
Stop!
Stop or I'll shoot.
Stop!
Shit, I didn't load it
Kill them.
Kill them all
Help!
Help!
Help me, Séraphin
Police!
Help, police!
Police, help!
Help!
They're calling us
Police!
Help!
Help!
The red on their arms must be their sign of recognition
It's a pity you forgot to load your gun, poet
Listen, both of you
I'm telling you this so you don't take any uncalculated risks
The auction will take place as planned
With his wounded wrist there is no chance that our man the man without a face, as the press calls him, will come to the auction
- He could send someone
- That's unlikely
We think he'll try to steal the seals from the new owner instead
He seems to have risen to the bait
Assuming there is a buyer.
People will be scared now
Yes, but one of our men will buy them
The seals will be taken to a place of our choosing in the provinces that is easy to guard and we will wait for him there
For 500 francs, going going gone
The next lot contains three seals each bearing an obscure emblem from the Order of the Templars dating from around 1300
Reserve price: 1,000 francs

Reserve price: 1,000 francs
Any advance?
1,100 francs 1,100 francs to the gentleman opposite
Any advance?
For 1,100 francs...
Any advance?
1,100 francs to the gentleman opposite
No advance?
For 1,100 francs, going going gone
No, believe me
No, I do not know anything at all about the Templars
I have no intention of deciphering these scribbles
Since you're so curious, let me tell you something that will be of more interest to you than the contents of this suitcase
I will find the key to the treasure without translating the signs on the seals
I will apply a much better method...
dowsing
I will load up my pendulums with a charge from these medallions
Then I will wave my pendulums with their charge over a big map
That way I will explore the whole world until my pendulums spring into action
It's quite simple really.
Goodbye
Look
Notice how the antenna is moving towards the medallion
This medallion, just like the pendants we wear and the key to the inner crypt are made of alchemical gold
This gold, as you know is radioactive up to a point
It emits a special radiation
I think we are going to have to put this device to good use
The ciborium that the killer stole from our late brother, Maxime de Borrego is also made of alchemical gold
Thanks to this device, we will be able to find it again, wherever it is
And wherever the ciborium is our man cannot be far away
This has just come in, sir
Professor Petrie is declaring that the seals of the Templars are fake
"I authenticated them to help the law...
"...to catch the killer of my friend, Maxime de Borrego"
He has made a fool of me
He must have thought he could get away with it
I condemn Professor Petrie to death for his lack of scientific integrity
Send out a press release
Warn the London offices that the deed will be done as soon as possible
- Is the plane ready?
- As always
I'll leave right away
I want to oversee things for myself
Professor Petrie is very clever
He has told the press that the Templar objects are fakes
The thief will want his revenge and we'll have another case on our hands
Have you seen this, boss?
Special edition
THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE I condemn Professor Petrie to death
Just as I was saying
It's in the hands of the English now
I must phone Scotland Yard right away
- You're phoning direct?
- We have no time for formalities
Hello?
Get me Scotland Yard, please
Superintendent Sorbier speaking.
This is urgent
Professor Louis Petrie is in danger.
He has received a death threat
I'll call back later
The crypt is deep underground and difficult to get to
They'll get there too late
But...
Just a minute, please, sir.
I'm taking a photo
But...
Sir...
Paul, we are to blame for the death of poor Professor Petrie
Those seals were our idea
- It was me who forged them
- No, Martine
No one forced him to join the fight
And why did he have to go proclaiming to everyone that the seals were fakes?
This man without a face is everywhere
In Paris, in London
Paul, we have to get far away from here, anywhere, or he'll kill us, too
I'm sure of it, Paul.
Let's leave
She's right
Hello?
- That's right
- Mr de Borrego?
This is Borrego speaking
- A call from the provinces
- I'll put you through to the police
Hello?
Superintendent Sorbier.
What's going on?
I'm phoning from a small village in Burgundy 300m outside the village are the ruins of a Templar master's residence
We have just found your uncle's corpse there
But that's unbelievable
It's true.
Come here right away with your friends
I've ordered a car for you.
It should be waiting outside your door
Pick up Inspector Péchhhet on your way.
He's on another case
The driver has been warned
What on earth is going on?
- Mr de Borrego?
- That's right
Superintendent Sorbier sent me
He won't escape me this time
I'm pleased with my impersonation skills
Even Mrs Sorbier was taken in
Brothers, in a few hours we will have found Maxime de Borrego's killer
We have pinpointed the neighbourhood he is hiding in
The hour of vengeance is nigh
Brother Templar
This is Marc calling
Templar here.
I'm listening
We have located our enemy
Intervening group to go to 13, Rue Fantôme in front the Sidi Brahim café
Bring a box of ammunition.
You never know
Over and out
I always keep my promises
I promised to spare your life if you told me everything you knew
But I never promised not to entrust you to the good doctor
He's going to give the three of you a very special treatment
Stop!
Danger!
We are under attack.
Stand by, all stations!
Carry on without me, Doctor.
Let's go
They're going to take me again
They'll say I'm crazy
They'll try and lock me up
They'll stop my work
But they'll never catch me
I will escape them again.
I will escape
Police car sighted
Withdraw immediately
Police car sighted
Withdraw immediately
How did you find us?
Our radios have for some time now been picking up radio signals that acted as guides
Following the lead of those radio waves we were led right here
CLOSED DUE TO ILLNESS
Miss Ermance
Oh, Mrs Lépié
So you're back, Miss Ermance?
I just came back to collect a few belongings
My niece has come to help me.
Excuse us, we have a train to catch
- Goodbye, Mrs Lépié
- Goodbye, Miss Ermance
See you very soon, I hope
Oh, yes, very soon, I think
Very soon

(phone rings)
Yeah?
- Aren't you awake yet?
- Yeah.
- Truck.
- What time is it?
Time to take care of business.
We gotta go get Garrity.
Oh, man, what's your hurry?
He's still in the stockade.
You got the...
Authorisation papers?
I got them.
Don't go back to sleep.
Pick me up at the corner of Bouchett, get it?
- Got it.
- Good.
Francis, I forgot to feed you last night.
I'm sorry about that.
You pissed on my shirt!
My last goddamned shirt.
You fuckass son of a bitch.
Get your ass off here.
Be glad when Annie gets back so she can take care of your fuckin' ass.
(Jerry) Slow down!
Stop bitchin'.
- You fixing' to kill us?
- You won't feel a thing.
- You're in the death seat.
- Oh, my God!
I didn't hear you offer to use your car.
My car?
!
You ain't tearing' up my new car, nigger!
No, no.
- Damn, you an unclean motherfucker.
- What?
- You smell like piss.
- Hey, I ain't no slob.
Ain't nobody calling you a slob.
You just a foul-smelling nigger.
How come your old lady don't like me?
You gotta understand that she's a middle-class broad... and you a gross son of a bitch.
- Naturally, she don't like you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on!
(honks horn)
- Hey.
What's your problem, mister?
- Round up the staff, Judge Advocate.
We don't round up nobody around here.
Sure you do.
Court-certified copy of bail bond and authorisation to surrender on a pervert named Garrity.
You Garrity?
- I could check with the major...
- Relax.
Mister, I don't know what the hell you are talking about.
General, this is a warrant for his arrest.
- You two are cops?
- Skip tracers.
He jumped bail, we gotta bring him in.
We got us a couple of Negro bounty hunters here!
- I'll just call the major, check on...
- Just relax.
You gonna bring him out or do we have to go in and get him?
Enlist.
I tell you what, you try us again on Mother's Day.
Then you won't have any trouble gettin' in.
Go play with yourself, redneck!
- What you doin'?
- Shit, I need a new tyre.
- Halt!
- Goddamn it, hit the left rear.
Dave, if only you'd listened.
What was I supposed to do?
Let 'em drive through like they own the place?
You don't let 'em drive through, but if you'd just let me call the major...
We did what we were supposed to do.
We stopped them, didn't we?
This man skipped bail.
I can do whatever is necessary to surrender him to court.
Garrity's a good man.
A man wounded twice in the line of duty.
Of course, he has his problems.
Spends most of his time in the brig.
- You civilians have no understanding...
- I didn't bring no violin.
Have you ever been in combat?
Do you know what kind of hell that is?
No, man.
I'm a faggot.
- You're on a military base, Mr Turner.
- Garrity raped a 1 3-year-old girl.
Snatched off her drawers, ripped her wide open and beat her half to death.
- Mr Turner, these things take time.
- Get the grease out your ass!
- Lighten up, he's a major.
- I don't care if he's a general.
What are you gonna say when the papers print you're harbouring a child molester?
Well, I...
I...
I...
Let Garrity leave the base... in civilian clothing.
Thanks, Major... for the new tyre.
Later.
I knew you had to be stupid to be a skip tracer.
But you tar babies take the cake!
I heard about you, Turner.
From what they told me about you, I expected a two-ton gorilla.
- But you're just another nigger.
- Why don't you shut up?
Why, you shuffle-footed overgrown coon!
Open your mouth one more time and I'm gonna kick your teeth down your throat.
You're a big man while I've got these cuffs on, ain't you?
Come on, that's enough!
Ain't you beat him enough?
Damn, Truck.
Did you have to beat him so bad?
He had it comin'.
Run it down.
What's goin' on here, King?
- How much you get for a rogue like that?
- $50 each and expenses.
- Get one every day for a year and...
- We wouldn't be lollygaggin' with you.
Fix me up with a pass to see Annie.
- Who?
- You know, my big doll!
Sarge, Jesse James is here.
No, Turner.
Truck.
Yeah.
Just a minute.
He says you got two minutes, and leave that cannon here.
Hey, man, you tell him this ain't no cannon.
Dig it?
Hey, look at him!
He can't wait to get some.
Say, man.
Where's that old grouchy broad of yours?
Man, that's my wife.
(woman) Oh, my God!
(excited chatter)
Hey, fine black thing.
(wolf whistles)
Shut up!
Hagglin' bitches.
Truck, what's wrong?
Nothing.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
I'm doin' this time.
I ain't letting' it do me.
That's my girl.
Don't let this bullshit get you down.
- I can't stand it.
- I know.
When I get out, Truck, can you and me go away someplace?
Where do you wanna go?
I don't care.
We've been together a long time and we ain't never been nowhere.
Time's up.
I'll see you tomorrow, OK?
Bye, Truck.
- Know what JD called my old lady?
- What?
A jive-ass broad.
Can you blame him?
One of these days, you gonna break your neck!
Why don't you buy yourself some?
Last time I listened to you, they put penicillin in my ass.
- Everybody gets it once!
- Some twice.
My old lady gets out tomorrow and I can't wait.
You gonna be deep into that for days!
You got that right!
All the way to the bone.
- Why'd she want another television?
- I don't know.
- Was it worth 30 days?
- The judge gave her 30 days, not me.
Everybody says "Go see Nate Dinwiddie.
He'll get your husband out."
Woman, don't jive me.
The bail is $1 ,000.
That makes the bond $100.
If your cheque bounces or your old man splits, I get burned for $1 ,000.
What you mean, "bounce"?
Oh, no.
Not Anna May's cheque.
- You guys back already?
- No.
- What about Garrity?
- Across the street.
Good.
This ain't Safeway.
I'm a bail bondsman.
We don't take no cheques.
- How much cash you got?
- 75.
- Got any credit cards?
- You take food stamps?
Ah!
Get your ass up.
- Ain't that you up there?
- Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Hey, I seen you play.
Truck Mack Turner.
Mack Truck Turner.
You got hurt, didn't you?
It takes talent.
It takes guts to play hurt.
Guts, that's what this game's all about.
- Thank you so much.
- You're all right.
You go on over to the jail.
I'll take care of the rest.
Get up.
- Hey, man, who's the heavy?
- Her husband's in for drunk-driving.
If I had a wife that size, I'd drink too.
Didn't I take care of you already?
Get the hell out of here.
Thanks.
Jerry, he still thinks the women in Tahiti walk around with their tits hangin' out.
That's right.
That's where I'm gonna retire.
Man, Tahiti's just like Miami Beach.
Shit.
I'm still gonna buy me a boat and cruise there.
I wish you two would argue after I get paid.
- Let me write you a cheque.
- A what?
- Fogarty called.
He's got something.
- Whatever he got, I don't want it.
- I'm on vacation.
- Vacation?
His booster gets out today.
That thievin' bitch is gonna be on the streets?
She'll steal your drawers one day and sell 'em.
- Get off my back, Papa Doc.
- Man, he's right!
You oughta send that bitch back to the Dalton gang.
- Why don't she get a job?
- She went that route before.
- She'd rather be a booster.
- I'll straighten her out.
(Jerry) What can you do for her?
Jail didn't do her no good.
- (Nate) He's right.
- What the hell's goin' on here?
We calling' a spade a spade.
No, we callin' her a thief.
The woman digs me and I dig her.
I ain't cutting' her loose.
Ain't nobody asking you to cut her loose.
Just cut the bitch's hands off.
Freeze your shit and get off my case.
You should see Fogarty.
He's talking five bills.
You creepin'.
Get some speed up.
This ain't no tank.
This is my wife's new car.
Let me see what this new rod'll do.
Open up.
I don't wanna get no ticket!
- Streets are clear.
Come on, hit it.
- You ain't ready.
I don't believe it'd do nothing anyway.
This can't outperform a truck.
- Are you ready?
- Are you ready?
Hold on, Truck, cos we movin'!
We go!
Yeah, yeah!
uh-oh.
- What d'you mean?
- (police siren)
- Look what you got me into now, nigger.
- It's your car, not mine.
Good day, Officer.
- This your car?
- The finance company lets me drive it.
- You see that stop sign?
- It was covered by the trees.
- Let me see your licence.
- But, blood...
Damn, this a ugly picture.
- What you laughing at?
- Nothing, Officer.
Laugh this ticket off.
You got a nice rod but you should drive more carefully.
(clerk) I'm sorry, Fogarty.
His bond went forfeit over 24 hours ago.
(Fogarty) Let me have one more day.
- I'm sorry.
- You don't realise what this'll do to me.
- Choose your clients more carefully.
- Where the hell am I... (taps pencil)
Mr Davidson, will you please stop interrupting this court?
I'm sorry, Your Honour.
Hi, Turner, Jerry.
Glad to see you.
I got a real easy one here for you.
Guy's name is Richard Leroy Johnson.
Also known as Gator.
His last known address is a vacant lot.
Bail is $30,000.
He jumped it yesterday.
I don't think anybody else could get him.
Bring him home, you got yourself 250 bucks apiece.
He's got two priors.
So, $800.
$800 for a lousy nigger?
- The guy's just a pimp!
- He's got two priors.
- You said that already.
- One was for pimpin'.
What's the other for, Fogarty?
All right. 400 bucks, Jerry.
What he can't say is assault with intent.
A student Gator tried to pull told him to fuck off.
Gator poured gasoline in her hair and set a match to it.
Girl's father went looking for Gator.
Gator busted his head, and carved his initials in his face.
1 ,000.
- No.
- Bye.
Turner, I ain't giving' you a thousand!
- You can't drive my car.
Don't even ask.
- Let me drive it.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
- Turner!
Wait a second.
- The man has problems.
- 500 apiece.
Be reasonable.
- Who you tryin' to jive?
Gator'll shoot anything that comes after him.
We gotta kick his ass.
OK. 1 ,000.
No.
The more I think about it, no.
Turner, you know this business.
If I lose him, insurance companies kiss me off.
- I need Gator to stay alive.
- No one else will go after him, will they?
No.
- $1 ,000.
- Each.
What?
Turner!
Do you know what it'll cost you if you don't get him?
You ain't got nobody to turn to but us.
So you shit or get off the pot.
Relax, man.
Why don't you go play some golf?
You got two lousy niggers takin' care of the case.
- (Jerry) You better leave that ho alone.
- To get a rooster, you check out the hens.
Oh, check out that big piece of chocolate cake!
(whistling and whooping)
Control yourselves!
- You Dorinda?
- Who wants to know?
Since I'm asking, it must be me.
- (laughter)
- Shut up!
You don't look like cops but you smell like trouble.
Trouble?
Me?
If I was, I wouldn't stand a chance with you, momma.
Tell me somethin'.
Is all that as good as it looks?
What you see ain't all you get, baby.
- This ain't Sears, Roebuck, nigger.
- (laughter)
Where's Gator?
I said where's Gator?
- Gator who?
- I owe him some bread.
You give it to me, and if I see him I'll give it to him.
That's enough.
Total up my bill and let Frenchie pay for it.
Frenchie!
- Sign the bill.
- Yes, momma.
- I told you, Gator ain't here.
- Where is he?
He's in Alaska, hunting' polar bear.
I told you I gotta talk to this nigger.
I'll tell him I saw you, so just take that money and shove it up your ass, you bounty-huntin' son of a bitch.
- Wait a minute.
- You wait a minute.
I hope you do run into Gator so he can cut your goddamn throat.
- You didn't get shit.
- Just follow the bouncing ball, nigger.
(honks horn)
(gunshot)
Stop!
Stop!
Follow that car.
Follow that car!
Move this truck or I'll blow your brains out.
- Follow that car.
- That one right there.
Move it.
You gonna get your picture in the paper.
On the front page?
Oh, man!
- Watch out for the car, Truck.
- I'll only hit the tyre.
- Watch out.
- Don't worry, I got it.
Yeah, but my wife, Truck!
(gunshots)
Any of you guys wanna make some money?
I'll give every man here a $50 bill to stop two punks from coming through that door.
I want blood!
Send them niggers to boot hill!
- Motherfucker, where you been?
- Right here!
Don't no son of a bitch move.
Excedrin headache no. 39, sucker.
- Man, he said you was punks.
- We are.
- So every man drop his pants.
Everybody.
- Come on, you heard him!
If anybody asks, tell 'em you been hit by a truck.
Mack Truck Turner.
What's goin' on here?
Shit.
If I'd known that was Truck Turner, he'd have had to pay me more than $50.
I think we gonna have to waste that pimp.
Yeah.
If he don't kill us first.
What am I gonna do about my car?
It's just a radiator job.
It'll be ready tomorrow.
You're about to meet royalty, Jerry.
I want you to go and mingle with the girls.
I got a little business to talk over.
- Mack Truck Turner, how've you been?
- Fine.
What's goin' on, Duke?
- Meet my partner, Jerry Barnes.
- Pleasure.
- You remember Lucille and Betty?
- Hey!
Still foxes, huh?
- My, you've grown!
- You haven't.
Just increased everywhere.
Just good fertiliser, momma.
- How's Nate?
- Nate's still tryin' to buy a boat.
Bring the gentlemen a drink, Lucille.
- Make mine a beer.
- Bring me another crème de menthe.
- You're lookin' good, Duke.
- I've lived hard, and it shows.
I'm laid up now.
All I do is drink, think of the memories.
Them beautiful memories!
Who is it?
What do you know about a pimp called Gator?
Gator?
Mean mack.
He's a dog among pimps.
I want him real bad.
His days are numbered.
Watch out you don't get caught in the crossfire.
- What do you mean?
- Word is somebody else wants him bad.
- Who?
- Hustler named Harvard Blue.
Been around here about two years or so.
Runnin' himself thin tryin' to start a stable.
Tryin' to run dope.
Gambling.
You name it.
- What's he want Gator for?
- Gator stole Blue's woman from him.
Some big blonde called...
Hey, Betty, what's that Blue's ho's name?
- Stalingrad Crewd.
- Yeah.
Son, there is a pimp civil war brewing'.
- They don't make pimps like they used to.
- Not like you anyway, honey.
- Shut up and get your ass back to work.
- Yes, Daddy.
My faithful lambs.
Where can I find this Gator?
- Maybe the Duke made a mistake.
- The old man don't miss.
Let's just wait.
Let's give it about 1 5 minutes.
- Is that him?
- I told you the old man don't miss.
Hey, man!
Wait a minute!
- Relax, gentlemen.
- We want some answers.
You work this alley regular?
You know everybody living here?
We're doin' a study.
Character comparison by garbage.
- What about apartment 1 309?
- The black pimp.
- What's his trash?
- That's for lawyers' or priests' ears only.
I'm a priest.
- Thousands of empty candy wrappers.
- Dope.
- Where does the druggist live?
- That's privileged information.
This is the last of the money.
Where does that druggist live?
- It's your turn to be the bad guy.
- You do it better than I do.
(man) Who is it?
Gator.
- We don't wanna hurt you.
- I'll kill this rat.
- You work for Gator, don't you?
- No, you got the wrong man.
(hollering)
- (Truck) Where's Gator?
- Look, man, I'm your friend.
- I don't know.
- You just got one chance left now.
Grow wings, superfly.
Wait.
Across 105th.
- What do you think?
- Make sure he's in.
Let's see some finesse.
Kick the door down, go in blasting'.
No, old weasel here can call him for some coke.
- He comes out, we scoop him up.
- Try to take him alive.
- How hard?
- You watch the house, I'll call the cops.
Got it.
You know the game.
You get cute, you're dead.
- What do I tell him?
- Tell him you got some good stuff.
(phone rings)
- Gator, aren't you gonna answer it?
- It's your job.
Answer it, you dumb bitch.
Hello.
- I think it's for you.
- How the hell could it be for me?
Jive-ass broad.
Speak!
What the hell you doin', callin' me here?
You know better than that.
Sorry, man, but...
I got some dynamite stuff here.
- Yeah, but why are you callin' me here?
- I gotta!
understand?
- Is anybody with you?
- Tell him to let you in.
- Let me in!
- I'm gonna slit your throat, you jive-ass sucker!
- How much time have I got?
- Worse than that.
- But what about me?
- What about you?
- Do me a favour.
Call the cops.
- Why do you want the cops?
Aaagh!
- Freeze, pimp!
Freeze!
- Hey, man.
Ain't no need for all this.
I got more money on me than you make in a year.
Take it.
Freeze.
- You hurt?
- Nah, I'm indestructible.
- Hey, man, looks like we get a bonus.
- Yeah.
Bitch.
(Fogarty) He's dead.
- Just give us our money.
- You'll have to take a cheque.
I've been stabbed.
I ain't in no mood for your bullshit!
And add $100 each.
- What for?
- Medical expenses.
I could swear that son of a bitch was gonna blow me back to the Last Supper.
You ain't gettin' any younger, you know.
Am I gonna hear it from her tonight.
- Your old lady, huh?
- Mm.
Tell her a frog peed on your arm.
Sometimes I think we ought to give it up.
(belches)
And do what?
Maybe rob some banks?
- Goddamn.
Annie.
Shit!
- She robs televisions.
Fuckin' around with you will blow my mind.
Pay for the drinks, will you?
But, Truck...
Hey.
- You know my name?
- I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to cash a cheque.
Shit!
You could have brought me some flowers.
I got some beer.
Is Francis all right?
Yeah, Francis is all right.
OK, Annie, get it out.
- You should have been there to meet me.
- I was there...
I spent 30 days in that joint and you visited me five times.
Six.
Now you wanna give me beer and screw me.
All right.
We'll stop and get something to eat first.
- You could tell me you love me.
- I do love you, baby.
Can't you tell?
Yeah, I can smell it on your breath.
# Alone again
# At last again
# Please let love have its way
# Don't let the waiting
# Anticipating
# Be all in vain
# Be good to me
# Cos I'm gonna be
# As good as I can be to you
OK, so I made a mistake.
# Baby, oh, baby

Momma, you ain't gonna keep this shit together with Gator gone.
Come here, you little black bitch.
Your ass belongs to me.
I tell you what you can and can't do with it.
- Do you understand?
- I didn't say I was leaving.
Shut up!
Now, you whores sit down.
I wanna talk to you.
Anybody thinking about leaving here's gonna find my left foot up their ass.
- What?
- Shut up, you junkie whore.
Those two bitches that left better learn to sell pussy in Iceland, because if I ever see them again I'll cut their fuckin' throats.
See, we are family.
And that's what we're gonna stay.
I got important business out there today.
When I call you, I want you to come out there and shake your asses proper.
You hear?
Huh?
Get out there and make it look good.
And, Raquel, take that fuckin' jacket off.
Move it!
- Dorinda.
You're lookin' beautiful.
- Hi, Reno.
I know it isn't the time or the place but we must get together and talk about this.
I'll name the time and place.
- I'm sorry about the Gator man.
- Thank you, Snow.
- I know it's hard on you.
- Yeah.
I'm glad you guys could come.
Before you say anything, I got something to clear your head.
- I could sure use it, Snow.
- What do you have here?
- You got something to put in this spoon?
- I'm not called the Snowman for nothing.
You move fast, Snow.
- Hey, Desmond.
- Hey, beauty.
You know I'm gonna offer you a quarter of a million for your stable.
Naturally you get to keep a percentage.
What is this shit?
We didn't come to this dead son of a bitch's house to be comedians.
- What's up?
- You lookin' good, Blue.
The Lord himself couldn't look better.
I'm rich.
I'm cute.
I'm handsome.
- What the hell is on your mind?
- Let's sit down and talk about it.
- I'm already here, bitch.
- It's OK with me.
- (Desmond) That's cool.
- (Reno) What do you want?
A bucket of blood.
I want the nigger that wasted Gator.
Wait a minute.
We in the business of running hos.
Not killing'.
The Gator was a friend of ours.
It would show respect.
(laughter)
Come off it, man.
What kind of money you payin' for a hit like this?
Truck Turner ain't a poopbutt.
It's been nice, but I wasn't even here.
You goddamn rabbits.
What the hell do you think I'm runnin' here?
A chicken coop?
Gentlemen, this is my family.
These are all prime-cut bitches.
$238,000-worth of dynamite.
It's Fort Knox in panties.
Candy did 17,000 last year.
Velvet Miss Sophisticate did 20.
used to be a Paris model.
Jess and Annette each did 22,500.
Show 'em your wares, bitch.
See what you can get if you're good?
That's Turnpike.
She did 26,500.
She's called Turnpike cos you gotta pay to get on and pay to get off.
China, come here, baby.
China did 29.
Sweet piece of oriental meat.
This is Frenchie.
Gator used to call her Boeing 747.
Show 'em why, bitch. (laughs)
She did 27,500.
And that's sweet Annette.
Show 'em that smile, you sweet thing.
She did 30,000 last year.
- Where's my baby?
- Right here.
That's Taffy. (laughs)
This bitch grossed $37,500 working part time.
Shit.
Her clients think she's too good to fuck.
They call her Colonel Sanders cos she's finger-lickin' good.
Oh, momma.
You've got yourself a family!
You've got to believe it, nigger.
All right, ladies, would you mingle?
Now, who's gonna kill that nigger for me?
You just saw $238,000 shake its ass in front of your face.
If you can't respect Gator, then respect that.
I want that bastard Truck Turner and I want him dead.
The man who kills him gets my broads, and I'll run the stable.
- Now talk to me.
- How much, lady?
Half. 50 per cent.
It's done.
I've had my say.
Dorinda, you're trying to piss standing up.
- You are gonna get a lot of people wet.
- I know it.
Cos there ain't a mack here is man enough to ice Truck Turner.
What do you expect?
He's a candy-ass pimp, not a sheriff.
I'm gonna say goodbye to you, because there's many of you here that I will not see again.
Dorinda, you're comin' on so strong, you're gonna need an act of congress or the united States army to get Truck Turner off your ass.
Val...
I'm gonna be a father to some orphans.
- (Annie) What brought this on?
- All I said was "Why don't you get a job?"
- Did I do somethin' wrong?
- Did you do something wrong?
You sound like you tryin' to get rid of me, baby.
- Babe, I'm not tryin' to get rid of you.
- Then what is all this shit about a job?
I'm tired of lookin' you up in jail.
Then why don't you get a job?
- You think you wired up for somebody.
- At least just admit it.
The last job I had I had to drop a fuckin' typewriter on the supervisor's foot.
- He kept puttin' his hands all over me...
- Yeah.
I heard that already.
Excuses.
You can't do shit in jail but look at the four walls and fight off them butches.
How come you dig me so much?
What makes you think I dig you?
Ouch!
- Come here.
- Get away from me, you freak.
Come here!
Hey!
That's him.
- That's Truck Turner, man.
- Look, man, that's him.
You said kill a nigger.
That's Truck Turner.
What's the matter with you?
We got a job to do.
- Look here, man!
- Come on!
Fuck you, man.
- Truck, do you know 'em?
- I told you I don't know who they were.
- Then why were they shooting at us?
- I don't know but I'll find out.
Aagh!
Come on in.
Close the door.
What do you want, man?
Checkin' you out... man.
What was all this shooting' shit outside?
The sky's about to open up on your head.
Better retire.
Take a vacation.
Lay on a beach for about 90 years.
You got ten seconds.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
- Be cool, pussy.
- Eight.
Dorinda's clever.
You gotta hand it to her.
She knows the dude that kills Turner can keep us from picking' her stable clean.
I'll take care of the bitches and Dorinda.
You just run the stable.
I don't wanna end up like Reno.
Desmond, what are you worried about?
We have an insurance company.
For Turner you're gonna need it.
- What's the tab?
- 20,000.
- Ten for you and ten for me.
- You got it.
What do you want for breakfast?
Hm?
What do you think?
Goddamn, Francis.
Where the hell you goin'?
- She's mine, Francis!
- Hello, Francis.
Wait a minute.
Your ass has got to go.
(gasps)
(Snow) You got players' blood runnin'.
- Turner's ass ain't even scratched.
- You ought to be layin' eggs, Snow.
Give it up, momma.
There's a much better way.
- Hey, momma.
Blue, he's here.
- Send him out.
You get back in the house.
- Can't I even say hello?
- Git, bitch.
You gettin' into shit.
You gonna trip and fall.
- When you do I'm not gonna be there.
- That's your choice.
- You comin' or goin'?
- Blue, all you son of a bitches are crazy.
Get the fuck away from me, you son of a bitch.
- I presume you came to talk business.
- Do I have my cock in my hand?
- Who's he?
Your test tube?
- He's searchin' your house.
- Shit, nigger, this ain't the White House.
- You better get it together.
Reno's dead, Toro's gone, so is Fontana.
Snowman just got egg on his shoes.
- Can't you cut the job?
- I came here to get him off your ass.
- My ass is in good shape.
- You ass is into hot water without a boat.
What you gonna do when Turner finds out you turned those guns on him?
You're liable to lose your ass and that string of bitches you got.
What are you gonna do?
Become a man?
You're past 30 and time is runnin' out.
I haven't had to sell my pussy since I was 1 5 and found out I could sell other bitches instead...
Because you had that crocodile nigger working for you!
Now he's getting his mail from the groundhog!
You wanna hear my deal?
What fuckin' deal?
I'll kill Truck Turner for half of Gator's share.
- You outta your goddamn mind.
- At least you can retire with a pension.
Shove your pension, nigger.
All I want is Truck Turner's head.
25 per cent of the take.
If you understand that, then me and you can talk a deal.
- You wait a minute, Blue.
- You heard what I said!
I bought an insurance company and it's at the airport.
Yes or no?
Let's go, Val.
Blue.
OK.
Call the insurance company.
- How's the insurance company?
- People doin' their own killing' nowadays.
A lot of amateurs calling themselves hit men.
Wendell, I want you to meet some friends I went to school with.
This is Panama.
Joe Dante.
AI Reed.
- The Candy Man.
- Some call me that.
How long's this gonna take?
We were late leaving' Detroit.
You gettin' superstitious, Al?
The only thing I believe in is this shotgun in this case.
Look, Harvard.
We got tickets for the doubleheader.
- How much?
- $20,000.
$500.
That's right.
Be here tomorrow morning at eight with $500, and your boy'll be home by nine.
That's right.
All right.
Goodbye.
- What's goin' on here?
- (Blue) We're not gonna waste any time.
We're not gonna repeat ourselves.
- What do you want?
- You're gonna listen and listen well.
- I ain't got no money here.
- These men sell insurance.
And you have a friend whose name is Truck Turner.
His death has just been insured.
Call him so he can collect his premium.
(phone rings)
Don't answer it.
- Hello.
- Truck, it's Nate.
You're drunk.
Go to sleep.
- Please come down.
- Say it's a big job and you're in trouble.
- What?
- A big job.
I'm in trouble.
Man!
I'm loaded, I'm tired, and...
Oh, God, Truck.
They're gonna kill ya!
(whimpers)
Hello?
Nate?
(phone rings)
- Hello?
- (Truck) Jerry, hi.
- What do you want?
- You sleeping?
No, man.
I was playin' poker.
What do you want?
- Nate's got something.
Says he needs me.
- Now?
You drunk son of a bitch.
Nate didn't sound right.
Go see what he wants.
I'll meet you.
- Shit.
- Ijust gotta sober up, man.
(sighs)
All right.
- Life insurance for the dead, my friend.
- This ain't Turner.
- Who the hell is it?
- Another piece of bait.
(groans)
For Christ's sakes, you killed the wrong man.
He called, a man came, we shot him.
Should we have asked for his licence?
No.
Just earn the 20,000 we're giving you.
That's all.
Hey, Al.
What do you say we pay Turner a visit at his house?
It's not gonna be that easy no more.
You been out of the insurance business too long, my friend.
Truck Turner's like a bulldog with eyes up his ass.
- We just cut him loose.
- You should leave town for a while, Blue.
You should get your lily-white hands dirty.
I'll get you the gun.
You get the stable and I'll run it.
That's the deal, not Turner breathing down my neck.
You play the game, you pay the price.
He's following a trail of blood, which is gonna lead right to you.
You bring him here.
Do you hear me?
- What?
- You heard what I said!
Just do it!
- May I help you?
- We've come to see Nate Dinwiddie.
- Sorry, no one sees him without...
- Would you leave us alone, please?
He isn't in this ward.
I'm getting tired of people barging in like you own the place.
Papa Doc?
- That you, Truck?
- Yeah.
Hey, baby, how you doin'?
Annie?
I'm OK, baby.
They got me so doped up, I...
They killed Jerry.
Who was it?
- They after you.
- Who?
I asked 'em what it was all about.
Just kept hittin' me.
Talkin' about insurance.
I didn't wanna call.
Somebody named Blue.
He was there.
- Harvard Blue?
- I didn't wanna call.
It's all right.
Oh, God.
I'm tired.
Hey, some people will do anything for a vacation, won't they?
Yeah.
If you wanna see those tits in Tahiti, you gotta get plenty of rest and get well.
Sleep tight, Papa Doc.
Be careful, boy.
Annie, look after him for me, please?
I will.
There he is, Lieutenant!
Goddamn it!
What the hell is going on?
Come on, I haven't got shit to go on.
- I'll kick your ass!
- (Truck) Hey!
Aw, shit.
I saw your partner.
I've been up all night.
Wait for me in the car...
I said the car.
- I don't wanna wait in the car.
- Go on.
Nate says he doesn't know nothin'.
You tell me.
Who did it?
I don't know.
But when I find out, I'll blow 'em to hell.
If they jump bail, you got 'em.
If not, it's my headache.
- I'm gonna get 'em.
- You got a permit to carry that gun.
Don't do nothin' to lose it, cos the way I figure it, somebody wants your ass.
I know that.
You'd better aim straight.
I'm gonna leave that man on Nate's door.
- Thanks.
- It's routine.
Who did that to Francis?
- Truck, they got Francis.
- There's nothing you can do.
- (Truck) Let's get out of here.
- (Annie) Oh, God.
Truck, they're gonna try to get you next.
- Annie, go to your mother's for a while.
- I ain't goin'.
- Yes, you are.
- I ain't goin' nowhere without you.
Now, look.
They tried to get me through you, and they'll try again.
- Why can't we just leave town, Truck?
- Not until I get 'em all.
- Truck, they gonna kill you.
- They gonna have to do just that.
Cos they owe me... and I'm gonna collect.
Hey.
Let's stop this nonsense.
Let's go shopping.
- I'll buy you a dress.
What size are you?
- Size five.
- Miss, where are your fives?
- Right around there.
- Over here.
Come on.
- You said we were going to town.
- We're goin' away.
- What are you doing?
Come on.
Let's try these on.
- Which way is your dressing room?
- Right over there, sir.
Right over there.
Come on, hurry now.
Mm-mm.
- This is the only one that fits.
- The only one that fits.
- Wear it.
- Truck!
I can't.
It's a night-time dress.
- Why don't I wear what I came in with?
- Baby, wear this one for me.
Take your bag and meet me in the car.
- Who's gonna pay for the dress?
- Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of that.
- Where's the security guard?
- What?
Where's your fuckin' security guard?
Over there.
(inaudible)
Oh, Christ.
Is Desmond in?
I'm a friend of his mother's.
- What's her name?
- Miss Ann.
- You can do better than that.
- Don't be no goddamn problem.
No problem.
Oohh!
If you don't open this gate, you're gonna get the biggest enema of your life.
Open it!
How did you get in here?
- You Desmond?
- That depends.
uh-huh.
None of these bitches are, so I guess that leaves you.
- What do you want?
- Where's Blue, your partner?
I don't have a partner named Blue.
Easy.
That thing cost me a lot.
This ain't my year.
Here's a pimp, a patio full of whores.
I'm the one gettin' fucked.
Nah.
- Where did you say Blue was?
- I have no idea.
(screams)
- Where is he?
- It's only money, man.
If you don't tell me where he is, this bitch is gonna deep-throat this barrel.
- Wait.
- (Truck) Where?
Last house in the hills. 2170 Sierra.
(gunshots)
- Doctor, how is he?
- He keeps asking for you.
- Is he gonna make it?
- I think so.
There's no more internal bleeding but that eye isn't gonna be any use to him.
Medication keeps him pretty drowsy, so don't be surprised if he drifts off on you.
- Doc, does he know?
- About his eye?
Yes.
Papa Doc.
You OK?
Yeah.
Are you all right?
I cancelled that insurance for you.
- What brought the roof down?
- Blue.
He's got a contract on me.
You get him yet?
I got the hit man.
Haven't got him yet, but I will.
Be careful.
He's slick.
He'll do what you least expect.
I hope he does try.
Here.
This was Jerry's.
Put it under your mattress.
- What am I gonna do with this?
- You might need it.
- You son of a bitch, your ass is mine.
- Go for it, cos I'm goin' for mine.
- Go see if the motherfucker's dead.
- I ain't goin' out there.
Son of a bitch, Truck Turner.
You better not show your goddamn face.
You better not do it, you son of a bitch!
Stay where you are.
I dare you to come out and show your fuckin' face!
I've got this kid out here, Turner!
(horn honks)
(girls chatter)
(girl) I'm gettin' the fuck out of here!
You ain't goin' nowhere, you simple-minded black bitch.
I know what all you whores are sayin'.
You can't do nothin' but fuck so you better work out a way to stay in...
All you bitches out of business.
- Pack your shit.
- Get your hands off of me.
Shit!
Your ass is leavin'.
Get the fuck out of here.
I don't understand...
Get outta my closet.
Your shit backfired.
I killed Blue's ass and you'll get the fuck outta here.
Truck Turner, anything you want, you can have it.
Forget them jive motherfuckers.
You and me could do business.
Cut that act, bitch.
Before you get that piece out, your ass is air-conditioned.
You ain't gonna kill no woman.
Oh, shit.
- Hey, you mad?
- What the hell do you think?
What I did, I did it for you.
I didn't want you scattered all over the street.
They were gonna try to get me through you.
Look, woman, cut the goddamn shit and get your ass in the car.
Would you leave me alone?
Babe, I love you.
Look.
I even got all our shit packed.
I promised you I was gonna take you away.
I need you.
And look.
Another pisser.
- Give her to me.
- uh-uh.
Come on.

Time to take care of business.
We gotta go get Garrity.
Oh, man, what's your hurry?
He's still in the stockade.
You got the...
Authorisation papers?
I got them.
Don't go back to sleep.
Pick me up at the corner of Bouchett, get it?
- Got it.

I'm sorry about that.

(Jerry) Slow down!
Stop bitchin'.
- You fixing' to kill us?
- You won't feel a thing.
- You're in the death seat.
- Oh, my God!
I didn't hear you offer to use your car.
My car?
!
You ain't tearing' up my new car, nigger!
No, no.
- Damn, you an unclean motherfucker.
- What?
- You smell like piss.
- Hey, I ain't no slob.
Ain't nobody calling you a slob.
You just a foul-smelling nigger.
How come your old lady don't like me?
You gotta understand that she's a middle-class broad... and you a gross son of a bitch.
- Naturally, she don't like you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on!
(honks horn)
- Hey.
What's your problem, mister?
- Round up the staff, Judge Advocate.
We don't round up nobody around here.
Sure you do.
Court-certified copy of bail bond and authorisation to surrender on a pervert named Garrity.
You Garrity?
- I could check with the major...
- Relax.
Mister, I don't know what the hell you are talking about.
General, this is a warrant for his arrest.
- You two are cops?
- Skip tracers.
He jumped bail, we gotta bring him in.
We got us a couple of Negro bounty hunters here!
- I'll just call the major, check on...
- Just relax.
You gonna bring him out or do we have to go in and get him?
Enlist.
I tell you what, you try us again on Mother's Day.
Then you won't have any trouble gettin' in.
Go play with yourself, redneck!
- What you doin'?
- Shit, I need a new tyre.
- Halt!
- Goddamn it, hit the left rear.
Dave, if only you'd listened.
What was I supposed to do?
Let 'em drive through like they own the place?
You don't let 'em drive through, but if you'd just let me call the major...
We did what we were supposed to do.
We stopped them, didn't we?
This man skipped bail.
I can do whatever is necessary to surrender him to court.
Garrity's a good man.
A man wounded twice in the line of duty.
Of course, he has his problems.
Spends most of his time in the brig.
- You civilians have no understanding...
- I didn't bring no violin.
Have you ever been in combat?
Do you know what kind of hell that is?
No, man.
I'm a faggot.
- You're on a military base, Mr Turner.
- Garrity raped a 1 3-year-old girl.
Snatched off her drawers, ripped her wide open and beat her half to death.
- Mr Turner, these things take time.
- Get the grease out your ass!
- Lighten up, he's a major.
- I don't care if he's a general.
What are you gonna say when the papers print you're harbouring a child molester?
Well, I...
I...
I...
Let Garrity leave the base... in civilian clothing.
Thanks, Major... for the new tyre.
Later.
I knew you had to be stupid to be a skip tracer.
But you tar babies take the cake!
I heard about you, Turner.
From what they told me about you, I expected a two-ton gorilla.
- But you're just another nigger.
- Why don't you shut up?
Why, you shuffle-footed overgrown coon!
Open your mouth one more time and I'm gonna kick your teeth down your throat.
You're a big man while I've got these cuffs on, ain't you?
Come on, that's enough!
Ain't you beat him enough?
Damn, Truck.
Did you have to beat him so bad?
He had it comin'.
Run it down.
What's goin' on here, King?
- How much you get for a rogue like that?
- $50 each and expenses.
- Get one every day for a year and...
- We wouldn't be lollygaggin' with you.
Fix me up with a pass to see Annie.
- Who?
- You know, my big doll!
Sarge, Jesse James is here.
No, Turner.
Truck.
Yeah.
Just a minute.
He says you got two minutes, and leave that cannon here.
Hey, man, you tell him this ain't no cannon.
Dig it?
Hey, look at him!
He can't wait to get some.
Say, man.
Where's that old grouchy broad of yours?
Man, that's my wife.
(woman) Oh, my God!
(excited chatter)
Hey, fine black thing.
(wolf whistles)
Shut up!
Hagglin' bitches.
Truck, what's wrong?
Nothing.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
I'm doin' this time.
I ain't letting' it do me.
That's my girl.
Don't let this bullshit get you down.
- I can't stand it.
- I know.
When I get out, Truck, can you and me go away someplace?
Where do you wanna go?
I don't care.
We've been together a long time and we ain't never been nowhere.
Time's up.
I'll see you tomorrow, OK?
Bye, Truck.
- Know what JD called my old lady?
- What?
A jive-ass broad.
Can you blame him?
One of these days, you gonna break your neck!
Why don't you buy yourself some?
Last time I listened to you, they put penicillin in my ass.
- Everybody gets it once!
- Some twice.
My old lady gets out tomorrow and I can't wait.
You gonna be deep into that for days!
You got that right!
All the way to the bone.
- Why'd she want another television?
- I don't know.
- Was it worth 30 days?
- The judge gave her 30 days, not me.
Everybody says "Go see Nate Dinwiddie.
He'll get your husband out."
Woman, don't jive me.
The bail is $1 ,000.
That makes the bond $100.
If your cheque bounces or your old man splits, I get burned for $1 ,000.
What you mean, "bounce"?
Oh, no.
Not Anna May's cheque.
- You guys back already?
- No.
- What about Garrity?
- Across the street.
Good.
This ain't Safeway.
I'm a bail bondsman.
We don't take no cheques.
- How much cash you got?
- 75.
- Got any credit cards?
- You take food stamps?
Ah!
Get your ass up.
- Ain't that you up there?
- Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Hey, I seen you play.
Truck Mack Turner.
Mack Truck Turner.
You got hurt, didn't you?
It takes talent.
It takes guts to play hurt.
Guts, that's what this game's all about.
- Thank you so much.
- You're all right.
You go on over to the jail.
I'll take care of the rest.
Get up.
- Hey, man, who's the heavy?
- Her husband's in for drunk-driving.
If I had a wife that size, I'd drink too.
Didn't I take care of you already?
Get the hell out of here.
Thanks.
Jerry, he still thinks the women in Tahiti walk around with their tits hangin' out.
That's right.
That's where I'm gonna retire.
Man, Tahiti's just like Miami Beach.
Shit.
I'm still gonna buy me a boat and cruise there.
I wish you two would argue after I get paid.
- Let me write you a cheque.
- A what?
- Fogarty called.
He's got something.
- Whatever he got, I don't want it.
- I'm on vacation.
- Vacation?
His booster gets out today.
That thievin' bitch is gonna be on the streets?
She'll steal your drawers one day and sell 'em.
- Get off my back, Papa Doc.
- Man, he's right!
You oughta send that bitch back to the Dalton gang.
- Why don't she get a job?
- She went that route before.
- She'd rather be a booster.
- I'll straighten her out.
(Jerry) What can you do for her?
Jail didn't do her no good.
- (Nate) He's right.
- What the hell's goin' on here?
We calling' a spade a spade.
No, we callin' her a thief.
The woman digs me and I dig her.
I ain't cutting' her loose.
Ain't nobody asking you to cut her loose.
Just cut the bitch's hands off.
Freeze your shit and get off my case.
You should see Fogarty.
He's talking five bills.
You creepin'.
Get some speed up.
This ain't no tank.
This is my wife's new car.
Let me see what this new rod'll do.
Open up.
I don't wanna get no ticket!
- Streets are clear.
Come on, hit it.
- You ain't ready.
I don't believe it'd do nothing anyway.
This can't outperform a truck.
- Are you ready?
- Are you ready?
Hold on, Truck, cos we movin'!
We go!
Yeah, yeah!
uh-oh.
- What d'you mean?
- (police siren)
- Look what you got me into now, nigger.
- It's your car, not mine.
Good day, Officer.
- This your car?
- The finance company lets me drive it.
- You see that stop sign?
- It was covered by the trees.
- Let me see your licence.
- But, blood...
Damn, this a ugly picture.
- What you laughing at?
- Nothing, Officer.
Laugh this ticket off.
You got a nice rod but you should drive more carefully.
(clerk) I'm sorry, Fogarty.
His bond went forfeit over 24 hours ago.
(Fogarty) Let me have one more day.
- I'm sorry.
- You don't realise what this'll do to me.
- Choose your clients more carefully.
- Where the hell am I... (taps pencil)
Mr Davidson, will you please stop interrupting this court?
I'm sorry, Your Honour.
Hi, Turner, Jerry.
Glad to see you.
I got a real easy one here for you.
Guy's name is Richard Leroy Johnson.
Also known as Gator.
His last known address is a vacant lot.
Bail is $30,000.
He jumped it yesterday.
I don't think anybody else could get him.
Bring him home, you got yourself 250 bucks apiece.
He's got two priors.
So, $800.
$800 for a lousy nigger?
- The guy's just a pimp!
- He's got two priors.
- You said that already.
- One was for pimpin'.
What's the other for, Fogarty?
All right. 400 bucks, Jerry.
What he can't say is assault with intent.
A student Gator tried to pull told him to fuck off.
Gator poured gasoline in her hair and set a match to it.
Girl's father went looking for Gator.
Gator busted his head, and carved his initials in his face.
1 ,000.
- No.
- Bye.
Turner, I ain't giving' you a thousand!
- You can't drive my car.
Don't even ask.
- Let me drive it.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
- Turner!
Wait a second.
- The man has problems.
- 500 apiece.
Be reasonable.
- Who you tryin' to jive?
Gator'll shoot anything that comes after him.
We gotta kick his ass.
OK. 1 ,000.
No.
The more I think about it, no.
Turner, you know this business.
If I lose him, insurance companies kiss me off.
- I need Gator to stay alive.
- No one else will go after him, will they?
No.
- $1 ,000.
- Each.
What?
Turner!
Do you know what it'll cost you if you don't get him?
You ain't got nobody to turn to but us.
So you shit or get off the pot.
Relax, man.
Why don't you go play some golf?
You got two lousy niggers takin' care of the case.
- (Jerry) You better leave that ho alone.
- To get a rooster, you check out the hens.
Oh, check out that big piece of chocolate cake!
(whistling and whooping)
Control yourselves!
- You Dorinda?
- Who wants to know?
Since I'm asking, it must be me.
- (laughter)
- Shut up!
You don't look like cops but you smell like trouble.
Trouble?
Me?
If I was, I wouldn't stand a chance with you, momma.
Tell me somethin'.
Is all that as good as it looks?
What you see ain't all you get, baby.
- This ain't Sears, Roebuck, nigger.
- (laughter)
Where's Gator?
I said where's Gator?
- Gator who?
- I owe him some bread.
You give it to me, and if I see him I'll give it to him.
That's enough.
Total up my bill and let Frenchie pay for it.
Frenchie!
- Sign the bill.
- Yes, momma.
- I told you, Gator ain't here.
- Where is he?
He's in Alaska, hunting' polar bear.
I told you I gotta talk to this nigger.
I'll tell him I saw you, so just take that money and shove it up your ass, you bounty-huntin' son of a bitch.
- Wait a minute.
- You wait a minute.
I hope you do run into Gator so he can cut your goddamn throat.
- You didn't get shit.
- Just follow the bouncing ball, nigger.
(honks horn)
(gunshot)
Stop!
Stop!
Follow that car.
Follow that car!
Move this truck or I'll blow your brains out.
- Follow that car.
- That one right there.
Move it.
You gonna get your picture in the paper.
On the front page?
Oh, man!
- Watch out for the car, Truck.
- I'll only hit the tyre.
- Watch out.
- Don't worry, I got it.
Yeah, but my wife, Truck!
(gunshots)
Any of you guys wanna make some money?
I'll give every man here a $50 bill to stop two punks from coming through that door.
I want blood!
Send them niggers to boot hill!
- Motherfucker, where you been?
- Right here!
Don't no son of a bitch move.
Excedrin headache no. 39, sucker.
- Man, he said you was punks.
- We are.
- So every man drop his pants.
Everybody.
- Come on, you heard him!
If anybody asks, tell 'em you been hit by a truck.
Mack Truck Turner.
What's goin' on here?
Shit.
If I'd known that was Truck Turner, he'd have had to pay me more than $50.
I think we gonna have to waste that pimp.
Yeah.
If he don't kill us first.
What am I gonna do about my car?
It's just a radiator job.
It'll be ready tomorrow.
You're about to meet royalty, Jerry.
I want you to go and mingle with the girls.
I got a little business to talk over.
- Mack Truck Turner, how've you been?
- Fine.
What's goin' on, Duke?
- Meet my partner, Jerry Barnes.
- Pleasure.
- You remember Lucille and Betty?
- Hey!
Still foxes, huh?
- My, you've grown!
- You haven't.
Just increased everywhere.
Just good fertiliser, momma.
- How's Nate?
- Nate's still tryin' to buy a boat.
Bring the gentlemen a drink, Lucille.
- Make mine a beer.
- Bring me another crème de menthe.
- You're lookin' good, Duke.
- I've lived hard, and it shows.
I'm laid up now.
All I do is drink, think of the memories.
Them beautiful memories!
Who is it?
What do you know about a pimp called Gator?
Gator?
Mean mack.
He's a dog among pimps.
I want him real bad.
His days are numbered.
Watch out you don't get caught in the crossfire.
- What do you mean?
- Word is somebody else wants him bad.
- Who?
- Hustler named Harvard Blue.
Been around here about two years or so.
Runnin' himself thin tryin' to start a stable.
Tryin' to run dope.
Gambling.
You name it.
- What's he want Gator for?
- Gator stole Blue's woman from him.
Some big blonde called...
Hey, Betty, what's that Blue's ho's name?
- Stalingrad Crewd.
- Yeah.
Son, there is a pimp civil war brewing'.
- They don't make pimps like they used to.
- Not like you anyway, honey.
- Shut up and get your ass back to work.
- Yes, Daddy.
My faithful lambs.
Where can I find this Gator?
- Maybe the Duke made a mistake.
- The old man don't miss.
Let's just wait.
Let's give it about 1 5 minutes.
- Is that him?
- I told you the old man don't miss.
Hey, man!
Wait a minute!
- Relax, gentlemen.
- We want some answers.
You work this alley regular?
You know everybody living here?
We're doin' a study.
Character comparison by garbage.
- What about apartment 1 309?
- The black pimp.
- What's his trash?
- That's for lawyers' or priests' ears only.
I'm a priest.
- Thousands of empty candy wrappers.
- Dope.
- Where does the druggist live?
- That's privileged information.
This is the last of the money.
Where does that druggist live?
- It's your turn to be the bad guy.
- You do it better than I do.
(man) Who is it?
Gator.
- We don't wanna hurt you.
- I'll kill this rat.
- You work for Gator, don't you?
- No, you got the wrong man.
(hollering)
- (Truck) Where's Gator?
- Look, man, I'm your friend.
- I don't know.
- You just got one chance left now.
Grow wings, superfly.
Wait.
Across 105th.
- What do you think?
- Make sure he's in.
Let's see some finesse.
Kick the door down, go in blasting'.
No, old weasel here can call him for some coke.
- He comes out, we scoop him up.
- Try to take him alive.
- How hard?
- You watch the house, I'll call the cops.
Got it.
You know the game.
You get cute, you're dead.
- What do I tell him?
- Tell him you got some good stuff.
(phone rings)
- Gator, aren't you gonna answer it?
- It's your job.
Answer it, you dumb bitch.
Hello.
- I think it's for you.
- How the hell could it be for me?
Jive-ass broad.
Speak!
What the hell you doin', callin' me here?
You know better than that.
Sorry, man, but...
I got some dynamite stuff here.
- Yeah, but why are you callin' me here?
- I gotta!
understand?
- Is anybody with you?
- Tell him to let you in.
- Let me in!
- I'm gonna slit your throat, you jive-ass sucker!
- How much time have I got?
- Worse than that.
- But what about me?
- What about you?
- Do me a favour.
Call the cops.
- Why do you want the cops?
Aaagh!
- Freeze, pimp!
Freeze!
- Hey, man.
Ain't no need for all this.
I got more money on me than you make in a year.
Take it.
Freeze.
- You hurt?
- Nah, I'm indestructible.
- Hey, man, looks like we get a bonus.
- Yeah.
Bitch.
(Fogarty) He's dead.
- Just give us our money.
- You'll have to take a cheque.
I've been stabbed.
I ain't in no mood for your bullshit!
And add $100 each.
- What for?
- Medical expenses.
I could swear that son of a bitch was gonna blow me back to the Last Supper.
You ain't gettin' any younger, you know.
Am I gonna hear it from her tonight.
- Your old lady, huh?
- Mm.
Tell her a frog peed on your arm.
Sometimes I think we ought to give it up.
(belches)
And do what?
Maybe rob some banks?
- Goddamn.
Annie.
Shit!
- She robs televisions.
Fuckin' around with you will blow my mind.
Pay for the drinks, will you?
But, Truck...
Hey.
- You know my name?
- I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to cash a cheque.
Shit!
You could have brought me some flowers.
I got some beer.
Is Francis all right?
Yeah, Francis is all right.
OK, Annie, get it out.
- You should have been there to meet me.
- I was there...
I spent 30 days in that joint and you visited me five times.
Six.
Now you wanna give me beer and screw me.
All right.
We'll stop and get something to eat first.
- You could tell me you love me.
- I do love you, baby.
Can't you tell?
Yeah, I can smell it on your breath.
# Alone again
# At last again
# Please let love have its way
# Don't let the waiting
# Anticipating
# Be all in vain
# Be good to me
# Cos I'm gonna be
# As good as I can be to you
OK, so I made a mistake.
# Baby, oh, baby
# I need you, I swear I do
# No other woman can love me
# Like you do
# You're the best thing that
# Ever happened to this man
# And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
# Just as long as I can
# I love you
# I love you
Damn, I missed you.
# You're in my arms again
# Where you should have been
# You're in my arms again
# Where you should have been
(bells toll)
Momma, you ain't gonna keep this shit together with Gator gone.
Come here, you little black bitch.
Your ass belongs to me.
I tell you what you can and can't do with it.
- Do you understand?
- I didn't say I was leaving.
Shut up!
Now, you whores sit down.
I wanna talk to you.
Anybody thinking about leaving here's gonna find my left foot up their ass.
- What?
- Shut up, you junkie whore.
Those two bitches that left better learn to sell pussy in Iceland, because if I ever see them again I'll cut their fuckin' throats.
See, we are family.
And that's what we're gonna stay.
I got important business out there today.
When I call you, I want you to come out there and shake your asses proper.
You hear?
Huh?
Get out there and make it look good.
And, Raquel, take that fuckin' jacket off.
Move it!
- Dorinda.
You're lookin' beautiful.
- Hi, Reno.
I know it isn't the time or the place but we must get together and talk about this.
I'll name the time and place.
- I'm sorry about the Gator man.
- Thank you, Snow.
- I know it's hard on you.
- Yeah.
I'm glad you guys could come.
Before you say anything, I got something to clear your head.
- I could sure use it, Snow.
- What do you have here?
- You got something to put in this spoon?
- I'm not called the Snowman for nothing.
You move fast, Snow.
- Hey, Desmond.
- Hey, beauty.
You know I'm gonna offer you a quarter of a million for your stable.
Naturally you get to keep a percentage.
What is this shit?
We didn't come to this dead son of a bitch's house to be comedians.
- What's up?
- You lookin' good, Blue.
The Lord himself couldn't look better.
I'm rich.
I'm cute.
I'm handsome.
- What the hell is on your mind?
- Let's sit down and talk about it.
- I'm already here, bitch.
- It's OK with me.
- (Desmond) That's cool.
- (Reno) What do you want?
A bucket of blood.
I want the nigger that wasted Gator.
Wait a minute.
We in the business of running hos.
Not killing'.
The Gator was a friend of ours.
It would show respect.
(laughter)
Come off it, man.
What kind of money you payin' for a hit like this?
Truck Turner ain't a poopbutt.
It's been nice, but I wasn't even here.
You goddamn rabbits.
What the hell do you think I'm runnin' here?
A chicken coop?
Gentlemen, this is my family.
These are all prime-cut bitches.
$238,000-worth of dynamite.
It's Fort Knox in panties.
Candy did 17,000 last year.
Velvet Miss Sophisticate did 20.
used to be a Paris model.
Jess and Annette each did 22,500.
Show 'em your wares, bitch.
See what you can get if you're good?
That's Turnpike.
She did 26,500.
She's called Turnpike cos you gotta pay to get on and pay to get off.
China, come here, baby.
China did 29.
Sweet piece of oriental meat.
This is Frenchie.
Gator used to call her Boeing 747.
Show 'em why, bitch. (laughs)
She did 27,500.
And that's sweet Annette.
Show 'em that smile, you sweet thing.
She did 30,000 last year.
- Where's my baby?
- Right here.
That's Taffy. (laughs)
This bitch grossed $37,500 working part time.
Shit.
Her clients think she's too good to fuck.
They call her Colonel Sanders cos she's finger-lickin' good.
Oh, momma.
You've got yourself a family!
You've got to believe it, nigger.
All right, ladies, would you mingle?
Now, who's gonna kill that nigger for me?
You just saw $238,000 shake its ass in front of your face.
If you can't respect Gator, then respect that.
I want that bastard Truck Turner and I want him dead.
The man who kills him gets my broads, and I'll run the stable.
- Now talk to me.
- How much, lady?
Half. 50 per cent.
It's done.
I've had my say.
Dorinda, you're trying to piss standing up.
- You are gonna get a lot of people wet.
- I know it.
Cos there ain't a mack here is man enough to ice Truck Turner.
What do you expect?
He's a candy-ass pimp, not a sheriff.
I'm gonna say goodbye to you, because there's many of you here that I will not see again.
Dorinda, you're comin' on so strong, you're gonna need an act of congress or the united States army to get Truck Turner off your ass.
Val...
I'm gonna be a father to some orphans.
- (Annie) What brought this on?
- All I said was "Why don't you get a job?"
- Did I do somethin' wrong?
- Did you do something wrong?
You sound like you tryin' to get rid of me, baby.
- Babe, I'm not tryin' to get rid of you.
- Then what is all this shit about a job?
I'm tired of lookin' you up in jail.
Then why don't you get a job?
- You think you wired up for somebody.
- At least just admit it.
The last job I had I had to drop a fuckin' typewriter on the supervisor's foot.
- He kept puttin' his hands all over me...
- Yeah.
I heard that already.
Excuses.
You can't do shit in jail but look at the four walls and fight off them butches.
How come you dig me so much?
What makes you think I dig you?
Ouch!
- Come here.
- Get away from me, you freak.
Come here!
Hey!
That's him.
- That's Truck Turner, man.
- Look, man, that's him.
You said kill a nigger.
That's Truck Turner.
What's the matter with you?
We got a job to do.
- Look here, man!
- Come on!
Fuck you, man.
- Truck, do you know 'em?
- I told you I don't know who they were.
- Then why were they shooting at us?
- I don't know but I'll find out.
Aagh!
Come on in.
Close the door.
What do you want, man?
Checkin' you out... man.
What was all this shooting' shit outside?
The sky's about to open up on your head.
Better retire.
Take a vacation.
Lay on a beach for about 90 years.
You got ten seconds.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
- Be cool, pussy.
- Eight.
Dorinda's clever.
You gotta hand it to her.
She knows the dude that kills Turner can keep us from picking' her stable clean.
I'll take care of the bitches and Dorinda.
You just run the stable.
I don't wanna end up like Reno.
Desmond, what are you worried about?
We have an insurance company.
For Turner you're gonna need it.
- What's the tab?
- 20,000.
- Ten for you and ten for me.
- You got it.
What do you want for breakfast?
Hm?
What do you think?
Goddamn, Francis.
Where the hell you goin'?
- She's mine, Francis!
- Hello, Francis.
Wait a minute.
Your ass has got to go.
(gasps)
(Snow) You got players' blood runnin'.
- Turner's ass ain't even scratched.
- You ought to be layin' eggs, Snow.
Give it up, momma.
There's a much better way.
- Hey, momma.
Blue, he's here.
- Send him out.
You get back in the house.
- Can't I even say hello?
- Git, bitch.
You gettin' into shit.
You gonna trip and fall.
- When you do I'm not gonna be there.
- That's your choice.
- You comin' or goin'?
- Blue, all you son of a bitches are crazy.
Get the fuck away from me, you son of a bitch.
- I presume you came to talk business.
- Do I have my cock in my hand?
- Who's he?
Your test tube?
- He's searchin' your house.
- Shit, nigger, this ain't the White House.
- You better get it together.
Reno's dead, Toro's gone, so is Fontana.
Snowman just got egg on his shoes.
- Can't you cut the job?
- I came here to get him off your ass.
- My ass is in good shape.
- You ass is into hot water without a boat.
What you gonna do when Turner finds out you turned those guns on him?
You're liable to lose your ass and that string of bitches you got.
What are you gonna do?
Become a man?
You're past 30 and time is runnin' out.
I haven't had to sell my pussy since I was 1 5 and found out I could sell other bitches instead...
Because you had that crocodile nigger working for you!
Now he's getting his mail from the groundhog!
You wanna hear my deal?
What fuckin' deal?
I'll kill Truck Turner for half of Gator's share.
- You outta your goddamn mind.
- At least you can retire with a pension.
Shove your pension, nigger.
All I want is Truck Turner's head.
25 per cent of the take.
If you understand that, then me and you can talk a deal.
- You wait a minute, Blue.
- You heard what I said!
I bought an insurance company and it's at the airport.
Yes or no?
Let's go, Val.
Blue.
OK.
Call the insurance company.
- How's the insurance company?
- People doin' their own killing' nowadays.
A lot of amateurs calling themselves hit men.
Wendell, I want you to meet some friends I went to school with.
This is Panama.
Joe Dante.
AI Reed.
- The Candy Man.
- Some call me that.
How long's this gonna take?
We were late leaving' Detroit.
You gettin' superstitious, Al?
The only thing I believe in is this shotgun in this case.
Look, Harvard.
We got tickets for the doubleheader.
- How much?
- $20,000.
$500.
That's right.
Be here tomorrow morning at eight with $500, and your boy'll be home by nine.
That's right.
All right.
Goodbye.
- What's goin' on here?
- (Blue) We're not gonna waste any time.
We're not gonna repeat ourselves.
- What do you want?
- You're gonna listen and listen well.
- I ain't got no money here.
- These men sell insurance.
And you have a friend whose name is Truck Turner.
His death has just been insured.
Call him so he can collect his premium.
(phone rings)
Don't answer it.
- Hello.
- Truck, it's Nate.
You're drunk.
Go to sleep.
- Please come down.
- Say it's a big job and you're in trouble.
- What?
- A big job.
I'm in trouble.
Man!
I'm loaded, I'm tired, and...
Oh, God, Truck.
They're gonna kill ya!
(whimpers)
Hello?
Nate?
(phone rings)
- Hello?
- (Truck) Jerry, hi.
- What do you want?
- You sleeping?
No, man.
I was playin' poker.
What do you want?
- Nate's got something.
Says he needs me.
- Now?
You drunk son of a bitch.
Nate didn't sound right.
Go see what he wants.
I'll meet you.
- Shit.
- Ijust gotta sober up, man.
(sighs)
All right.
- Life insurance for the dead, my friend.
- This ain't Turner.
- Who the hell is it?
- Another piece of bait.
(groans)
For Christ's sakes, you killed the wrong man.
He called, a man came, we shot him.
Should we have asked for his licence?
No.
Just earn the 20,000 we're giving you.
That's all.
Hey, Al.
What do you say we pay Turner a visit at his house?
It's not gonna be that easy no more.
You been out of the insurance business too long, my friend.
Truck Turner's like a bulldog with eyes up his ass.
- We just cut him loose.
- You should leave town for a while, Blue.
You should get your lily-white hands dirty.
I'll get you the gun.
You get the stable and I'll run it.
That's the deal, not Turner breathing down my neck.
You play the game, you pay the price.
He's following a trail of blood, which is gonna lead right to you.
You bring him here.
Do you hear me?
- What?
- You heard what I said!
Just do it!
- May I help you?
- We've come to see Nate Dinwiddie.
- Sorry, no one sees him without...
- Would you leave us alone, please?
He isn't in this ward.
I'm getting tired of people barging in like you own the place.
Papa Doc?
- That you, Truck?
- Yeah.
Hey, baby, how you doin'?
Annie?
I'm OK, baby.
They got me so doped up, I...
They killed Jerry.
Who was it?
- They after you.
- Who?
I asked 'em what it was all about.
Just kept hittin' me.
Talkin' about insurance.
I didn't wanna call.
Somebody named Blue.
He was there.
- Harvard Blue?
- I didn't wanna call.
It's all right.
Oh, God.
I'm tired.
Hey, some people will do anything for a vacation, won't they?
Yeah.
If you wanna see those tits in Tahiti, you gotta get plenty of rest and get well.
Sleep tight, Papa Doc.
Be careful, boy.
Annie, look after him for me, please?
I will.
There he is, Lieutenant!
Goddamn it!
What the hell is going on?
Come on, I haven't got shit to go on.
- I'll kick your ass!
- (Truck) Hey!
Aw, shit.
I saw your partner.
I've been up all night.
Wait for me in the car...
I said the car.
- I don't wanna wait in the car.
- Go on.
Nate says he doesn't know nothin'.
You tell me.
Who did it?
I don't know.
But when I find out, I'll blow 'em to hell.
If they jump bail, you got 'em.
If not, it's my headache.
- I'm gonna get 'em.
- You got a permit to carry that gun.
Don't do nothin' to lose it, cos the way I figure it, somebody wants your ass.
I know that.
You'd better aim straight.
I'm gonna leave that man on Nate's door.
- Thanks.
- It's routine.
Who did that to Francis?
- Truck, they got Francis.
- There's nothing you can do.
- (Truck) Let's get out of here.
- (Annie) Oh, God.
Truck, they're gonna try to get you next.
- Annie, go to your mother's for a while.
- I ain't goin'.
- Yes, you are.
- I ain't goin' nowhere without you.
Now, look.
They tried to get me through you, and they'll try again.
- Why can't we just leave town, Truck?
- Not until I get 'em all.
- Truck, they gonna kill you.
- They gonna have to do just that.
Cos they owe me... and I'm gonna collect.
Hey.
Let's stop this nonsense.
Let's go shopping.
- I'll buy you a dress.
What size are you?
- Size five.
- Miss, where are your fives?
- Right around there.
- Over here.
Come on.
- You said we were going to town.
- We're goin' away.
- What are you doing?
Come on.
Let's try these on.
- Which way is your dressing room?
- Right over there, sir.
Right over there.
Come on, hurry now.
Mm-mm.
- This is the only one that fits.
- The only one that fits.
- Wear it.
- Truck!
I can't.
It's a night-time dress.
- Why don't I wear what I came in with?
- Baby, wear this one for me.
Take your bag and meet me in the car.
- Who's gonna pay for the dress?
- Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of that.
- Where's the security guard?
- What?
Where's your fuckin' security guard?
Over there.
(inaudible)
Oh, Christ.
Is Desmond in?
I'm a friend of his mother's.
- What's her name?
- Miss Ann.
- You can do better than that.
- Don't be no goddamn problem.
No problem.
Oohh!
If you don't open this gate, you're gonna get the biggest enema of your life.
Open it!
How did you get in here?
- You Desmond?
- That depends.
uh-huh.
None of these bitches are, so I guess that leaves you.
- What do you want?
- Where's Blue, your partner?
I don't have a partner named Blue.
Easy.
That thing cost me a lot.
This ain't my year.
Here's a pimp, a patio full of whores.
I'm the one gettin' fucked.
Nah.
- Where did you say Blue was?
- I have no idea.
(screams)
- Where is he?
- It's only money, man.
If you don't tell me where he is, this bitch is gonna deep-throat this barrel.
- Wait.
- (Truck) Where?
Last house in the hills. 2170 Sierra.
(gunshots)
- Doctor, how is he?
- He keeps asking for you.
- Is he gonna make it?
- I think so.
There's no more internal bleeding but that eye isn't gonna be any use to him.
Medication keeps him pretty drowsy, so don't be surprised if he drifts off on you.
- Doc, does he know?
- About his eye?
Yes.
Papa Doc.
You OK?
Yeah.
Are you all right?
I cancelled that insurance for you.
- What brought the roof down?
- Blue.
He's got a contract on me.
You get him yet?
I got the hit man.
Haven't got him yet, but I will.
Be careful.
He's slick.
He'll do what you least expect.
I hope he does try.
Here.
This was Jerry's.
Put it under your mattress.
- What am I gonna do with this?
- You might need it.
- You son of a bitch, your ass is mine.
- Go for it, cos I'm goin' for mine.
- Go see if the motherfucker's dead.
- I ain't goin' out there.
Son of a bitch, Truck Turner.
You better not show your goddamn face.
You better not do it, you son of a bitch!
Stay where you are.
I dare you to come out and show your fuckin' face!
I've got this kid out here, Turner!
(horn honks)
(girls chatter)
(girl) I'm gettin' the fuck out of here!
You ain't goin' nowhere, you simple-minded black bitch.
I know what all you whores are sayin'.
You can't do nothin' but fuck so you better work out a way to stay in...
All you bitches out of business.
- Pack your shit.
- Get your hands off of me.
Shit!
Your ass is leavin'.
Get the fuck out of here.
I don't understand...
Get outta my closet.
Your shit backfired.
I killed Blue's ass and you'll get the fuck outta here.
Truck Turner, anything you want, you can have it.
Forget them jive motherfuckers.
You and me could do business.
Cut that act, bitch.
Before you get that piece out, your ass is air-conditioned.
You ain't gonna kill no woman.
Oh, shit.
- Hey, you mad?
- What the hell do you think?
What I did, I did it for you.
I didn't want you scattered all over the street.
They were gonna try to get me through you.
Look, woman, cut the goddamn shit and get your ass in the car.
Would you leave me alone?
Babe, I love you.
Look.
I even got all our shit packed.
I promised you I was gonna take you away.
I need you.
And look.
Another pisser.
- Give her to me.
- uh-uh.
Come on.

No, no.
- Damn, you an unclean motherfucker.
- What?
- You smell like piss.
- Hey, I ain't no slob.
Ain't nobody calling you a slob.
You just a foul-smelling nigger.
How come your old lady don't like me?
You gotta understand that she's a middle-class broad... and you a gross son of a bitch.
- Naturally, she don't like you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on!
- Hey.
What's your problem, mister?
- Round up the staff, Judge Advocate.
We don't round up nobody around here.
Sure you do.
Court-certified copy of bail bond and authorisation to surrender on a pervert named Garrity.
You Garrity?
- I could check with the major...
- Relax.
Mister, I don't know what the hell you are talking about.
General, this is a warrant for his arrest.
- You two are cops?
- Skip tracers.
He jumped bail, we gotta bring him in.
We got us a couple of Negro bounty hunters here!
- I'll just call the major, check on...
- Just relax.
You gonna bring him out or do we have to go in and get him?
Enlist.
I tell you what, you try us again on Mother's Day.
Then you won't have any trouble gettin' in.
Go play with yourself, redneck!
- What you doin'?
- Shit, I need a new tyre.
- Halt!
- Goddamn it, hit the left rear.
Dave, if only you'd listened.
What was I supposed to do?
Let 'em drive through like they own the place?
You don't let 'em drive through, but if you'd just let me call the major...
We did what we were supposed to do.
We stopped them, didn't we?
This man skipped bail.
I can do whatever is necessary to surrender him to court.
Garrity's a good man.
A man wounded twice in the line of duty.
Of course, he has his problems.
Spends most of his time in the brig.
- You civilians have no understanding...
- I didn't bring no violin.
Have you ever been in combat?
Do you know what kind of hell that is?
No, man.
I'm a faggot.
- You're on a military base, Mr Turner.
- Garrity raped a 13-year-old girl.
Snatched off her drawers, ripped her wide open and beat her half to death.
- Mr Turner, these things take time.
- Get the grease out your ass!
- Lighten up, he's a major.
- I don't care if he's a general.
What are you gonna say when the papers print you're harbouring a child molester?
Well, I...
I...
I...
Let Garrity leave the base... in civilian clothing.
Thanks, Major... for the new tyre.
Later.
I knew you had to be stupid to be a skip tracer.
But you tar babies take the cake!
I heard about you, Turner.
From what they told me about you, I expected a two-ton gorilla.
- But you're just another nigger.
- Why don't you shut up?
Why, you shuffle-footed overgrown coon!
Open your mouth one more time and I'm gonna kick your teeth down your throat.
You're a big man while I've got these cuffs on, ain't you?
Come on, that's enough!
Ain't you beat him enough?
Damn, Truck.
Did you have to beat him so bad?
He had it comin'.
Run it down.
What's goin' on here, King?
- How much you get for a rogue like that?
- $50 each and expenses.
- Get one every day for a year and...
- We wouldn't be lollygaggin' with you.
Fix me up with a pass to see Annie.
- Who?
- You know, my big doll!
Sarge, Jesse James is here.
No, Turner.
Truck.
Yeah.
Just a minute.
He says you got two minutes, and leave that cannon here.
Hey, man, you tell him this ain't no cannon.
Dig it?
Hey, look at him!
He can't wait to get some.
Say, man.
Where's that old grouchy broad of yours?
Man, that's my wife.
Oh, my God!
Hey, fine black thing.
Shut up!
Hagglin' bitches.
Truck, what's wrong?
Nothing.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I'm doin' this time.
I ain't letting' it do me.
That's my girl.
Don't let this bullshit get you down.
- I can't stand it.
- I know.
When I get out, Truck, can you and me go away someplace?
Where do you wanna go?
I don't care.
We've been together a long time and we ain't never been nowhere.
Time's up.
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Bye, Truck.
- Know what JD called my old lady?
- What?
A jive-ass broad.
Can you blame him?
One of these days, you gonna break your neck!
Why don't you buy yourself some?
Last time I listened to you, they put penicillin in my ass.
- Everybody gets it once!
- Some twice.
My old lady gets out tomorrow and I can't wait.
You gonna be deep into that for days!
You got that right!
All the way to the bone.
- Why'd she want another television?
- I don't know.
- Was it worth 30 days?
- The judge gave her 30 days, not me.
Everybody says "Go see Nate Dinwiddie.
He'll get your husband out."
Woman, don't jive me.
The bail is $1,000.
That makes the bond $100.
If your cheque bounces or your old man splits, I get burned for $1,000.
What you mean, "bounce"?
Oh, no.
Not Anna May's cheque.
- You guys back already?
- No.
- What about Garrity?
- Across the street.
Good.
This ain't Safeway.
I'm a bail bondsman.
We don't take no cheques.
- How much cash you got?
- 75.
- Got any credit cards?
- You take food stamps?
Ah!
Get your ass up.
- Ain't that you up there?
- Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Hey, I seen you play.
Truck Mack Turner.
Mack Truck Turner.
You got hurt, didn't you?
It takes talent.
It takes guts to play hurt.
Guts, that's what this game's all about.
- Thank you so much.
- You're all right.
You go on over to the jail.
I'll take care of the rest.
Get up.
- Hey, man, who's the heavy?
- Her husband's in for drunk-driving.
If I had a wife that size, I'd drink too.
Didn't I take care of you already?
Get the hell out of here.
Thanks.
Jerry, he still thinks the women in Tahiti walk around with their tits hangin' out.
That's right.
That's where I'm gonna retire.
Man, Tahiti's just like Miami Beach.
Shit.
I'm still gonna buy me a boat and cruise there.
I wish you two would argue after I get paid.
- Let me write you a cheque.
- A what?
- Fogarty called.
He's got something.
- Whatever he got, I don't want it.
- I'm on vacation.
- Vacation?
His booster gets out today.
That thievin' bitch is gonna be on the streets?
She'll steal your drawers one day and sell 'em.
- Get off my back, Papa Doc.
- Man, he's right!
You oughta send that bitch back to the Dalton gang.
- Why don't she get a job?
- She went that route before.
- She'd rather be a booster.
- I'll straighten her out.
What can you do for her?
Jail didn't do her no good.
- He's right.
- What the hell's goin' on here?
We calling' a spade a spade.
No, we callin' her a thief.
The woman digs me and I dig her.
I ain't cutting' her loose.
Ain't nobody asking you to cut her loose.
Just cut the bitch's hands off.
Freeze your shit and get off my case.
You should see Fogarty.
He's talking five bills.
You creepin'.
Get some speed up.
This ain't no tank.
This is my wife's new car.
Let me see what this new rod'll do.
Open up.
I don't wanna get no ticket!
- Streets are clear.
Come on, hit it.
- You ain't ready.
I don't believe it'd do nothing anyway.
This can't outperform a truck.
- Are you ready?
- Are you ready?
Hold on, Truck, cos we movin'!
We go!
Yeah, yeah!
- Uh-oh.
- What d'you mean?
- Look what you got me into now, nigger.
- It's your car, not mine.
Good day, Officer.
- This your car?
- The finance company lets me drive it.
- You see that stop sign?
- It was covered by the trees.
- Let me see your licence.
- But, blood...
Damn, this a ugly picture.
- What you laughing at?
- Nothing, Officer.
Laugh this ticket off.
You got a nice rod but you should drive more carefully.
I'm sorry, Fogarty.
His bond went forfeit over 24 hours ago.
Let me have one more day.
- I'm sorry.
- You don't realise what this'll do to me.
- Choose your clients more carefully.
- Where the hell am I...
Mr Davidson, will you please stop interrupting this court?
I'm sorry, Your Honour.
Hi, Turner, Jerry.
Glad to see you.
I got a real easy one here for you.
Guy's name is Richard Leroy Johnson.
Also known as Gator.
His last known address is a vacant lot.
Bail is $30,000.
He jumped it yesterday.
I don't think anybody else could get him.
Bring him home, you got yourself 250 bucks apiece.
He's got two priors.
So, $800.
$800 for a lousy nigger?
- The guy's just a pimp!
- He's got two priors.
- You said that already.
- One was for pimpin'.
What's the other for, Fogarty?
All right. 400 bucks, Jerry.
What he can't say is assault with intent.
A student Gator tried to pull told him to fuck off.
Gator poured gasoline in her hair and set a match to it.
Girl's father went looking for Gator.
Gator busted his head, and carved his initials in his face.
1,000.
- No.
- Bye.
Turner, I ain't giving' you a thousand!
- You can't drive my car.
Don't even ask.
- Let me drive it.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
- Turner!
Wait a second.
- The man has problems.
- 500 apiece.
Be reasonable.
- Who you tryin' to jive?
Gator'll shoot anything that comes after him.
We gotta kick his ass.
Okay. 1,000.
No.
The more I think about it, no.
Turner, you know this business.
If I lose him, insurance companies kiss me off.
- I need Gator to stay alive.
- No one else will go after him, will they?
No.
- $1,000.
- Each.
What?
Turner!
Do you know what it'll cost you if you don't get him?
You ain't got nobody to turn to but us.
So you shit or get off the pot.
Relax, man.
Why don't you go play some golf?
You got two lousy niggers takin' care of the case.
- You better leave that ho alone.
- To get a rooster, you check out the hens.
Oh, check out that big piece of chocolate cake!
Control yourselves!
- You Dorinda?
- Who wants to know?
Since I'm asking, it must be me.
Shut up!
You don't look like cops but you smell like trouble.
Trouble?
Me?
If I was, I wouldn't stand a chance with you, momma.
Tell me somethin'.
Is all that as good as it looks?
What you see ain't all you get, baby.
This ain't Sears, Roebuck, nigger.
Where's Gator?
I said where's Gator?
- Gator who?
- I owe him some bread.
You give it to me, and if I see him I'll give it to him.
That's enough.
Total up my bill and let Frenchie pay for it.
Frenchie!
- Sign the bill.
- Yes, momma.
- I told you, Gator ain't here.
- Where is he?
He's in Alaska, hunting' polar bear.
I told you I gotta talk to this nigger.
I'll tell him I saw you, so just take that money and shove it up your ass, you bounty-huntin' son of a bitch.
- Wait a minute.
- You wait a minute.
I hope you do run into Gator so he can cut your goddamn throat.
- You didn't get shit.
- Just follow the bouncing ball, nigger.
Stop!
Stop!
Follow that car.
Follow that car!
Move this truck or I'll blow your brains out.
- Follow that car.
- That one right there.
Move it.
You gonna get your picture in the paper.
On the front page?
Oh, man!
- Watch out for the car, Truck.
- I'll only hit the tyre.
- Watch out.
- Don't worry, I got it.
Yeah, but my wife, Truck!
Any of you guys wanna make some money?
I'll give every man here a $50 bill to stop two punks from coming through that door.
I want blood!
Send them niggers to boot hill!
- Motherfucker, where you been?
- Right here!
Don't no son of a bitch move.
Excedrin headache no. 39, sucker.
- Man, he said you was punks.
- We are.
- So every man drop his pants.
Everybody.
- Come on, you heard him!
If anybody asks, tell 'em you been hit by a truck.
Mack Truck Turner.
What's goin' on here?
Shit.
If I'd known that was Truck Turner, he'd have had to pay me more than $50.
I think we gonna have to waste that pimp.
Yeah.
If he don't kill us first.
What am I gonna do about my car?
It's just a radiator job.
It'll be ready tomorrow.
You're about to meet royalty, Jerry.
I want you to go and mingle with the girls.
I got a little business to talk over.
- Mack Truck Turner, how've you been?
- Fine.
What's goin' on, Duke?
- Meet my partner, Jerry Barnes.
- Pleasure.
- You remember Lucille and Betty?
- Hey!
Still foxes, huh?
- My, you've grown!
- You haven't.
Just increased everywhere.
Just good fertiliser, momma.
- How's Nate?
- Nate's still tryin' to buy a boat.
Bring the gentlemen a drink, Lucille.
- Make mine a beer.
- Bring me another crème de menthe.
- You're lookin' good, Duke.
- I've lived hard, and it shows.
I'm laid up now.
All I do is drink, think of the memories.
Them beautiful memories!
Who is it?
What do you know about a pimp called Gator?
Gator?
Mean mack.
He's a dog among pimps.
I want him real bad.
His days are numbered.
Watch out you don't get caught in the crossfire.
- What do you mean?
- Word is somebody else wants him bad.
- Who?
- Hustler named Harvard Blue.
Been around here about two years or so.
Runnin' himself thin tryin' to start a stable.
Tryin' to run dope.
Gambling.
You name it.
- What's he want Gator for?
- Gator stole Blue's woman from him.
Some big blonde called...
Hey, Betty, what's that Blue's ho's name?
- Stalingrad Crewd.
- Yeah.
Son, there is a pimp civil war brewing'.
- They don't make pimps like they used to.
- Not like you anyway, honey.
- Shut up and get your ass back to work.
- Yes, Daddy.
My faithful lambs.
Where can I find this Gator?
- Maybe the Duke made a mistake.
- The old man don't miss.
Let's just wait.
Let's give it about 15 minutes.
- Is that him?
- I told you the old man don't miss.
Hey, man!
Wait a minute!
- Relax, gentlemen.
- We want some answers.
You work this alley regular?
You know everybody living here?
We're doin' a study.
Character comparison by garbage.
- What about apartment 1309?
- The black pimp.
- What's his trash?
- That's for lawyers' or priests' ears only.
I'm a priest.
- Thousands of empty candy wrappers.
- Dope.
- Where does the druggist live?
- That's privileged information.
This is the last of the money.
Where does that druggist live?
- It's your turn to be the bad guy.
- You do it better than I do.
Who is it?
Gator.
- We don't wanna hurt you.
- I'll kill this rat.
- You work for Gator, don't you?
- No, you got the wrong man.
- Where's Gator?
- Look, man, I'm your friend.
- I don't know.
- You just got one chance left now.
Grow wings, superfly.
Wait.
Across 105th.
- What do you think?
- Make sure he's in.
Let's see some finesse.
Kick the door down, go in blasting'.
No, old weasel here can call him for some coke.
- He comes out, we scoop him up.
- Try to take him alive.
- How hard?
- You watch the house, I'll call the cops.
Got it.
You know the game.
You get cute, you're dead.
- What do I tell him?
- Tell him you got some good stuff.
- Gator, aren't you gonna answer it?
- It's your job.
Answer it, you dumb bitch.
Hello.
- I think it's for you.
- How the hell could it be for me?
Jive-ass broad.
Speak!
What the hell you doin', callin' me here?
You know better than that.
Sorry, man, but...
I got some dynamite stuff here.
- Yeah, but why are you callin' me here?
- I gotta, man!
Understand?
- Is anybody with you?
- Tell him to let you in.
- Let me in!
- I'm gonna slit your throat, you jive-ass sucker!
- How much time have I got?
- Worse than that.
- But what about me?
- What about you?
- Do me a favour.
Call the cops.
- Why do you want the cops?
- Freeze, pimp!
Freeze!
- Hey, man.
Ain't no need for all this.
I got more money on me than you make in a year.
Take it.
Freeze.
- You hurt?
- Nah, I'm indestructible.
- Hey, man, looks like we get a bonus.
- Yeah.
Bitch.
He's dead.
- Just give us our money.
- You'll have to take a cheque.
I've been stabbed.
I ain't in no mood for your bullshit!
And add $100 each.
- What for?
- Medical expenses.
I could swear that son of a bitch was gonna blow me back to the Last Supper.
You ain't gettin' any younger, you know.
Am I gonna hear it from her tonight.
- Your old lady, huh?
- Mm.
Tell her a frog peed on your arm.
Sometimes I think we ought to give it up.
And do what?
Maybe rob some banks?
- Goddamn.
Annie.
Shit!
- She robs televisions.
Fuckin' around with you will blow my mind.
Pay for the drinks, will you?
But, Truck...
Hey.
- You know my name?
- I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to cash a cheque.
Shit!
You could have brought me some flowers.
I got some beer.
Is Francis all right?
Yeah, Francis is all right.
Okay, Annie, get it out.
- You should have been there to meet me.
- I was there...
I spent 30 days in that joint and you visited me five times.
Six.
Now you wanna give me beer and screw me.
All right.
We'll stop and get something to eat first.
- You could tell me you love me.
- I do love you, baby.
Can't you tell?
Yeah, I can smell it on your breath.
Alone again
At last again
Please let love have its way
Don't let the waiting
Anticipating
Be all in vain
Be good to me
Cos I'm gonna be
As good as I can be to you
Okay, so I made a mistake.
Baby, oh, baby
I need you, I swear I do
No other woman can love me
Like you do
You're the best thing that
Ever happened to this man
And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
Just as long as I can
I love you
I love you
Damn, I missed you.
You're in my arms again
Where you should have been
You're in my arms again
Where you should have been
Momma, you ain't gonna keep this shit together with Gator gone.
Come here, you little black bitch.
Your ass belongs to me.
I tell you what you can and can't do with it.
- Do you understand?
- I didn't say I was leaving.
Shut up!
Now, you whores sit down.
I wanna talk to you.
Anybody thinking about leaving here's gonna find my left foot up their ass.
- What?
- Shut up, you junkie whore.
Those two bitches that left better learn to sell pussy in Iceland, because if I ever see them again I'll cut their fuckin' throats.
See, we are family.
And that's what we're gonna stay.
I got important business out there today.
When I call you, I want you to come out there and shake your asses proper.
You hear?
Huh?
Get out there and make it look good.
And, Raquel, take that fuckin' jacket off.
Move it!
- Dorinda.
You're lookin' beautiful.
- Hi, Reno.
I know it isn't the time or the place but we must get together and talk about this.
I'll name the time and place.
- I'm sorry about the Gator man.
- Thank you, Snow.
- I know it's hard on you.
- Yeah.
I'm glad you guys could come.
Before you say anything, I got something to clear your head.
- I could sure use it, Snow.
- What do you have here?
- You got something to put in this spoon?
- I'm not called the Snowman for nothing.
You move fast, Snow.
- Hey, Desmond.
- Hey, beauty.
You know I'm gonna offer you a quarter of a million for your stable.
Naturally you get to keep a percentage.
What is this shit?
We didn't come to this dead son of a bitch's house to be comedians.
- What's up?
- You lookin' good, Blue.
The Lord himself couldn't look better.
I'm rich.
I'm cute.
I'm handsome.
- What the hell is on your mind?
- Let's sit down and talk about it.
- I'm already here, bitch.
- It's okay with me.
- That's cool.
- What do you want?
A bucket of blood.
I want the nigger that wasted Gator.
Wait a minute.
We in the business of running hos.
Not killing'.
The Gator was a friend of ours.
It would show respect.
Come off it, man.
What kind of money you payin' for a hit like this?
Truck Turner ain't a poopbutt.
It's been nice, but I wasn't even here.
You goddamn rabbits.
What the hell do you think I'm runnin' here?
A chicken coop?
Gentlemen, this is my family.
These are all prime-cut bitches.
$238,000-worth of dynamite.
It's Fort Knox in panties.
Candy did 17,000 last year.
Velvet Miss Sophisticate did 20.
Used to be a Paris model.
Jess and Annette each did 22,500.
Show 'em your wares, bitch.
See what you can get if you're good?
That's Turnpike.
She did 26,500.
She's called Turnpike cos you gotta pay to get on and pay to get off.
China, come here, baby.
China did 29.
Sweet piece of oriental meat.
This is Frenchie.
Gator used to call her Boeing 747.
Show 'em why, bitch.
She did 27,500.
And that's sweet Annette.
Show 'em that smile, you sweet thing.
She did 30,000 last year.
- Where's my baby?
- Right here.
That's Taffy.
This bitch grossed $37,500 working part time.
Shit.
Her clients think she's too good to fuck.
They call her Colonel Sanders cos she's finger-lickin' good.
Oh, momma.
You've got yourself a family!
You've got to believe it, nigger.
All right, ladies, would you mingle?
Now, who's gonna kill that nigger for me?
You just saw $238,000 shake its ass in front of your face.
If you can't respect Gator, then respect that.
I want that bastard Truck Turner and I want him dead.
The man who kills him gets my broads, and I'll run the stable.
- Now talk to me.
- How much, lady?
Half. 50 per cent.
It's done.
I've had my say.
Dorinda, you're trying to piss standing up.
- You are gonna get a lot of people wet.
- I know it.
Cos there ain't a mack here is man enough to ice Truck Turner.
What do you expect?
He's a candy-ass pimp, not a sheriff.
I'm gonna say goodbye to you, because there's many of you here that I will not see again.
Dorinda, you're comin' on so strong, you're gonna need an act of congress or the united States army to get Truck Turner off your ass.
Val...
I'm gonna be a father to some orphans.
- What brought this on?
- All I said was "Why don't you get a job?"
- Did I do somethin' wrong?
- Did you do something wrong?
You sound like you tryin' to get rid of me, baby.
- Babe, I'm not tryin' to get rid of you.
- Then what is all this shit about a job?
I'm tired of lookin' you up in jail.
Then why don't you get a job?
- You think you wired up for somebody.
- At least just admit it.
The last job I had I had to drop a fuckin' typewriter on the supervisor's foot.
- He kept puttin' his hands all over me...
- Yeah.
I heard that already.
Excuses.
You can't do shit in jail but look at the four walls and fight off them butches.
How come you dig me so much?
What makes you think I dig you?
Ouch!
- Come here.
- Get away from me, you freak.
Come here!
Hey!
That's him.
- That's Truck Turner, man.
- Look, man, that's him.
You said kill a nigger.
That's Truck Turner.
What's the matter with you?
We got a job to do.
- Look here, man!
- Come on!
Fuck you, man.
- Truck, do you know 'em?
- I told you I don't know who they were.
- Then why were they shooting at us?
- I don't know but I'll find out.
Aagh!
Come on in.
Close the door.
What do you want, man?
Checkin' you out... man.
What was all this shooting' shit outside?
The sky's about to open up on your head.
Better retire.
Take a vacation.
Lay on a beach for about 90 years.
You got ten seconds.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
- Be cool, pussy.
- Eight.
Dorinda's clever.
You gotta hand it to her.
She knows the dude that kills Turner can keep us from picking' her stable clean.
I'll take care of the bitches and Dorinda.
You just run the stable.
I don't wanna end up like Reno.
Desmond, what are you worried about?
We have an insurance company.
For Turner you're gonna need it.
- What's the tab?
- 20,000.
- Ten for you and ten for me.
- You got it.
What do you want for breakfast?
Hm?
What do you think?
Goddamn, Francis.
Where the hell you goin'?
- She's mine, Francis!
- Hello, Francis.
Wait a minute.
Your ass has got to go.
You got players' blood runnin'.
- Turner's ass ain't even scratched.
- You ought to be layin' eggs, Snow.
Give it up, momma.
There's a much better way.
- Hey, momma.
Blue, he's here.
- Send him out.
You get back in the house.
- Can't I even say hello?
- Git, bitch.
You gettin' into shit.
You gonna trip and fall.
- When you do I'm not gonna be there.
- That's your choice.
- You comin' or goin'?
- Blue, all you son of a bitches are crazy.
Get the fuck away from me, you son of a bitch.
- I presume you came to talk business.
- Do I have my cock in my hand?
- Who's he?
Your test tube?
- He's searchin' your house.
- Shit, nigger, this ain't the White House.
- You better get it together.
Reno's dead, Toro's gone, so is Fontana.
Snowman just got egg on his shoes.
- Can't you cut the job?
- I came here to get him off your ass.
- My ass is in good shape.
- You ass is into hot water without a boat.
What you gonna do when Turner finds out you turned those guns on him?
You're liable to lose your ass and that string of bitches you got.
What are you gonna do?
Become a man?
You're past 30 and time is runnin' out.
I haven't had to sell my pussy since I was 15 and found out I could sell other bitches instead...
Because you had that crocodile nigger working for you!
Now he's getting his mail from the groundhog!
You wanna hear my deal?
What fuckin' deal?
I'll kill Truck Turner for half of Gator's share.
- You outta your goddamn mind.
- At least you can retire with a pension.
Shove your pension, nigger.
All I want is Truck Turner's head.
25 per cent of the take.
If you understand that, then me and you can talk a deal.
- You wait a minute, Blue.
- You heard what I said!
I bought an insurance company and it's at the airport.
Yes or no?
Let's go, Val.
Blue.
Okay.
Call the insurance company.
- How's the insurance company?
- People doin' their own killing' nowadays.
A lot of amateurs calling themselves hit men.
Wendell, I want you to meet some friends I went to school with.
This is Panama.
Joe Dante.
AI Reed.
- The Candy Man.
- Some call me that.
How long's this gonna take?
We were late leaving' Detroit.
You gettin' superstitious, Al?
The only thing I believe in is this shotgun in this case.
Look, Harvard.
We got tickets for the doubleheader.
- How much?
- $20,000.
$500.
That's right.
Be here tomorrow morning at eight with $500, and your boy'll be home by nine.
That's right.
All right.
Goodbye.
- What's goin' on here?
- We're not gonna waste any time.
We're not gonna repeat ourselves.
- What do you want?
- You're gonna listen and listen well.
- I ain't got no money here.
- These men sell insurance.
And you have a friend whose name is Truck Turner.
His death has just been insured.
Call him so he can collect his premium.
Don't answer it.
- Hello.
- Truck, it's Nate.
You're drunk.
Go to sleep.
- Please come down.
- Say it's a big job and you're in trouble.
- What?
- A big job.
I'm in trouble.
Man!
I'm loaded, I'm tired, and...
Oh, God, Truck.
They're gonna kill ya!
Hello?
Nate?
- Hello?
- Jerry, hi.
- What do you want?
- You sleeping?
No, man.
I was playin' poker.
What do you want?
- Nate's got something.
Says he needs me.
- Now?
You drunk son of a bitch.
Nate didn't sound right.
Go see what he wants.
I'll meet you.
- Shit.
- I just gotta sober up, man.
All right.
- Life insurance for the dead, my friend.
- This ain't Turner.
- Who the hell is it?
- Another piece of bait.
For Christ's sakes, you killed the wrong man.
He called, a man came, we shot him.
Should we have asked for his licence?
No.
Just earn the 20,000 we're giving you.
That's all.
Hey, Al.
What do you say we pay Turner a visit at his house?
It's not gonna be that easy no more.
You been out of the insurance business too long, my friend.
Truck Turner's like a bulldog with eyes up his ass.
- We just cut him loose.
- You should leave town for a while, Blue.
You should get your lily-white hands dirty.
I'll get you the gun.
You get the stable and I'll run it.
That's the deal, not Turner breathing down my neck.
You play the game, you pay the price.
He's following a trail of blood, which is gonna lead right to you.
You bring him here.
Do you hear me?
- What?
- You heard what I said!
Just do it!
- May I help you?
- We've come to see Nate Dinwiddie.
- Sorry, no one sees him without...
- Would you leave us alone, please?
He isn't in this ward.
I'm getting tired of people barging in like you own the place.
Papa Doc?
- That you, Truck?
- Yeah.
Hey, baby, how you doin'?
Annie?
I'm okay, baby.
They got me so doped up, I...
They killed Jerry.
Who was it?
- They after you.
- Who?
I asked 'em what it was all about.
Just kept hittin' me.
Talkin' about insurance.
I didn't wanna call.
Somebody named Blue.
He was there.
- Harvard Blue?
- I didn't wanna call.
It's all right.
Oh, God.
I'm tired.
Hey, some people will do anything for a vacation, won't they?
Yeah.
If you wanna see those tits in Tahiti, you gotta get plenty of rest and get well.
Sleep tight, Papa Doc.
Be careful, boy.
Annie, look after him for me, please?
I will.
There he is, Lieutenant!
Goddamn it!
What the hell is going on?
Come on, I haven't got shit to go on.
- I'll kick your ass!
- Hey!
Aw, shit.
I saw your partner.
I've been up all night.
Wait for me in the car...
I said the car.
- I don't wanna wait in the car.
- Go on.
Nate says he doesn't know nothin'.
You tell me.
Who did it?
I don't know.
But when I find out, I'll blow 'em to hell.
If they jump bail, you got 'em.
If not, it's my headache.
- I'm gonna get 'em.
- You got a permit to carry that gun.
Don't do nothin' to lose it, cos the way I figure it, somebody wants your ass.
I know that.
You'd better aim straight.
I'm gonna leave that man on Nate's door.
- Thanks.
- It's routine.
Who did that to Francis?
- Truck, they got Francis.
- There's nothing you can do.
- Let's get out of here.
- Oh, God.
Truck, they're gonna try to get you next.
- Annie, go to your mother's for a while.
- I ain't goin'.
- Yes, you are.
- I ain't goin' nowhere without you.
Now, look.
They tried to get me through you, and they'll try again.
- Why can't we just leave town, Truck?
- Not until I get 'em all.
- Truck, they gonna kill you.
- They gonna have to do just that.
Cos they owe me...
and I'm gonna collect.
Hey.
Let's stop this nonsense.
Let's go shopping.
- I'll buy you a dress.
What size are you?
- Size five.
- Miss, where are your fives?
- Right around there.
- Over here.
Come on.
- You said we were going to town.
- We're goin' away.
- What are you doing?
Come on.
Let's try these on.
- Which way is your dressing room?
- Right over there, sir.
Right over there.
Come on, hurry now.
Mm-mm.
- This is the only one that fits.
- The only one that fits.
- Wear it.
- Truck!
I can't.
It's a night-time dress.
- Why don't I wear what I came in with?
- Baby, wear this one for me.
Take your bag and meet me in the car.
- Who's gonna pay for the dress?
- Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of that.
- Where's the security guard?
- What?
Where's your fuckin' security guard?
Over there.
Oh, Christ.
Is Desmond in?
I'm a friend of his mother's.
- What's her name?
- Miss Ann.
- You can do better than that.
- Don't be no goddamn problem.
No problem.
Oohh!
If you don't open this gate, you're gonna get the biggest enema of your life.
Open it!
How did you get in here?
- You Desmond?
- That depends.
Uh-huh.
None of these bitches are, so I guess that leaves you.
- What do you want?
- Where's Blue, your partner?
I don't have a partner named Blue.
Easy.
That thing cost me a lot.
This ain't my year.
Here's a pimp, a patio full of whores.
I'm the one gettin' fucked.
Nah.
- Where did you say Blue was?
- I have no idea.
- Where is he?
- It's only money, man.
If you don't tell me where he is, this bitch is gonna deep-throat this barrel.
- Wait.
- Where?
Last house in the hills. 2170 Sierra.
- Doctor, how is he?
- He keeps asking for you.
- Is he gonna make it?
- I think so.
There's no more internal bleeding but that eye isn't gonna be any use to him.
Medication keeps him pretty drowsy, so don't be surprised if he drifts off on you.
- Doc, does he know?
- About his eye?
Yes.
Papa Doc.
You okay?
Yeah.
Are you all right?
I cancelled that insurance for you.
- What brought the roof down?
- Blue.
He's got a contract on me.
You get him yet?
I got the hit man.
Haven't got him yet, but I will.
Be careful.
He's slick.
He'll do what you least expect.
I hope he does try.
Here.
This was Jerry's.
Put it under your mattress.
- What am I gonna do with this?
- You might need it.
- You son of a bitch, your ass is mine.
- Go for it, cos I'm goin' for mine.
- Go see if the motherfucker's dead.
- I ain't goin' out there.
Son of a bitch, Truck Turner.
You better not show your goddamn face.
You better not do it, you son of a bitch!
Stay where you are.
I dare you to come out and show your fuckin' face!
I've got this kid out here, Turner!
I'm gettin' the fuck out of here!
You ain't goin' nowhere, you simple-minded black bitch.
I know what all you whores are sayin'.
You can't do nothin' but fuck so you better work out a way to stay in...
All you bitches out of business.
- Pack your shit.
- Get your hands off of me.
Shit!
Your ass is leavin'.
Get the fuck out of here.
I don't understand...
Get outta my closet.
Your shit backfired.
I killed Blue's ass and you'll get the fuck outta here.
Truck Turner, anything you want, you can have it.
Forget them jive motherfuckers.
You and me could do business.
Cut that act, bitch.
Before you get that piece out, your ass is air-conditioned.
You ain't gonna kill no woman.
Oh, shit.
- Hey, you mad?
- What the hell do you think?
What I did, I did it for you.
I didn't want you scattered all over the street.
They were gonna try to get me through you.
Look, woman, cut the goddamn shit and get your ass in the car.
Would you leave me alone?
Babe, I love you.
Look.
I even got all our shit packed.
I promised you I was gonna take you away.
I need you.
And look.
Another pisser.
- Give her to me.
- Uh-uh.
Come on.

Julie Clayton
Who is in the wooden men alley?
Fang Shih Yu
Who is on duty today?
Uncle Chen Si Di
Fang Shih Yu
Still a naive apprentice and yet you stormed the alley
Do you know what would happen to you?
Yes, if I can't get out
I'll have to start again from the beginning
More haste less speed, I suggest you go back
I am determined to go
Do you know why this alley is called the wooden men alley?
Yes, although our own brothers are on duty in the alley they'll not spare anyone when fighting their hearts are like wood and stone;
hence the name
Who is to blame if anyone dies or gets injured?
I have only myself to blame
Alright
Chen Guang
Yes
Be careful
Uncle
You can leave
Thank you
Uncle
Fang Shih Yu, hurry and go
"Da Mo Hall"
Abbot, Fang Shih Yu has stormed the wooden men alley with a knife and killed Chen Guang
Please look into this
Are you Feng Dao De?
Yes
Fang Shih Yu would not do such a thing
Abbot Zhi Shan, don't you trust us?
Brother, we should go let's return to Wu Dang
We were originally from Wu Dang School we haven't learnt much at Shaolin Temple
Let's go...
Brother Feng, you are doing right
Brother White Brow
You know what happened?
Zhi Shan suspects us we can't stay at Shaolin anymore
We'll fight with Shaolin one day
I'll deal with Zhi Shan
You have to watch out for Fang Shih Yu
Yes
Fang Shih Yu's mother bathed him with tonic wine since he was small that makes him sort of invincible
Just now though he is cut by Brother Wu's sword
I'm afraid he wouldn't be hurt
When you meet him in the future in any fight you must lure him tojump and stab him upward while he's still in air
This is the only way to pierce into his body
Remember this
I understand
Let's go
What are you doing?
What do you want?
Your uncle owed Master Lei money and has offered you as collateral for the loan
Are you off your rocker?
You don't even recognise me?
Fang Shih Yu
He Da Yong
You can't just dismiss it with a kick
Pick up the flowers from the floor
You have to stay in Shaolin for at least 3 years
How come you can get out so quickly?
By my true and tried skills
Go
Is Lei still such an outlaw?
I don't think no one is able to put a stop to him
Not really
When Lei Lao Hu knew that you went to Shaolin he started practising the Pile formation
Two people who fought him died under the formation
Pile formation?
That's right beneath these poles are sharp pointed bamboo
Once you fall...
I buried one of the hero myself
He died amidst the pile formation
Pile formation?
If you haven't practised before you'd better leave as soon as possible
Then I won't forcibly get out of wooden men alley
The pile formation couldn't stop me
You haven't practised on the piles before and in a fight with Lei Lao Hu you'll be at a disadvantage
No need to be rash, stay at my home for the night
I'll set up the formation for you
Practise it at least a few days before you go to him
Fang Shih Yu is back
Why hasn't he come to me?
He's with He Da Yong they are talking about something
The men of Lei Lao Hu...
"Jin Lun School"
Make way...
May God bless me with good luck
Winner takes all
Here, go on with the bet
Boss Hu, we're in bad luck today
Can you lend us some money?
What?
Are you kidding?
If you need money, there's a pawn shop up the road
Hu Yiu Ding, don't you know us?
You don't even give us a little face
Who are you?
Aren't you the instructors of the Jin Lun School?
Even if you're a king, no mercy is shown here
Hu Yiu Ding, you dare say that again
Don't bet if you can't afford to lose
People are afraid of your Jin Lun School, but I am not
You...
Stop fighting...
Please stop
Gentlemen, we haven't offended you
Please stop fighting...
None of your business
Someone's been killed
Get away
Quiet
Hu Huei Chien, listen
Head injuries caused your father's death
The scar is over 2 inches long
Lost at gambling killed himself by banging his head
Nonsense, he's bruised all over would that be due to banging against a wall as well?
You may take back his corpse for funeral arrangements
Don't cause more problems
Hu Huei Chien, what are you doing?
You want to defend Jin Lun School
I'll settle the score with them myself
Instructor, someone's causing trouble at our factory
Who is it?
Hu Huei Chien
Who is this kid?
Hu Huei Chien, son of Hu Yiu Ding
You...
The factory under Jin Lun School employs over 10,000 workers
With expert kung fu instructors from Wu Dang school even the officials are scared of them
Guess we better not mess with them
We...
Get lost, all of you
I have to do that
You did that once and look what happened to you
I still want to go, as long as I live
I'm going now
He's here again
Hu Huei Chien, you escaped last time you want to test your luck again?
If you don't cause trouble again you might be spared
Rubbish!
Throw him into the river
Let's go
You still want to go?
Yes
You know you are no match for them and still want to go, why?
Fight them even risking my life
How much?
Not for sale
Then why have you put it here?
The people of Jin Lun School are outlaws no one in Guangzhou dares to mess with them except you
You are a hero and I don't want you to die
If it's not for sale, I'll take it by force
Have some tea
Inside please...
There's a fight upstairs
People fighting?
Hu Huei Chien is really a hero
Only he dares to take on the outlaws of Jin Lun School
What a pity he is no match for them though!
I think he'll die this time
Go quickly
I saved you, why do you hit me?
I was risking my life, how dare you interfere?
I don't think you were risking your life you were in fact giving up your life
Who are you?
Fang Shih Yu
You are the one who killed
Lei Lao Hu on the pile formation?
I have heard about you
If it's revenge you seek, I can help you
No, I'll do it myself
You are not ready yet you have to train hard at Shaolin Temple
I fear you might not be able to bear the hardship
If you can, so can I
Let's go
Sir, you haven't paid yet
"Shaolin Temple"
Kneel down...
Damn it, kneel
You are open for business
How dare you refuse the patronage of people from our factory?
You never pay
Anyone else not convinced yet?
Bow to apologise quickly or you'll give up your lives in vain
"Jin Lun School"
Bow
Stop
Recognise me?
Hu Huei Chien, you dare to return
What do you want?
Beat you
Heave and Earth
Place your bet...
Where have I seen you before?
Take your time
This gentleman looks familiar
Don't you remember?
Eight for the head and nine for the tail
Got it
He is the kid who helped
Hu Huei Chien 3 years ago
Instructor Lu, you have a good memory
What do you want?
Not much
I'll gamble with you two here so that Hu Huei Chien has time to tear apart your factory
Damn kid
Stop, your men are here
I think Hu Huei Chien would have almost finished his work
Instructor...
Hu Huei Chien has crushed our factory Jin Lun School
Sorry, see you in a while
Don't think of escaping
This is a waste of time you'd better go to look for Hu Huei Chien now
We are a small business, if they come...
Don't worry, I have destroyed their 7 factories and now await Niu Hua Jiao and Lu Ying Bu here
Once they appear
I'll drive them out
Whatever the damages, I'll pay for it all
Hero Hu, if you drive out these two
You would have done Guangzhou a huge favour
You have to be careful too
If Hu Huei Chien cannot defeat them and your words are heard by them your restaurant would be torn down
Tell the factory foremen to wait for me at Jin Lun School
Okay
He's here...
let's go
Niu Hua Jiao, Lu Ying Bu time to settle our score
You owe us one life
Great
Good going
Great...
Everybody's here
Listen to me
Niu Hua Jiao, Lu Ying Bu and a group of people have broken the law and caused much oppression they have got what they deserve
Here's the order from now on, don't ever do immoral deeds
Hu Huei Chien
You shouldn't have crushed the school's plaque
Because of Niu Hua Jiao
The name of Jin Lun School stinks
Crushing this old plaque will do you good
Do you know what other people think about you?
If people from the factory break the law again
I'll beat them up every time I see them
Not only have the two of them killed my father they are students of Wu Dang School
From Feng Dao De of Wu Dang School conspired with the Qings, oppressed and killed people
I can't let them off so easily
Cui Ping, let's go
Do you really have to go?
I must
I am a Shaolin disciple and have a lot of things to do
I'll go look for Fang Shih Yu first, then Hung Hsi Kuan the government is looking around to arrest him so I must find him
"Li Chun Brothel"
Public notices with your picture have been posted everywhere for your arrest
You still dare to run around?
I don't understand what you are thinking
It doesn't really matter who's going to be the Emperor
It does
Alright, never mind please lower your voice
Hung Ying, come out...
Guys from CommanderinChief's office are here again
Wonder who's going to be in bad luck!
Hung Ying, someone's calling you
Hung Ying, aren't you going to come out?
Hung Ying, someone's here
How conceited!
Do you know where we are from?
From the CommanderinChief's office
So you know
I've also seen people from Governor's office
May I know your name please?
When Commander Gao is here, I really need to ask him
It's just passing anger, nothing much
We'll pay for the things we broke
You're too kind
What's the matter?
I am Hung Hsi Kuan, the one who kills Qing people
Master Lei...
Have you arrested any suspect?
Got one, couldn't stand the beating he died being branded by a hot iron
Master Lei
I don't think Hung Hsi Kuan has the guts to hide in the city
Chase
I said he's come to the city, but you don't believe me
Change the notice tomorrow and raise the reward
Will go tonight
Yes
Hung
Liu residence in the west of the city
Not enough soup
How much more?
3 catties
Everyone, the Qing court are hard on our trail we've got to be very careful
Brother Hung, since you've been in the city you've killed a lot of Qing guys
They are now extremely frightened and the people rejoice in this
How much could one man do not much even with the people around here
We ought to seek allies with heroes everywhere
Spread the news until the Ming dynasty can be restored
Before I came to the city I met Hu Huei Chien
There'll be more guys from Shaolin in the next few days we shouldn't stay here long
Tomorrow we'll leave separately
Be careful
Yes
"Wine"
"Wanted:
Hung Hsi Kuan"
Who are you?
I never change my name
Tong Qian Jin, disciple of Shaolin
Arrest him
Hurry and go
Chase
Stop chasing
They must be here for Hung Hsi Kuan we can only follow them secretly in order to find Hung Hsi Kuan
I've told you to stay off trouble, but you don't listen
Hey
If everyone from Shaolin were like you staying away from the Qing, you can do nothing
I don't think you can accomplish anything great
Wait until we see Brother Hung
Because of you, I wonder if I could meet brother Hung at the agreed time
Brother Hung
Brother Tong, Brother Nian should be here today
Yes, I'll go to meet them
You...
I can't hide up just because there are warrants against me
Brother Hung
Brother Hung...
Nian Rui Qing
You fought your way out of the wooden men alley
Actually I crawled out of it
Hung Hsi Kuan, you can't run away
You brought 56 men with you and you are the only one who has come back
Why have you come back?
Men
Yes
Mobilize the troops of the whole province and invite the experts of Wu Dang and Er Mei here
I must burn down the whole of Shaolin Temple
Gao Jin Zhong, Feng Dao De burnt down Shaolin Temple
As long as I live we have to fight hard
That's right
Let's go separate ways for the time being
Brother Feng will go back to Shiu Hing and set up a base there at Qing Yun Temple
The Qing dogs are hard on our trail some can hide at the red boat
Ding Fok of the theatre troupe will do the liaison
It's quite unexpected that we actors are becoming more and more popular
Once the villages hear of our coming people gather around us
I think you can change your profession
Wait
How come there's no one on the boat?
Yes, we stayed behind to pack things up
Others should have come back
Arrest them
Hurry and go
Don't kill him
How many are there in the red boat?
Any disciples from Shaolin?
Altogether there are 26 8 of them are from Shaolin
Ding Fu is the leader we've captured him alive
The others have all been executed on the spot
A girl managed to escape
A girl?
Who's she?
Li Cui Ping, a good friend of Hu Huei Chien
She escaped along the river
I've sent the Li brothers to follow her
Good, bring Ding Fu here
Yes
Why don't you kneel?
Ding Fu, are you a disciple of Shaolin?
Yes
I burnt down Shaolin
Many Shaolin disciples died only a few left, I suppose they won't live long either
Shaolin men might die but Hans will live on
Ding Fu, do you know what's the bounty for?
Fang Shih Yu, Hu Huei Chien and Hung Hsi Kuan?
Yes, if they are caught because of an informant there'll be a reward of a few thousand taels of silver
Ding Fu with so much, you your descendents can lead good life
Save them for your own grave
Bring the burning basin
Hung Hsi Kuan, Fang Shih Yu, Hu Huei Chien
Where are they hiding?
Speak
Okay
They are among the commoners
Go
Please stay
Who are you?
We never change our names
Disciples from Shaolin...
It's not safe here
The Qing dogs will return
Hurry and go to the town ahead
Who are you?
Li Cui Ping
Hu Huei Chien?
He's my friend
Haven't seen him for a long time
Gao Jin Zhong and his troops burnt down Shaolin Temple
People there are all gone
Don't know where they are!
Go
Master Lei, the Li brothers are with Li Cui Ping
She treat them as one of his own
Good, ask them to follow her
Don't frighten them away before seeing Hung Hsi Kuan
Yes
Miss Li, we've been at this alley before
Yes, I'm afraid someone might be following us so I am going around in circles
Miss Li, we've been walking for 2 days when are we going to see Brother Hu?
That's right, you're just leading us around
Be patient, you'll see them before it gets dark
Let's go
Okay
Hurry and go
"Meet Hung Hsi Kuan before dark"
Master
News from Li brothers
Before it gets dark today you can see Hung Hsi Kuan and the others
Let's hurry and go
No one's here
When I call out, you'll see.
Brother Hung
CommanderinChief of Guangdong
Li Da Wan, Li Er Wan wants to see you
Kill them
These two guys left marks on the way
Gao Jin Zhong will follow
Be careful, don't get close to that graveyard
You've sent out news yesterday
We are fully prepared
Once Gao Jin Zhong comes he'll be dead
Ding Fuk died a cruel death a few guys should keep him company
Where are you hiding?
I don't really know
You won't even know that we hid in the deserted Qing Yun Temple
It's all the sharp pointed bamboo
"Qing Yun Temple"
Brother
Let's set off
I know where the remaining Shaolins are hiding
Where are they?
Let's go, talk about it on the way
Uncle, please
Put on casual wear
Yes
Master Gao guessed right
If they could kill people near the cemetery they must be hiding somewhere near
Just now I came across 2 Shaolin pupils buying two to three hundred catties of rice
There must be at least over ten people there
Lei Da Pang, hurry and mobilize your men
Yes
Brother Tong, you've come back
Have you been followed?
No, but there were a few Qing dogs on the road
They passed by without even looking at us though
It's too quiet out there
I feel like something is going to happen
This Qing Yun Temple has been deserted for many years
Only locals know about this place
No one else will know
Brother Chen, Brother Zhi go and see if there's any movement outside
Yes
Brother Chen, hurry and report to Brother Hung
You...
Never mind about me
Brother Chen...
Brother Chen...
Brother Chen
Brother Hung
Feng Dao De and Gao Jin Zhong and their men have surrounded this area
Where's Brother Zhi?
He and I were both shot at and he's fighting with the enemies in the front
Alright, Shaolin Temple has been burnt down
Teacher Zhi Shan was killed by that rascal White Brows
Today is the day when we all disciples from Shaolin fall as martyrs
Brother Hung, let's go out and fight and kill as many as we can hoping that at least some of us can survive the fight and continue Shaolin's legacy
If unfortunately we all die our Shaolin chivalry and honour shall be immortalised
Brother Hung, don't worry even though there's seniority among us Shaolin students even the most junior ones are not afraid of death
Good
Brothers, go
Today is the day to die for a cause
Brother Chen, you...
I can't go with you
Hung Hsi Kuan, you've nowhere to go
Surrender and save your own lives
Why don't you ask my brothers?
Fang Shih Yu, Nian Rui Qing, Tong Qian Jin
Hu Huei Chien, Li Cui Ping the junior kung fu experts of Shaolin are all here
By the power of us you Qing dogs don't even think of leaving here alive
We Shaolins have sworn to fight till death
Save your breath
Good, you persist till death
Attack
Spread out and fight your way ahead
Try your best
Once I clap my hands, you pass me the sword
Yes
Brother... you...
Relax, help me bandage it
I don't intend to get out of here alive as long as I can kill more Qing scoundrels
Cui Ping
I'll wait for you ahead
Brother Feng
Brother, how can this rascal be regarded as our uncle
This is a treacherous move to ambush one's enemy
The sword is totally stabbed into my belly
I have to go first
- Sorry.
- How dare you?
That's so rude!
He didn't do it on purpose.
I said I was sorry.
She's not normal.
She's a hick, a Southerner.
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait.
Can't you see she's crying?
Listen, he said he was sorry.
Do you want him to get on his knees?
It's not you.
My cousin lsotta Carmela was supposed to pick me up here.
My cousin lsotta Carmela was supposed to pick me up right here.
If she doesn't show up, what am I going to do?
Poor me!
Calm down.
Don't get upset.
We'll help you find her.
She's probably waiting here somewhere.
Carmela!
- Miss Carmela!
- lsotta.
Her name is Carmela, but we all call her lsotta.
- Why?
-just because.
- I liked Carmela better.
- So did I.
Isotta!
Miss lsotta!
If you're here, answer us!
Miss lsotta, please, where are you?
Isotta!
Miss lsotta!
Is there anyone named lsotta here?
Please, lsotta!
- Is there an lsotta here?
- Are you looking for me?
- lsotta!
- Adelina!
Isottina!
- Is that really you?
- Don't you recognize me?
- I thought you were a man.
- Come on!
- Really!
- What are you saying?
Isottina, how you've changed!
You look just like a lady:
- Actually, like a gentleman.
- Taxi!
ALL SCREWED UP
- Wow.
Who are they?
- Rich people.
Watch out!
Are you crazy?
- You crashed right into us!
- Perfect aim, right?
You were hoping to avoid the Terror of the Metropolis, but I caught you both.
I'll knock your teeth out!
- Terror of the Metropolis, my ass!
- Come on.
You're hilarious.
Come on!
- You think you're funny?
- Okay, I'm sorry!
I'll pay for the damages.
- It was my fault.
- Of course, it was your fault.
You crashed right into us.
We got hurt.
Everyone saw it!
- Come on, damn it!
- That guy saw it too.
You, with the bicycle, excuse me.
You saw it, right?
That guy just ran us over.
- You're our witness, right?
- Witness?
I didn't see anything.
- What do you mean?
- Excuse me.
- Why?
Come back.
- Don't be mean.
Leave him alone.
Can't you see he's completely stoned on love?
Besides, you don't need him.
I acknowledge my guilt.
You want me to pay for the damages?
I'll give you my scooter.
- There's no need to go overboard.
- I'm not going overboard.
- You shouldn't trouble yourself.
- It's no trouble at all.
It was my fault, so here.
Take it.
Besides, that's just who I am.
I'm happy to give you the scooter.
- You're being a little too kind.
- Don't be silly.
You should pay for your mistakes.
It was my fault, so I'll pay.
Who cares?
Just take the scooter.
This scooter is worth at least 100,000 lire.
Just so I don't lose too much money, slip me 20,000 if you have it.
- Are you joking?
- Of course not.
Then we'll be even.
- It's this year's model.
- That's great.
There's half a tank of gas already.
It's only fair.
If you break it, you pay.
I paid, and good luck to you.
- You're too kind, really.
- You're really fantastic.
- But what will you do now?
- I'll take the tram.
- Wait.
We'll drive you.
- No, really.
- We feel bad.
- You shouldn't feel bad.
The scooter's not mine anyway.
I stole it!
- No, get off the tram.
- Unbelievable.
- Quick, get on.
- Hold on.
Hurry, he's getting away!
This thing is too slow!
Serves you right, dumbasses!
- Get off the tram!
- Slow down.
Watch out for the cars.
Careful.
Watch out.
Screw you!
You swindler!
If I catch you, I'll cut you to shreds!
Dream on!
Thief!
That bastard!
If I'd caught him, I'm telling you, I might've killed him.
- Forget it.
Let's take it to the police.
- No way!
I'm not going to look like a fool.
No way I'm taking it to the police.
I'm keeping the scooter, even if it's stolen.
- Gigi, are you crazy?
- I don't care.
You may not care, but I do.
It's stolen, and that's that.
What does it matter?
Besides, there's no license plate.
- Come on.
Get on.
- No way.
I won't ride on that.
- Get on.
- No.
- Don't be stupid.
- No.
See you Friday.
- Bye, Anna Rosa.
- Bye, Biki.
Living large, eh?
- What is it?
You having trouble?
- I don't have much experience.
Look. it's easy.
Push this thing in, turn the knob, open the door, put the laundry in here.
You close it like this.
Good.
Put the token in here, and start it.
- It's nothing.
- Thank you, ma'am.
Don't mention it.
Did the Biraghis send you?
Wait, I get it.
You're lsotta's cousin, the girl from Sicily.
- You know my cousin?
- Sure, she was with me for two years.
- She was your maid?
- My maid?
We were both maids.
We shared a room.
I feel so silly.
You look like a real lady.
And why not?
Ours is a privileged line of work.
In one year, with no expenses, you can save up to 1.5 million lire.
Plus, we live in style.
A television, modern appliances.
- Where does lsotta work?
- I don't know.
For rich people.
Hungry, hungry-
What are you two doing here?
I'm talking to you.
Move along.
First of all, use this familiar tone only with your sister, please.
- Have I made myself clear?
- Okay.
- But you're bothering the clientele.
- We are bothering them?
We, who are starving to death, are disturbing them?
We're bothering you?
It's you who are bothering us with all this stuff in the window.
It makes me so hungry.
Do you believe this guy?
We're bothering him.
Now I'll lie down and die of starvation, and then we'll see if I'm bothering you.
Oh, go to hell!
Hungry, hungry-
I never would have thought there'd be so many cows in Milan.
Here we'll get bellyfuls of meat.
- We'll all be stuffed.
- We'll end up getting gout.
I told you, everyone's rich here.
Everyone except us, damn it.
- Stop working!
- Are you talking to us?
What are we supposed to do?
- Let's go.
We're marching.
- If there's a march, let's march.
- Let's go.
- Stop working!
We're on strike!
OSVA WANTS TO BUILD THIS ACROSS THE STREET.
WE SAY NO!
CITIZENS, DO WE WANT TO BE MICE FOREVER?
DOWN WITH SMOG
HURRAH FOR NATURE
LET'S CHASE THE LANDLORDS INTO THE BASEMENTS
FAILED FACTORY
THE REVOLUTION DOES ITS WORK METHODICALLY
- K. MARX
WHAT TIMES WE LIVE IN, THAT WE HAVE TIME TO PAINT
Comrades, let's all join together.
Green equals life!
Hurrah for green!
Agnelli is a bastard!
- What does Agnelli have to do with it?
- Nothing.
But Agnelli's always a bastard.
Listen.
We don't have a lot of experience.
It's our first day of work.
We're country folk.
- Where are we going?
- To City Hall.
This time we're going to occupy it, and no one is going to kick us out!
- I like fistfights.
I do it for fun.
- Carletto, things could get rough.
Look at that.
Wanna bet we're the ones who end up in jail?
The police are bastards!
- The police are bastards!
- What are they doing?
Hey, is that a bomb?
- These guys are beating us!
- We have nothing to do with this.
- We have nothing to do with this!
- Damn it!
- We have nothing to do with this!
- Hey, you're going to poke my eye out!
- I told you we'd end up in jail.
- We didn't do anything.
- We're innocent, you know?
- We're all innocent here.
Look at these two.
It's like they're fresh out of a hen's ass!
- They're going to put us in jail.
- Don't bust our balls.
- We'll all be out in half an hour.
- You mean they'll let us go?
Of course.
Give me a cigarette.
Sure they will.
If they kept all the protesters in Italy in prison, can you imagine?
They'd have to put a fence up around the entire peninsula.
- You're sure they'll let us go?
- Of course.
You bet!
I really don't want to be locked up tomorrow.
- This guy and I have dates.
- Let's hope so!
We'll see the boss together.
- What does mine look like?
- I don't know.
We haven't met her.
- Where are the girls?
- Let's just hope for the best.
There they are.
Carletto!
Carletto, come on!
- Where shall we go?
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's pick something. it's getting late.
- Let's go see The Decameron.
- They say it's good.
- I've heard it's pornographic.
Isn't he the guy from the other day?
The Southern hick with the bicycle.
- Hey, Fidel Castro.
- Is that your girlfriend?
- Who are you?
- We met two days ago.
Don't you remember the accident?
You were staring at that girl.
- Hello, miss!
- Don't clown around.
These things are delicate and extremely private.
It's not funny, please.
With that long face, you'll make her sad.
- Girls want to have fun.
- Listen to me.
Take her dancing.
- I would never dare.
- Big mistake.
- Maybe I should dare.
- Of course, you should dare.
- But she doesn't even know me.
- We'll take care of that.
- Stay here.
- Please, come back!
Miss.
Miss!
Miss, listen.
Come outside.
Do you see our friend, the one with the mustache over there?
Be nice.
Can we spend the afternoon together?
A little prayer?
Help, help!
Oh, God!
Hey, Adelina!
Scary, isn't it?
- Please, I need help.
- I'm coming!
Scared, huh?
May I introduce Miss -
It's just the excitement.
Be brave.
Why are you so stuck up?
- Do you have a special model?
- Extra special.
My model's like a bear trap.
It'll cut you to shreds.
- Well, I could -
- How dare you?
Come on.
You idiot!
You don't know what you're missing!
Scaredy cat!
Hey, you look like you're straight out of the depths of Africa.
Right, and we prefer blondes!
- Gourmand
- What does that mean?
- It's French for glutton.
- You're bilingual.
I'm sorry, miss, I'm a beginner.
But I'm honored to -
So now I work by the hour.
I make more, and I work less.
There are a lot of expenses, but Biki has had a fantastic idea.
I wanted to talk to you about it, because you're the only people we know in this town.
She says we should all live in one house and share the expenses.
Biki is a great girl.
She's extraordinary, smart, confident and modern, right?
Oh, sure.
- Would you be interested in living with us?
- You bet!
We could save a lot.
Of course, we're in.
- Biki is looking for an apartment.
- That would be great.
We work like dogs, but we never have a dime.
- This city is hell.
- Oh, God, I can't get used to it.
So much noise and confusion.
- You see, I'm a country girl.
- I'm a country boy, for that matter.
I'm going to demolish you.
Shit.
What are they doing back there?
They're behaving so strangely.
No, nothing.
Gigi is a bit of a scoundrel, that's all.
Listen... if that's why you're holding me like this, I'll let it slide.
Otherwise, I might even take offense, okay?
Why would you take offense?
Because it's no way to behave, without even the declaration.
Where I come from, a man has to declare himself to a girl.
If you have any intentions...
I have certain intentions, but I don't know about any declaration.
I could declare my taxable earnings.
Come on.
Don't feel insulted.
It's just that I don't know what to say.
A declaration is important to a girl.
Sometimes it can last a lifetime.
For instance, girls who get engaged and then married can only ever have one declaration.
It's very important.
- You're making fun of me.
- No, I'm not.
It's just that talking...
I'm not used to it.
It's really not my thing.
I don't know.
What can I say?
I don't know what to say.
What do you want me to say?
- What should I say?
- I don't know.
Something about me.
What do you like about me?
Well...
You're making me feel like an idiot.
You're making fun of me, aren't you?
There.
For example, I like how you cover your mouth when you laugh, just like children do.
And also how you cry desperately like you did at the station, sitting on your suitcases.
Things like that.
- I like that you're such a shorty.
- You're saying I'm a midget.
No!
You're so cute and little, with those big eyes and black curls.
All alone in this big city.
Well...
I want to protect you, that's all.
You must be made of stone.
No, you should really wait for my answer.
Right, now I have to fill out a form.
Well...
Yes.
I mean, you shouldn't get mad, because the answer is yes.
Go on, Carletto!
Time for action!
You're so rude.
Go to hell!
I'm sorry.
He's such an animal.
- Forgive him.
- Don't worry.
There's no danger anyway, because from here down, I'm made of stone.
- And that's all there is to it.
- I knew it!
Of course!
A hundred percent, I was absolutely certain.
Because when I like a girl, you can bet your life she won't give it up.
Because you like virtuous girls.
No.
It's that I'm a total loser.
I never get laid, damn it.
Oh, well.
Tell me more about Biki's apartment then.
Biki might have found a wonderful apartment.
In the middle of the sprawling metropolis, amid the jungle of skyscrapers, there's a little apartment building that's a real dream.
It used to belong to a painter friend of mine, an eccentric.
He specialized in painting ceramic statues.
He only did Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Well, this delightful apartment is miraculously available.
Fortunately, a tragedy has occurred.
The painter threw himself off the building.
He jumped off the terrace.
He was holding Snow White.
Not that one, of course.
Love or neurosis?
It's unclear, but the apartment is free.
It's a real bargain, even though it's run down.
It's spacious, centrally located.
We each get a room.
We share expenses.
We save money, time and everything.
We can make a commune.
It's all the rage at the moment.
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfettes!
They're well organized.
Biki is really smart.
The girls really know how to navigate the city.
They work two hours here, two there, they make a pile of money, and they still have time to find a home and organize the whole thing.
They're real go-getters, these girls.
Poor devil.
- Who?
- The painter.
With all this cement surrounding him, if he wanted to see a tree, he had to paint it on the wall.
It's like La Bohéme here.
This is a fantastic idea.
- We really have everything here.
- Shall we set down the rules?
In the house, between housemates, nothing doing. it's all over.
Worse than brother and sister, okay?
- What do you mean?
- Otherwise, it would turn into a brothel.
It's going to be a respectable home.
So forget it ever happened.
But if you want to use your room to entertain company, you can pay a supplement.
For 15,000 lire a month, you can bring girls home.
Great.
Clear guidelines make for a long friendship.
I'll pay.
Come here, you.
I'm a gentleman, you know.
Have I made myself clear?
And never try that again.
This is a commune of workers.
Now you're going to turn ugly.
You already look a bit like Brezhnev.
Hey!
- Who are you?
Dracula?
- I'm the cousin.
- Of Dracula?
- No, of Anna Rosa.
Oh, in that case.
There must be a factory down in Sicily, because they all look alike.
It's like they came from the same mold.
- What a wonderful bed.
- Gigi, you're a bit too frisky.
Anna Rosa!
All these men in the house?
Don't worry.
Don't be so Sicilian.
This penthouse is so nice, and the kitchen is adorable.
We can put the stove here.
There's already an exhaust pipe.
Anna Rosa.
What did the black widow decide?
- Who?
- Your cousin.
- Is she staying with us?
- Yes, she's decided to stay.
Besides, she doesn't know anyone in Milan.
She just got here from Sicily, where she was recently disappointed.
She tried to kill her fiancé in order to defend her honor.
- No way.
- Yes!
But the gun didn't go off.
You laugh, but she was so upset, poor thing.
- Carletto.
- What?
Come and see.
This is the wash room, but the painter used it as a studio and a greenhouse.
It's so nice.
Very artistic, right?
Look at my childhood friend, a blade of grass.
What a place.
- Do you like it?
- Sure, look at the view.
We can see tons of workers.
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.
Your skirt is a mini mini.
Should I be the only one in along skirt?
Then everyone would look at me.
But by trying to blend in, you might end up like Biki.
She barely even covers her front parts.
You can almost see her carpeting, her little garden, respectfully.
It's the fashion.
Do you want me to look like a peasant?
What's wrong with peasants?
You should look at yourself.
You're all dirty.
Now that we're here, don't worry.
I'll wash your clothes.
For 150 lire a day, you can forget all about it.
150 lire a day?
Laundry service. it's a bargain.
Biki has it all worked out:
laundry, food, overtime, expenses.
You'll see how much we can save.
In my hometown, the fruit looks very different on the trees.
There are small ones, big ones.
I just don't get the fruit here.
Have you noticed?
They're all exactly the same.
How do they get them to do that?
They make them in the Pirelli factory.
They're made of plastic.
- Maserati, Ferrari -
- Ferrari, Maserati!
They're great, sure, but right now, I think there's no car that has the class of the De Tomaso.
- What's a De Tomaso?
- It's a beast!
Four mufﬂers, and the tires just eat up the road, I tell you.
Well, the best car in the world is the Alfetta.
Mark my words.
Okay, the Alfa, but right now no one can beat the De Tomaso.
Good evening.
- It was an accident.
- That's right.
No kidding.
- If we may...
- My compliments.
Unfortunately, faced with the facts, her family is against us.
My family is up in arms because I got screwed by a Southerner.
No, don't say that, my love.
Tomorrow we're getting married.
- In that case...
- In any case, congratulations.
You should be saying, "Condolences."
I was an apprentice window dresser.
I didn't even get severance pay.
- That's true.
- We're in really big trouble.
Due to our extremely precarious situation, we'll impose on your kindness for a week or two, just until we get back on our feet.
There's only room in the wash room, and you'll have to make do.
It's 10,000 a week plus expenses.
- For now, it's a decent solution.
- How wonderful!
Hey, you can't be in here!
I'm not bothering anyone.
- I have to feed my children.
- Hey, are you dozing off?
- Thinking about your girlfriend?
- No, I'm thinking about shit.
- That's nice, right before lunch!
- Maybe he's constipated.
In the morning, I'm very nervous.
Don't worry about it.
At first, I was like that too.
- But you'll get used to living up north.
- I miss the sea.
Who has time to think of the sea?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
That damn alarm clock.
Are you gonna turn it off?
Please, let Mariuccia sleep a little.
She's not feeling too good.
You're telling me?
I'm gone every day from dawn to dusk.
The bathroom is free.
Quick, quick!
- It was our turn first.
Damn it.
- Please, Gigi.
- Come on, Gigi, don't screw me again.
- Open the door.
- I have to get to work early.
- You snooze, you lose!
What a son of a bitch.
Oh, well.
I guess that means I'll take a bath tonight.
The dirt on my body will be preserved in the freezer.
- Don't use all the hot water.
- Lighter, thanks!
Now you're going to smoke in there!
They always beat me to the punch.
Everyone's always running, running.
What a drag.
You're all in such a hurry.
Speaking of which, Carletto, please call Mrs. Penzotti and tell her that I'm going to be 15 minutes late.
- The number?
- It's on the wall.
Penzotti, with a "P."
Look it up under
Let me run.
Let me run.
Let me zip out of here.
The foot traffic is crazy here.
Honestly, Carletto, you still don't know how to make a telephone call?
Go on.
Of course, I know how.
I just woke up.
Excuse me.
Hello, Mrs. Penzotti?
Ma'am, I'm going to be 15 minutes late.
I'm sorry.
It can't be helped.
She's so annoying.
I'm thinking of quitting.
- Hey, what's that?
- Isn't it beautiful?
Finally, we can watch Mike Bongiorno.
It's second-hand.
We shared the cost, me, Biki, Anna Rosa and Gesuina.
You guys can watch it too in the evenings.
- You just pay us 100 lire.
- 100 lire?
Great.
First the washing machine, now the TV.
50 lire here, 100 there.
It's a wonderful system.
- Is there any coffee?
- Yes, honey, it's nice and hot.
Don't forget the 50 lire.
The 50 lire!
Of course, I won't forget.
Okay, I'm all paid up!
You girls don't miss a thing.
It's convenient for you too, though.
You have everything you need.
Why?
Aren't you happy?
Of course, everything's fine.
You're always working.
Let me see those big eyes.
Silly boy.
- Go on.
I'm already late.
- Okay.
I'm just afraid you're becoming too sophisticated.
You work, you telephone, you make piles of money.
After all, what does a man dream about?
Some day, you and I will have a place all to ourselves.
And I'd like to buy you a TV, a washing machine, all that stuff.
But you've already bought it all.
Don't worry.
There are tons of things to buy.
You worry about finding a good job.
They say there's no future at the produce market.
And with you?
ls there a future with you?
Darn it.
Do you realize that since we got here, I haven't even been able to touch you?
You're worse than a cloistered nun.
Damn it.
You know how I feel about these things.
I'm Sicilian.
"I'm Sicilian."
You're something else.
I really don't get it.
When it comes to everything else, the money, the TV, the miniskirts, you've become Milanese.
But "down there" you're still Sicilian.
- It's not fair, damn it.
- Oh, well.
I'm a man like all the others.
I'm ﬂesh and blood and all that.
Watch out, or I'll bring girls to my room like Gigi.
Try it, and I'll shoot you.
So you do care.
What's this?
You've gone to town with the lingerie.
Black stockings, very sexy.
Come here, you.
Are you trying to give me a nervous breakdown, Adelina?
Shall we take a leap of faith?
Let's get married.
How can we get married if you boys can't even pay your share here?
The girls have turned into piranhas.
They're three bloodsuckers.
100 lire to wash our underpants, 50 for a cup of coffee.
Any minute now, they'll start charging 16 lire every time we use the toilet paper.
The minute we get home, they skin us alive.
But it's worse in other places.
At least we have everything we need.
I wish they would let us stay after the baby is born.
Who knows where we'll end up?
- Boy, it's really freezing here.
- it's 10 below out here.
Inside the freezer, it goes down to 20 below.
- You might as well move to Moscow.
- It's not the cold that's bad for you.
It's going from cold to hot or from hot to cold that's dangerous.
Here we go from 20 below to 10 above every five minutes.
At least they pay you well.
How much do you make a month?
180,000 lire.
It's enough for just the two of us.
Later, we'll see.
Hey, Carletto, what happened?
Are you mesmerized?
These raspberries are beautiful.
- And all these animals!
- Beautiful, aren't they?
They slaughtered them seven or eight months ago.
- Really?
- In here, they can last for years.
Then, when we need them, we pull them out again.
You see this goat?
It's Chinese!
Really?
It died in '71, and they might feed it to us in '77.
Sure, because this place is special.
Everything is preserved in here.
One of these days, I might even preserve my mother-in-law in here.
This friend of mine, Mr. Director, would like to work here with us.
If you could find a job for him, he's a really good guy.
I can vouch for him myself.
- If you could find something -
- No, he's already caught a cold.
He's not suited for this kind of work.
Is the pizzeria busy here?
Are you kidding?
We make 2,000 pizzas a day.
Can I help you?
- Destiny has thrown us together.
- Destiny belongs at the opera house.
Who put this pig's head here?
You animals!
Look at this hair.
He looks like Mary Magdalene.
- Okay, okay.
I'll tie it back.
- Or you'll make curly-haired pizza.
Today he's really nervous.
If I find this disgusting thing on my counter again, there'll be trouble!
- Milan lost again, yesterday.
- Thank you so much for the update.
I know already!
I don't need you to tell me!
Hey!
Alberto, there's too much talking.
Everybody quiet!
The owner, she's coming!
What a sack of bones she is.
She's a mummified remnant of the war.
The Genera less, damn it.I
Even in a wheelchair, she still makes the rounds to increase production.
The worst part is that she gives all her money to the fucking fascists.
All in memory of the late fucking fascist general, her husband, infamous member of the colonizing invaders of Ethiopia.
- Hey, Black Beauty, are you a virgin?
- The Virgin Mary was a virgin.
Hey, that's my fiancée.
Even if at first sight, she may seem like a bit of a slut, she's being watched.
Soon she'll be my wife, so hands off, or I'll cream you.
- Of course.
Forewarned is forearmed.
- Yeah, right.
It's just that she looks like a girl I used to know.
What do you want?
Leave me alone.
I have work to do.
Come here.
Me, I go to the movies every night.
Yeah, to moon over Mastroianni.
It's fine with me if they want to watch Mastroianni, as long as everything else is made available to us laborers.
Dream on.
Nothing doing around here.
- Speak for yourself!
- Right!
All I need is a book with sexy masturbation photos, and off I go!
I worked for a very rich family for three years.
Such a refined atmosphere.
There were two of us.
They called us the Kessler Twins, just like those two ballerinas on TV.
Let's go dancing!
Here come the paranoid obsessives.
- About yesterday's game -
- Never talk to me about soccer again.
- Excuse me.
- I just wanted to say that Anastasi said hi.
You can stop making jokes, Piedmont, because you stole that game.
You always have an excuse when Milan loses.
What excuse?
This guy comes over with his eyes all bugged out, and then he says, "Anastasi said hi."
What should I say?
"Thank you very kindly.
You send my regards to that cuckold, the referee."
- Excuses!
- I'm not making excuses.
- The referee is a cuckold!
- The referee has nothing to do with it.
- We're tigers on the field.
- Tigers?
You're kittens.
Stop making fun of me!
Hey, ladies!
What about Carletto?
He found a job in a big restaurant.
It's right around the corner.
He wasn't making enough at the market.
- It's his first day.
- Really?
- They pay well.
- He seems like a nice young man.
- But living under the same roof...
- There's no danger.
- What's going on?
- Enough!
- Don't bust my balls.
- Enough!
I can't take it anymore!
I can't take it!
It's just too much.
I can't stand it!
I will, I'll jump!
And I'll take the children with me!
Come on.
Stop it.
Those are my underpants, damn it!
- Oh, shut up, you imbecile!
- Stop yelling, damn it.
She sounds like Maria Callas.
- They married so young.
- They shouldn't have.
That's easy to say.
But what do young people know of life's disappointments?
What a prison.
Two rooms with two children.
It's enough to drive you crazy.
What love could survive?
Fists are ﬂying over there.
That's love for you.
- He's the one who gets beaten up.
- Really?
No, no.
When I look at these huge apartment buildings,
I think of all the people sentenced to life living in these cells.
When I read in the papers that people have killed themselves,
I'm not surprised.
- I want to become a faggot!
- Go right ahead.
- Great solution.
- I'm going to become a faggot!
Holy Mother, it's true!
The eviction people are here.
They want to evict us and build luxury apartments here.
I don't give a damn!
It's no use trying to evict us.
We're not leaving!
We're not moving!
We've formed a neighborhood committee against the exploiters, and we're not going anywhere!
Tell that to the owners, those stinking speculators and developers, exploiters of the people.
We're not leaving!
Two Milano.
Hurry!
And you, I need veal chops and sausages, now!
- I'm coming!
- Hurry up!
- Calm down, people!
- We need the meat, now!
I have to cut it first!
Do you expect me to pull it out of my ass?
Are my pizza capricciosas ready?
- Darling, can I have my pizza napoletanas?
- Yes, my love.
- Here are your napoletanas.
- Bye!
Excuse me, I need -
- Young man...
- Of course, I'll serve you too.
You're so annoying.
Can I pick up-
The napoletanas are ready.
Hey, leave those there.
It's up to me to serve you.
You have to ask me first.
I was trying not to disturb you.
I saw you had a line.
I thought I would take them because there was a line.
Line or no line, you have to wait, and don't you dare take them.
What do you mean, "dare?"
I'm a very refined person.
Actually, I don't know who you are.
I'm a cook, and you're a waitress.
In the dining room, you can do whatever you want.
But not here!
You must have patience, ma'am.
Listen, young man, I refuse to speak to that boorish man.
I beg your pardon.
I'm taking my pizzas, and I'm leaving with them.
No,you'll make him angry.
God damn it!
Stop right there.
Give me back those pizzas.
I hand them out!
Don't you dare!
- Have you lost your mind?
- What language!
That woman!
This is my space, and I'm in charge here!
- You shitty Piedmontese.
- What?
You shitty Piedmontese.
Bruno!
- Say that again!
- You shitty Piedmontese!
Wait!
Calm down!
Back to work!
I'm so tired.
Oh, Lord.
I wonder how many pizzas we made?
Thousands.
At least 1,500 pizzas.
Christ, you had to screw us with the pizzas.
Pizzas or no pizzas, we're all screwed the same.
We could die here.
This place is unfit for human beings.
For 200,000 lire a month plus a quarter of the tips!
Why are you dumping on this place?
It's not like other places are better.
They're all the same.
People, noise, the stench of fried food, and assholes to go around.
He's right.
This place is better than many others.
Besides, 200,000 lire plus tips is a heck of a lot of money.
- You can do a lot with it.
- Like what?
- For starters, you can get a house.
- You already have a house, so why bother?
No, one of my own.
Not that hotel where we live now.
- A house of my own.
- Why, do you want to get married?
- Why?
What if I did?
- Go on.
- Carletto, where are you going?
- To make a phone call.
It's hellish out there!
- Can I wear your raincoat?
- It's pouring!
Are you gonna let Adelina screw you?
She wants to tie you down.
What do you care?
Are you going to marry Adelina?
Well, then.
- He's capable of doing something stupid.
- With that face, he really could.
Carletto, if you get married, you'll be dead to me.
Whoever gets married is an asshole.
What's gotten into him?
'Cause I doubt he's doing it for love.
It's fear.
Because ever since we came to the city, we've been scared.
- Why?
Would a wife take the fear away?
- A wife would make it worse.
Those with a wife don't want one, and those without are looking for one.
- Go figure.
- He's an idiot.
If he gets married, he'll never see me again.
Never trust a friend.
It's just that we've been friends since we were children in the parish, at Don Vincenzo's in San Rocco.
He was an orphan.
I was almost an orphan.
- I don't want him to make a mistake.
- Come on.
You know how it is.
Pussy has more pull than a tractor.
- Hello?
- Hello!
I have a ton of money.
I'm a billionaire, Adelona!
With 200,000 a month plus tips, I'll easily reach 300,000.
- Get out the matching bra and panties.
- What are you talking about?
Don't you get it?
Palermo, wake up!
We're getting married!
Will you marry me?
- When, right now?
- Right away, of course.
Tomorrow, the day after.
Not Saturday, 'cause I'm busy.
What are you saying, Carletto?
Get married right away?
To tell you the truth, I think it's anti-economical.
- You think it's what?
- Anti-economical.
What do you mean, anti-economical?
Damn it, damn it, damn it!
Adelina, between the two of us we're making half a million a month.
Carletto, do the math.
About 100,000 for rent, about 200,000 for food, clothing, gas, telephone.
Factor in installments and other payments, all we need is a child or an illness, and we'd be destitute.
Worse than Sante and Mariuccia.
This way, we set aside 150 or 200 a month, and in 10 years, maybe we open a store.
We're so young.
We are young, but I don't want to get married when I'm old.
I love you, God damn it.
It can't always be about money, Adelina.
Have you ever seen half a million, one bill on top of the other?
I haven't.
Besides, what more do we need?
We have everything.
A house, food, clothing.
I even have two suits.
We lack nothing.
Adelina, we're set!
You think you're all set.
just look around you.
The shops, the commercials, Caroselo.
Look around you.
You'll realize that there are things you need that you'd never have dreamed you needed.
Would you ever have thought you needed a leather wallet?
Or a picnic outfit?
Or perhaps a plastic bouquet of ﬂowers?
But you do need them.
Women are crazy.
We all know that.
On top of that, yours is a hick.
Get out while you still can.
- Or are you a slave of love?
- Get out of here.
You get out of here.
I'm going to the unemployment office.
Well, I'll be.
So you didn't call the cops.
You kept it for yourself.
Good for you.
Well, one has to adapt, you know.
My compliments on your bike.
- Wanna go for a ride?
- I'd love to.
- Here.
- So, I gave you a bit of a thrill.
Did you like it?
Would you like to buy one?
I wish.
Are you kidding?
I can't, not with my job.
So that's why you look so run down and underweight.
You're working.
I don't get it.
Don't you know work is for the birds?
Those who are rich don't do anything, and those who work are always broke.
Take off your helmet.
The war's over.
Take a bite out of life.
Life is an open window.
- You wanna make a Michele?
- What?
- A Michelangelo.
- I don't get it.
- A rosé.
- What's that?
Oh, boy, you're so green.
- 10,000 lire!
- I wish.
I'm taking you on an adventure.
Hop on.
Let's go.
Careful with the package.
Guess what's in it.
- What?
- Shit!
Hey, don't rush it!
It has to be a meticulous job.
I even got you the small brushes, so you could reach every little gear.
Cylinders, distributor, belts, shocks.
Everything, everything.
Millimeter by millimeter, everything must be very accurately... covered in shit.
- Hey, Walter.
- Yes?
- Come here a minute.
- What a stench.
What?
- Who's he?
- He's a friend of mine.
- I'll vouch for him.
Don't worry.
- Watch out.
So, how are we doing?
Everywhere, okay?
It has to be perfect, meticulous.
Walter, no, the pedals, the knobs, the heating, everything.
When I say that, I mean millimeter by millimeter.
We're not here to play around.
For two years, every night in jail,
I only managed to fall asleep by thinking of this moment.
Because now we're going to lock everything up tight.
It'll take at least a week for anyone to find it on this heap of garbage.
And when, after a week, all this shit has fermented and has penetrated into all the gears, then, our dear Chief of Police will have the car he deserves.
Everyone will make fun of him.
"S 1!
.
They're going to call him as in "shit."
There's two of them!
They're twins!
- Two?
- There's two of them!
- Two!
- What's wrong?
Are you ill?
TWO?
Come on.
Buck up!
- These Southerners always overdo it.
- Two birds with one rock-hard stone!
- Very funny.
- You've got a dirty mouth!
Two?
My babies!
Two!
My babies!
- See how happy he is?
- So selfish.
There, there.
Don't worry, my angel.
I'll work harder than a dog, but I'll manage.
I'll manage.
Don't worry.
Yes, you Southerner.
You won't get me again.
From now on, pills.
Pills for lunch and dinner.
Shut up, damn it.
You're really pathetic.
Shut up!
- Come on.
Come with us.
- Go screw yourself!
He doesn't want to come.
- No?
- No.
He doesn't want to come.
We've lost Tarzan, the spider of the Dolomites, my friend.
He got married, he's become bourgeois, he got a job.
He's become honest, the big fat son of a bitch.
Who are you?
Quit playing around.
We're professionals here.
We take our work seriously.
Well?
What can I tell you?
He doesn't want to come.
We could use...
I don't know about Walter's friend.
- If you want to try me...
- He doesn't have what it takes.
He's a rube.
I advise against it.
Seriously, I advise against it.
- You advise against it?
- Yes.
He advises against it.
You must be patient.
You know what, Fatso?
If you're against it, I have to use him.
Because Fatso's a kind of oracle.
When he opens his mouth, bullshit always comes out.
Come on, Fatso.
Get up, you idiot.
Why does he always pick on me?
It's not your fault, Fatso. it's fate.
Spouting bullshit is your mission in life.
And you, stop laughing.
It's just not fair!
So, we're going tomorrow?
Tomorrow, tomorrow.
Tomorrow, you're going to start living!
Come on.
Let's go.
Tell your friend Gigi, officially, that if he doesn't show up tomorrow, he's fired.
It's not his fault if he's sick.
Send a doctor to the house.
No one has ever fooled us.
We won't be sending any doctors.
If he's not here tomorrow, he's fired.
All right.
I'll let him know.
Abyssinian hick!
Stop calling me a hick!
Understood?
- It's got to stop.
We're sick of it.
- I don't need your help.
Go call your sister an Abyssinian, all right?
Since I don't have any sisters, you can take it up the ass.
And even if I did have one, she would have been born up north.
Your mother, then, son of a whore.
Easy on the whores.
That's another line of work where there's been a lot of immigration from the south.
You rotten bastard!
I want to see your blood!
I'll murder you!
Have you gone crazy?
Ru kill you!
Let's hide the knives!
O, brothers of Italy
Italy has awoken
The owners are CEOs, and right now they're all stuck in traffic.
That's where we come in.
The houses of the rich are ripe for the picking.
- But in broad daylight?
- Why?
Do you want to do it at night?
Times have changed.
We keep decent hours now.
Nights are for sleeping, or maybe...
- I don't get it.
- Don't worry.
We have informers.
There's only one occupied building.
Wait till you see how organized we are.
We know everything.
We get it all from the maids.
See the boss?
Fatso, go stand guard.
Hurry UP!
Wow!
Who are these people?
We're live from the match between England and San Giovanni.
The referee is Death Warmedover.
The linesmen are Peppe Ancuenta from Positano and Fatso Sforza from Gorgonzola.
England, john Xyzzz passes the ball to the wing.
Loff holds off Fetecchia.
Now it's Pompidou.
Peppe the cripple, Peppe Accanta, Antonio Midthigh, Peppe Ancuenta and Toté Lostuolo.
Now the ball goes to Skin 'n 'bones.
Skin 'n 'bones advances, loses a bone.
Canevacchi recovers the ball.
He's in the penalty area.
They trip him.
Vacco's head is mistaken for the ball and kicked.
Fell'nlove, then Still'nlove takes the ball and advances toward the goal!
The ball is back in play.
Loff advances and kicks it back.
Pompidou recovers the ball and passes it to Midthigh.
Goal!
Motherfucker!
Are we playing games?
This is a burglary, all right?
I wanted to see what I looked like on TV, boss.
See?
You look great too.
- I just wanted to see what it would feel like.
- So you had to play the sportscaster, asshole?
Take the stocking off.
It's not a robbery. it's a burglary!
Look who I have to work with.
They're worse than children.
Get out of the way, idiot.
This is bullshit.
Silver, paintings, radios, watches, got it?
Clean them out and leave.
Let's move.
Look alive.
Let's go.
- Whiskers, you come with me.
- Me?
Is he talking to me?
- Do I have to go out on the balcony?
- Hurry.
This is your break.
Go on!
Hurry up!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Turn on the light.
I can't see a thing.
The light.
The light.
Where are you looking?
By the window?
it's by the door!
Wake up!
What are you doing?
just watching me like an idiot?
Go to the next room.
I'll take care of this one.
Mr. Fumagalli, lawyer.
What do you keep in your desk?
Pills, string, rubber bands.
Come on.
Where do you keep your money?
What's going on?
What's he doing?
What the hell are you doing?
Go to the bedroom.Jewelry, watches, radios, televisions, small objects.
Get going.
Be quiet.
I can't believe the idiots I have to work with.
What, are we cleaning up now?
Poor people, I just thought it was rude.
They're so tidy.
Fuck you'.!
- Stop right there, asshole.
- My pants!
That way is blocked.
We can't get out.
- You ripped my pants!
Damn it!
- Come here.
Now we'll have to put on a show.
Sit down.
Not a word, or I'll kill you.
My dear sir, thank you so kindly.
You are our guiding light.
Good day and all the best.
Good-bye.
Say good-bye to the lawyer.
He's grown attached.
He can stay.
Good day, sir.
Oh, you're coming?
- Good-bye.
I'll call you.
- Good-bye, sir.
- Ma'am.
- Good morning.
- Could you open the elevator for us?
- Of course.
- We don't know the building well.
- Right this way.
- Are those bifocal lenses?
- Yes.
- How do you like them?
- Oh, I love them.
I'm asking because I really should get some too.
- They're wonderful.
- Hear that pure Milanese accent?
- The elevator's here.
Thank you, ma'am.
- You're welcome.
Behave, or I'll crack your skull.
And walk slowly when we get out, or I'll break your back, asshole.
Don't run!
- Somebody's coming.
- Quiet!
Help!
Thief!
- What's going on?
- There's been a burglary.
Imagine that.
- On the fifth ﬂoor.
- Oh, Lord!
Help!
Stop them!
Help!
Thief!
I've been robbed!
Help!
Stop them!
Oh, God, my pants!
I'll nail you, damn shoe.
Yes, but you could have told me you wanted to change jobs and be a sales rep.
You left me in the dark.
Like an idiot, I had to make excuses for you to the chef.
I almost got fired.
But you look great.
That suit looks expensive.
Listen, does it pay well, being a sales rep?
It depends.
Sometimes things go well and other times, not so much.
This time I got lucky.
But it's great being your own boss.
You go wherever you want.
You do whatever you please.
- Couldn't I do that too?
- No.
- Why?
Am I an asshole?
- No, I mean - it takes initiative.
I only just started.
Let's wait and see.
Maybe later, if things work out for me.
Look who's here.
- The brunette.
- Where is Adelina?
Good morning, miss, may I entertain the hope of taking you out to dinner?
Sure, you just keep hoping.
Tonight?
Not tonight.
Not ever.
Just forget it.
It just can't be]
You're such a cruel Abyssinian.
- You'll make me switch to blondes.
- I'm here.
Yes, my tasty little morsel has arrived.
She's a client.
We have to talk business up in my room.
- Really?
- Excuse me.
Be my guest.
The tasty morsel.
Come here.
Tell me something.
He's allowed to have girls in his room?
He pays a supplement.
- Do you pay one as well?
- What for?
With Adelina, it's been a disaster living here.
I can't even lay a finger on her.
Marriage is "anti-economical."
If she sees me with a woman, she says she'll shoot me.
I don't know what to do.
Why is she doing this to me?
- You let her do it.
- Me?
Sure. it's all your own fault.
They did everything to convince us to move out of the building.
They even offered us money, but we stuck to our guns.
The neighborhood committee rejected the eviction and petitioned the City.
Let's see if they get the message.
It's tough when you have kids.
Baby food is so expensive.
I'm going to have to find more work.
I could fix refrigerators at home, after hours.
What else can I do?
- Carletto, are you listening?
- I'm sorry. it's Adelina.
- What's wrong?
- I mean, we live here together.
She's always in front of me, but she won't...
- I'm not a saint, you know.
- Carletto, there's a simple solution.
Where I come from, we have our own way of solving this problem.
It's an ancient remedy.
You have to take her by force and commit the impure act.
The impure act will fix everything.
What are you talking about?
- Good night.
- Good night.
- I'm prepared. "Do not disturb."
- Good night.
Pardon.
Voila}.
- Oh, you're here.
- I was waiting for you.
I worked late.
Mrs. Penzotti had a dinner party.
- Really)
-Are - . '?
What a strange expression.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Holy Mother, that Gigi.
He's in his room with that blonde.
I don't know anything about this sex stuff, but I think people make too much of a fuss.
Listen.
What's he doing to that girl?
It sounds like he's slaughtering a sheep.
Yeah.
For 15,000 extra, he gets to organize a "reperotte" in his room.
Excuse my language, but that means "brothel" in Italian.
And he kicks me out.
I mean, listen to the ruckus.
We can't even have a conversation with that Boccaccio in the other room.
But, Adelina, I wanted to talk to you.
You see, you've become a city girl.
Head on your shoulders.
You're quick.
You're clever.
You work and make money.
But in a modern girl like you, there's one note that's off-key.
Why are you turning off the lights?
What "off-key note?"
That one.
But... how dare you?
You heard me.
That one.
- A clever girl like you, a virgin?
- Oh, God!
- It's laughable.
- No, Carletto, don't mess around.
Please, Carletto, no.
Please.
Come on.
No.
- Yes.
- No!
Yes!
No!
Scoundrel, coward!
No!
Hold still.
There's no way out of this.
- No!
- Carletto is awake now.
You're through.
- Where are you going?
- Help!
- Stop,
- No!
No!
- No!
- This lingerie is so...
No scratching!
It's no use.
I won't let you go.
No, Carletto, no.
I beseech you.
- The others are in the house.
- I don't care.
Enough is enough.
I'm tired of listening to Gigi.
For once, he'll have to listen to my Decameron.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
You Zulu, scoundrel, sellout, coward!
Who the hell invented these panty hose?
Maria Goretti?
No, let me go!
Oh, God, God, God!
Yes, God.
Oh, no, let go of that!
- Watch out!
- Not the television!
No!
Oh, God.
The television is brand new!
Watch out for the television.
Careful with the TV.
It's new.
If it falls, it'll break.
Hold on to it.
Hold on tight.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
No!
Saint Rosa ha!
Oh, my God!
- What's going on?
- Nothing, my love.
Why?
Why?
Why are you doing this awful thing to me, Carletto?
Because I love you.
- You idiot.
- Oh, my God.
A score is being settled.
Charge, Savoia!
Come on, blondie. it's an orgy!
There's a rape in progress.
Let's join in the fun!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Now you've calmed down.
Holy Mother.
You made a big boo-boo.
That's right.
Why bother with a little boo-boo?
Are you cold?
Are you cold?
Boy, what a struggle.
Did I hurt you?
A lot?
I'm sorry.
I'm a fallen woman now.
That's right.
Finally.
I'm willing to make amends.
It's up to you.
Poor me.
What did you do to me?
I really don't know what happened.
What?
You don't know what happened?
Well, let me explain it to you again.
Watch it.
I'll tip the television over again!
Execute the eviction.
We have the paperwork.
Execute the eviction.
We're not budging from here!
Damn you!
You have no mercy even on women and children!
Show them the babies.
Go on.
Hold them up!
All of them!
Didn't Biki say she wanted to get rid of the children?
Yeah, but now they're coming in handy.
Down with the landlords!
We want housing!
Down with the landlords!
Who are those guys?
Students.
They're here to help us.
They believe in our cause.
We want housing!
Down with the landlords!
You have to think of your children, of your rights, and of your cause!
Accessorized.
Minimum consumption, maximum mileage.
- Ice white finish, black leather interior.
- It's gorgeous.
I even joined the Automobile Club.
Very high-class, isn't it?
How did you afford the down payment?
It's called "overtime," dear.
What overtime?
What do you mean, Biki?
That pig, Professor Quinteri.
The other day, when his wife was out, he was coming onto me.
30,000 lire for 10 minutes of pain.
- Holy Mother!
- What Holy Mother?
These days, you can't afford to be squeamish.
I'm telling you this now that Carletto has serviced you.
If you get the chance, take it.
- We did it!
- We did it!
Come outside!
We did it!
- The City bought the building!
- Holy Mother!
They're going to renovate!
- Our rents will stay the same.
- The same rent!
We won!
"Twenty-five years of leftist administration in Bologna have set an example."
Wait. "The historical center of town has been restored for the people."
Holy crap! "What happened here today is a historical milestone for Milan."
A historical milestone for Milan!
- What's going on?
- Mariuccia is feeling ill.
- Mariuccia isn't well.
- Give her some air.
She doesn't feel well.
My Mariuccia.
- Didn't you take your pills?
- Yes, I did.
But with all our worries, I might have made a mistake.
- Let's hope not.
- Oh, Lord.
Let's hope not.
My word, Sante!
Five!
You two could repopulate the desert!
- You do have a tiger under the hood.
- Five!
Come on.
Buck up.
Don't cry.
Holy Mother!
Five!
She'll destroy her insides!
Just imagine, Anna Rosa.
In Sicily, I shot Carmine because he refused to disgrace me.
I could have ended up like her.
If he had gone ahead with it, who knows how many children I'd have by now?
Five kids in one go!
You could make a lot of money in advertising.
- Right!
With the pill, it's not so unheard of.
- It can happen. it does happen.
Seven of them, Holy Mother.
How can we keep them all here?
- Imagine what Biki will say.
- She won't tolerate it.
Gigi, Carletto, come here.
We have to make a decision.
There are too many of them to stay here.
How can we keep seven of them here?
They have to leave.
- Have some compassion.
- Look at him, poor guy.
I know.
I feel sorry for him.
But he's irresponsible.
If I were his wife, I'd cut his thing off.
She's right.
- He ruined that poor woman.
- Yes, but you're going overboard.
After all, children are a blessing too.
With 200,000 lire a month for nine people?
It's enough to kill you.
You're all so severe.
Listen, Carletto, don't even dream of putting me in that situation.
Well, I ruined you.
You decide if you want to live in disgrace.
You're a scoundrel, but I refuse to do something that's anti-economical.
I'd rather be disgraced than stupid.
Just listen to her, damn it.
My darling baby, don't worry.
Your father will feed you all.
Somehow he'll manage.
He'll manage.
Hey, are you going to light that cigarette?
Why not?
Listen, honey, what are you waiting for out here all alone?
Are you looking for company?
Why not?
Well, then, get in, handsome.
Why not?
20,000?
All right, 20,000.
Come on.
- Payment in advance.
- That's fine with me.
Hey!
- Are you joking?
- No jokes.
I charge 20,000 to fornicate.
Me Pay you?
It's you who has to pay me, you cretinous dolt!
Get out of here before I kick you in the ass!
You imbecilic Southern hick!
There's no need to yell.
There's been a misunderstanding.
I'll send you straight to jail.
You're wasting my time, you fucking idiot!
So rude.
What about the new job?
- Did you start it, Santino?
- Yes.
- Did it go well?
- Not really.
But they've promised me another one with the City tomorrow.
Keep quiet, or they'll kick us all out.
- Did you give Cicciuzzo his medicine?
- Yes, of course.
Don't worry.
Sleep quietly, children.
- Did you eat, at least?
- Yes, my love, don't worry.
Well, that's good.
I'm so tired.
No, be a good boy.
Come on, please.
- Not tonight either?
- No, love, it's too dangerous.
All you have to do is look at me.
Come on, love, no.
But I love you.
- I can take anything, but I love you.
- Quiet.
No, not this!
You can't do this to me, because I can't take it.
You can't take this away from me.
It's late.
Go to bed.
- How are you feeling?
- A little better.
Adelina, will you bring me the hot water bottle?
Let me go to bed.
I worked all day, and I'm exhausted.
- Come on.
Gigi's not here.
- That's why I won't bring it.
- Come on, Adelina.
- Be good.
No, be patient.
Let's not get in any more trouble.
Don't you hear those guys in there?
We have to be level-headed.
Life is no joke.
Life!
I just don't understand it.
Everything is upside down here.
At least when you get married, there's a hearth, a home.
There are bills to pay.
Come on.
Let's go to bed.
Tomorrow's going to be a busy day.
Good night.
Oh, my goodness.
Tomorrow I have to work almost 10 hours.
Work and money.
Money and work.
Work and money.
We have to form a union of our own.
You won't listen to me because you're afraid.
There are some customers.
- Hey!
- Hey.
- Well?
- They don't have money.
- Forget them.
- Get out of here.
We have to form a union.
It's time to get rid of the bloodsuckers.
Who could touch us then?
We would have the last laugh.
We would have our own hotels, health insurance, a pension, our own private police, so no one could suck our blood anymore.
What are you doing here?
You acted all stuck up, with your nose in the air.
Well?
You're a fool.
But I can smell your type a mile away.
No one can know about this.
Not even Adelina.
Do you have any conscience at all?
Back home, I have my mother and four brothers.
Five poor souls who live off this.
If anybody finds out where it comes from, they won't be able to survive anymore.
So get out of here.
I've got you stuck in my craw, and you know it full well.
Maybe it's better this way.
I can pay.
How much?
Ten, 20?
- Whatever you want.
- No.
Not you.
There's not money enough for you.
Why not, God damn it?
That's just the way it is.
Go away.
Dirty whore!
- Mariuccia, come into the other room.
- Biki wants to talk to you.
This time it would be unforgivable.
But today?
Right now?
Right now, immediately.
We don't have a minute to lose.
Don't worry about the money.
We'll take care of it.
You can't go on being irresponsible.
Anna Rosa and Gesuina will take care of the children.
Sante doesn't know.
What he doesn't know can't hurt him.
- I can't think about it.
- You have to think about it.
Look at the state you're living in, with your starving children!
When you leave here, you won't be able to feed them!
Look how you've let that man ruin you!
Look at yourself!
You look like an old woman.
Come on.
Leave the children here, and we'll go with you.
In two hours, we'll be back, and it will be behind you.
Come on, Mariuccia.
Let's go.
Have you heard from lsotta?
I haven't heard from her in ages.
She's disappeared.
Back home, her entire family is worried.
Who knows where she is?
She could give us a call, though.
Come with me.
Take your coat off.
Hurry.
Let's go.
Don't be afraid.
Everything's going to be fine.
You go take a walk and come back in fifteen minutes.
All these poor people.
- Oh, Lord.
- Don't dwell on it.
Come on.
A glass of water.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
I don't feel well.
I don't have any money.
Wait here for a family member or the doorman, perhaps.
Come on.
Buck up.
Now you'll go home and lie down.
You have to go.
We're busy here.
- What do you want?
- Some water.
- Is she feeling ill?
- No, she's just a little weak.
Now she's going to go home.
Come on.
The worst is over.
I don't feel well.
- I'll help her.
- But Mariuccia!
A little compassion.
- Listen, we have work to do.
- You should be ashamed!
- How dare you?
- Shame on you, you parasites!
Get out, with your foul mouth!
- Our work is of a delicate nature and -
- You have to be patient with her.
- Who did you bring me?
- Bye.
Get out of here, and don't come back!
- Thank you so much.
- It's going to be all right.
Thank you, again.
Oh, my God, I feel sick.
Ma'am, I feel sick.
I'm a mother.
I have five children.
- I was hoping -
- Don't worry.
Forget about it.
I'll take her home.
Come with me, ma'am.
I'm the idiot here, trying to do favors for others.
Go to hell!
I'm sorry for Biki, but I'm not going back to those butchers.
I know how many poor women die under the knife.
Those parasites, murderers.
So the government can save face.
It's murder.
In the end, I don't know who the real murderers are.
- Calm down, Mariuccia.
- Of course, I'll calm down.
I'll calm down and keep this new wretch of a child.
He couldn't have found a worse mother, poor thing.
Poor angel
Be careful, Sante.
Can't you see your lines are all crooked?
You're ridiculous.
You can't go on like this.
Do you want to die?
After 10 hours in the freezer, you can't work all night.
You can't keep it up.
What do you want me to do?
Drown my kids like rats?
They came into the world.
They're here.
I have to make it.
Back home, seven kids, even if they were starving, the whole town would take care of them.
They would all grow up together, in rags, perhaps, stealing fruit in the orchards, fish from the fishermen.
But here, in the city, it's different.
You can't raise seven kids.
Food, clothing, surrounded by other people.
It's different!
Why don't you go back home then?
Why?
Because I've heard that even down there everything's changed.
I'm scared.
The trip is so expensive.
I'm scared.
No, Carletto, I have to make money.
I need money.
That's it.
I have no more shame.
I'll do anything for money, anything.
Listen to those kids crying.
Even if they're locked in their room, they're really giving me the blues.
They have to move out.
All the misery in the house makes me sad.
By the way, any news?
Did we get the apartment?
- Did you give them the down payment?
- Of course, the receipt's in my room.
I'll show it to you.
It's already rented for 50,000 lire a month.
I did the math.
The rent will pay the mortgage, so we won't have to worry about it.
As soon as we get rid of Sante and Mariuccia, we'll clean the room, put some nice furniture in, and then you'll see.
Girls, let's be honest.
If we rent it by the hour, we can make 300,000 a month.
- That's for sure.
- Holy Mother.
- By the hour?
- Absolutely.
Now that the City is putting in another bathroom, finally we'll pull in some money.
This summer, we're going on a cruise!
Enough with the daydreaming.
It's late, and Mike has already started.
Mike!
Well?
Why the long face?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm sad because of that poor girl in the other room.
Tell me the truth.
Is it because of Carletto?
Did you tell him the weddings off?
No, at this point, he's figured it out.
Don't be stupid.
If you worry about other people, you're screwed.
Just focus on having a good life, and we will, I promise.
It's going to be great!
This evening, as you already know, there are some new additions to our game.
But I'll let someone else tell you about them.
I'll pass the mike over to-
- Hi, Sante.
- Hi.
What are you doing here?
Did they offer you a job?
- Sort of.
- It's not for that fascist, is it?
What do you want from me?
I have to think of myself.
I leave politics up to the rich.
Did you know she's pregnant again?
Forget about me.
Don't say anything.just let me be.
Bye.
That was Carletto.
He says that Sante might be in trouble with that fascist from the restaurant.
He's afraid they might have roped him in to do some political demonstration.
They came around here looking for people too.
It was for some demonstration.
That idiot Sante is so desperate for money with all those kids.
I'll go take a look.
- What do you think they're planning?
- I think it's something crazy.
- You mean some crazy stunt?
- It could be serious.
Did you see how excited the owner's son was?
Those fascist pigs don't fool around.
They want to prove themselves to the industrialists who finance them and show the CIA that they're serious.
A bomb!
There's been an explosion!
That was a bomb!
- What the hell's going on?
- They set off a bomb!
And Sante?
I don't know where he is.
We have to find him.
- How?
In all this confusion?
- We'll go look.
- If bombs are involved, I'm out.
- What?
What's wrong with you, Gigi?
He's a friend.
We have to help him.
What kind of person have you become in this shitty city?
A thief is what I've become, idiot.
Understand?
It's full of cops here, and if they catch me, I'll go to jail because I have a record, okay?
You go look for that idiot!
Get down!
Let me go!
- Holy Mother of God.
- Yes!
That guy!
Hit them!
Take this and get lost.
Stop that man!
- Let me go!
- It's him!
- It's your friend.
- it's him, it's him!
Let me go!
Help!
Help!
Let me go!
Help!
I had nothing to do with it!
Have mercy!
Let me go!
My babies!
My children!
- My babies!
- Sante!
My babies!
Come on!
Come on!
So it's all over?
Back to work?
You've already digested the whole thing?
You couldn't care less about what happened outside.
This is what ruins us all.
It's this stomach we have.
We can digest anything, anything at all, with this stomach.
- Bruno, come on.
- No, I've had enough.
It's enough!
I can't take it anymore.
It's too much!
You coward!
Come here!
Come with me!
Come on, you coward!
You're done, you coward!
That's enough.
Over here.
Come over here.
Mommy!
Who will help me?
Will anyone help me?
- Poor guy.
- It was an attack of neurasthenia.
- They'll put him in the psych ward.
- Better never to set foot in there.
He went a bit crazy, but he had tears in his eyes, poor guy.
What kind of a life is this?
Screwed.
We're all screwed.
If we keep on working like this, we'll all go crazy.
I don't know.
Maybe we should all just stop.
We should start over somewhere else, in a different way.
A different way.
We should stop.
What's all this?
The restaurant is full.
People are hungry.
Let's move it.
Back to work!
Back to work!
ALL SCREWED UP
Communication between self and self between self and others, may take many forms.
Dreams are a language which we may learn to interpret.
Our deeper self talking to our self.
The needs, the sensations, the flights of fancy of others impinging on our own.
Take heed not to disregard these communications but rather, listen and hear what they have to say.
Your tread must be light and sure as though your path were upon rice paper.
It is said a Shaolin priest can walk through walls.
Looked for, he cannot be seen.
Listened for, he cannot be heard.
Touched, he cannot be felt.
This rice paper is the test.
Fragile as the wings of the dragonfly, clinging as the cocoon of the silkworm.
When you can walk its length and leave no trace you will have learned.
Thank you.
What will you do now?
Stay here for a time, if I may.
Allow me to offer advice.
Leave.
-Go elsewhere.
-Why?
There are emanations of evil in this place.
-Evil?
-Yes.
Perhaps the spirits of this soil are not right for us.
There is danger.
It is present when we work, and it does not stop when we sleep.
You do not go elsewhere?
I am too old to search for other places.
But you, you should.
is there work to be had?
Far more than a man can do for less than he should be paid.
I do not seek wealth.
What then, huh?
Exhaustion?
Peril?
That is all a man can find in this place.
is it?
Have I not already found a friend?
You sure look like you could use the work.
The pay's 75 cents a day.
Of that, we keep 30 for feeding you, 1 0 for work clothes.
That leaves 35 for me.
You count too fast.
You haven't been hired yet.
You said you needed men to lay track.
I know what I said.
Pete.
Yeah?
-New john, huh?
-Yeah, wants to be.
Well?
This one wasn't sent to us.
He just walked in.
Oh, I see.
-What do you think?
-Damion will be very interested.
That's what I thought.
-What is Damion?
-He's an investigator for the railroad.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come in.
Damion, we might have something for you.
New john, walked in out of nowhere, asked to be put on tracklaying.
-Chinese?
-Big one.
All right.
Let's take a look at him.
-And get Joe.
-Go on in.
You're not full Chinese, are you?
My father was American.
Like you.
Joe?
All right.
Now, do you recognize this man?
Are you sure, Joe?
Now, it was dark when you saw him.
Yeah, but it lit up.
And I saw the face clear.
And I ain't never gonna forget it.
This ain't him.
All right.
Thanks.
-What's your name?
-l am Caine.
-l'm sorry, I have to check everyone.
-Why?
We've had a series of explosions around here.
That's how the boy was hurt.
Someone's trying to roll up our track and maybe us along with it.
I could not do such a thing.
I am sorry any man can.
This man is a will-o'-the-wisp.
One minute, he's here.
The next, he's gone.
-l hope you can stop him.
-l'll stop him.
You're free to go, Caine.
What do we do with him?
You said he wanted to work.
Let him work.
All right, come on.
Put that tie down.
Get that rail down here.
Come on.
Come on, move it there.
Move it along.
Honest day's work, honest day's wages.
Come on.
You're getting paid good wages.
Move it out.
Come on.
Come on.
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Come, come, come, come.
Get that lined up there.
That's it.
Move it along.
Honest day's work, honest day's wages.
Come on.
All right, line it up.
Come on, move it.
I will work more slowly.
No, no.
The foreman will be angry with you as he is with me.
Then they will take more money from your pay.
Come on, swing that sledge, old man.
You people down there, what are you doing?
Come on, get up here, go to work.
They are worse with us since our countryman has caused them trouble.
What do you know of this man?
He strikes with the surprise of a snake and the strength of a tiger.
is it strength to use explosions to harm a small boy?
All of us are harmed.
If one Chinese brings evil, they expect evil from all Chinese.
Please, take this.
They permit us this.
They know we will work twice as hard once we are refreshed.
Here, you can get rid of them rags you got on.
Come on, let's go.
Get up.
Get up, old man.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
-Let's go.
-Where are we going?
-l'm putting you on guard duty at the bridge.
-Guard duty?
-l'm very tired.
-Well, maybe I'll give you an easier shift tomorrow.
Come on, now.
Not you. I don't know about you yet.
Please...
You wear the robes of a Shaolin master.
They are my own.
Master Li?
We could not be sure you were alive.
As you see....
l had heard that you were in this country.
Your exploits have preceded you.
You do me honor.
May one ask why you left China?
Fleeing the same enemy as yourself, master.
The emperor.
A most imperfect movement, Disciple Caine.
Fortune, not skill, achieved the result.
May I be instructed, Master Li?
Let us repeat the movements.
You see?
Yes. I will try to improve, master.
Kwan Li of the family of Kwan Chou of the province of Hupeh?
Yes.
A message for you.
-Speak.
-lt was the order of the emperor...
-...that you be killed.
-Why?
Your family has been decreed guilty of treason.
That is not true.
The emperor's edict makes it the truth whatever the truth.
Does my family still live?
Their death was to follow quickly upon yours.
-l must go to Hupeh.
-At once.
Forgive me if I have injured you.
Do you know that I have sent for you?
I felt it.
Do you wish to learn why?
If such is your wish.
You have been in the work camp.
Have you heard nothing?
They search for a man who has done harm to the railroad.
You have found him.
But you are not this man.
You are Shaolin.
You could not follow such a path.
For any reason?
For any reason.
Your clothes are in tatters.
Please take these.
You are kind.
We will speak again. I will come to you.
You do me honor.
Go now.
Come on, get this man out of here!
Come on, let's hurry up.
Hurry up!
Get him out.
Hurry!
Come on, let's get some shovels, and let's get these guys out of here.
Hurry up.
Let's get some men.
Get these shovels.
Come on.
-ls he hurt badly?
-Yes, very badly.
I'm sorry.
What kind of thing is it to take an old man on guard duty after a long day's labor?
I'm not the track boss.
How bad is the damage?
The bridge is a complete wreck.
We've lost a week, at least.
-That'll make somebody very happy.
-You sure he ain't the one?
No, but I think he knows more than we do.
I could prod him a little.
That's my job.
Caine?
Come on, you men, let's go.
-Gets worse and worse.
-Worse?
People hurt, damaged.
He's like a ghost.
But he has been seen.
That doesn't seem to bother him.
He was seen again tonight.
Yet they do not know him.
You know what they say.
All Chinese look alike to white men.
And you?
Let me get one look at him.
No Chinese ever seen him?
None that'll talk about him.
That is, perhaps, understandable.
is it?
-You left the camp this afternoon.
-Yes.
Do you mind telling me where you went?
-For a walk in the woods.
-And?
Then I came back.
You walk very quietly.
Now, that's one thing that they say this man I'm looking for does also.
Yet Joe has told you I am not that man.
is there a doctor?
They don't think we need a doctor.
But they think we need an investigator.
I must attend my friend.
Work for the railroad and return a rich man to Siangfan.
You see how rich I have become.
And I may never see Siangfan again.
You cannot be certain.
I cannot believe--
Believe the man who did all this damage is Chinese.
He would not hurt us.
He would not hurt us.
My master.
You do not wear the garments I gave you.
No, master.
They were made for my nephew.
Has he grown so tall?
You remember him.
I remember.
If only he would cry out his grief, his rage.
Did he see the slaughter?
He saw it.
Father, mother, two brothers his sister, dragged from the house and killed before his eyes.
The whole family?
All but the boy.
How was he spared?
A whim of destiny.
He had climbed a tall tree in the garden, dared the highest limb.
It was then the soldiers came.
He has not eaten since, and I am worried for him.
It is not food that he needs now.
He would have been 1 7.
Would have been?
He's dead.
He was crushed to death under the wheels of the railroad.
May his spirit be at rest.
Mine is not.
He was the last of my family.
No seed remains to link us to the future.
We are removed from the earth for all time.
It is said the soul may be reborn.
None may know that for certain.
No, master.
Shall I tell you why I sent for you?
If such is your wish.
May a man love, Kwai Chang?
As you have loved your nephew.
And may a man also hate?
We are taught this is the human condition.
I will destroy the railroad.
It is said the way avoids destruction.
I destroy the destroyer, iron and steel.
More than iron and steel are destroyed.
Who is he?
His name is Han Tsung.
He was injured last night in the explosion.
He will not live.
One man.
There were many before him.
The railroad has killed thousands.
Are you asking me to join you?
I gave you the garment of one who was to me as a child of my own flesh.
You could fill his place.
Venerable master that is why I cannot wear the garments.
Cannot?
Say it, will not.
You--
-How is the old man?
-Asleep.
Where were you when the bridge blew up last night?
Here.
-Anybody with you?
-Yes, we all heard it.
Do you always go barefoot?
-Yes.
-Why?
I do not like shoes.
This is a piece of fuse wire, and I found it down by the bridge.
Now, it's the first time our mystery man has left anything behind and maybe he's getting a little careless, a little cocky, but he also left a bare footprint where l found this.
The footprint is not mine.
That will be very easy to prove.
How do you feel about all this?
About the track being blown up?
Men being hurt?
I do not like it.
But you won't help me find the man who's done it.
It is not my place.
Will it be your place to bury that old man if he dies?
is your cup empty?
Master.
I walk among them.
I sit.
They cannot see me.
How can they stop me?
Tea.
I'm sorry to hear about the old man.
He's not the first to die working for the railroad.
You can't blame his death on the railroad.
-No.
-But someone else does.
is that it?
You're not a tracklayer, Caine.
Now, what brought you to Station 431 ?
My own path.
And that path, I suppose, has no connection with the mystery man?
Do you approve of what he's doing?
He does not care if I approve or disapprove.
If you find this man who is doing these things what will you do to him?
They'll put him on trial, and if he's found guilty, hang him.
Please, excuse me.
Sir.
You are Damion?
-Yes.
-The investigator for the railroad?
That's right.
You are well armed.
Do I know you?
You must answer that.
Well, what do you want?
To be of service to you.
How?
Take your rifle.
-Why?
-This man you are looking for I know him.
-You know him?
-And can lead you to him.
-Now?
-Yes.
Follow me.
-How do you know him?
-l have dealt with him.
-Helped him?
-He needs no help.
Who are you?
I am a john.
is that your name?
You are not interested in my name.
You want the man who blows up bridges.
Yeah?
I am looking for Mr. Damion.
He ain't here.
Where is he?
I don't know.
He went off somewhere with the tea john.
Just the two of them?
I didn't see no one else.
It is not far now.
Are you afraid?
I asked you before.
Who are you?
It is of no matter.
We are here.
-There's no one here.
-No one?
You.
-No.
-Yes.
I am the man you are looking for.
I don't believe you.
I think you do.
All right, I do.
Why do you do this?
You must be shown the weakness you take for strength.
If this man dies...
-...others will take his place.
-Stronger?
They will not yield.
Are they Shaolin masters?
No.
Do you believe you can stop me?
I will have to try.
Kwan Li, stop.
I am not Kwan Li.
-May I go?
-Go.
Kwai Chang, I called you here.
Now I tell you leave.
Who is he, Caine?
How many other people is he gonna kill?
You tried to stop him.
You can do no more.
I can do one thing.
-Pete?
-Yeah, Damion.
Arrest this man.
-Caine?
But he--
-You heard me.
Lock him up.
Come on out, Caine.
Damion wants to see you.
I would like to see him.
Nothing bothers you, does it?
It would seem that way to you.
Over there.
Let's take a ride.
How do you feel?
A question I must ask you.
You save my life, I throw you in jail, and you're not angry?
Are you not holding me for a purpose?
I guess you know you're the only hope I have of bringing him in.
Can I count on you?
Why should I do this?
Maybe because you feel enough outrage at the harm he's causing.
I could feel the same outrage at the railroad.
I should quit.
I'm no match for him.
It is true.
You are not.
Trying to cheer me up?
I was at his mercy yesterday.
I was frightened.
Didn't help having two guns and a knife.
He would've finished me off if you hadn't shown up.
How'd you happen to follow us?
That is between me and him, not you.
You can't leave me out of it.
I wanna back you up.
-What?
-There must be things that you want.
Things that I can get you.
Not me, but the people who hired me.
They want to track this man down, and they can be very generous.
I am not a bounty hunter.
I wasn't talking about money.
So you do not capture him, but you have me.
Let's walk.
There are ways of getting rid of this.
The men who run this railway have a lot of influence.
They could get a crime off the books.
A crime committed in China?
If they could pull it off, you'd be a free man.
And for this questionable freedom I must surrender my friend?
Your friend?
Remember, I saw the two of you together.
Would he be as scrupulous about you?
Yes.
What would happen if I turned you in?
I would be sent back to China.
And be beheaded.
I'm not a sheriff.
I don't work for the government.
You must do what your conscience tells you.
What do you owe this man?
Much.
Much.
I would say so.
You are still here.
As you see.
Despite my order.
The investigator has asked me to betray you.
Betray me.
It is of no consequence.
Hi, what's this?
We feel refreshed when we drink tea.
I thought you would like coffee.
Thank you, john.
I was about to fall asleep.
It smells good.
Pass me a cup of that.
Oh, that looks good too.
That's good.
Good and strong.
You know, Pete, what this really needs is a good shot of whiskey.
Then you will fall asleep, Stanley.
I didn't think that was funny.
-You didn't think so?
-No.
I thought it was funny.
I thought it was very funny.
-l still think it's a great idea.
-Yeah, we should do this every night.
With the shot of whiskey.
With the shot of whiskey.
You have been taught that you dare not disobey your master.
Yet I must if I believe my master is wrong.
I am Shaolin, but I am also a man.
I feel pain, grief, the sorrow of loss.
-How can we question the ways of destiny?
-l can and do.
All we may question are the ways of men.
Are not emperors men?
Was it not men that built the train that crushed my nephew to death?
And may a man not strike back?
There will be people in here in the morning.
-Company men, bosses.
-Men.
And outside, those you are doing this for you will kill them too.
I must stop you.
You of all men, the last I would wish to harm.
You are the master.
I am the student.
I wear the garments of the nephew you have loved.
Yet if I were he, if I were your son still, I should do this.
I must.
You insist.
Let it be.
Now call the investigator to arrest me.
I only meant to show you what you yourself have taught me.
No man is omnipotent.
It is not for me now to tell you what to do.
You are the master.
You got paid.
-Looks like you're ready to leave.
-Yes.
Settled what I had to.
Did you go into the headquarters building last night?
What does it matter?
Well, somebody left all this, and we found it this morning.
Nobody saw him, as usual.
Now, wait.
Aren't you gonna tell me how you did it?
It is nothing to do with you.
But the results do.
I had a conference with the bosses this morning.
I made a few suggestions.
Nothing much, just safer working conditions.
A doctor in the camp.
They wouldn't listen.
Perhaps they will when the explosions end.
No.
I didn't deliver a culprit.
They wanted a carcass.
They, too, look for revenge.
Yeah.
Joe.
Joe, let me help you with that.
Please, I do not need this.
Thanks.
I've done my last job for the railroad.
You will improve nothing by going away.
But I don't have to be a part of it.
I think that's something I picked up from you.
I said that?
You don't have to put everything in words.
Can I give you a ride?
I thank you.
But I think it is better that I go my own way.
Why?
Where are you going?
I may never know.
Communication between self and self between self and others, may take many forms.
Dreams are a language which we may learn to interpret.
Our deeper self talking to our self.
The needs, the sensations, the flights of fancy of others impinging on our own.
Take heed not to disregard these communications but rather, listen and hear what they have to say.
Your tread must be light and sure as though your path were upon rice paper.
It is said a Shaolin priest can walk through walls.
Looked for, he cannot be seen.
Listened for, he cannot be heard.
Touched, he cannot be felt.
This rice paper is the test.
Fragile as the wings of the dragonfly, clinging as the cocoon of the silkworm.
When you can walk its length and leave no trace you will have learned.
Thank you.
What will you do now?
Stay here for a time, if I may.
Allow me to offer advice.
Leave.
- Go elsewhere.
- Why?
There are emanations of evil in this place.
- Evil?
- Yes.
Perhaps the spirits of this soil are not right for us.
There is danger.
It is present when we work, and it does not stop when we sleep.
You do not go elsewhere?
I am too old to search for other places.
But you, you should.
Is there work to be had?
Far more than a man can do for less than he should be paid.
I do not seek wealth.
What then, huh?
Exhaustion?
Peril?
That is all a man can find in this place.
Is it?
Have I not already found a friend?
You sure look like you could use the work.
The pay's 75 cents a day.
Of that, we keep 30 for feeding you, 10 for work clothes.
That leaves 35 for me.
You count too fast.
You haven't been hired yet.
You said you needed men to lay track.
I know what I said.
Pete.
Yeah?
- New john, huh?
- Yeah, wants to be.
Well?
This one wasn't sent to us.
He just walked in.
Oh, I see.
- What do you think?
- Damion will be very interested.
That's what I thought.
- What is Damion?
- He's an investigator for the railroad.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come in.
Damion, we might have something for you.
New john, walked in out of nowhere, asked to be put on tracklaying.
- Chinese?
- Big one.
All right.
Let's take a look at him.
- And get Joe.
- Go on in.
You're not full Chinese, are you?
My father was American.
Like you.
Joe?
All right.
Now, do you recognize this man?
Are you sure, Joe?
Now, it was dark when you saw him.
Yeah, but it lit up.
And I saw the face clear.
And I ain't never gonna forget it.
This ain't him.
All right.
Thanks.
- What's your name?
- I am Caine.
- I'm sorry, I have to check everyone.
- Why?
We've had a series of explosions around here.
That's how the boy was hurt.
Someone's trying to roll up our track and maybe us along with it.
I could not do such a thing.
I am sorry any man can.
This man is a will-o'-the-wisp.
One minute, he's here.
The next, he's gone.
- I hope you can stop him.
- I'll stop him.
You're free to go, Caine.
What do we do with him?
You said he wanted to work.
Let him work.
All right, come on.
Put that tie down.
Get that rail down here.
Come on.
Come on, move it there.
Move it along.
Honest day's work, honest day's wages.
Come on.
You're getting paid good wages.
Move it out.
Come on.
Come on.
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Come, come, come, come.
Get that lined up there.
That's it.
Move it along.
Honest day's work, honest day's wages.
Come on.
All right, line it up.
Come on, move it.
I will work more slowly.
No, no.
The foreman will be angry with you as he is with me.
Then they will take more money from your pay.
Come on, swing that sledge, old man.
You people down there, what are you doing?
Come on, get up here, go to work.
They are worse with us since our countryman has caused them trouble.
What do you know of this man?
He strikes with the surprise of a snake and the strength of a tiger.
Is it strength to use explosions to harm a small boy?
All of us are harmed.
If one Chinese brings evil, they expect evil from all Chinese.
Please, take this.
They permit us this.
They know we will work twice as hard once we are refreshed.
Here, you can get rid of them rags you got on.
Come on, let's go.
Get up.
Get up, old man.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?
- I'm putting you on guard duty at the bridge.
- Guard duty?
- I'm very tired.
- Well, maybe I'll give you an easier shift tomorrow.
Come on, now.
Not you.
I don't know about you yet.
Please...
You wear the robes of a Shaolin master.
They are my own.
Master Li?
We could not be sure you were alive.
As you see...
I had heard that you were in this country.
Your exploits have preceded you.
You do me honor.
May one ask why you left China?
Fleeing the same enemy as yourself, master.
The emperor.
A most imperfect movement, Disciple Caine.
Fortune, not skill, achieved the result.
May I be instructed, Master Li?
Let us repeat the movements.
You see?
Yes.
I will try to improve, master.
Kwan Li of the family of Kwan Chou of the province of Hupeh?
Yes.
A message for you.
- Speak.
- It was the order of the emperor that you be killed.
- Why?
Your family has been decreed guilty of treason.
That is not true.
The emperor's edict makes it the truth whatever the truth.
Does my family still live?
Their death was to follow quickly upon yours.
- I must go to Hupeh.
- At once.
Forgive me if I have injured you.
Do you know that I have sent for you?
I felt it.
Do you wish to learn why?
If such is your wish.
You have been in the work camp.
Have you heard nothing?

We will speak again.
I will come to you.
You do me honor.

Come on, get this man out of here!
Come on, let's hurry up.
Hurry up!
Get him out.
Hurry!
Come on, let's get some shovels, and let's get these guys out of here.
Hurry up.
Let's get some men.
Get these shovels.
Come on.
- Is he hurt badly?
- Yes, very badly.
I'm sorry.
What kind of thing is it to take an old man on guard duty after a long day's labor?
I'm not the track boss.
How bad is the damage?
The bridge is a complete wreck.
We've lost a week, at least.
- That'll make somebody very happy.
- You sure he ain't the one?
No, but I think he knows more than we do.
I could prod him a little.
That's my job.
Caine?
Come on, you men, let's go.
- Gets worse and worse.
- Worse?
People hurt, damaged.
He's like a ghost.
But he has been seen.
That doesn't seem to bother him.
He was seen again tonight.
Yet they do not know him.
You know what they say.
All Chinese look alike to white men.

You walk very quietly.
Now, that's one thing that they say this man I'm looking for does also.
Yet Joe has told you I am not that man.
Is there a doctor?
They don't think we need a doctor.
But they think we need an investigator.
I must attend my friend.
Work for the railroad and return a rich man to Siangfan.
You see how rich I have become.
And I may never see Siangfan again.
You cannot be certain.
I cannot believe...
Believe the man who did all this damage is Chinese.
He would not hurt us.
He would not hurt us.
My master.
You do not wear the garments I gave you.

No seed remains to link us to the future.

Is that it?
You're not a tracklayer, Caine.
Now, what brought you to Station 431?
My own path.
And that path, I suppose, has no connection with the mystery man?
Do you approve of what he's doing?
He does not care if I approve or disapprove.
If you find this man who is doing these things what will you do to him?
They'll put him on trial, and if he's found guilty, hang him.
Please, excuse me.
Sir.
You are Damion?
- Yes.
- The investigator for the railroad?
That's right.
You are well armed.
Do I know you?
You must answer that.
Well, what do you want?
To be of service to you.
How?
Take your rifle.
- Why?
- This man you are looking for I know him.
- You know him?
- And can lead you to him.
- Now?
- Yes.
Follow me.
- How do you know him?
- I have dealt with him.
- Helped him?
- He needs no help.
Who are you?
I am a john.
Is that your name?
You are not interested in my name.
You want the man who blows up bridges.
Yeah?
I am looking for Mr. Damion.
He ain't here.
Where is he?
I don't know.
He went off somewhere with the tea john.
Just the two of them?
I didn't see no one else.
It is not far now.
Are you afraid?
I asked you before.
Who are you?
It is of no matter.
We are here.
- There's no one here.
- No one?
You.
- No.
- Yes.
I am the man you are looking for.
I don't believe you.
I think you do.
All right, I do.
Why do you do this?
You must be shown the weakness you take for strength.
If this man dies others will take his place.
- Stronger?
They will not yield.
Are they Shaolin masters?
No.
Do you believe you can stop me?
I will have to try.
Kwan Li, stop.
I am not Kwan Li.
- May I go?
- Go.
Kwai Chang, I called you here.
Now I tell you leave.
Who is he, Caine?
How many other people is he gonna kill?
You tried to stop him.
You can do no more.
I can do one thing.
- Pete?
- Yeah, Damion.
Arrest this man.
- Caine?
But he...
- You heard me.
Lock him up.
Come on out, Caine.
Damion wants to see you.
I would like to see him.
Nothing bothers you, does it?
It would seem that way to you.
Over there.
Let's take a ride.
How do you feel?
A question I must ask you.
You save my life, I throw you in jail, and you're not angry?
Are you not holding me for a purpose?
I guess you know you're the only hope I have of bringing him in.
Can I count on you?
Why should I do this?
Maybe because you feel enough outrage at the harm he's causing.
I could feel the same outrage at the railroad.
I should quit.
I'm no match for him.
It is true.
You are not.
Trying to cheer me up?
I was at his mercy yesterday.
I was frightened.
Didn't help having two guns and a knife.
He would've finished me off if you hadn't shown up.
How'd you happen to follow us?
That is between me and him, not you.
You can't leave me out of it.
I wanna back you up.
- What?
- There must be things that you want.
Things that I can get you.
Not me, but the people who hired me.
They want to track this man down, and they can be very generous.
I am not a bounty hunter.
I wasn't talking about money.
So you do not capture him, but you have me.
Let's walk.
There are ways of getting rid of this.
The men who run this railway have a lot of influence.
They could get a crime off the books.
A crime committed in China?
If they could pull it off, you'd be a free man.
And for this questionable freedom I must surrender my friend?
Your friend?
Remember, I saw the two of you together.
Would he be as scrupulous about you?
Yes.
What would happen if I turned you in?
I would be sent back to China.
And be beheaded.
I'm not a sheriff.
I don't work for the government.
You must do what your conscience tells you.
What do you owe this man?
Much.
Much.
I would say so.
You are still here.
As you see.
Despite my order.
The investigator has asked me to betray you.
Betray me.
It is of no consequence.
Hi, what's this?
We feel refreshed when we drink tea.
I thought you would like coffee.
Thank you, john.
I was about to fall asleep.
It smells good.
Pass me a cup of that.
Oh, that looks good too.
That's good.
Good and strong.
You know, Pete, what this really needs is a good shot of whiskey.
Then you will fall asleep, Stanley.
I didn't think that was funny.
- You didn't think so?
- No.
I thought it was funny.
I thought it was very funny.
- I still think it's a great idea.
- Yeah, we should do this every night.
With the shot of whiskey.
With the shot of whiskey.
You have been taught that you dare not disobey your master.
Yet I must if I believe my master is wrong.
I am Shaolin, but I am also a man.
I feel pain, grief, the sorrow of loss.
- How can we question the ways of destiny?
- I can and do.
All we may question are the ways of men.
Are not emperors men?
Was it not men that built the train that crushed my nephew to death?
And may a man not strike back?
There will be people in here in the morning.
- Company men, bosses.
- Men.
And outside, those you are doing this for you will kill them too.
I must stop you.
You of all men, the last I would wish to harm.
You are the master.
I am the student.
I wear the garments of the nephew you have loved.
Yet if I were he, if I were your son still, I should do this.
I must.
You insist.
Let it be.
Now call the investigator to arrest me.
I only meant to show you what you yourself have taught me.
No man is omnipotent.
It is not for me now to tell you what to do.
You are the master.
You got paid.
- Looks like you're ready to leave.
- Yes.
Settled what I had to.
Did you go into the headquarters building last night?
What does it matter?
Well, somebody left all this, and we found it this morning.
Nobody saw him, as usual.
Now, wait.
Aren't you gonna tell me how you did it?
It is nothing to do with you.
But the results do.
I had a conference with the bosses this morning.
I made a few suggestions.
Nothing much, just safer working conditions.
A doctor in the camp.
They wouldn't listen.
Perhaps they will when the explosions end.
No.
I didn't deliver a culprit.
They wanted a carcass.
They, too, look for revenge.
Yeah.
Joe.
Joe, let me help you with that.
Please, I do not need this.
Thanks.
I've done my last job for the railroad.
You will improve nothing by going away.
But I don't have to be a part of it.
I think that's something I picked up from you.
I said that?
You don't have to put everything in words.
Can I give you a ride?
I thank you.
But I think it is better that I go my own way.
Why?
Where are you going?
I may never know.
[ENGLISH

I do not know, there, on the highway.
Well that leads us to what I call Zone "B" and costs 1 dollar extra.
All right, now let's go.
If they were in zone "A" ...
It would be $ 1 for turning on the car And $ 1 for zone "A" ...
But as you are in zone "B" It will be 1 dollar to turn it on ... $ 1 for the area "A" And $ 1 more for zone "B".
That and the initial customer price in Gives a total of $ 3.50 each.

In a moment, Track.
Playing that song again?
They said about Carter, who has everything The department with regular salary.
We're good like this.
Well, some weeks are good.
Others not, I was thinking that if ...
If we had a better salary We would count on being more regular.
And taxes would rise, People would not like that.
And people vote.
Better than those who break the law pay Taxes and not taxpayers ...
Is the best way to do it, As far as I'm concerned
Keep it regular, it's work from the Department.
And maybe we would make Johnny Raise your taxi fare ... ha ha.
That investigator from the tax office Came to see me again
What did he want?
Oh, he asked a lot of questions.
On accidents.
What did you say to him?
Nothing to say.
Roy.
I will be another time.
Hi.

But it's much better now.
Hello, Sheriff Roy!
How is it going?
- All right.
I'll tell them it's the best car that I've seen.
Sheriff Roy would dry it with Your exhaust pipe!
He has no chance ...
No car around here can Beat the California Kid.
Not even Sheriff Roy's.
Sheriff Roy has a racing engine With double carburetor and all ...
I installed it.
Yes I know ... but still, it does not have Opportunity against "California Kid".
I'm with you, Eli.
Well done, Eli!
Hey, mister ... what was I doing over there?
Just looking at the junk.
And trying not to break the laws.

In the back of this car?
I asked you a question!
We were not doing anything Sheriff Roy, I swear ...
Well, you two, get out.
Are you aware of the fact that Sissy Berry is a minor, eh?
Yes sir.
Contributing to an offense of abuse of Minors is a very serious thing.
All right?
Oh, Sheriff Roy.
I, I ...
Give me your driver's license.
I have seen them grow since childhood.
I do not allow this kind of thing.
I'll let them go this time.
Can you hear me, Tom?
See me again a week later Friday and I will return this.
Until then, I'll suspend you The privilege of driving.
Yes sir.
Sissy Berry, I should put you on My knees and whip you.

To the owner of that car.
Do not.
Jerry, have you seen someone come out of that Showy machine that is outside?
I do not know who, I was late here.
Maybe he was here early.
Umm, I have to go.
We'll see you later, Roy.
Then we sat down and We talk one day
I guess I was the That spoke more.
My husband just stopped and He went out the door.
He did not even warn me.
Frank used to say that I was proud.
I asked him where he was going, when he would return And that is what I would do.
And you figured out what he was doing?
Yes ... of course I did.
I went out every morning with The empty lunch box.
And I would go home with her Full of money.
He found a tree that gave money.
Sometimes I get letters from him.
Usually on my birthday.
And it's always the same thing.
Maggie, I love you.

Thank you.
You have a nice place.
Thank you.
Are you comfortable here?
Yes.
You are different.

The village women are Different from those of the city.
I did not mean that.
I only know one thing.
What is it?
You're here because you have something With Sheriff Roy Childress.
So you think!
Yesterday, after you left the picnic area, He looked very worried.
I had not seen it since A long time ago.
Not since the accident.

His wife Kathy and her son.
What happened?
They both died.
On the main street, just at noon.
A driver rolled over and fled.
Roy hurt a lot.
She swore she'd find him someday.
He never did.

I do not want to be with him anyway.
Come on, let's take a seat.
- Insurance.

Do you have a car, Eli?
I have one!
Buzz gave me the old two-door.

If you had one now we could go for a walk.
I know a place.
I can not, Sissy.
Not until ...
Forget this.
Me and Tom used to go out when I was learning.
But are you afraid or something?
Maybe I can in the morning, just for a while.
We can go swimming in the river.

You're still here!

I've been here all my life.
It's not like other towns You know, just ...
It does not change much.

Yes very soon.
When Frank got into trouble ...
When they came and took him away ...
I felt I should go And start over.
So I sold everything we had.
And ...
I went out and bought that trailer.
That way I started to feel better.
I felt really good.
Because I knew I could go Wherever I wanted
But I never did, Michael.
I once thought I would.
But when the time comes, I It was scary, so I never left.
And there I knew I would never do it.
I just want you to know...
That ... as it is and it is well.
Because the time we were Together, it was really good.

Maybe ... maybe I will.
State Line 3 miles
Decrease 30 mph
Is there anything good there?
Only the best.
THE SLAP
There's no time!
I have to meet my father at the new place.
- Let's hurry then!
- What about my scooter?
- You don't need it...it's nearby.
- Sure I do!
- Pretty cool, isn't it?
- There's no alarm?
Nope.
No elevator either.
We'll save money on rent.
Hurry!
- I paid them an advance.
- How will you manage?
I told them I'd pay more in July, then I wrote a letter to my mom.
I think my lung is broken, it's going "tac tac." Think it's serious?
Get serious, it's nothing.
Move on.
We're here.
Keys...
What do you know about lungs?
They'll ask me that in ten days, I don't want to think about it.
Check it out.
So?
Verdict?
Well it's not...
You said a studio.
But it's nice.
Better than my room at La Cité.
I'll be re-painting the floor white.
Rémi will help me.
And we can buy ice skates.
No, but when we have guests, we can push the bed and have a sofa...
I got a head rush...
- Why did you carry up your bike?
- Someone stole my lock.
Isn't it time you told your father?
You like it?
Yep.
- Hi Madeleine!
- Hi!
- Hi Dad!
- Hi.
Give me a break, I'm really busy and I don't have a car.
But your father has his class at two.
In downtown Paris, the scooter is faster than a car anyway.
O.K. she's here, so show her.
The two rooms here are same as the blueprints, but come see your room.
We decided to put it here, it's bigger and you'll have a view of the gardens.
- Facing the courtyard?
- Well, yes.
Here by the side door you can come and go as you please... for privacy.
I have to go, I'll be at the agency office all week.
Thank you, I'll call you Tuesday.
- So?
Everything fine?
- Yes.
I mean, this, you're not...
you're happy?
- Well yes!
- Then say so!
- I said I liked it.
- No you didn't say anything!
You don't look around, you don't ask questions, just stand there.
What's up?
Are you hungry?
- Who taught her to smoke?
- Don't look at me!
Don't start.
It must have cost a lot.
Darn right, hope you appreciate it.
You're really something, you know.
C'mon, it's nothing, it's a new place, it's great... but you take on a tragic air, it's like...
I take on a tragic air?
Me?
Goodbye Madeleine, it's very beautiful, I'm very happy, bye!
She's really out of control.
- Are you coming Madeleine?
- Yes.
STRIKE TO PROTEST STUDENT EXPULSION 2:00- 2:15
You guys are kidding me, no?
What class was our expelled student in?
Final year at Lyon.
What did he do?
He had his feet on his desk and didn't want to move them.
Very well.
Let's go, break this up!
I'll get you for this!
I don't know, next thing I know he's punching me.
- What are you doing here?
-Can I take the scooter?
I got dinner.
- Can't Rémi take you?
- He has plans.
He can take you home though.
- Is there enough gas?
- Yes, if the headlight goes out, just tap on it.
- Hey, what about my running shoes?
- Should I go barefoot?
Next time...
- You're not going out tonight are you?
- No, why?
Because, umm, Just asking that's all.
- In that case...
-Ohhh
- Never mind "Ohhhs"
- That's right.
He'd better not, I can be violent.
And if I go out anyway?
Then I'll go back to Irène, and have the last laugh!
She's soooo mine.
I'm telling you.
He's been here 20 years...
He's taught honours classes for five or six years, never been a problem.
Well there is one now.
One in hospital, the other at the dentist...big problem.
Excuse me?
Do you want to speak to him?
Can you come get me, Pierre?
- Am I free to leave?
- Yes, for the time being.
No, I wasn't hurt.
- Good evening Madeleine!
- Good evening, my dear.
- Is Dad here?
- No.
- It's day old, I didn't have any time...
- Doesn't matter.
You're going out?
- Yes.
Where are you going?
- To the Morettis.
- Playing cards?
What?
I love you.
I love you too...
What's wrong?
Did you talk with your father?
- About what?
- About us.
You're getting married?
No, we're not getting married.
Well...
I think I'll go on ahead.
We said 8 o'clock.
Tell him to meet me, unless he wants me to go alone, like the last time.
I'll say he's making you study.
Speaking of...how's it going?
It's nuts.
Closer exams get,the less I know!
Apparently it's common.
Say, love's not always a party, is it?
Where did you park your car?
It must have been impounded.
Along with my things probably.
The Education Ministry called already, they're sending an inspector in the A.M.
Very well then.
It's Charvin.
You know him?
Oh yes.
That cop needs to miss less than 8 days' duty.
You'll have to pay a fine.
If it's worse than that, it won't be a laughing matter.
Do you want me to stay for dinner?
No, I have to go out with Madeleine.
Good night, Pierre.
And thank you.
I'm sorry.
I'm very late.
Don't worry, I'll go alone and explain.
I have the car, now I'm used to this.
Sleep well.
I had a few tales to tell you, but if you'd rather go play cards.
That's right.
I'd rather go play cards.
I'm cutting in. she wouldn't say that, I didn't even know her back then.
No way!
Impossible!
Say what?
I'm so sure!
Could he do that and study both at once, maybe nights.
Hang on!
- Hi Dad.
- Hi.
That's not possible!
Don't talk crazy!
Tell me exactly what she said!
What a...
No!
No!
Madeleine went on ahead.
Hurry up!
Yes, I saw her leave, but I'm not going.
Where are the kitchen matches?
Here!
No, this summer if I pass we're taking a road trip with Marc and the others.
Maybe Yugoslavia or Alsace, or some such place.
Is it O.K. if you have dinner alone?
I'm going out after all.
If I fail, please shoot me, what else?
Because if I have to start over again...
Wait.
I can't hear you.
I don't hate it, but I can't say I'm in heaven either.
So if I fail and have to do first year over...
I'm off to DuCellier's for dinner.
The parents are strict, can't be late.
Sure, me too.
No.
Yes!
Yes!
Bye!
Another new record.
If I need money for driving lessons, is it a huge problem?
You need a licence to get in to second year?
Didn't you know?
No, it's so I can share with driving this summer.
Don't move.
Share what driving?
What's this Yugoslavia thing about?
Didn't I tell you this already?
Mind you, it's not a sure thing.
- Is that the time?
- What did you think?
Gotta go!
Tell Madeleine I borrowed her bracelet.
Where are you going?
Some friends.
You don't know them.
Don't worry.
I'm studying hard, you know.
I just need a break and I won't stay out late.
Marc, he's that boy in my class?
Morillon?
Yes.
Is he a good student?
Sure, when he doesn't stay out late.
That reminds me...
We'll need to talk about something.
When?
One of these days!
This results in a morphostructural style, particularly complex, but very banal on the contours of the Mediteranean.
We can distinguish these components on the schema...
Please excuse me, the headmaster needs to see you right away.
O.K. well, take five.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
So, they don't know anything?
Who?
About what?
Your students.
You know, about yesterday.
I don't think so, no.
Let's start, our friend is in a hurry.
The police officer is out of hospital, as expected, it's getting around.
You'll need to lie low for a while.
Yes, instead of suspension, Rabel offers a transfer, Ministry would O.K. that.
Wait, two guys punching a student...
Wouldn't you have done something?
And I'm the one picking up the check?
Next school year, two options are yours:
Toulouse or Colmar, but with freshmen.
Senior classes are already spoken for.
Very well, I'll hand in my resignation tomorrow, Pierre.
Are you serious?
Pedestrians over here!
- Back into drive...first gear...
- It's no big thing, you know, you come home and say, "Dad, I love a boy, and I want to go live with him."
- If he says...
- Right over here.
Turn signal.
...you know, "Get married first," tell him we're not in the Dark Ages.
- What's your problem?
!
- Shut your face!
Very distinguished, very classy!
Listen to me Marc:
I get to my lesson and you're already in the backseat...
You're talking in my ear...
I'll crash into someone, then you'll get your way.
Easy on the clutch.
Turn signal.
Second gear.
Good.
And we have a look in our...
Rearview mirror.
There you go.
Truth is you're afraid of your father.
Time goes by, you'll be an old maid, with plenty of time to cry about it.
- It's such a sad story.
- Why don't you talk to him?
"Good day sir, I want to live with Isabelle, goodbye sir."
I may be a wimp, but you're a man.
Dad should be easy for you.
A real pushover.
What's with this play?
!
Stay in your lanes over there!
Let's go you losers!
Get to the net!
Look at those fancy moves, he fell on his face!
Hey there champ, word is you're buying drinks!
- He got his marks?
- Yes!
He passed, we're celebrating!
Yay!
You're graduating?
Easy courses, anyone could pass those!
That hurt, stop hitting!
What about military service?
Did they ask?
Yeah, I'll get my orders, but I don't know when.
- What's the score?
- 0-0
Why is your dad with the students?
Students and faculty against the alumni.
Looks like he's having a fine time!
Go team, go!
What?
Going alright?
Position!
Position!
What are you doing?
!
Sir, ummm...
Sir...
Yeah!
We'll have to get one back, let's not freak out.
- Are you O.K.?
- Yeah, I'll be alright.
- Need my soap?
- I'm fine, thanks.
Again, sorry about before.
I mean, I shouldn't apologize.
No problem.
In the end, overall...
They won a cheap one.
What else was there?
Oh yes, did Isabelle tell you about the room?
What room?
She wants to get a room in the city.
To uhhh...be independent.
You know at 18, soon to be 19, she's no infant.
I know these things.
Morillon, you have a comb?
Sure, pocket with the cigarettes.
So I've been meaning to have a word with her father.
Still a bit over here.
Not easy to know what they want.
Isabelle falls in love every 5 minutes.
Wanting to switch studies, or move.
It's not only her, you know.
Do you have sisters, Morillon?
No.
If you did, they would be the same way.
All of them.
They follow their whims, that's life these days.
Luckily, we are there for them.
Me for my daughter, and you for your sisters.
Luckily.
Where will you go?
How old are you?
What will you do?
I have that book to do with Pierre.
Finding illustrations, everything.
And my program starts again in the fall I could also teach private school.
Seems every time I do something you don't like, you ask me my age.
3 programs on Napoleon won't fill up your schedule.
Napoleon, who's Napoleon?
The series is 20th century with 15 episodes, so there.
And all this is for your pride?
Did you ever ask yourself if maybe there was something more?
Like what?
This year, 2 or 3 times, after an hour in class... the classes would be over and...
I told myself I still had a lot left to teach them.
But I no longer know how.
What happened?
An hour of my life, an hour of theirs, but it was no longer the same hour.
That's it.
You only have this suitcase?
Yes, the other ones stayed back at my place.
Who told you you couldn't bring them?
Nobody did.
But who asked me to bring them here?
Let me.
There's hardly anything, what are you bringing back?
1 or 2 small spoons, a ladle, 2 or 3 ashtrays.
A letter came today from Australia for Isabelle.
Yes, I saw it.
Do you talk to her sometimes?
About what?
- About Hélène.
- No.
She never re-married?
No, since we're not divorced.
Oh yes, I was forgetting.
No you weren't forgetting.
What are you doing here?
How did you find me?
Rémi told me, this afternoon, after the game.
Well, yeah.
How does he know where you are when I don't?
Shhhhh!
Because he found me the job, all you had to do was ask him.
- What job?
- This one!
Why did your father say you fall in love every five minutes?
Dad said that?
Darn right, he's throwing you over old girl.
Now answer!
Ow!
Hands off!
What's with the jacket on a warm night?
I borrowed it, for this summer.
We're not going to Yugoslavia.
Oh yeah, it's news to me.
Where then?
To La Clusaz in Haute-Savoie, where the action is!
What are we going to do there?
That I'll explain later.
Don't sit down!
So you spoke to my father?
- No.
I couldn't.
- What do you mean?
Why?
Because.
When he looks at me like in class I just can't take it.
I'll write him.
That's pitiful!
It's like I'm leaving a man for a mouse.
Say that again!
Quiet!
I told you to be quiet!
You're going to repeat what you just said!
- Watch the jacket!
- Get out!
I'm sick of this!
- Don't try to leave me Isabelle!
- Out, I said!
So he breaks an ashtray.
I warned you I was capable of violence!
There you go, now he's awake.
How do you do it?
Will you be quiet?
!
Go to sleep.
Stop!
Bedtime!
Look at him now, I'm going to deal you a hard one!
Good evening.
Everything go O.K.?
A perfectly uneventful evening.
Good, do you have any money on you?
You broke an ashtray?
Me?
No.
Must have been the cat.
Where is the cat?
Your mother will be waiting at the station?
- Probably, yes.
- I hope the weather is fine.
Same here Jean, I hope the weather is fine.
Simon will be waiting too?
No, we'll meet him at the sea shore, if he still has the house there.
What do you care now, anyway?
You might get a message for me, I asked about a job in Geneva.
As an interpreter?
Yes, August 10th to September 5th.
They were supposed to call.
O.K. well, What do I say?
That I don't live there, give them my new address.
For Isabelle, you'll explain?
Then again, no, don't explain too much.
Let's not bother writing each other.
It's late, I'll call back tomorrow when I wake up, kisses.
You know what Picasso said to Cocteau?
Is that who you were talking to?
Well, no.
- You want to know what he said?
- Sure, yes.
That he was amazed when taking a bath that he didn't melt like sugar.
He was convinced it was a miracle!
Christine read Cocteau's book "Opium".
Ahhh.
You smoked a lot of opium?
Oh, often, that's all I smoke.
Did Madeleine go alright?
Yes, really, yes.
- When is she coming back?
- Where did I put my glasses?
Not going to bed?
No, I was putting away books, not that we're moving tomorrow, but there are so many.
I should give some away.
Did you have a good day?
A stellar day, a banner day, yes.
Well, I'm turning in.
Good night.
Lights out before 2, alright?
Sure.
What if I said I want to go with a boy?
Like, I mean, move in with him?
You got a letter from Australia.
Mom, yes, I read it.
She's well?
Yes.
They're coming to Europe.
These are for the reject pile.
I want to go live with Marc.
Have you seen yourself, with your bare knees and schoolgirl socks?
I can wear stockings, if that makes a big difference...
You know, these days, society's not...
People fall in and out of love, it's no big thing, look around.
Things change.
What are you doing, Isabelle?
You teaching me about life?
No, but with you even simple things are complicated.
I know what you'll say:
I'm only 18, no job, Marc neither...
We don't know where we're going...
My exams are next week...
The usual this, that and the other.
I would have said "This, that and the other?"
Sure, go ahead and mock me.
So is it yes or no?
I think you know.
By what right?
You ask and I answer you.
Now if you want, you can leave anyway.
You're saying no for yourself!
Not for me.
No more games, I said no, so go to bed!
I'm like a queen, two husbands, three homes.
Marc loves me and makes me laugh, Dad makes me cry and I love him.
I'm sick of this, and still write in my diary.
I'll throw it away soon enough.
When I think of my exams in 4 days, I feel my stomach knot up.
There's no pick-ups in September, it's more a contest than just exams.
And it lasts 3 whole days.
Even if we get average grades, we may not get in to second year.
we have to be among the best.
Friday 21st.
Christine's friend got us into second-year autopsy labs.
I wanted to be a surgeon, I may have to rethink that plan.
First operation, I'd faint on a patient.
- ...we will be removing the brain...
Marc is becoming very, very, very, very irritating.
Spying on me, summer plans to hide me in La Clusaz with aunts who make cheese.
- But I saw him!
- You saw him do what?
!
Isabelle!
Saturday 22nd.
I got a long letter from Madeleine.
It was very sad and very funny.
I understood.
Dad says nothing.
I stepped around his books all day.
He took a lot of phone calls.
I wonder if there is another woman already.
He's working hard.
Suddenly, he told me he was quitting teaching to write.
I think he could do both.
That's his business.
I'm not his wife.
Still, something fishy's going on.
Sunday.
It's raining and I'm not sure of anything.
I said I was studying with Christine, but really Marc's taking me to La Tosca.
He loves the lyrics.
I hope we have fun, it's my first time at opera.
Next we're picking up Rémi.
I really like Rémi.
He found a job while waiting to leave for the army.
Next we'll drink punch at Marc's.
He'll ask me to bed.
I'll say no.
He'll shout.
So will I.
I'll slam the door.
Then once again shed tears in the streets.
It will be very late.
Not sleeping?
Have you seen the time?
Aren't your written exams tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday?
Yes, I'm going straight to bed.
You wore makeup?
Well yes, why?
To go study at Christine's?
Sure, why not?
Is it forbidden?
Are those already the proofs of your book?
No, they're's just the mock-ups.
Besides that, did you study hard?
Oh la la, yes, phew!
Say, about Christine...
She called from the countryside.
Seems she had an awful train voyage.
I hate this!
I hate this!
I hate everything!
Who is it?
What do you mean "Who is it?"
Well, come in.
Here...
Take these tomorrow, I'm afraid I'll forget.
What is it?
You're not giving me drugs?
It's some vitamins.
And I bought brioches too.
So we'll leave about 8-8:15, sleep well.
So it's over with Madeleine?
I saw she wrote you a letter.
Yes, I left it on the T.V. for you to read.
- I can read it?
- Sure you can.
Well then, I already read it.
So it happens?
We can break up without one rejecting the other?
That can happen, yes.
And Mom?
Mom what?
Nothing.
Now you should sleep, or you'll be a mess tomorrow.
When she left for Australia...
She was leaving me?
Shouldn't say those things Isabelle, That would be...
No.
You were 8 when you lived with her, so when she had to leave, we agreed... that I should take you.
And then she stayed over there.
That's all.
In Adelaide, she said you separated at first beacause of another woman.
How did she mention it?
Just like that, that's all.
It was your fault then?
Well, she wasn't exactly...patient.
- Come on!
O.K. good night, sleep well.
The other woman?
Was that Madeleine already?
No.
So you've had a lot of women?
No.
Place your student I.D. in front of you.
It will be returned after the test in exchange for your copy of the exam.
You may not leave the exam room until a half hour after tests are given out.
You may use no documents, books, lecture notes, photocopies, or dictionaries.
- This was awful!
- Whatever, I didn't make it.
Don't mention the time.
What time are you working?
I'll be with the 8 o'clock brigade.
Enough!
I've had three servings, I'll explode!
Telephone call for you, by God!
Oh, I've been shouting for a while, but with your Negro music...
We're celebrating my brother's diploma.
Yeah yeah...yeah yeah.
Hello?
Oh hello sir.
Not here.
We're having Rémi's party.
I called her, but nobody was home.
No, I didn't see her this afternoon.
Want me to ask Marc?
Morillon is there?
Put him on the line, please.
What does he want?
Hello Morillon?
Come on over for dinner.
Sure right now.
Why?
It's not dinnertime?
Sure, but, ummm...
Uhhh, it's because I had this cocktail, uhhh...
I don't understand what you're saying.
What cocktail?
No time to talk, I'm cooking.
Big surprise.
Get yourself over here!
Hello?
- Isabelle?
- Yes.
Don't come in until I tell you.
Just a second.
Mademoiselle Douélan.
What's this?
I didn't call.
I couldn't...
Oh, my, my.
I told Pierre: "She'll return as always, cowed, wrong answers, a catastrophe.
It's Waterloo, not even sure she got her name right.
And in the end, like in high school, she'll get all A's."
Sure!
Sure!
Sit down, don't move, tonight I'm on the clock.
Round two tomorrow, but tonight, no more exam talk.
Off-lim-its!
You know what I made for dinner?
You cooked?
I just completed an extraordinary effort.
And now there he is.
Nothing.
A complete blank.
Damn.
It's coming.
Are you seated?
I couldn't even tell him.
He has his own problems.
They're saying he got fired.
What?
Why?
Maybe not fired, but they say he punched some policemen.
Here we are!
He had a good job.
Setting the clocks in city churches, since he fixed clocks.
He was a real firebrand, but he was my dad.
With me he was...
We really loved each other.
Isabelle never knew him.
Let's go Morillon, we have to finish these.
I was kidding, I'm full.
C'mon, c'mon.
Just say you didn't like them.
It was good, really.
So, another little spoonful?
Pass me your plate.
Isabelle?
No way, I'm quite sure.
I have to hurry things up, I need to pass by Pierre's.
How's it going?
Not when he edits, he only types with one finger.
Good night Isabelle.
Good night, sir.
And thanks!
Tomorrow I can't drive you, my class is at 8 o'clock.
Last course of the year.
I won't go tomorrow.
Isn't the test tomorrow?
Yes, but I wont go.
There's no longer a point.
This morning I handed in a blank test, pretty much.
There you have it.
In any case, with the weighting, I could never catch up.
I'm on vacation.
What happened?
It was Structure and Histophysiology of Exocrine Glandular Epitheliums.
I was frozen in the headlights.
What would you have put?
Don't speak like that, Isabelle.
You ran a red light, didn't you see?
Anyways, I'm sick of medicine.
I despise it.
You spoke of a calling, risking your life healing fellow men.
That's over, I'm not generous anymore!
They can be sick without me!
So what do you want?
Freedom!
But that's not a career.
You're might be right, you know.
That was uncalled for.
It's because things aren't going well with me.
For the last hour, the way you've been talking to me, you're like a stranger.
...always telling me what to do...
I'm sick and tired of all of this!
Get to your room!
Get going!
Hop!
You don't scare me.
Send me to the exam wearing a veil, I still won't write it!
Because you think you frighten me?
You speak poorly.
You work poorly.
You dance poorly.
Growing up poorly!
But you don't frighten me Isabelle.
But I'm in pain!
Sure, excuse me, I forgot...
That's why you didn't take it seriously?
To live otherwise?
Not otherwise!
Other things!
With what?
With that clumsy boy who can't even string a sentence together?
That's a man to you?
I never said I wanted a man!
I don't care about a man, I just wanted a boyfriend!
And I hope he doesn't screw up, because you sure did with your diplomas!
Who told you about that?
Everyone knows.
Everyone's talking.
So spare me, or I'll...!
Morning.
Is Christine home?
No.
She didn't sleep here?
No.
Where are you coming from?
Nowhere.
I'm leaving.
I came to ask Christine to lend me some money.
C'mon.
Isabelle.
Yeah?
Hang on there.
Mr. Douélan...
Miss Saki, a, uhh...classmate.
So Morillon, you don't know where she went?
Who?
Isabelle.
She didn't sleep at home.
No!
Morillon...
She'll surely get in touch.
So as soon as you hear something, you telephone me!
I'm at school until 10, then back at home.
From now on, the responsibility is...
all in your hands.
Well sure, you tell her she can't live with me, but now I have to chase her?
In exchange, I promise not to...
Ahhhh, no, that's...
My handbag!
Don't come up!
Why not?
Get up there.
Is there room here?
Yes, I think so.
Thanks.
Tell Christine I'll write to her.
You're not leaving for your parents' place right away?
No.
Anyhow I got my army papers, I'm going in 8 days.
It's moving!
Go!
Rémi!
Can you give this to Marc?
I wrote it quickly, I had no time.
Think that's it?
Sure it is.
Rosewood Manor.
Just passing through or a planned excursion?
You've never heard of using a telephone?
No, things happened so fast.
I'll explain later.
This is Rémi Abellier.
Robert!
What's he saying?
He said you just arrived, and me that you wrote me from Australia.
You still don't speak any better?
Yes, but it depends.
When he speaks too quickly I lose track.
It's lovely!
Don't get excited, it's not ours.
Robert's lawyer is letting us use it.
Only 3 rooms are open, the others...
So...turn it on there...he makes me feel like we can live a calm simple life.
Never any showing each other up... and more importantly, never any showdowns.
Sure, I get you.
I'm saying, I feel good around him.
We may even get married.
I'd have to ask your father, because we said we wouldn't divorce.
Call him back, he may be home by now.
No, I just tried 5 minutes ago.
O.K. well time for a nosy mom question:
One bed or two?
What do you mean?
The young man, Rémi.
What are the matchups?
He's a friend's brother, you're silly, I met him on the boat.
Oh, O.K. two beds then.
Keep it simple.
In any case, I can't put him elsewhere.
You'll have to excuse this, but we're expecting Robert's two sons.
Getting along better with them?
Now, yes, especially since next year Frankie is off to college in Sydney.
Open the window, it's stifling.
And Jean?
How are things with his interpreter lady?
Fine, I guess.
What do you want me to say Morillon?
Go on.
I'm no Hercule Poirot!
I went all over!
I've been 83 km through Paris on a bike!
You can look at my odometer.
Hello?
Are you sleeping?
Yes.
Your mom's nice.
How old is she?
29 and a half.
So then you just turned 11?
Yes.
Your dad doesn't want to see her again?
What are you doing?
Just caresses, I don't dare kiss you directly.
A subtle approach.
No, go to sleep.
I'm telling you... it's better this way.
I can't sleep there, it's just too small.
So then we'll switch.
You won't tell me that you love me, will you?
I didn't come all this way to tell you I don't.
- Has it been a long time?
- Yes.
No. well I haven't counted.
In England?
What's she doing in England?
I'd sure like to know!
She's not exactly bending over explaining things.
Hold on, I'll read.
Her penmanship is lamentable.
I'll explain later...
It's raining...
Like that's important...
I'm sad...you can write eventually...
Rosewood Manor, Chilham, Kent.
That's it?
Nothing else?
Nothing more, well, the usual...
She adores me, I'm wonderful...
I don't love you anymore.
It's surely all my fault.
You know how love is...
Can't let it get to you.
Rémi called, he's in England with her at her mother's.
Her who?
Isabelle.
What?
Hi there.
But her mother's in Australia.
Don't think so.
What's Rémi doing with her?
That's despicable!
Excuse us, see you later.
Don't wear yourself out, power is down all over the neighborhood.
Is my daughter here?
Yes, mine is here also.
You could have warned me.
Same here.
They both just showed up yesterday.
They?
Who's "they"?
With her...ummm...
I don't know what you call him.
I don't call him anything!
I want to know who she's with!
Listen, don't be like this.
I'm way out of practice.
- Hélène...
- Here, grab this.
- Hélène, will you listen?
- Things good?
Sure, great, but I really get the feeling you...
Right away when I got the address, I tried to call.
Don't you have a phone in there?
Yes, but it's unlisted.
What does Robert do?
Robert.
There he is, I thought he was at tennis.
Mr. Dickinson, Monsieur Douélan.
Good day.
Why didn't you...talk to me...
Or write me?
You could have at least phoned.
I wanted to last night, but there was nobody home.
- I can't, I...
- Yes.
Let's eat then!
You know the Food and Agriculture Organization?
The FAO?
He's a part of that.
UNESCO asked him to study the soil resources.
In Australia.
In the desert.
He doesn't speak French at all?
No, not yet.
Thank you, thank you.
Bordeaux.
Yes, I can see that.
It's written on the bottle.
That's very kind of you.
Very kind, thank you.
And Rémi!
Sure, since there's now a Rémi.
Why do you say that?
I met him on the boat.
Yes I know.
You told me this twice already.
Are you hurt?
My apologies, I might have...
I'm so sorry.
Sorry what?
It happens.
Isabelle fetch another glass.
From his father's cellar.
How old is his father?
He's dead.
Oh.
What?
He can tell you don't know wines, but he forgives you.
He's a pretty funny guy.
I'll make your bed in the library?
You can share your bathroom?
Not at all, I found a small hotel up the hill.
I'll pick you up at 7, the plane's at 8.
Jean?
There's no point in...
Isabelle asked me to come live in Australia.
But why?
When?
Uhhm.
Now.
For what?
I can't keep this up.
Not only work, but all of it.
You know I love you, but I'm confused and don't have words to explain.
I might come back if I can't work over there, if...
Airplanes come and go all the time.
So.
If I hadn't come...
How would I have found out?
I wrote you a letter this morning.
You have, so to speak, thought this through?
I would prefer to think later.
In that case, good evening.
Sir!
Where are you coming from?
Jean!
She always said I'd take her back some day.
So take her!
Why are you running?
It's not me, it's she, I can't say "No" can I?
She's mine too dammit!
Come back inside.
Are you crazy?
What a jerk!
Stop it, this is stupid!
Leave him alone!
Like another cup?
We can't drive around like this all night.
Don't you want to turn back?
No.
Keep going.
Tired of this aren't you?
Of course.
I know you get chilly...
But a slicker as bedwear?
That's how it is.
Take it off.
Try it!
For what reasons?
By whose authority?
When I re-read what was in your letter,
I said "I can't send this!" and just threw it out.
That doesn't change a thing.
You know that, don't you?
I'll simply have another in the mail tomorrow morning.
Which I'll then throw out as well.
And since I have final say...
I'm headmaster, you know.
Go, it's green.
In addition, they dropped the idea of a quarantine.
They don't want you a martyr, as Charvin said.
You play right to him.
I don't want to see them anymore, Pierre.
I just can't.
What about your students?
Isn't it neat they know Burma produces tungsten, when an hour ago they didn't?
Don't start with me Pierre, I'm in no mood today.
Fine.
So, where are we eating?
I reserved at Enwe's.
Nice.
Hurry up then!
They'll refund you, or you'll sell back to someone else?
I'll find a buyer.
- Speculating, are you?
- Right.
I can't say I really understand this game.
Evenings, he explains plays.
I pretend to listen, but,
I wouldn't fight to know the score.
So Isabelle, I'll drop you off at the airport?
Yes, we should be going.
Goodbye ma'am.
And thank you for everything.
My pleasure, au revoir.
You'll make it to Paris tonight with your motorcycle?
Yes.
I'll drop Isabelle off at the plane and...
If you're not there tonight, I'm calling police!
You won't start mistrusting me?
It's not you I don't trust.
I'll try my best.
For some socks, a passport, it won't take 6 months.
A few other things I need...
Do they have modern hospitals in Adelaide?
Think that's just at home?
Over there it's just grass huts and Tiki dancers.
Emergency
Room 14, over there.
Thanks.
She left.
She's alright.
I'm fine too, just in observation until tomorrow.
They told me downstairs.
And?
The bandage?
Stitches from when I hit the headlight.
The dooooor!
They told me she'd been knocked out, then we got disconnected.
When it happened, she was...
We were worried for a while, since...
I don't know if you saw the motorcycle, but...
Are you O.K.?
So she came out of X-rays, and wanted to call but you'd left already.
When we said au revoir, had you both already decided to take the bike?
Yes.
Thanks for being honest.
What did her father say?
I don't know, apparently he fought off some attendants, and he took her away.
My leg!
Oh, sorry!
No, but, you've only been with your mother for less than a week, and I'm already picking you up at the lost and found.
What's this guy's problem?
You need to understand, my life these days... is not about Mom, or even you.
Only with you, I always have to walk on eggshells just to live.
I'm not sure what you're saying.
Even the littlest things with you,
I say I'm leaving for Australia, you storm out and go back to France.
We're here as always, but it can't go on like this.
We're happy, so don't let it be like this.
I'm a grown up now.
Oh.
I never noticed.
And your teaching situation?
Hold on, not all at once.
I'll explain it when we're home.
I'm not going home, I'm sleeping at Rémi's.
Rémi?
But he's at the clinic.
He's back home tomorrow.
I won't be alone to wait, his sister Christine will be there.
Au revoir.
I'll pick up some things tomorrow.
Do you know where my slicker is?
Which one?
The yellow one.
It's the only one I have.
I'll look around.
Sorry I'm late.
Hello.
They're so complicated in those places.
She left me all those forms to fill out.
Why didn't she fill them out herself?
I sent her to my guy at the passport office.
I already ordered, I have work to do at 2:15.
You got the Bouzy?
Nice of you to remember it.
Let's not go down memory lane, I'll never make it all the way.
What's that?
My hotel key.
I must have dropped it.
Your health.
When do you take the plane?
Tomorrow morning.
No, I mean the one for Australia.
Not sure.
We'll see over there.
15th...16th...
Staying with this wine?
Yes.
I wanted to see you because...
Could we get that divorce?
To finish it?
To finish what?
Well, it's Robert that insists.
He's so...
Alright, if Robert is insisting.
It's good that we can talk.
Without me throwing that plate at you?
Yes.
On the other hand, People do...
Stop it Hélène.
Just stop.
I don't understand.
Sure you do.
We can have the same luncheon, just without the music.
Are you still angry at me about Isabelle?
Not any more.
She and I are more on the same wavelength now.
Not eating?
Sure, sure.
Good, isn't it?
You know I still have the photo of her you took at Colombes.
Really?
I can't take her photo now, she moves around too much.
Life isn't easy for me now either.
I'm living alone.
Since when?
It's been...
You know Isabelle, she'll leave again.
So it's right, it's time.
For what?
For you to have her for 5 minutes.
Are you saying that to hurt me?
Meaning 5 minutes out of 10 years?
That's it?
Well, no.
It's much the same.
There's Dimitri who lives nearby, so I'll at least have company.
Don't send any postcards.
I can't stand Australia.
Let's not discuss that again.
We could have been happy, with some luck.
Where?
In the barracks?
No, I'd could get a room in the city.
You could play Snow White for your father.
Don't start on my father again!
Leave me alone!
Why say that?
Because I love you...
You dummy!
I don't want that kind of love!
Haha!
We're first!
We're early?
Here, for you!
Isabelle Douélan and Rémi Abeiller.
Enough with the introductions.
Why?
Introduce her.
That's the thing, I forgot her name.
Things O.K.?
Yes.
When I knocked...
You were fighting a little?
Not fighting...
We were saying goodbye.
Mr. Douélan isn't here?
No, ma'am.
I'm Isabelle's mother.
Is he coming back for dinner?
Should be...not sure when.
He tells me very little.
Well, come in.
Sorry to leave you to wait, I was just going.
No.
Don't wait up for me, things are crazy over here.
It got delayed when the...
What?
Now they're waiting at the printers' downstairs.
Try to come by, even if it's late, we'll keep some food warm.
There's even a surprise for you.
No, no, you'll have to see for yourself.
When you act all tough it makes me laugh.
I was sure he would show up.
You alright?
I understand them, I don't like airport goodbyes.
For Rémi, I'm the one who asked him not to come.
When does he leave?
Tonight.
Destination, please?
Isabelle!
Hélène!
Hélène!
What's are you both up to?
She just took off!
I know.
I just saw her.
Where is she going?
I don't know!
I just don't know!
She took off for...
for Rémi obviously.
Guess it was about time, We were getting ridiculous.
So where do you want to go?
I don't know.
A train tonight, or the plane.
I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.
Take me somewhere for a drink.
We'll phone if we can find them.
Over this way.
My keys.
You'll want to have them back.
Keep them if you want.
I'm just kidding.
I'll hang on to them.
15 days, and she'll come scurrying back.
A few times around Provence on her scooter, by then...
What time's your plane?
Not sure.
Time to be going.
Bon voyage.
Goodbye Mr. Douélan.
Au revoir Morillon.
He's taking things rather well.
That's beautiful, no?
England on the line.
Hello Robert?

You know, no-one 's interested in this stuff any more.
Why don't you write a novel instead?
You could get the Goncourt prize...
The movie's not going to be a success.
But if you want to make a film set in the past, shoot this one: you'll make millions!
The last word from Proust:
"Madeleine, Go for Broke!"
Who would you like to do it with?
- Well... with you!
- No, I mean the actors...
Well, with some unknowns... maybe my wife.
My son, in any event.
A kid as a hero?
No, that's not a good idea.
Audiences don't like watching kids.
At least, not other people's ones.
- What do we load?
- Colour.
Okay, it's Sunday!
- Are you crazy?
It's Wednesday!
- No, Sunday.
OK, that's fine.
Great, that's it.
Your set is awful...
Let me fix it...
I'll put...
So, how am I framing this?
...the grandfather ...frame this... microphone...
- No.
Shoot the picture.
- OK.
- Action.
- Rolling...
- David, what are we doing here?
- Well...
- What are we doing?
- An interview.
- An interview, or some screen tests?
- Tests, but right now you're interviewing.
- But why, what for?
- Because maybe I'll do "Violins at the Ball".
- Which character?
- Michel.
You.
You know...
And who is that?
Tell me.
Well, the main character.
The hero.
If the test is bad, if you're a bad actor, what then?
Well, I don't know...
You won't have me in the movie.
- OK.
But will you upset about it?
- No, but I hope I'll be in the movie.
I won't be an actor when I grow up.
- No?
- No.
Really.
Anyway, that's a fact.
I'm not going to be an actor.
- You're maybe a bit too little.
- You think so?
I mean, young.
You say this after four years, and I'll probably be the right age.
How old are you?
I'm 42.
And you want to shoot a movie set in 1939?
- Yes.
- But you're 34 years late, my friend!
The past is over!
The past is dead, buried!
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
- You start with the subway station "Calvaire"...
- OK, that's fine.
Shooting pan...
- Good morning, madam.
- Gentlemen.
- Could we ask you a question?
- Why?
Did I win a contest?
No, madam, you only won my sympathy.
- Do you live in the neighbourhood?
- Yes, I live in this building.
- Ah yes.
For very long?
- Oh, yes, a long time.
I didn't win anything...
That's too bad... too bad...
She's perfect!
Cut!
- Are you mad?
Why do you want this old biddy?
- You'll understand later.
Come on, my wife is waiting for us.
- Marie-Jose!
- Ah, there you are!
Hello, darling.
How are you?
Hello...
- Not too tired?
- It's OK, I had a break.
- Will you be all right?
- I'm tired but I'll be fine.
- Stage fright?
- Yes, I hate this.
Come on, you'll be all right, you'll see.
- And I'm the one doing the show.
- But I'm the one who gets dizzy.
Don't worry.
See you later.
Come here, let's go to the bleachers.
- You want to shoot her performance?
- Bravo!
This might sound like a dumb question, but what's this got to do with the movie?
- Nothing.
- And what about that old woman?
Her, yes.
I've been dreaming of this movie forever.
I was born just in front of this place...
When I think she complains about not being filmed...
- Hello.
- Hello, madam.
- Can I help you?
- I've come about the flat.
Really?
Please come in.
Did an estate agency send you?
No, some friends told me about the flat and I just wanted to have a look at it.
All right, let me show you around.
Please come in.
There's the dining room...
The whole place is 83 square meters.
- That's weird...
- What's weird about it?
- Well, nothing...
- The three windows let you see the boulevard...
From here, you can see the Winter Circus...
Is this a partition?
Yes, that's right.
Actually this large flat was separated...
Awful.
And here is a room...
- I know, yes.
- You know?
- Yes, I've been here before.
Ladies and gentlemen, please give your attention to Mr Paul Raynaud, Chairman.
In the last 15 days.
I've made two speeches.
Each time to announce bad news.
On May 21st, I said to the Senate:
"The Germans are in Amiens".
On the 28th, I said:
The king of Belgium has betrayed us".
The road from Dunkerque is opened.
And now, these are procedures from Captain Kafoulis - our father - in case of evacuation.
Get this off, it's horrible.
First: we should give the key to the caretaker.
The apartment should be closed up, but leave the windows open a bit for airing.
Come here, Nathalie.
These are my instructions in case of evacuation.
PS:
- Mum!
- Yes, sweetheart, soon...
PS:
Of course all instructions are private and must remain confidential.
"... the spirit of the nation was revealed to itself: worthy of our forefathers.
"The second goal was to break the moral of Paris".
"Last Monday Hitler organized a massive air raid upon the capital city."
- Mum, do you love me?
- Yes, sweetheart.
"...a hundred fighter planes.
What were the targets?"
"Doesn't matter, because HE knows, and we know, that..."
The picture.
Your grandfather's picture.
Be careful...
My dear husband.
Twenty years of happiness.
- I've got it, grandma.
- Just be careful.
What's wrong sweetheart?
Don't be so sad.
Come on, Nathalie will make you some brunch.
You're graduating?
- Yes.
What about you?
I have already, last year.
Why are you lying?
See you...
Doesn't matter any more, now...
Please, miss...
- And you lived here until?
- 1940.
- I keep thinking about it.
- About what?
- My childhood.
- And what did you find out about your childhood?
- It's mine!
- So what?
Have you finished the script?
It seems old fashioned, nobody wants to hear about this stuff...
Make your own home movie, one to show your family.
Bastard!
Maybe you've got wealth issues, but some people live their own lives.
Never!
Wars are always like this, 1870,1914...
Always the same.
You let the enemy come in, then...
SLAM!
The trapdoor closes.
On 1914, I had pink dress.
I can see it even now.
It was a princess dress, with some religious stones in the back.
You'll never change!
I'll tell you something:
you may be afraid,
- But nothing will happen.
- Mama, not in front of the kids.
And who is going to play your character?
- Well, me!
- Ridiculous, ridiculous!
No star: no movie.
I'm going to do it.
Excuse me.
Hello?
And what's the title of your movie?
Hello?
"Violins at the Ball".
Please hold on.
"Violins at the Ball".
"Violins at the Ball".?
Nice but not commercial...
Why not something more upbeat, with "love" in it, for example?
Hallo?
Yes, absolutely my dear...
It's not a problem to get back to this...
- How many days you can give me?
- Twelve plus VAT.
OK then, that's fine: camera!
- What do we do?
- Here are my keys, you go to my place.
- Which one is it?
- The little one.
The rent isn't paid, there's no phone.
But key works!
- And what do I do?
- You film, sir!
Arms behind your backs, hands crossed!
Come on!
Forward.
- Hey, you aren't a Jew, by any change?
- What?
- Jew, I said.
- Jew?
Come on, hurry up!
- Ah, I was worried!
- Worried?
Why?
I saw that he wasn't in bed.
Why did you take him?
I was alone, I felt like some father-son time...
I didn't even have time to change...
I got a ride over.
Circus people are so strange...
You train months and months for a one minute routine...
You're crazy to do that show.
What about you?
What's in your mind?
You're going to play the mother's role...
You'd better hurry up... 10 years ago I was supposed to play the daughter.
Soon I'll be able to play the grandmother...
- You're too young to play grandmother's role.
- Thank you!
Anyway I see my grandma older than she actually was.
On the other hand, I see my mother younger.
It's true, I'm not just saying that to convince you.
That's funny, I see myself wearing a sailor suit, but I don't even know if I ever had one.
I'm quite sure I never had a sailor suit.
- I'm going to shoot in two days.
- You found some money?
I left grandpa's painting at the pawnshop.
- What else then?
- Then we'll sell the flat.
- And where will we live?
- In the parking lot.
We'll get a box, and live in the parking lot.
I really married a nutcase!
- But tell me, your mother was blonde?
- That's right.
His mother?
What would Freud think of this?
I don't like myself blonde.
I'll play brunette...
Mama, mama!
Hello!
Mama, mama!
Mama, mama!
Mama, mama, mama!
Mama, mama, mama!
- Mama!
- Don't panic, Leon, your mother's home!
Leon yourself!
Stop picking on your brother.
And there's grandfather...
Hello sweetheart...
What's the matter with you?
You look so serious...
Mum, what's a Jew?
- Well... well...
- What then?
- I'm waiting...
- All right, dear.
I'll tell you.
It was a long time ago before all of these things happened...
There was only one religion, the Jewish one.
One day, a man came and said:
- "I'm God's son"
- You already heard about Jesus Christ?
- Yes.
- Well, this was the man.
It took place in Palestine.
People were unhappy.
So Christ, a very good man, said:
"love each other, the kingdom of heaven is promised to you..."
And a lot of tender and knowing things...
But without understanding how, things went badly wrong.
- What things?
- Those who followed him became Christians.
Those who didn't remained Jewish.
- What about us?
- We come from that background.
- Then I'm a Jew?
- Yes, so what?
Why didn't you tell me?
Because these are very old stories that we don't talk about at home.
- But I've already been in a church?
- And me and your grandma as well.
- Can i go again one day?
- Sure, but it's very clammy inside...
- But I'm Jewish, that's funny!
- You are just like the other boys.
You've got a nose, ears, a mouth, hands...hmmm... dirty ones!
My little Jew!
...and you will maybe know one day, Madam, how far a son's love can go.
Aren't you beloved, maybe?
What's wrong?
Nothing, I scraped myself.
Come and see...
- Nathalie, are you Jewish?
- You scared me!
- Are you Jewish?
- Of course, dear.
You, me, we all are.
Hey, you were right.
I'm a Jew!
Down with Jews!
Down with Jews!
- Tag!
- You scared me, you scamp!
What are you doing here?
We've been looking for you for hours.
- And what are you doing here?
- I wanted to say a little prayer.
- But this is a church!
- So what?
Little darling...
Nice.
Very nice...
But where's the sex?
When are you shooting the sex scenes?
Sex scene?
Well, we're starting on Saturday.
Saturday?
That's it, we shoot it in Saturday...
- Yes, Saturday...
- And explosions?
How many dead do you have?
Well, no, they won't die...
And who's going to be interested in that?
You've got Jews...
Not much commercial value...
Any Jews dead?
Maybe a few...
But all of them alive?
Impossible!
You have many, huh?
You have Buchenwald, Hiroshima and Vietnam.
Even Biafra!
What kind of audience do you imagine is going to be interested in seeing everyone alive?
My characters do not die.
- No?
- No, they don't die.
- That makes it awkward...
- Too bad.
- Have you heard about Guido Tolcani De Oliveri?
- No...
Well, that's me.
The cinema...
I thought that...
Sorry to rush you, but there's another screening.
Did you know that I have no more money to continue the movie?
- How much do you need?
How much?
- Well, quite a lot.
Could we put some more drama in it?
I like him...
I'll take care of you, don't worry.
Trust me:
I promoted Mussolini...
So?
So?
- That guy's a real asshole!
- That's true but he knows people.
It's a shame that you need so much money to narrate your own life.
You need just as much to narrate anyone's life.
You see, there's directors like Fellini:
he doesn't tell stories any more, he simply shoots emotions.
That's right, but he still needs film in the can.
My turn, my turn!
- What is it?
- An alert.
Where are you going?
In case of alerts, we go to the high school for defence exercises.
- You're not going!
- I am!
No!
And afterwards, I'm going to the station to help refugees.
Some enjoy music, meanwhile others are at war.
So what?
I didn't start this war.
What about this chandelier?
We should move it, it's in the way.
The children are growing apart from me...
And where is Nathalie?
I know where she is, should I get her?
No.
You go to bed...
Sorry Madam, there's nothing left.
Do you know this child's family?
Let me help you...
I couldn't leave her like that.
She'll sleep in my bed, I'll sleep with Michel.
Do you agree?
Of course, let her stay.
Madam...
You must be hungry...
No thank you.
If you don't mind, I'm very tired from travelling.
- I'll show you your room.
- Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good evening, madam.
Excuse me...
There you are.
I'll sleep with my brother.
You'll have my bed.
I'll leave you to it.
- Aren't you cold?
- No.
- She's a very fine young woman.
- Very.
- You smoke now?
- Well, from time to time.
Jean, do you hear me!
You've got half an hour, you'll be late!
- Michel, are you still asleep?
- No, I'm getting up.
Jean, Jean!
- Mama, mama, mama.
- Hello, sweetheart...
- Jean, wake up.
- Mum, where's the car?
We sold it a long time ago.
Here's your hot milk.
Where is she?
Hurry up, you'll miss your class.
- But where is she?
- She's gone.
Just like that?
She didn't eat anything, just smoked a cigarette and left.
- Did she say where she was going?
- She said nothing.
I'm not sure she knew herself...
She's so beautiful...
So beautiful...
You don't know:
I saw her naked.
- When do we meet?
- I'm late, they're already out.
- Where are mine?
- Here!
Sir, can I go out?
You're winding up your classmates!
Out!
At the door!
- Sir, can I go down and kiss my brother?
- Enough!
Four hours detention!
You'll see, after the war, everything will be wonderful.
This is London...
But where's Jean?
...French are talking to French...
Your father wrote that it's becoming very dangerous for him out here.
- It's not dangerous for me?
- You're much younger...
You don't have the risk of being sent to Germany Jean-Louis is 16.
- But where are they?
- Listen, you're old enough to understand.
I'll tell you an important secret.
Jean met your father near the Spanish border.
- They're going to England to fight.
- I'll get right of the war!
- But why didn't Nathalie come for dinner?
- She said she wasn't hungry...
- You know something you're not saying...
- Me?
Why me?
- She's not the same as she used to be...
- Because of the war, you just said it!
Nathalie, come inside!
- Are you waiting for someone?
- No.
Not any more.
Are you worried?
Come on!
Is that you, miss?
Don't get worked up.
There are so many prowlers, we need to be careful.
Come here, I'll notify madam.
Please leave me alone.
Stay here.
What's going on?
It's me, Madam.
Sit down, miss.
My son told me about your little affair.
- While we were having dinner.
- Yes, madam.
I know...
I know everything.
Pierre is just a child.
Unfortunately, marriage is not something we can consider.
- But I love him!
- For sure, for sure!
But it's impossible.
My son has no father now, and he's young.
I'm sure he's sorry about the bad things he's put you through.
He's so sensible...
- But he finally saw reason.
- What reason?
I admit it may sound cruel to you, but it's impossible for my son to marry you.
I don't understand... that's his child!
I know it.
- I have nothing against you.
But you are Hebrew.
Yes.
But I never hid it, he always knew.
Always!
I need to go Paris, it's my last change.
I'll explain it to you, one day.
Please tell them I've gone, I'll give them some news as soon as possible.
- And what if we leave as well?
- Don't be afraid, we'll meet again.
- Why don't you tell them?
- Because they wouldn't let me go.
See, it's the most beautiful plaza in the world.
- Before the war, it was full of light and laughter.
- Tell me, why did Nathalie leave so fast?
- Because her fiancé didn't love her anymore?
- Yes, something like that.
- Do you think she'll meet him again?
- No, I don't think so.
- Will we find her again?
- I hope so...
I just left the demonstration, the cops messed me up a bit.
Would you mind helping me get out of here?
I'm not keen on being repressed.
Lay down!
We're out, you want to get out here?
I'd rather wait until it gets dark.
I can't show up like this.
- I can take you to my place...
- Okay, but I don't want to see anyone.
Lay down, lay down!
There's some water here, if you want to wash up.
- Can I trust you?
- You don't have much choice.
- Why are you doing this?
- You remind me of someone...
- My hats!
Where are my hats?
- I've got them!
I've warned all my friends, Nathalie will get in touch with them, she's got no money.
- What is it?
- Another alert!
- No, it's the timer.
Michel, turn on the light.
- Yes, mum.
Thinking about the fact that you don't do anything during the day...
I've enrolled you in a class...
a very refined class...
- Will I be tracked down?
- No, I enrolled you with a false name.
You start next Monday.
You'll be just like any other boy.
We're on the seventh floor.
Seven is my lucky number!
Every time I buy a lottery ticket, I choose number seven.
But I can't have any boy's life.
I think about too many things...
There are too many things on my mind...
What the...!
It'll surprise no one to learn that pupil Georget... has a zero!
The only interesting composition, which I've saved for last because i gave it an A+, is the one from Michel Cafou.
This one will be read by himself to all classrooms, I insist and Michel Cafou will be honoured to help during our Saint-Charlemagne's mass.
Do you know what to do during mass?
- Of course I do!
What's your name?
- La Roche Foucault.
- Is that your real name?
- Of course it is!
- Bye guys!
- Bye!
Come on, come on...
Come on, get in!
Don't wait till it goes.
Come on, let's go!
Come on, let's go to my place.
Up here, you juniors!
- Eric, is that you?
- Mum, we're going to have brunch!
We're going to have party, guys!
You're telling me!
Where did you get chocolate?
My father salvages wreckage, sells it to the Huns, so we have everything.
It's great!
He sells English boats.
We show up, we get the wrecks, and we sell them!
Hello, young man...
Hello, madam.
- Michel, what the hell are you doing?
- I'm coming!
- Melanie, Melanie!
- What's wrong?
She talked to me!
Just now she phoned!
- I recognized her voice instantly!
- Who?
- Nathalie...
- Nathalie!
We found Nathalie.
- I think she's being watched.
- When is she coming?
She's not coming, I'll go there tomorrow.
- But Mum, tomorrow is Thursday.
Can I come?
- Yes.
Thank you, Mum!
"Maréchal, here we come!"
Wait for me downstairs.
- Darling...
- Don't ask questions.
You need to move out of the hotel, there's going to be a raid tonight, at La Muette.
But where will we go?
115 Longchamp Str.
At the courtyard, stairway C, 3rd floor at Mrs Leon's place.
She knows.
This is her phone number.
I'll call you, Melanie?
Everybody's fine.
What about you?
I have to leave for a while.
I'm watched all the time.
I'll call you...
- OK, that's fine.
- Cut!
Thank you, ladies.
Police!
- Are you hungry?
- Yes, a bit.
My wife doesn't buy bread anymore, she said it makes you fat.
We've all got our problems...
- Bourgeoisie cuisine, good, huh?
- Sausages are proletarian food.
You must be a superior officer's son...
You know where you're going?
I need to go to Lyon.
There, someone will tell me where to go.
- Are you going to Switzerland?
- If anyone asks, tell them you don't know.
It's nothing to laugh about.
As I've gone through this situation myself, it makes me laugh that it can still happen...
Hello?
Ah, Nathalie...
Yes, dear.
What about you?
No, Michel is in the class.
And Melanie is out getting colza seeds so she can make some oil.
Yes, yes.
They sprout in the water.
Well, grease, anyway.
That's the elevator, it must be her.
Call me back.
Police!
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing?
You frightened me...
- Do you have your papers?
- Yes, here they are.
Blanched, Jeanne...
That's funny, we're born on the same day, but not in the same year.
Please come with me.
Well, what we're looking for isn't here.
We can leave.
The Germans are at my place!
You hurt me!
Who's this?
Why did you say that?
- Because it's true.
- You'll get in trouble, little madam.
And first of all, you're wrong.
We're French.
- You live alone here?
- Yes.
Present yourself at 6 o'clock, Laurelton Street.
Oh, sweetheart!
- What are you doing here?
- I'll explain.
Look who's here.
Oh, Melanie!
- My darling!
- Let's go home.
- That's the problem, we can't.
- Why not?
- I brought your coat.
- What's happening?
- I'll tell you later.
Mum, what's this?
These are seals, dear.
- My God...
- Mum, I'm afraid...
You're safe, honey.
We're home.
Here we are...
The door is locked from the inside.
This one as well...
I'm going to leave you with Mr. Robert, please do whatever he says.
You'll see, honey, we'll meet again soon.
Don't be sad.
Okay, lad, if you don't want to cause me trouble, you need to wise up, now!
Sit down, we need to talk.
Your time tied to your mother's apron strings is over.
If anyone asks you, you're going to meet your aunt Marie in Saint-Julien-Les-Valeries.
- What's your name?
- Michel...
Vautan.
- Your mother?
- Simone Vautan my father, Jean.
My little sister, Ghislaine is much better now.
Her lungs are fine, thanks to my father's relationship with a pharmacist, she could be cured by the best doctors.
Mum will not come this year...
Okay, that's very good!
You can invent the rest!
Invent it, but remember it.
See here?
You got some egg!
Come on, let's have lunch!
Ah... what do we have here?
Yes!
Eh, wait a sec!
Let's not eat like this, or we're going to get a crowd in here!
- What do you do for a living?
- Movies.
Now it's my turn to laugh.
Porn or Catholic?
- Hebrew, let's say.
- Oh, yes?
You're not anti-Semite, at least?
Well, it's a day of laughs today!
I know what it's like to be ob the run.
Some do it for an ideal, others for money.
- What about you?
For good intentions?
- Well, I won't take you as far as Switzerland.
I can give you a ride to Lyon, but not to Switzerland.
Your papers, please.
Is this boy your son?
- Yes, yes...
- Where do you come from?
- Paris.
- And your destination?
- Saint-Julien-Les-Valeries.
- Good, good...
- What's this?
- Food.
`
- No, no, it's nothing.
Fine.
Very dangerous!
Dangerous!
- Come on, then.
- I'm coming.
Do you know what time it is
- I know.
The boy must be dying of exhaustion!
Come here, my boy...
Wipe your feet!
OK, I'll grab something to drink...
Put the bags behind the cash register.
Come here, my boy, I'll show you your room.
Chocolate?
There's not much left, apart from Easter chicks.
Now, you go to bed.
We'll see you tomorrow.
- Could you please leave the lamp?
- All right.
Would you give me a kiss?
You need to eat all the bread, or it means it's no good.
You need to eat more!
I wouldn't want my boy to look like you!
Well, we take what we have.
I can't say I was spoiled like this.
Lucienne's here.
She's your cousin Vautan.
You're both the same age.
Don't worry, the last time you met each other, you were both six months old.
- Aunt Marie!
- I'm at the oven.
Well, give each other a hug!
- Lucienne, are you staying with us?
- Yes, mum will take us to the cemetery.
The cemetery?
We'll put some flowers on Grandma Vautan's grave this afternoon.
- What's the matter with you
- It's my grandma's first name.
Are you mad?
Someone might see you.
- What's your movie about?
- A story I wrote long time ago.
- A bourgeoisie story, I suppose?
- I have a bourgeoisie face, huh?
Yeah...
You're happy with yourself, you can't deny that.
- And quiet
- Quiet, quiet, not that much.
- I'm not sure how to make this movie.
- Is its little message so important?
That little message walks all over you, junior.
No need to move, it's an accident, not a roadblock.
- Are you going back to Paris, after this?
- No, I'll go on for some scouting.
- What are you doing?
- I need a minute, wait here.
- You're funny.
- Why's that?
Boys around here don't look like you, not like Paris.
When the war ends, I'll come back and take you away.
Yes, believe me.
Lu, I'll prove I really love you:
I'm going to tell you a huge secret.
If you tell it someone, it could be very serious.
- Do you swear?
- You swear first.
OK, I swear...
- I'm not your cousin.
- Ah, you liar!
My family hides, we have fake papers, and my name isn't Vautan.
- What your real name, then?
- Kafoulis at first, then Cafou.
It's been two years since anybody called me that name.
- Because, you know, Cafou is less...
- Less what?
Oh, PFF!
- What a liar you are.
- You promised not to tell anyone.
I swear.
So, lots of chocolate!
We can eat lots, it's huge!
Michel!
Hide!
- Are you alone?
- Yes.
- Here we are.
Today's the day.
- What day?
Moving out day.
Your mother and your grandma just arrived.
- They're waiting for us in Bellegarde.
- Do I have to go right now?
Well, yes.
Get your stuff, I'll wait downstairs.
- Did you hear?
- I believe you, now.
Michel, hurry up!
I'm getting ready!
- Take this.
- But I can't!
- I'll just say i lost it.
- But I can't, I'm a Jew!
I don't care.
My father is a communist...
Then?
- I'm coming, I'm coming.
Goodbye!
BYE.
UNDERTAKERS
No!
It's impossible, I'm going to choke to death!
And it's too small as well.
- You are not the first, or the last.
- If you can't walk, this is the alternative.
What the hell are you trying to make me do?
I'd rather be dead.
- This is so you won't be dead.
- Yes, but somehow...
This one is okay?
- And now, get me out of here!
- Michel?
- Michel?
- Are you sad?
No...
Now, darling, our troubles are ending.
We'll run to Switzerland.
And Nathalie will join us later on.
You'll see, sweetheart, we'll all be together again.
No, it's clear.
Then, in between the Jerries patrols we need to reach the grove below the road.
You can't see it from here.
Etienne, hurry up!
Follow the others.
- That was close.
- Come on, we've only got ten minutes...
- You go along the hedge and through the field.
- We'll wait for you under the trees.
Charlie will get granny and take her to the hearse.
Jean will show you the path.
Your name is Jean?
- Yes, why?
This way...
Is all this your luggage?
- Now, it's 4000 Francs.
- But I thought that...
Listen, you take it or leave it!
We're in this mess as well!
Okay, kid, it's your turn!
What are you waiting for?
- Are you afraid?
- Please!
Go ahead, dear.
What's wrong?
Are you mad, we're all going to get caught!
What's wrong with you?
I can't stand it any longer!
My veins are swelling up...
Go on without me, or I'm going to ruin everything.
We need to go.
Go on, I can sort it out.
- No, I'm staying with you.
- Mum, come, come!
- Well help you walk.
- Take the suitcase.
- My purse!
- OK...
- You follow me.
- OK, sweetheart, move ahead.
Give me your case.
Hide, quick!
We've lost an hour, and the meeting point is still miles away.
- I'm too old for war.
- No!
That's enough, now.
If the hearse didn't wait, we're done!
Dear madam, you're beyond walking to Switzerland.
Come on!
Let's go!
I can manage.
See you later, dears.
OK...
Our turn, now.
We need to keep on.
- Be careful!
- Go ahead!
We can't use the trail...
Be careful, look in front of you!
Get up on this bank, and say if you see something.
I don't see anything...
- Is it far?
- We need to go across this field, and reach the tree line, over there.
- Catch up with us afterwards!
- We'll give you a signal...
Mama!
Mama!
Hurry up!
The Jerries have fun shooting into the trees.
- Today's a celebration for them...
- A celebration...!
OK, let's go.
Come on!
Quick!
Here's the meeting point.
Watch your step.
- What about my mother?
- She's in the hearse, you'll meet her later.
I'm glad everything went well.
Good-bye, madam.
Go, go!
Come on, move.
OK, let's go.
If we're downwind...
But we're turning around!
We were there before with Jean!
Listen, madam, that's enough.
If you don't give us more money, we're not taking any more risks.
You've got five minutes before the next patrol.
Just go along the woods, you can't miss it!
- Don't be afraid, dear.
- I'm not afraid, I'm with you.
Take this.
- Yes, mum.
- Come on, follow me.
- Careful...
- Wait for me!
This way, through here....
Be careful...
Take this...
Mum, look at that...
Melanie's safe.
What's wrong?
Go ahead!
Drop everything!
Stop!
Fire!
Border police.
You can rest easy.
Bravo!
Hey, not bad...
Bravo!
Really, ifs very good.
Whatever happens, I'll call you back.
Excuse me.
Guido, I'll let the dog out for a minute, put it the car and we can meet at the pizzeria.
- At the grocery.
- No, at the pizzeria!
Ok, then, the pizzeria....
There's some interesting stuff here...
It's very complicated, very dense, but there's enough in there for a movie.
But it is a movie.
Violins at the Ball", scene 447, take 9.
End clap.

(MUSIC ENDS) DIRECTOR:
Well, okay.
Come on, let's get together.
LAURA:
Hi, darling, you missed my specialty.
I know.
I'm sorry.
How's it going?
Oh, it's a little rough around the edges, but it's going to be marvelous.
Roland will put it together.
Where are your car keys?
What?
Well, I'm leaving you the Rolls, and Freddy.
What for?
Well, I don't want you driving home alone.
Uh, it's parked on the Western Street.
Where are you going?
Oh, I have a business appointment.
Business.
Of course.
It's important, Laura.
I know, Victor.
It's always important.
I don't know, Mr. Mannix.
I don't know why anyone would want me dead, but I do know it was my car, so it must've been me they wanted to kill.
MANNIX:
How did your husband happen to take your car?
I was rehearsing, and he came by the studio.
Rehearsing?
I was doing a charity show.
I belong to "The Helpmates."
We do a benefit every year for crippled children.
Tom Andros is producing it this year.
Anyway, Victor came by about 10:00, and he said, "I'll take your car.
Freddy'll drive you home."
Freddy?
The chauffeur.
Victor didn't want me driving home alone.
Could anyone else have known he was, uh, gonna switch cars?
Freddy, of course, but beyond that, I couldn't say.
Do you have any idea where your husband was going?
It was, uh... business... in the Valley, I think.
Wasn't that sort of unusual?
I mean, it was after 10:00 p.m.
10:00 was early for Victor.
I'd like to talk to your chauffeur, if you don't mind.
Hello, Doris.
Would you ask Freddy to come in, please.
He's probably in the garage.
Thank you.
How long has he worked for you?
Seven or eight years.
For Victor, that is.
We've been married about three years.
Would you happen to know if your husband had any enemies?
Mr. Mannix, having enemies goes with being wealthy and self-made.
Anyone who'd want to kill him?
Not that I know of, but it's possible.
Victor was very, very competitive.
You might even say ruthless, in business matters.
(KNOCKING)
Something I can do for you, Mrs. Harris?
This is Mr. Mannix, Freddy.
He's a private investigator.
Mr. Mannix.
MANNIX:
Do you mind answering a few questions?
No, sir.
Do you have any idea where Mr. Harris might have been going last night?
He didn't say, sir.
Well, that's not exactly what I asked.
I wanted to know if you had any idea where he might have been going?
I'm just a chauffeur, sir.
Mrs. Harris tells me he was going to keep a business appointment.
Yes, I heard him.
And she also told me that he might have been going to the Valley.
Did he go there regularly?
Yes.
Fairly often.
Did you ever drive him there?
Yes, sir.
MANNIX:
Exactly where in the Valley?
Tell him, Freddy.
Mrs. Harris,
I worked for your husband for eight years.
During that time I've...
LAURA:
I know where you went.
I've known for months.
It doesn't matter now.
Tell Mr. Mannix where you went.
If you say so, Mrs. Harris.
2331 Morning Way.
Who lives there?
A girl.
Janet Malone.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Miss Malone?
Yes.
My name is Mannix.
I'm a private detective.
May I come in?
Well, is it something important?
You were expecting Victor Harris last night, isn't that right?
Oh, I get it.
Dear Laura hired you to get something on Victor and me, didn't she?
Well, you tell Mrs. Harris that I don't care how many private cops she hires.
Because I'm going to marry Victor, and nothing she does can stop me.
I take it you haven't seen the morning paper?
No, I just woke up.
Why?
I think we'd better talk inside, Miss Malone.
Mr. Mannix, whatever it is,
I'd appreciate it if you'd make it brief.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
Is there any other kind?
How bad?
Pretty bad.
Is it Victor?
Yes.
He's been hurt?
He's dead.
How?
Well, he was in his wife's car.
There was an explosion...
She killed him.
Who?
Laura, who else?
Why would she want her husband dead?
Because he wanted a divorce.
And she wouldn't give him one?
And lose all that pretty money?
Miss Malone, you told me you just woke up.
Yes.
And you haven't talked to anyone?
No.
How do you take your coffee?
Black.
Why?
Do you usually take it in two different cups?
Quite an act.
Okay.
Lay off.
She's in the clear.
Who are you?
Tom Andros.
Well, I'll leave you two to your coffee.
Thank you, Miss Malone.
All right, all right.
Take it easy.
I'll be back in a second.
Mr. Mannix.
Look, about Janet, it wasn't an act.
I came here to tell her what happened, but you rang the bell before I could.
Andros?
You're the producer of that charity show
Mrs. Harris is in.
Yeah, that's right.
That must be quite a cozy little group.
A lot of togetherness, camaraderie.
We're all friends.
Was Mr. Harris your friend?
Victor?
I admired him enormously.
And how about Janet Malone?
Do you admire her enormously, too?
I knew she'd be very broken up when she heard about it.
So broken up you hid in her bedroom.
People have a way of... getting the wrong idea about things.
Look, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention to anyone that you saw me here.
Why is that?
Because I have a friend and I'd prefer it if this friend didn't know anything about my being here.
It's, uh, it's a personal matter.
So is murder, Mr. Andros.
(GUNSHOT)
PEGGY:
Hi, Joe.
CHIP:
Hi, Joe.
Oh, you haven't got a chance.
Peggy, give Chip eight dollars.
For what?
To pay the cabbie.
Oh, Joe, not again.
The insurance agency is already screaming.
Let them scream.
They're in a risk business.
Now, any messages?
On your desk.
IVES:
Mm-hmm.
Right...
Right.
Mm-hmm.
(WHISPERS):
Can I get you anything?
Shotgun, windshield, and no other damage.
Right, well, I understand that he did report it promptly, which is kind of unusual for Mannix, isn't it?
Right.
A little car trouble, Dan.
You didn't see either one of them?
Ah, too busy hitting the deck.
How about this Tom Andros?
You think it could have been him they were after?
In show business?
Ha, who knows?
I understand Laura Harris recently became a client of yours.
That's right.
Well, now, do you buy the notion that maybe this bomb could have been meant for her?
Kind of looks that way, Dan.
But, uh, it's pretty tough to come up with a motive.
You kind of like her, don't you, Joe?
I mean, the lady's really, really got class.
Hey, what kind of a question is that?
Well, the boys down at the lab pulled off a set of prints from that wrecked car and I found it very interesting.
So?
I had the prints checked through Central Computer.
They belong to a girl named Gloria Martinson.
You're right.
Very interesting.
Oh, now, come on, Joe, don't tell me that that name doesn't ring a bell.
(SIGHS) Okay, Dan, just what are you getting at?
Well... well, it seems that
Gloria Martinson was arrested and booked by the Las Vegas police April 1969.
Top-of-the-line call girl.
(CHUCKLES):
Fascinating.
I'll give her a call.
Still no bell, huh?
Okay, Dan, who is Gloria Martinson?
Your client, Joe...
Laura Harris.
Joe, why would Victor Harris, with all of his money, marry a... a woman like that?
Is the lieutenant positive, Joe?
Well, the prints match, Chip.
Well, what if Harris didn't know?
Maybe she was straight when he met her?
I mean, after all, five years, that's a long time out of the game.
And anyway, Joe, whatever she did in Las Vegas, how would that have anything to do with her husband's murder?
Or would it?
Well, we're not sure it was Harris they were after.
(SNAPS FINGERS) Hey, try this one on for size.
Maybe she did get Harris to switch cars.
The rest could be fancy footwork.
No, no, no, Harris suggested the switch himself.
The chauffeur confirmed it.
Still, the estate's now all hers, isn't it?
That's right.
And Harris must've left a bundle.
You know, Joe, Chip could be right.
She could have just hired you to, you know, for a cover, to make everything look kosher.
Yeah, that thought crossed my mind.
Chip, I'm gonna have to borrow your car.
Oh, Joe, the last time...
Word of honor...
55 miles an hour.
PEGGY:
Where are you going?
Well, who in town knows everyone in show business and everything about them?
And now for tonight's thought.
What was the real reason behind the split of those two ex-writers, now producers of a hit series, One From Down under?
Could it have been their temperamental star who now thinks he's above it all?
This is Rona Barrett in Hollywood.
Ah, Rona, it's good to see you.
You're looking great.
How's my favorite private eye?
(LAUGHS) Here, Harry.
Good night, Miss Barrett.
Thank you.
Hey, on the phone you said you wanted to know about the Helpmates?
Mm.
Well, that takes in every wife of every big shot in the industry.
Uh, kind of makes them feel, uh, useful.
But you're not here as a show biz fan, are you, Joe?
This about Victor Harris's death?
That's right.
What sort of a man was he?
Louse.
Qualify that: brilliant louse.
Charming when he wanted to be.
Amoral with a capital "A."
But then, uh, who isn't in this dog pound?
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
Rona, what can you tell me about Harris and a girl named, uh...
Janet Malone?
Town's full of them.
Full of what?
Victor Harris's Janet Malone.
Ah.
Was Victor Harris gonna divorce his wife?
Who says?
One particular Janet Malone.
Hey, she was either kidding herself or kidding you.
Evidently, Laura Harris knew about the Malone girl.
Look, there are some wives who are able to, um, shut their eyes if they're, uh, anxious to hold on to a man.
Is there any chance that the Malone girl was right?
About victor marrying her?
Mm-hmm.
Forget it.
I told you he had Janet Malones stashed all over the town.
That's how Victor operated.
He didn't like to turn up in, uh, let's say, Burbank and be caught short without company.
Why Laura married him, I'll never know.
Do you know anything about her background?
I know everything about, uh, everyone in the industry, Joe.
(CHUCKLES)
Still Irish rocks?
Hey, you don't forget a thing, do you?
It's the bottle on the left...
and I'll have the same.
Joe...
I like Laura Harris.
Don't hurt her, huh?
Mm.
Was their marriage working?
Like a charm.
Oops.
Said that a little too fast, Rona.
Sorry.
Um, okay.
About five or six months ago they had a rocky period.
Victor left the country...
Paris, I think.
And?
Nothing.
Apparently, they, uh, got together and straightened things out.
Tell me about, uh...
Tom Andros.
Hm.
A shark.
He did the charity show last year, too, didn't he?
Yes, but not for sweet charity's sake.
He wound up that little number with, uh, Ginny Freeman, and, uh, you know who she is.
Samuel Freeman's widow.
American Steel?
That's right, darling.
And mad about Tom Andros.
MANNIX:
Hm.
Why?
Because, um, she's that age.
Poor soul, doesn't know she can't win.
Look, if she backs one of Tom's films and it's a flop, she's gonna lose a small fortune.
If it's a hit, you know he's gonna be long gone to, uh, younger and greener pastures.
Great business.
Right.
Does Andros play around?
Why?
Well, I walked in on a coffee klatch he was sharing with the Malone girl.
I was wondering if, uh, Victor Harris knew or cared.
Hey, Victor cared.
Nobody touched his property.
Organic or, uh, inorganic.
Well, I guess that about takes care of what I needed to know.
Thanks, Rona.
I'll call.
Mmm... with some nice, nasty dirt if possible, darling.
I can always wash it off.

Okay, girls, take a five break, will you?
It's looking better and better, Roland.
You think so?
I don't know, it needs a lot of work.
Keep smiling.
Laura.
You leaving?
Yeah, I've got something to do for an hour, Tommy.
I'll be back.
Why don't you take the day off.
You really ought to get some rest.
No, I want to work.
Look, uh... if there's anything you need, you know, like a...
a shoulder or something,
I'm right here.
All you have to do is ask.
Thanks, Tommy.
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) Ginny, you really ought to get heels that make a noise when you walk.
Really?
What was all that about?
Nothing.
I was telling Laura to take it easy.
Oh, how nice of you.
Ginny, you've got 60 women in this charity outfit.
Now, I, uh, talk to all of them at one time or another.
That's right.
That's right, darling.
Just be sure that that's all you do is talk... and not to one at a time.
Am I stupid?
Hm?
Give me the first 16 bars now, will you?

Laura Harris... you buy that?
Who are you?
The name is Mannix.
I'm a private investigator.
So?
What's to investigate here?
I need a couple of answers about you and your lady friend.
(LAUGHS) Okay.
So you found out that she pays the rent.
That illegal?
Oh, no, no, that's not illegal.
But killing Mr. Harris and making it look like an accident, that's illegal.
As a matter of fact, uh, the DA calls it, I believe, murder.
You can't pin a rap like that on me.
I don't know what she did or didn't do to her husband, but don't you try to pin any part of it on me.
It got pinned on you the minute she came out here to see you.
You just try to make that stick.
What'd she want to talk to you about?
Ask the lady.
But remember one thing... she came here to see me;
I didn't go to her.
And right now you're standing on my property.
Ah, so I am.

Yeah.
How's this?
The eyes and the nose are all right, but give him a little squarer jaw.
All right, one square jaw coming right up.
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
All right, so maybe this is one of the punks that tried to kill you.
But why?
I don't know.
Whatever I'm doing is making somebody very nervous.
Hey, Joe.
Chip.
What happened?
We expected you hours ago.
I had a little car trouble.
What?
-What'd you get on that Morrell Drive address?
The name's Hal Carter.
What sort of trouble?
It went off the road.
About Hal Carter...
Las Vegas connections.
Syndicate?
Seems so.
How far off the road?
Huh?
My car.
Oh, uh, well, the last I saw, it was at the bottom of a ravine, burning.
Peggy.
Burning?
Any idea who Hal Carter works for?
No, but he's muscle bait and he entertains a lot around the pool and bedroom.
How is he mixed up with Laura Harris?
He told me to talk to her.
Apparently the lady has all the answers.
She called, Joe.
When?
About an hour ago.
Said she'd wait for you.
I'd better get over there and have a man-to-man talk with Mrs. Harris before I'm too dead to talk.
Oh, and, Peggy, I'll need your car for about an hour.
No way.

Oh, and I made a call on Chip's car phone.

Get an ambulance over to 1701 North Roxford Drive.

She's still alive.
Well, we've done a lavage and we have her on positive pressure.
Dr. James is with her now.
How are her chances?
Well, everything possible is being done.
A few minutes later and she would have been a goner, though.
She had enough pentobarbital in her to kill a dozen people.
She's, uh, she's lucky you showed up.
May I see Laura Harris, please?
I am a friend.
My name is Ginny Freeman.
I'm sorry, she's in intensive care.
No visitors.
Excuse me, Mrs. Freeman?
Yes.
My name is Mannix.
Laura Harris is a client of mine.
A client?
Yes, I'm a private detective.
Are you really?
Well, will she be all right?
I hope so.
It's awful, isn't it?
Pills.
I had no idea she was so shaken up by Victor's death.
How did you know, Mrs. Freeman?
What?
That Mrs. Harris had taken an overdose of pills.
Oh, you really are a detective, aren't you?
Well, as a matter of fact, Tommy Andros told me.
He's our producer, and Laura didn't show up for rehearsal, so he called the house, and the housekeeper told him that the ambulance had just left.
Mr. Mannix, I'm really not very comfortable in hospitals.
Um, isn't there a coffee shop or something?
Yes, I believe there's one on the ground floor.
Well, shall we?
Mrs. Freeman, do you happen to know a girl named Janet Malone?
Well, now, that's not very likely, is it?
I think what you're asking, Mr. Mannix, is if, um, I know that Tommy has been seeing Janet Malone.
Is that it?
That's about it.
Yes, I do know.
I also know that Tommy has been making... or has made...
a pass at Laura Harris.
Oh, isn't that nice?
I surprised you.
Mr. Mannix, it's been a very long time since I broke into girlish laughter.
I do not fool myself.
I have a very attractive bank account... attractive and sweet... and I know what kind of flies that attracts.
An ambitious, attractive man like Tommy Andros... well, I keep him on a very long leash, but the collar around his neck...
that has my name on it.
Ah, here comes Rover now.
Ginny.
Darling.
I've been all over the hospital looking for you.
Is Laura all right?
I think she will be.
Pills.
I can't even swallow vitamins.
Oh, Tommy.
Now, listen, I think we should be going.
I mean, you have all those people waiting for you at the rehearsal.
Don't you think we ought to talk to the doctor?
Well, Mr. Mannix will let us know when Laura is out of danger.
Won't you?
Mm-hmm.
We really should be going, huh?
The show must go on, you know.
Why?
Because it's a very old tradition.
Uh, Tommy, darling, would you get my car and just bring it around the front?
I'll be right along.
All right.
Mr. Mannix, I told you I don't fool myself.
Everything is very expensive, and at my age I don't mind paying.
Good-bye.
Mrs. Freeman.
Yes, Mr. Mannix.
You should shop around a bit more.
You may do better for your money.
Do you think so?
Bye-bye.
Well, if her pulse and respiration stay the same, the situation should stabilize.
Well, that's the way I had it.
Doctor, excuse me, how is Laura Harris doing?
Well, it was pretty close, but she's gonna pull through, there's no doubt about that.
This is Dr. James...
her personal physician.
Mr. Mannix... the gentleman who found her.
Oh, I imagine you've already been told that you got there in the nick of time.
Doctor, you prescribed sleeping pills for Mrs. Harris two days ago, just before her husband's death.
Is that right?
Yes, I did, as a matter of fact.
Why?
Mr. Mannix, I'm sure you must be aware of the confidential nature of...
The doctor-patient relationship, yes, but Mrs. Harris hired me to protect her, and I can't do that unless I know how serious she is.
Hired you?
Yes, I'm a private detective.
Look, Mr. Mannix, what I tell a patient...
Doctor, I can't protect her unless I know just how ill she is.
Ill?
She did try to kill herself.
Mr. Mannix, I'm not a psychiatrist.
I'm an obstetrician and Mrs. Harris is two months pregnant.
If she survives this, the baby should, too.
A baby, huh?
Well, that certainly clears up a lot of things.
Does it?
Well, sure.
This Mrs. Harris and this Hal Carter murdered her husband and then she hired you to cover up.
Just like that?
Look, her record doesn't indicate she's Mrs. Clean, Joe.
Too pat, Chip.
Well, what do you do if you've been out of the country five or six months and you come back and you find your wife two months pregnant, huh?
What do you do?
There are a few more options besides killing him.
Not with a guy like Victor Harris.
Suppose it isn't Hal Carter's baby?
You mean there's another candidate?
Yeah, Tommy Andros the producer.
What makes you think that?
Ginny Freeman says Andros made a play for Laura Harris.
Well, if it isn't Hal Carter's baby, why did she sneak out to his house to see him?
I think Chip is right, Joe.
There's got to be a connection with Carter.
Why should Laura Harris go to Carter's house at all?
I mean, she's got all her husband's money.
All she and Carter would have to do is to play it cool.
Instead she takes a bottle of pills.
Doesn't fit, there's something wrong.
I can feel it in here like an ulcer.
(PHONE RINGS)
Mannix.
Yeah, Dan.
I'm on my way.
Well, Ives thinks he's got a possible identification on one of the guys who ran my car off the road...
Your car.
Joe, give me five minutes with the guy.
Chip, I want you to keep an eye on Mrs. Harris's room at the hospital.
She could still be in danger.
Oh.
There was something familiar about this face, Joe.
Charlie here came up with it.
He was on riot duty in 1964, the last big steel strike.
Here's an old employment application.
Ed Plummer.
CHARLIE:
Ten years ago, he ran the goon squad at American Steel.
You mean, he worked for Mr. Freeman,
Ginny Freeman's dear departed?
Well, if you call bashing in heads and burning down homes work, yeah.
Any record on Plummer since?
Nothing.
He retired, whatever that means.
Dan, uh, let me take a look at what's left of Harris's personal effects, huh?
Sure.
Charlie.
Something tie in, Joe?
Well, it's, uh...
it's just a hunch.
It's hard to get hunches admitted as evidence.
Yeah, well, just take another look at this suicide note Mrs. Harris left.
I've been thinking about it, uh, just to keep my ulcer quiet.
So what about it?
Well, it's just a few lines, typewritten, then signed by hand.
Lieutenant.
Thanks, Charlie.
So?
Well, the typewriter was all the way across the room.
Now, if that's all you were going to say in a suicide note, why not just write out the whole thing?
And also, take a look at how far down on the page her signature comes.
So, you think maybe this is a phony, and that she didn't try to kill herself at all?
Yeah.
I think that somehow somebody got Laura Harris to sign a blank piece of paper, and then filled it in afterwards.
(PHONE RINGS)
Ives.
Oh, yeah, Peggy.
Okay.
Yeah, Peg?
Joe, Ginny Freeman called.
She says it's very important.
She wants to talk to you.
She's at the studio in the rehearsal stage.
Oh, yeah, thanks.
Yeah, take a look at that, Dan.
A gasoline slip.
So what?
Signed by Victor Harris.
So?
MANNIX:
Take a look at the date.
Mrs. Freeman.
Oh, Mr. Mannix, hello.
I'm so glad that you could come.
My secretary said it was important.
Oh, yes, it is.
I do hope it hasn't inconvenienced you to come here, but you-you see, we're starting rehearsal a little later, and this is rather a private matter.
I understand.
I, uh... think I know why Laura Harris tried to kill herself.
Why?
Oh.
Well, you see, she was pregnant.
And then when Victor found out about it, he just couldn't stand it.
I mean, the child not being his.
And so, he must have threatened to, uh, walk out on her.
So Mrs. Harris killed him?
Well, that is a motive, Mr. Mannix.
I mean, especially, if Victor said that he was going to leave her.
Mrs. Freeman,
Laura Harris did not kill her husband.
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
Well, then, who did?
You know, loyalty's a wonderful thing, Mrs. Freeman.
Let's take Ed Plummer.
All those dirty jobs he did for your husband when he used to work for him.
Like blowing up houses to scare the boys on the picket line.
Uh... you do remember Ed Plummer, don't you, Mrs. Freeman?
What does any of that have to do with Victor Harris?
Well, blowing up a car is just a piece of cake for ol' friendly Ed.
And Ed Plummer did it because you told him to.
And you told him to do it because you thought Laura Harris would be driving that car.
And when I started to get too close to home, you told Plummer to try and take care of me, too.
You're good, Mannix.
Yeah, you're really very, very good.
Well, friendly Ed Plummer.
I was sort of expecting you.
But it's too bad that where you're going there won't be anyone to listen.
I'm going some place?
Oh, yeah, a place where they won't find you for a long, long time.
Oh.
Good-bye, Mr. Mannix.
Mrs. Freeman.
Let's go.
Drop it!

We get these contracts out, we'll be in good shape.
Really?
Can I help you?
Lieutenant Dan Ives.
Where's Joe Mannix?
MANNIX:
You're just a few seconds late, Dan.
Surprised, Mrs. Freeman?
Ed Plummer is up in the, uh, prop warehouse, dead.
You were right then, huh?
Yeah, it wasn't Victor Harris who was supposed to die in that car.
It was Laura Harris.
Thanks to Mrs. Freeman here.
No, that's not true.
Why would I possibly want to hurt Laura?
Because of him.
You thought I was having an affair with Laura?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yeah, she thought Laura was carrying your child.
It's not true.
Yeah, I know that.
But Mrs. Freeman didn't.
It was Victor Harris's child.
No, that's not possible.
Victor Harris was in Europe for six months.
He couldn't possibly have been the father of that child.
Victor Harris was in town on August 20, just two months ago.
(PAPER UNFOLDING)
You see he, uh, bought some gas and signed for it.
No.
(LAUGHS) Oh.
No!
Oh, no!
Ginny.
It's hard to believe.
She tricked you into signing that piece of paper, didn't she?
She said it was for the show, an insurance waiver or something.
She said she'd fill it in later when she got all the signatures.
And after she was gone,
Ed Plummer came in and forced you to take the pills.
He had a gun.
Mrs. Harris, why did your husband come back into town that weekend in August so secretly?
We were having trouble.
Victor flew back to try to keep our marriage together.
For a while, I thought it might even work when I found out about the baby.
What about, uh...
Hal Carter?
You know about him?
Mm.
And a girl from Las Vegas called Gloria Martinson.
He was blackmailing you, wasn't he?
Yes.
Why did you go back to see him after your husband was dead?
He couldn't have hurt you any more.
I was afraid... someday he might hurt my child.
I don't think you have to worry about that anymore.
I checked.
He's gone.
My guess is you'll never see him again.
He probably likes his freedom too much to exchange it for a cell.
I had hoped that part of my life was forgotten.
What part is that, Mrs. Harris?
Joe, I got here as soon as I could.
What's the matter?
Oh, uh, well, it's nothing really important, uh, Peggy.
I just wanted to talk to you about something.
What?
Uh, why don't I, uh, tell you about it on the way back... in the cab?
Cab?
!
What happened to my car?
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Hide the Christmas tree well.
The children shouldn't see it till it's decorated.
How much?
50 oere.
Here's a crown.
Keep the rest.
Back already?
Yes, here I am!
When did you get home?
Just now!
Come here!
See what I bought.
You bought all that?
Been squandering money again?
We can afford it this year.
The first Christmas we haven't had to pinch pennies.
It's not there to be spent like water.
Yes it is, now you're earning... plenty of money.
Starting New Year.
I don't get my salary till 3 months later.
We can borrow on it.
Spendthrift as usual!
Suppose I borrow 1.000 crowns... and you spend it over Christmas, and a brick falls on my head over New Year.
Then I wouldn't mind how much I owed.
What about the people who lent the money?
Them?
Who cares about them?
Mere strangers!
You know my attitude.
No debts!
Never borrow!
When a home is founded on debts and borrowing... it must be a miserable place.
As you like.
Nora?
What would you say this was?
Money!
You see!
I know how much...
Christmas cost in a family.
60, 70, 80.
Thank you, Torvald.
That'll do for quite a while.
You'll have to, too.
Just think what I've bought, and so cheap, too!
A suit for Ivar and a toy sword.
A horse and a trumpet for Bob.
A doll for Emmy, plus a bed.
Nothing special, but she'll break it anyway.
Dress material and handkerchiefs for the maid.
What's that?
That's for you.
Really?
And what would you like?
Me?
I don't want anything.
Of course you do!
Tell me what you'd like best.
I don't really know.
Yes, I do.
Listen, Torvald.
If you want to give a present, give me...
Well?
Out with it!
You might give me some money.
Whatever you can spare.
Then I'll buy something after Christmas.
But Nora!
Please!
What do we call people who spend every penny?
Frivolous hens, I know.
But let's do it the way I said.
I'll have time to think over what I want most.
I call that sensible, don't you?
Of course, if you really buy yourself something.
Usually it gets used for the household, and I... fork out again.
I'm as thrifty as I can be.
Too true!
As you can be!
But you simply can't!
Money flows like water through your fingers.
You never know what's happened to it.
Well, well, I have to take you as you are.
It's in your blood.
Yes, Nora, these things are inherited.
If only I took more after Father.
I wouldn't want you to change.
I'd never do anything you disapproved of.
I know.
Did you invite Dr. Rank?
No, but it isn't necessary.
It goes without saying I can tell him... when he drops in today.
I've got some good wine in.
Nora, you have no idea... how I'm looking forward to this evening.
So am I. And the children will go wild!
It's a wonderful feeling to have a secure... position and a steady income.
Isn't it just?
The idea is fantastic.
It is wonderful!
You know what I've been thinking?
Right after Christmas...
Ah, the bell's ringing.
Someone must be coming.
What a pity!
I'm not at home to visitors.
There's a lady just come.
Show her in, will you?
The Doctor's arrived, too.
Did he go to my room?
Yes, sir!
Hello, Nora!
Hello!
Don't you recognize me?
Kristine?
Fancy not recognizing you at once!
My how you've changed!
I suppose I have.
In 9 or 10 long years.
Has it been so long since we met?
Yes, you're right.
Oh, the last 8 years have been so happy.
You came all this way in depth of winter.
I arrived today by steamer.
To have a few nice days over Christmas.
Yes, now you're looking your old self.
It was just the first impression.
You grown a bit paler.
And much older.
Yes, a little older, perhaps.
You're widowed now.
3 years ago.
It was in the paper.
I meant to write, but things kept cropping up.
I can understand.
It was mean of me.
Didn't he leave you anything?
Nothing.
And no children?
Nothing at all?
Not even a feeling of grief.
But Kristine, how is that possible?
It can happen that way.
So alone.
How terribly hard it must be on you.
I have 3 lovely children.
I can't show you them... right now.
They've gone for a walk with the maid.
But, now tell me everything.
No, you tell me.
You start.
I don't want to be selfish.
I must... think of your concerns.
By the way, have you heard of our luck?
What luck?
My husband's been made a bank director.
Your husband?
That's a stroke of luck.
And what a stroke!
We're delighted, believe you me.
He gets a large salary and a percentage.
We'll be... able to afford a much better life.
It's fine to have lots of money and not a thing... to worry about.
Yes.
It must also be fine to have the bare necessities.
No, not the bare necessities, post of money.
Haven't you learnt sense yet?
You always were... extravagant.
Torvald says I still am.
But Nora's not so scatter-brained as you think.
We didn't have any money to squander.
We both had to work.
You, too?
At home: knitting and crocheting and so on.
He gave up his job and set up practice as a lawyer.
He overworked the first year.
He took on extra work and worked long hours.
He couldn't stand it and fell seriously ill.
The doctors prescribed a warmer climate.
You spent a year in Africa?
Yes.
It wasn't easy to pay for the trip.
It was just before Ivar was born when we had to go.
It was wonderful stay and it saved Torvald's life.
But it cost an awful lot of money.
It cost 4.800 crowns.
That's an awful lot.
I'm sure.
You're lucky to have had it.
They all think Father gave it, including Torvald.
But it's not true.
I raked the money together.
I saved his life.
You?
All that money?
4.800 crowns.
But where from?
You couldn't borrow it.
Really?
Why not?
No woman can borrow money without her husband's consent.
If a woman's got an eye for business...
I don't get it at all.
Never mind.
I didn't have to borrow the money.
I could have earned it some other way.
An admirer... might have given it.
When a woman's not bad-looking...
You must be crazy.
And you're very nosy, Kristine.
Are you sure you weren't rash?
Is it rash to save one's husband's life?
And you never said a word to your husband?
Torvald - with his male self-esteem.
He'd be embarrassed at owing anything to me.
It would change our relationship.
Our whole... happy married life would not be the same.
Won't you ever tell him?
Yes, later perhaps, many years from now...
When I'm no longer so good-looking.
Don't laugh.
I mean, when he's not so much in love with me.
Then it can't do any harm to have that in reserve.
What do you say to my secret, Kristine?
Am I any use, or not?
The whole thing... was quite a headache, believe me.
It wasn't easy to keep up my payments, quarterly interest, repayments.
Money was hard to come buy.
I had to save... wherever I could.
I just sat here imagining a rich, old man... had fallen in love with me.
And then he died.
And when they opened his will, there it stood in big letters:
"My whole fortune goes to the enchanting Mrs Nora Helmer, payable at once in cash."
What man was that?
Do get it right.
There was... no such man.
Then I kept imagining it when I was broke... and didn't know where the next penny would come from.
Now I'm free of all my cares!
Good Lord, Kristine, how wonderful it is... to be living and happy, too.
I'm looking for a job, office work.
That's very strenuous. you'd be better advised... to take the waters somewhere.
I can't afford it.
Don't be angry with me!
Don't you be angry with me!
That's the worst of my situation, it embitters me.
I've no one to work for, and yet have to struggle on, we all have to live, and that makes us egoistic.
When you told me how well things had turned out... for you, I was not so much glad... for you sake as for mine.
Why?
Oh, I see.
You think...
Torvald might do something for you?
Yes, that's what I thought.
So he should.
Just leave it to me.
Someone's ringing.
I'd better be going.
It's no one for me.
Someone will be wanting Torvald.
A gentleman to see the Master.
The Bank Director.
I don't really know, the Doctor's in there...
Who is this gentleman?
It's me, Mrs Helmer.
What's this about?
Why do you want to see my husband?
Bank business.
I work at the bank.
They say... your husband is to be our boss...
So it's about... rather dull business, nothing else.
Let the maid show you in.
Who was that man?
Name of Krogstad.
So it really was him!
You know that fellow?
I used to know him.
He was very unhappily married.
Is he a widower now?
With lots of children.
They say he's involved in shady dealings.
Really?
Maybe.
I wouldn't know.
Don't let's talk business.
It's so uninteresting.
I'll go and join your wife a while.
Sorry.
I suppose I'm in the way.
Not at all.
Doctor Rank - Mrs. Linde.
A name often mencionated here.
I passed you on the stairs.
I have to take them slowly.
I can't stand climbing stairs quickly.
A little internal trouble?
More likely over-exertion.
That all?
You're seeking recuperation in social distractions?
I'm looking for work.
To counteract over-exertion?
People have to live, Doctor.
Yes, that's a pretty widespread notion.
You want to live, too.
Of course.
Miserable though my state is, I'd like... to crawl around as long as I can.
All my patients feel that way, even those... morally debilitated.
There's such a moral invalid with Helmer now.
Whom do you mean?
A certain Krogstad.
You wouldn't know him.
His character is rotten to the core, but even he... makes a fuss about going on living... as if it were important.
What did he want of Torvald?
I don't know.
I heard it was something about the bank.
I never knew this Krogstad had... dealings with the bank.
He has a bit of a job there.
I don't know if you have people... who spy around, to dig up anything rotten, and then you decide to give priority to... these normal patients.
The healthy get short shrift.
The sick need a shelter more than other people.
That's just it.
This attitude... makes a hospital of our society.
What so funny?
Do you know... what it is: our society?
Who cares about society?
I'm laughing about... something very funny.
Tell me, Doctor:
Is Torvald in charge of all the Bank's employees?
What's so funny about that?
Let me speak.
Yes, I find it very stimulating... to imagine that we -
that Torvald has so much power over so many people.
Now I'm really terribly happy.
Now I feel a terrible urge.
To do what?
To say something so that Torvald can hear.
Why don't you say it?
I can't, it isn't decent.
What is it you'd so much like to say?
I'd like to say: "They can all go and get...!"
Once again!
He's coming.
Well, Torvald?
Got rid of him?
He's gone.
This is Kristine.
She arrived today.
I'm sorry, but I don't know...
Mrs. Linde, Torvald, dear.
Mrs. Kristine Linde.
A childhood friend of my wife's?
We're old acquaintances.
She made this long trip to see you.
What does that mean exactly?
Well, not really...
She's a skilled office employee and wants to learn more under the guidance of a competent man.
You'll do something for Kristine for my sake, won't you, Torvald?
I supoose it might be arranged.
Have you done any book-keeping?
Yes, quite a bit.
I can probably find you employment, then.
You see!
You came at the right moment, Mrs...
Linde!
Thank you.
That's all right.
You must excuse me.
I'll come along.
Don't be long.
An hour at most.
You leaving, too?
I have to find a room.
I'll go with you part of the way.
But you'll come here this evening.
You, too, Doctor.
Excuse me, Mrs Helmer?
What is it?
The door was ajar.
Someone must have forgotten to shut it.
Mi husband's not at home.
I know.
What is it you want, then?
To speak to you.
Speak to me?
Exactly.
Today?
But this isn't the first of the month?
No, Christmas Eve.
You have it in your power to decide how happy your Christmas shall be.
What do you want?
I saw your husband going down the street.
with a lady.
So what?
Was that Mrs. Linde?
Yes.
Just arrived?
Yes, today.
Is she a friend of yours?
She is.
We have met before.
I know that.
Is Mrs Linde getting a job at the bank?
Do you work under my husband?
You ought to know that.
Mrs Linde will be employed, at my request, to be exact.
I was right, then.
One has a certain influence, I should think.
Just because I'm a woman, doesn't mean that...
If one is a humble employee, one should be careful not to offend someone who who has influence?
Very true.
Use your influence in my favour.
How do you mean?
See that I keep my lowly position.
Who's going to take it from you?
I know who's responsible for me being dismnissed.
But I can assure you...
I advise you to prevent it through your influence.
But I have no influence, Mr Krogstad.
You just said yourself...
I didn't mean it that way.
What makes you assume I have any influence on my husband?
I know your husband of old.
If you speak derogatorily of him, I must ask you to leave.
You're very brave.
I am no longer afraid.
After New Year the matter will be closed for me.
I'll fight to the death to keep my job at the bank.
It looks that way.
It's not the wages I'm after, but the chance to regain the respect of my fellow men.
The position at te bank was to be the first step.
Your husband intends kicking me into the mire.
No, I really have no power to help you.
I can force you to.
By telling my husband I owe you money?
What if I told him?
That would be low.
If he found out my secret, which is my pride and joy, in this mean, low way it would mean terrible unpleassantness for me.
Unpleassantness?
Go ahead.
If you do, your job's as good as lost.
Is unpleassantness all you fear?
If my husband gets to know, he will pay you off, of course.
And we'll have seen the last of you.
Either you have a bad memory, or you have no idea of financial affairs.
I'll have to put you right.
How?
When your husband was ill, you came to borrow 4.800 crowns.
There was no one else.
I was prepared to put up the money...
So you did.
I provided it against a promissory note.
Which I signed.
In a codicil your father stood surety.
He signed it.
I left the date open.
Your father was to enter it the day he signed.
I gave you the promissory note to send to your father.
Isn't that so?
You did that.
After 5 or 6 days I got the note with your father's signature, whereupon you were paid the sum.
Didn't I pay up punctually?
More or less.
But to come back -
It must have been a hard time for you, Mrs Helmer?
Yes, it was.
Your father was very ill.
He was dying.
And soon died?
Do you happen to remember the day he died?
I mean the month and day.
Father died on September 29th.
Quite so.
I inquired.
That's why it seems to me there's something inexplicable.
What?
I don't know...
It's queer that he signed 3 days after his death.
Why, I don't understand...
Your father died on September 29th.
Now look here.
The paper says it was October 2nd.
Isn't that strange?
Your father signed with his own hand.
No, he didn't.
I signed his name.
That is a dangerous admission.
You'll get your money back.
That means you cheated me.
I didn't take that into account.
You didn't interest me.
I couldn't stand you.
You caused a lot of trouble although you knew my husband's life was in danger.
I committed no greater nor worse crime.
Yet it cost me my decent living.
You?
You mean to say you did a brave deed to save your wife's life?
Laws do not weigh people's reasons.
They must be bad laws.
If I show the court the note, you will be sentenced by our laws.
If I'm cast out a second time,
I shall drag you with me.
He's trying to frighten me.
I did it for love.
Helen, bring the tree in.
Where shall I put it?
In the middle of the room.
Shall I bring anything else?
Nothing more is needed.
Put a light here and the flowers here.
That revolting fellow!
I will do anything to please you, Torvald.
Are you back already?
Yes.
Has anyone been here?
Here?
No!
Strange.
I saw Krogstad leaving the front way.
Krogstad?
Oh, yes.
He was here for a moment.
Did he ask you to put a good word in?
He told you to pretend it was your idea?
And not tell me he was here?
Did he ask you that?
Yes, Torvald, but...
Nora!
Nora!
And you agreed to that?
You stooped to talk to him?
Even made a promise to him!
And told a lie into the bargain!
It's so warm and cosy in here!
Torvald.
Yes?
Are you very bussy?
What are those papers?
Bank business.
Already?
I have power to change the personnel and policy.
I have to make use of Christmas week.
Everything's to be fixed by New Year.
Is what Krogstad did really so bad?
Forgery.
Do you know what that means?
Can't he have done it out of necessity?
Yes, or frivolously.
I condemn no man for just one slip.
You're right.
Some people recover morally when they admit their fault and take their punishment.
Punishment?
Krogstad didn't choose that way.
He tricked his way out.
That ruined him morally.
Do you really think...
Imagine the way such a person has to lie, play the hypocrite with everyone, wearing a mask for his family, his wife and children.
The worst thing is the children.
That's really terrible.
How?
Such a lying atmosphere infects the family with his germs.
Every breath the children take is full of the virus.
Can you be sure?
I've frequently experienced it.
Almost all delinquents have had dishonest mothers.
Why mothers especially?
It usually comes from mothers.
But the influence of fathers can be similar.
Every lawyer knows that.
And still Krogstad lived for years with his children and poisoned them with his dishonesty.
That's why I call him a moral wreck.
Promise not to intercede for him.
I could never work with him.
I feel physically sick in the presence of such people.
How hot it is in here!
And I have so much to do.
I have things to do before we eat, too.
It can't be true!
It's impossible.
It must be impossible.
The children would like to see their Mama.
No, Anne-Marie, don't let them in.
You stay with them.
Poison my children.
It's not true.
It simply can't be true.
I finally found the fancy dress.
Put the box on the table.
It's in pretty bad shape.
I wish I could tear it to pieces.
It can be repaired.
I'll go and see Kristine.
She can help me mend it.
In this weather?
You'll catch a cold and be sick.
That wouldn't be that bad.
Where are the children?
They're playing with their Christmas presents.
Do they often as after me?
Yes.
They're so used to having their mother about them.
I won't be able to be with them so often now.
Children get used to anything.
D'you think so?
Would they forget their mother if she weren't here anymore?
How could you do such a thing, handing your child over to strangers?
I had to, to be your wet nurse.
But you wanted to!
If I could get such a good job?
That fellow never did a thing for me.
Your daugther must have forgotten you.
She wrote when she was confirmed, and at her wedding.
You were a good mother to me.
And for my children you'll...
Nonsense!
Go back to them.
I'll look very nice in this, you'll see.
There won't be anyone as pretty at the ball.
I heard you were asking for me.
You have to help me.
Consul Stenborg's giving a fancy-dress ball tomorrow.
and Torvald wants me to dance.
Put on a real performance?
Torvald would like me to.
This is the dress.
It's all so torn, and I haven't any idea...
We'll soon fix that.
That's very nice of you.
I'll come tomorrow to admire you in the costume.
That was a very cosy evening yesterday.
I didn't think it was as nice as usual.
You should have come here sooner.
Torvald has a wonderful way of making our home lovely and cosy.
So do you.
Tell me, is Dr Rank always so depressed?
Yesterday it was especially noticeable.
He's suffering from an incurable disease.
He has tuberculosis of the spine, poor man.
His father was a revolting man who kept mistresses.
His son was sickly even as a child, you know.
But how do you know?
Does he call every day?
Yes, every day.
He's Torvald's best friend.
And mine, too.
He's practically a member of the family.
Is he always truthful?
Yesterday he said he'd heard my name mentioned often.
But your husband didn't know who I was.
Yes, that's true.
Torvald loves me so very much, and so he wants me all to himself, as he says.
He used to be jealous when I mentioned my parents.
So I avoided that.
But I talk to the Doctor about it.
He likes to listen.
That's how it is.
You shlould break off the affair with him.
What affair?
You mentioned an admirer who lent you money.
One who doesn't exist, unfortunately.
Go on!
Is Dr Rank wealthy?
Well, yes.
Without any dependents?
No one.
And he visits you two every day?
Yes, I already told you.
How can such a fine man be so pressing.
I don't know what you mean.
Don't try and pretend.
I have guessed who lent you the money.
Are you mad?
How can you think such thing?
A friend of ours, who calls every day.
How embarrassing that would be.
Really not from him?
I assure you.
I would never have dreamt of it.
However, I'm sure, if I'd asked him...
But you wouldn't?
Of course not!
I can't imagine it would ever come to that.
But I'm sure if I spoke to Dr Rank...
Behind your husband's back?
I have to get out of the other matter.
That's behind his back, too.
Of course.
I told you yesterday.
But...
A man can manage these things better than us.
When you finish the payments you get your promissory note back, don't you?
Of course you do.
You're hiding something.
Can you tell by my face?
Something's happened since yesterday.
Torvald coming.
Go into the children's room, please.
Torvald can't stand sewing.
Anne-Marie will help you.
I won't leave till we're talked it over.
I've been waiting for you.
Was that the sempstress?
No, Kristine.
She's helping me fix my costume.
Don't you worry.
I'll look really good.
Must you work?
I've been to the bank.
If I asked you for a great favour...
What, then?
Would you do it?
I'd have to know what it's all about.
I hope it's not the same thing you were bothering me with this morning?
Yes, Torvald.
I beg you.
You dare to ask me again?
Yes, Torvald.
You must do me this favour.
You must let Krogstad keep his job.
I intended Mrs Linde to replace him.
That's awfully nice of you.
But all you need do is dismiss another clerk.
It doesn't have to be Krogstad.
You're incredubly stubborn!
Just because you promised to put in a good word for him, I'm supposed to...
That's not why.
It's for your sake.
This fellow can cause you dreadful harm.
I'm scared to death...
You mean that affair of your father?
Of course.
You know the way they wrote in the paper about Father.
The rumours that circulated.
They would have got him dismissed if the Ministry hadn't sent you and you hadn't been so lenient toward him.
The two cases aren't the same.
As an official, your father was vulnerable.
I am not.
I hope I never will be.
We could have such a wonderful time, us and the children.
That's why I implore you...
This makes it impossible for me to keep him.
They know I want to dismiss Krogstad.
If they said:
The new director allows his wife to change his mind.
What then?
Am I to be a laughing stock?
Let people see I'm open to all sorts of pressure?
I'd soon feel the consequences.
What do you want?
Make an end of things!
Hand this letter to a porter to deliver immediately!
Immediately!
It's already addressed.
Here's the money.
Torvald!
What was that letter?
Krogstad's dismissal.
You don't know what consequences that letter can have fou us all.
Too late!
Yes, too late!
I forgive your fears, though they are an insult to me.
Yes, they are!
Isn't it insulting when I'm supposed to fear a crooked lawyer's revenge?
But I still forgive you, because your fears are also wonderful proof that you love me!
If Rank comes, tell him where to find me.
I recognized the way you rang.
Don't go to him, he's busy.
And you?
You know very well I always have time for you.
Thank you!
I'll take you up on it, as long as I can.
Meaning what?
As long as you can?
Yes.
Are you shocked?
You spoke so strangely.
Are you expecting something to happen?
Something I am prepared for.
I never thought it would happen so soon.
What?
What's going to happen?
You must tell me.
I'm on the downhill run.
Is something wrong with you?
With who else?
There's no point in deceiving myself.
I'm the most hopeless case of all my patients.
I've just made a general examination of my internal state.
I'm bankrupt.
I may be lying in the churchyard, rotting away within a month.
How can you talk in that ugly way?
The whole thing's pretty ugly.
But the worst thing is,
so many ugly things will happen first.
There's still one examination to go.
When I've done that, I'll pretty well know just when the break-up begins.
There's one thing I'd like to say:
Helmer's highly-strung, and he has an aversion to anything that's ugly.
I don't want him at my bedside.
Under no circunstances!
My door is shut to him.
As soon as I know the veredict, I'll send you my card with a black cross on it.
Then you know that the ugly process of dissolution has begun.
No, no.
You're talking nonsense today.
I'd liked to see you in a good humour.
With death facing me?
Having to pay for someone else's guilt?
Is that justice?
Somehow, in every family there's such a case of retribution.
Please stop!
Let's be cheerful and gay!
Yes, it's actually a funny story, only fit to be laughed at.
My poor, innocent spine is paying for my father's gay times as an army officer.
He was probably fond of asparagus and goose liver paté.
Yes, and truffles.
Yes, on truffles and oysters, too, I suppose?
Yes, oysters, too, of course!
Then there's port wine and champagne.
How sad that all these tasty morsels are bad for the back.
Especially sad when they ruin a miserable back that didn't even have the benefit.
Yes, that's the saddest thing of all.
Why did you smile?
No, you smiled.
No, you.
You're a bigger rogue than I thought.
I could really act the fool today.
It looks that way.
you can't die and leave
Torvald and me.
You'll soon get over the loss!
You think so?
You make new contacts, and then...
Who'll make new contacts?
You and Helmer, when I'm gone.
You've already started it seems.
What did Mrs Linde want here?
Don't tell you're jealous of Kristine?
I am.
She will be my successor in this house.
After me this person...
Quiet!
She's in there.
Here again?
There, you see!
To fix my costume.
How irritable you are!
Do be calm, Doctor.
Tomorrow you can see me dance.
You can imagine I'm doing it for you.
And for Torvald, of course.
Take a seat.
I want to show you something.
What?
Look!
Here!
Silk stockings.
Flesh-coloured.
Aren't they pretty?
It's dark in here, but tomorrow...
You may only look at the foot.
Well, all right you can see more.
Why so critical?
Don't they suit me?
I can hardly form an opinion on that.
Shame on you!
It's your own fault!
What other wonderful things do I get to see?
You're not going to see a thing, for being so naughty.
When I sit here so cosily with you, I can't conceive...
I can't imagine what would have happened if I hadn't been allowed in this house.
I really believe you feel at home with us.
Having to leave all this... and not even leave behind a token of gratitude.
Just a fugitive sorrow.
An empty place to be filled in by the first that comes along.
What if I asked you...
For what?
For a great favour...
What?
I mean a very great favour...
Will you make me so happy?
You don't know what I mean.
Well, tell me.
I can't.
It's asking too much.
The more, the better.
But I have no idea what you want.
Do tell me!
Don't you trust me?
I do.
You're my best friend, I know that.
And I'll tell you.
Something must be prevented.
And you must help me.
You know how Torvald loves me
He would give his life for me.
He's not the only one would give his life for you.
I wanted you to know.
Yes, now you know.
And now you know, too, that you can trust me absolutely.
Let me pass!
Helene, bring the lamp!
That was beastly of you.
Loving you as much as someone else.
Is that beastly?
No, but telling me was.
That was uncalled-for.
Did you know...
I ask you, did you know?
Who knows whether I knew or didn't know.
How could you be so clumsy!
When everything was so lovely!
You can be sure I am at your service.
Please speak your mind.
After what just happened?
You mustn't punish me like that.
Let me do all in my power to help you.
You can't do a thing for me.
I shan't need any help.
You'll see, it's all imagination.
Sure!
Of course!
You're a right rogue.
I suppose you're ashamed now the light's on?
No, not really.
But perhaps I should withdraw - for ever?
No.
Of course, you must keep coming to see us.
Torvald can't do without you.
Yes.
And you?
I always found it immensely entertaining having you here
And that put me on the wrong track
You're a riddle to me.
Sometimes I felt as if you liked being with me as much as with Helmer.
You see, we love certain people best, and almost prefer to be with the others.
At home, I loved Father best, but I found it exciting to slip up to the maids' rooms.
No one tried to bring me up, and when the girls were among themselves they chatted so amusingly.
So I was their successor.
It wasn't meant that way.
But you must understand:
With Torvald it's the same as with Father.
Something unpleasant?
No, not at all.
It's just...
It's about my new costume.
I ordered it, and Torvald isn't to know about it.
So that's the great secret.
Of course.
Go over now and try and keep him occupied.
Don't you worry.
He won't slip out of my grasp.
Is he waiting in the kitchen?
He came up the back stairs.
Didn't you say I had a visitor?
I did, but it had no effect.
He wanted to wait?
He says he's simply got to see Mrs Helmer.
All right.
Let him in.
But quietly.
Helene!
Don't tell anyone.
It's a surprise for Mr. Helmer.
I understand.
Please come in.
Speak softly.
My husband's at home.
For all I care!
What do you want?
Information.
What about?
I've received my dismissal.
I couldn't prevent it.
Does your husband love you so little?
You're in my power...
What do you want?
Just see how you're keeping.
Think of my children.
Did you and your husband think of my children?
Let's drop it.
Don't take it too hard.
I'm no one to start trouble.
I knew you wouldn't!
The matter can be settled amicably.
It can be kept among us three.
My husband must not know ahything.
How can you prevent it?
You won't get your promissory note back.
What do you want with it?
Keep it.
And if you're thinking of doing something desperate...
I am.
such as leaving husband and children...
I am.
... or even worse things...
Then you'd better forget them!
How do you know I'm thinking of that?
Most of them do, at first.
I thought of it, too.
But then I lacked courage...
I do, too.
You, too?
You haven't got it?
No, I haven't.
It would be very stupid, too!
I have a letter here for your husband.
Does it tell all?
It breaks it gently.
My husband musn't get that letter.
Tear it up!
Tell me how much you want.
I'll get the money.
I don't want money!
What is it you want?
I want to get on.
And your husband will help me.
I tell you, I want to get on, get back to the bank.
I want a better job.
Your husband's going to get me that job.
He never will!
He will!
I know him.
He won't dare kick.
Once I'm in the Director's office, just watch me.
In a year I'll be the boss's right hand man.
Nils Krogstad will run the bank, not Torvald Helmer.
You'll never get that far.
You mean you'd...?
Now I have the courage.
You can't frighten me.
A fine, spoilt lady like you...
You'll soon see.
Maybe under the ice?
Into the cold, black wetness, to be washed up in spring, disfigured beyond recognition, hair fallen out...
You can't frighten me.
Nor can you me.
Paople don't do these things.
What good would it do?
You woudn't get him back?
Even then?
When I'm no longer...
Your obituary will depend on me.
I expect your husband to reply to my letter.
He has forced me to take this path again.
I shall never forgive him for it.
Torvald - now we are lost.
It can't be improved any more.
Shall we try it on?
Come here.
What's the matter?
Come here!
Do you see that letter?
Behind the pane in the letter box?
That letter is from Krogstad.
Krogstad lent you the money!
Yes.
And now Torvald will discover everything.
It's the best thing for both of you.
You don't know eveything.
I forged the signature.
Let me tell you something, Kristine:
You must be my witness.
Witness?
What should I do?
If I lose my reason, which might easily happen... or anything happens to me, and I can't be here... if anyone else takes the blame, you must testify that it isn't true.
I tell you:
No one knew anything
I did it all by myself.
Remember!
I will.
I don't quite see the connection.
I'll speak to Krogstad.
No, don't do that.
He'll do you some harm.
Time was when he'd do anything to please me.
What's his address?
Oh, how should I know?
Or, rather -
Here's his card.
Yes.
What is it you want?
Don't be afraid.
We can't get in.
You've locked yourself in.
Are you still trying the dress on?
Yes.
I'll be lovely, Torvald.
He lives round the corner.
He must demand his letter back, unread.
Distract your husband's attention.
I'll be right back.
Can I come into my own living room now?
Now, let's see.
What is this?
Rank was preparing me for a great surprise.
I must have misunderstood.
No one's going to see me in my costume before tomorrow evening.
You're looking worn out!
Been practising too much?
No, I haven't been practising at all.
But you have to.
Yes, I really must.
But I can't do a thing without your help.
I've fotgotten it all.
We'll soon fix that.
I hope so.
I need you all evening.
You musn't think of business one moment.
I promise.
Today I'm here foy you alone.
But first I want to...
Want to what?
See if the mail's come.
Don't do that.
Why not?
Please stay here.
There is no mail.
Let me look.
You musn't think of it all today and tomorrow.
You musn't open any letters, or any mailbox.
Aha, still scared of that fellow!
Yes, that, too.
I can tell there's a letter from him in the box.
No, I don't know.
I think...
But you musn't read anything like that now, Torvald.
There must be nothing ugly between us.
Don't gainsay her now.
Let her have her will.
But tomorrow, after you've danced...
Then you're free!
The table is laid.
French champagne, Helene.
Yes, Ma'am.
Kristine, you must help me with my hair.
You go along, please.
Well?
Gone to the country.
I could see by your face.
I left him a note.
You could have saved yourself the trouble.
Don't try and prevent anything.
Everything's fine after all.
I want to go upstairs again.
I'm not finished yet.
But Nora, Dear!
Please!
I implore you.
Just one more hour.
Not one minute, my sweet Nora.
That was the agreement.
Now into the parlour.
You'll catch cold here.
Good evening.
Your here?
At this hour?
I'm sorry, but I wanted to see Nora in her costume.
Well, take a good look at her.
She's worth looking at.
Isn't she lovely, Mrs Linde, absolutely beautiful?
Every was unanimous at the ball, though her dance was perhaps exceedingly naturalistic.
More natural than art would seem to allow.
I spoke to him.
And?
You have to tell your husband everything.
I knew it.
You needn't worry about Krogstad.
He loves me
We shall marry.
Nevertheless you should tell your husband the truth.
I won't do that.
Then the letter will.
Thak you, Kristine.
Now I know what I have to do.
Well, have you admired her?
Yes, and now I'll say goodnight.
Already?
Well, goodnight Nora Goodnight, Mr Helmer
Goodnight.
I hope you get home all right.
I'd be glad...
But it's not that far.
Goodnight, then.
We finally got rid of her, that awfully boring old hen.
Aren't you very tired?
Not at all.
I even feel very fresh
But you look really very tired.
I am tired, too.
I'll soon be asleep.
So it was right of me not to stay any longer.
Whatever you do is always right.
Now you're talking sense.
Did you notice how chipper Rank was today?
Was he really?
I didn't speak to him.
It's ages since I saw him in such good humour
You know, it's great to be back in one's own four walls all alone with you.
Don't look at me like that.
Can't I look at my most precious possession?
This wonderful gift that's mine, all mine.
all mine alone!
You musn't talk to me like that tonight.
That makes you even more seductive.
I was longing just for you.
When I saw you dancing, so sparking and enticing, my blood began to seethe.
I couldn't stand any more, so I abducted you from the party early on.
Sopt it!
I don't feel like it tonight.
What do you mean?
You must be joking, little Nora.
You refuse!
Am I not your husband?
What are you doing?
I'm emptying the letter box.
It's full up.
There won't be any room for newspaper tomorrow.
Are you going to work?
You know I'm not.
Helene, turn that lamp off.
The way things pile up!
What's that?
The letter?
2 visiting cards from Rank.
The Doctor?
"Doctor medicinae Rank."
Any message?
Above his name, a black cross.
Look!
What weird idea!
As if he was announcing his own death.
So he is.
What?
Do you know something?
Did he tell you?
The cards mean he has said goodbye.
He's locking himself up to die.
He's crawling away like a wounded animal.
It's best done without words.
With his suffering and loneliness he formed a gloomy background to our happiness.
Now we're thrown on our own resources.
I feel as if I couldn't hold you tight enough.
You know, Nora, sometimes I wish you might be in very great danger, so I could rick my life and everything foy you.
Now you should read your mail, Torvald.
All right!
Never see him again!
Never see the children!
Not even them!
The ice cold black water!
The gloomy depths.
Now he's got the letter.
Now he's reading it.
Do you know what's in this letter?
Yes, I know.
Whare are you going?
You mustn't save me.
So it's true what he writes?
No, no, it can't be.
it must be imposible.
Yes, it's true.
I loved you more than anything.
Don't give me those stupid excuses.
You mustn't take the blame yourself.
Quit play acting!
Do you know what you've done?
Answer me!
Do you know?
Now I begin to see the whole thing.
A hypocrite, a liar!
Worse, a criminal!
How wretched it all is!
I might have thought something like this would happen.
I should have foreseen it.
Your father's irresponsible ways...
No religion, no morality, no sense of duty!
I'm well punished for having been lenient with him.
For your sake - and this is how you repay me!
This way!
You've ruined my life, wrecked my future.
I'm in the power of a ruthless man.
He can do what he likes, demand anything of me.
Can command me, order me about.
I daren't open my mouth.
All because of an irresponsible wife!
When I leave this world, you will be free.
Your father always came up with such talk.
What good would that do me?
People would think I'd incited you.
Do you realize now what you've done to me?
Yes.
This has to be covered up, no matter what.
As for you and me, it has to look as if everything was normal.
But only in other people's eyes.
You remain here, of course.
But I can't allow you to bring up the children anymore.
It's not our happiness that counts.
What counts is keeping up appearances.
What's that?
So late at night?
Hide!
Say you're ill.
A letter for Mrs. Helmer.
From him!
You shan't have it.
I must know what he writes.
Nora, I am saved!
I am saved.
And me?
You, too.
We're both saved.
Look!
He's sent the promissory note.
He writes he's sorry, and his life has taken a happy turning.
It doesn't matter what he writes.
We are saved.
No one can do a thing to you.
Oh, Nora, Nora!
But first this must disappear.
I'll look upon this affair as just a bad dream.
He wrote that since Christmas you have...
These days must have been terrible for you.
Yes, in these 3 days I have fought a hard battle.
And you were stricken with fear and saw no other way out but ...
Let's forget about it.
Let's celebrate.
It's all over!
It's all over!
You don't seem to grasp it.
It's over and done with.
What's the matter?
That frozen expression!
You can't believe I have forgiven you.
I swear I have forgiven you everything.
What you did was for love of me.
Yes, that's true.
You loved me as a woman should love her husband you just chose the wrong means.
I don't love you any less for acting on your own.
Lean upon me, I am your counsellor and guide.
Forget the hash words that escaped my lips.
I have forgiven you, I swear I have forgiven you.
I thamk you for you forgiveness.
Stay here.
What do you want in there?
To take my costume off.
Do that.
And see that you calm down and regain your balance somewhat.
How nice and cosy our home is.
There's something so satisfying and sweet for a man when he knows he has forgiven his wife.
It sort of puts her doubly in his possession.
You're not going to bed?
You've changed your clothes?
I shan't be sleeping tonight.
But...
It isn't very late.
Sit down.
We two have a lot to talk over.
What do you mean?
Sit down.
This will take time.
I have a lot to discuss with you.
You frighten me.
I don't understand you.
That's just it.
You don't understand me -
I never understood you, either, till tonight.
No, don't interrupt.
I want you to listen to what I say.
How do you mean?
Don't you notice anything about us sitting here?
What should I notice?
Don't you notice it's the first time we ever talked seriously - as man and wife?
Seriously?
How do you mean?
For fully 8 years.
No, longer!
From the firts time we met, we never spoke seriously about serious matters.
Should I have to you with my worries,
Which you couldn't relieve me of?
I'm not talking about worries.
You have never understood me.
A lot of harm has been done to me.
By Father and by you.
What?
By both of us?
You never loved me.
You both thought it delightful to be in love with me.
How can you say such a thing, Nora?
It's true.
When I was still with my father
I had to share his opinions.
When I came into your house ...
What an expression for a marriage!
I mean I passed from his possession into your.
I adopted your tastes.
Or pretended I did
I'm not quite sure.
I think a bit of both
If you ask me, I've led a miserable life.
From hand to mouth.
I lived on pretending to you.
But that's how you wanted it.
Father and you - you are to blame that I amounted to nothing.
You're ungrateful.
You were happy here.
No, just entertained.
You were always nice to me.
I found it amusing when you played with me.
Just like the children liked me playing with them.
That was our marriage.
There's some truth in it, exaggerated as it may sound
But now things have to change.
The time for playing is over.
Now is the time for education.
Whose education?
Mine or the children's?
Yours and the children's.
Oh, you're man to educate me into being a woman, the kind you need.
You say that?
And me - am I mature enough to bring up children?
You said yourself you couldn't let me bring them up.
I was overwrought.
You were right.
I am not up to bringing up children.
I have to bring up myself.
And you're not the man to help me in this.
I have to do the whole thing alone.
That's why I'm leaving you.
I won't allow it
There's no sense in forbidding me anything.
I'll take what belongs to me.
I want nothing of yours, neither now or later.
This is sheer madness!
I'm leaving tomorrow.
You don't care what people may say?
I know what I have to do.
This is intolerable!
Can you forget your duties like this?
I have duties towards myself, and nobody else.
I'm your husband, you're the mother of my children.
I know most people will say you are right.
I can't bother about what people say.
I have to think things over and see my way clearly.
That's what religion is for.
I don't even know what religion means.
But you must have some idea of morality?
Or perhaps you haven't?
Answer me!
It's hard to answer.
I really don't know.
I can't see such things clearly.
All I know is I see them differently from you.
I also hear that laws are different from what I thought.
You're talking like a child.
You don't understand the society you live in.
No, that's true.
I don't understand it.
I have to find out which of us is right.
Society or me!
You're sick!
I've never been so sure of anything as now.
You're leaving your husband and children deliberately?
Yes, I am.
There's only one explanation.
What?
You don't love me anymore.
No!
That's just it!
Just like that?
It hurts.
You're always been good to me.
But I can't change things.
I don't love you anymore.
Can you tell me what made you stop loving me?
You're not the man I took you for.
When Krogstad's letter was in the mail-box.
I never thought you would give in to his demands.
I was convinced you would tell him:
Tell the whole world, and then...
What then?
What if I'd exposed my wife to the world's opprobrium and shame?
Then - and this what I firmly believed - you would have faced the world and said:
I am the guilty one.
But ...
I'd never have accepted that sacrifice, and would have departed from this world.
No one sacrifices his honour for the one he loves.
You think and talk like an unruly child.
I lived for 8 years with a stranger.
and had 3 children by a stranger.
An abyss has opened between us.
Can't it be bridged?
I have the strength to change myself.
Perhaps.
I cannot be parted from you.
The more need for it then.
Wait till tomorrow.
I cannot sped the night in the home of a stranger.
Farewell, Torvald.
I don't know what will become of me.
You are my wife, Nora, now and forever.
I absolve you of your ties.
Here is your ring back.
Give me mine.
There.
So now it is all over.
I¡ll leave the key here.
The maids know how to run things better then me.
Tomorrow Kristine will come to pack my things.
They are to be sent on.
Can I help you if you need anything?
I can't accept help from strangers.
We would both have to change, so that ...
Change, so that ...
Nora!
Hearing Impaired sub by Pavel Samoilov aka Tanis [psamoilov@tut.by]
This isn't what I am telling you.
You weren't in the room when Jim said that.
And I was.
And he really did.
He told me, that everything was fine
between Helen and him.
And I knew, that even if he didn't say it, that it was true.
He knew it then.
No one else did.
You may be thought you did.
But I knew you didn't.
And it makes me furious when you tell me I didn't know about Helen.
She was my best friend.
She even told me about that time she drank gin with you.
So may be now you believe me.
After that
I got sick of the beach.
Harry turned on all of the burners on the stove before we left the cabin.
He said he wanted to set fire to the whole row.
It made me sick.
Everything was bad between us.
And that was it for me.
I never said one word to him on the way back.
When he stopped and we saw Joan at Jim's.
He bought some cigarettes and told Joan that I was a flirt.
I don't flirt.
I never was a flirt.
I was not flirting with Jim.
I didn't flirt then and I don't flirt now.
And you started this that night Jim told me.
You have never understood Jim.
After the way you treated Helen, it isn't a wonder that he feels the way he does.
And you know it.
And you know, that even Paul isn't the same.
You have never understood Jim.
You had it all wrong, honey.
You.
And Joan.
Now you know what Paul was really talking about.
By the way.
Where were you when Paul got home, at three in the morning?
This isn't what I am telling you.
You weren't in the room when Jim said that.
And I was.
And he really did.
He told me, that everything was fine between Helen and him.
And I knew, that even if he didn't say it, that it was true.

Now you know what Paul was really talking about.
By the way.
Where were you that night, when Paul got home at three in the morning?
Between 1943 and 1944 Hitler's empire, stretching from the Volga river to the English Channel began collapsing under the blows of the Soviet army and the Anglo-American landings.
On the eastern front.
After the Stalingrad defeat, the German army is driven out of Russia after being decimated and compelled to a shameful retreat through Ukraine and Poland.
On the southern front, the Anglo-Americans heading up the Italian peninsula where, in the meantime, Mussolini's regime has collapsed.
In June, 1944 Rome is freed.
Several detachments of the Italian army, along with the partisans form an alliance with the Anglo-Americans and take part in the Nazi expulsion from Italian soil.
After the liberation of Paris the Nazi troops are driven out of the western front, towards the Rhine.
On April 11, 1945 the Anglo-Americans reach the Elbe river.
On April 16, the Russian troops begin the battle to conquer Berlin.
There are just 15 days to Hitler's end the Reich is in ruins and the horror of the concentration camps where nine million people found a dreadful death, is devastating.
In northern Italy, Mussolini who had entered the war hoping to share Hitler's plunder is now just the leader of a puppet government.
On April 20, General Clark's troops spread through the Po valley.
In the Alps, and in several parts of the Po-Venetian plain the National Liberation Army, counting 200.000 men is waiting for the general insurrection order from the allied headquarters.
Mussolini is surrounded.
The Americans and the British want to get him alive in order to try him as a war criminal.
The Germans want him on their side until the end.
But the "National Liberation Committee" (NLC) has already issued the death penalty for Benito Mussolini.
LAST DAYS OF MUSSOLINI
- Look.
The Duce!
- Duce!
Duce!
- Captain.
- Heil!
I will announce you to his Excellency...
Captain!
- Heil Duce!
- Do you always enter unannounced?
- There was no time.
- Why not?
The German Embassy has moved to Merano.
- We have to reach it.
- "We"?
As soon as possible.
Not later than tomorrow.
- My orders, come directly from Berlin.
- We are to abandon Milan?
General Clark's troops are across the Po.
The partisans are coming down from the mountains to fight.
We must move north.
But...
Not to Merano.
We'll go here, to Valtellina on the Alps, I'll continue the fight.
- Alone?
- Thousands of men will follow me!
Valtellina is a perfect strategic position.
- Excellency...
- Yes, Captain...
My orders are to instruct you that the movements of your soldiers must be strictly co-ordinated by the Reich authorities.
You and your government must transfer to Merano, immediately.
Under your protection?
No!
The Führer needs an ally, not a prisoner there are more than 100,000 men ready to combat for victory.
They are bringing the ashes of Dante Alighieri from Ravenna...
Dante!
The father of the Italian language.
I'll report your intentions to Berlin, but, for the moment, our objective must be Merano.
You must not leave Milan till we are ready to move.
- Excellency...
- What?
- You must give me your word of honour.
- You have my word.
- [How many men can you spare?
] - [A dozen.]
[I'll be back by tomorrow.]
[Meanwhile, don't let him out of your sight for a second.]
- [What if he tries to escape?
] - [The orders are explicit.]
[He's to be shot, no hesitation.]
The general strike has begun an armed insurrection will follow.
But General Clark prohibited any attempt at insurrection...
For the salvation of our lands our homes, our factories demonstrate in the streets under the tricolour banner of the NLC!
Give the Germans the choice they got in Genoa and Turin "Surrender or die"!
Viva the general strike!
Viva the national insurrection!
Milan, April 25, 1945.
Our mediation is imperative, or blood will run in every gutter in Milan.
The fascists have been given four hours to surrender to the partisans.
After six o'clock, it'll be "shoot on sight".
What do you know of Mussolini's real intentions?
There's some wild talk about a stronghold in the Alps, a last stand but Cella assured me that Mussolini has no intentions of fighting.
What makes Cella so sure?
Mussolini sold him the buildings and the presses of "Popolo d'Italia" for 109 million lire.
He had the money transferred to a Swiss bank account...
Hardly the gesture of a man planning his last battle.
Claretta Petacci.
His mistress.
Is here in Milan.
He's probably thinking of getting himself to safety and taking her.
Will he appear at the meeting, this afternoon?
Mussolini is unpredictable, but everything points to his coming.
Excellency...
I greatly appreciate your coming here.
I only pray our meeting may prevent further sorrow and destruction...
You are now the only man capable of saving Northern Italy from complete chaos and disaster.
It'll take all your courage.
The journey to Saint Helena is long and lonely.
And dangerous.
Remember that Napoleon was on the deck of a British warship...
Much safer than a salon in the Curia of Milan.
This is the history of the life of Saint Benedict.
I wrote it many years ago...
There's a situation in here very like our own.
Totila, the king of the Goths, is received by the Saint in the monastery at Monte Cassino.
- Monte Cassino?
Monte Cassino has been destroyed by the new barbarians the Americans.
The British and the Polish have reduced it to rubble.
Not even a saint could live there, now.
May I ask how you intend to save Milan from a similar destruction?
From that useless slaughter you were unable to spare the rest of Italy?
- Meaning?
- A drink?
No, no...
Do you plan to accept the capitulation which will be offered to you today?
Well, my plan is simple...
First, I'll disband the army and the Republican National Guard and then I'll withdraw to the mountains with thousands of fascist loyalists.
- You mean to continue the war?
- A symbolic gesture.
An empty gesture.
The men ready to follow you will only be a few hundred, don't fool yourself.
More, more...
Many more.
So, General Cadorna, what do you propose?
Since these are political, and not military negotiations I shall let the delegate from the National Liberation Committee Counsellor Marazza, speak.
I have been charged by the Committee to ask for your unconditional surrender.
I came to this meeting because I was promised guarantees for fascists and their families.
We'll find an agreement about these matters...
- What the people demand...
- The people!
I've devoted my life to serve the people!
I've always fought against the king and traitors who wanted to disrupt my revolution!
Gentlemen, please excuse me...
In these days I've enacted a decree with which I intend to give all my power to the people.
The decree provides for the nationalization of factories and the transfer of my powers to the Socialist Party.
This is my commitment.
I still haven't received an answer to this proposal...
I am now waiting.
Mister Mussolini.
Your proposal is pointless.
You give away things, that don't belong to you anymore.
You have destroyed the parliament, the unions, the political parties...
You've deceived the people with promises of colonies, empires, and victorious wars.
And now, in the midst of this catastrophe you want to pass yourself off as a socialist!
You have no other choice than unconditional surrender.
As for your personal safety the new Prefect of Milan Riccardo Lombardi will be responsible.
What about the safety of my followers?
We intend to accord the fascist troops treatment reserved for prisoners of war.
But not the criminals of war...
they'll be judged by the appropriate military tribunals.
Criminals!
And who is to decide?
Who is to judge?
We could never trust you!
Duce, we can't sign a surrender behind the Germans' backs.
Our loyalty to our ally is our highest claim to honour!
Graziani.
I understand what you're trying to say, but we still have the duty to negotiate.
- We have to work out an understanding.
The Germans are not as scrupulous as you over honour.
General Wolff has negotiated the surrender of their detachments in Italy.
Negotiations... it's just talk...
a delaying tactic.
It seems they did not feel the need to inform you.
Of course, we knew or guessed, but there have been further developments.
- What do you mean?
- Prefect Bassi knows all the details.
Well... it's true...
I've learned that the Germans have completed the negotiations for the surrender of all their troops in Italy to the Anglo-Americans.
General Wolff is expected here at the Palace any minute to sign the agreement.
- How did you find that out?
- From Don Bicchierai he handled the negotiations with the Germans.
Now that the secret is out, I can confirm it.
But... what are the conditions?
The Germans will be considered prisoners of war in accordance with international conventions.
In exchange, they will pledge not to destroy our factories not to take hostages and to disarm the fascist militia.
I can't believe this...
I can't believe that you would use the Germans against your own people!
Not our people!
Your people, your bandits!
The Germans have always treated us as servants, and now they betray us!
They're just betraying the fascists... and you!
I will deal with them!
Duce, we must try to talk to the Germans...
Let it be clear that from this moment I am resuming full liberty of action with the Germans.
Me!
I'll return in an hour.
Excuse me, your Eminence...
I will speak with the Germans, and I assure you, there will be an agreement.
I hope so.
It's the only way to keep Milan from turning into a battleground.
There's been enough blood and destruction.
Italians!
This material is magnificent!
Wonderful!
All of Italy must see it...
they must see it!
Stand at attention!
- Salute the Duce!
- Heil!
I have sent a letter to Hitler informing him, as of June 10th Italy will enter the war and fight by Germany's side.
Your Excellency has received my report so you must be aware of our military unreadiness.
- We need more time.
- In 3 or 4 months the war will be over.
We must forget about the military problem and concentrate on our political advantages.
- But, Excellency...
- When the war is over we have to be on the winning side and have our share of rewards and glory.
In order to do this.
I must have a few thousand Italian dead.
Only then will I be able to sit at the negotiating table and have real negotiating power.
Do you understand?
Your General Wolff has betrayed us!
Pavolini, what's happening?
Why aren't you giving orders?
!
- I have to know first what order to give.
- How many black shirts can you get?
- At least thirty thousand, Duce.
- We can't keep on repeating these lies!
Where are these men?
Nowhere, they're nowhere!
Our men are pouring into Milan from all over Lombardy!
- Lies!
- Tomorrow at 8, in Como...
In Valtellina.
Not Como!
In Valtellina!
There's nothing there!
No food, no guns, nothing!
They're all strategists, now!
Liars!
We haven't even got enough gasoline to get us there!
What, you want to give up?
To surrender to the partisans?
We must die fighting!
No agreements, neither with Germans nor partisans!
Alright, but where is the artillery?
!
We have to leave Milan.
We'll go to Como...
There.
We'll decide whether to go to Germany or die on the Alps, with the ashes of Dante.
Duce.
Don't leave...
It's safer for you to stay in Milan...
- For how long?
- Till the Americans arrive.
Ah.
The Americans...
No, no, no...
The truth is that I hate the Americans and the British more than the partisans!
What can the partisans do to me?
Shoot me?
No.
I will not be turned into a trophy for the Tower of London.
Nor exhibited in New York's Madison Square Gardens...
- Have you seen the lady?
- Mrs. Petacci is waiting in the courtyard.
- What did she say?
- She asked no questions.
She simply told me to tell you that she is ready to follow you, anywhere.
Thank you.
Let him go, you cannot be any help to him now...
- You would only be in the way.
- You don't understand...
He needs me.
He's always needed me.
You, and a hundred others...
I know, but I'm the one he sent for.
I want to be near him now I can't leave him when he's in danger.
They'll hunt him down like an animal and when they get you, they'll kill you both!
What about Switzerland?
This Swiss frontier isn't far from here.
The Germans won't even let him see the frontier.
Look at him...
I'm sure that he'll win in the end he's brave and clever.
He has a plan, you know?
Listen.
Marcello...
He's already sent Churchill a letter, a magnificent letter...
There's nothing cowardly or defeatist about it...
It's a plan to defeat communism, not just in Italy, but all over the world.
Churchill will listen to him...
he must listen to him.
Oh, Marcello, you know...
How many times they've written him off?
He always pulled through.
He'll win through again.
We must trust him.
I'm sure he will overcome all obstacles.
Heil Duce!
Heil!
He had promised me he'd never see that woman again!
Why do you worry?
She's his daughter...
At least that's what everybody says in Milan...
Daughter or not, she's a whore to me!
Claretta, do you still want to follow him?
Yes, absolutely...
Anywhere...
Mister Sereni.
You must listen to your Cardinal.
You must promise me that there'll be no armed insurrection.
You are not my Cardinal...
and it's impossible to stop it now.
- The insurrection has already begun.
- Mister Valiani, you persuade him...
- What's the use of fighting?
- If the fascists surrender there'll be no fighting.
- What about you, Mister Lombardi?
- Everything will be done legally.
Criminals of war will be court-martialled.
If Mussolini surrenders.
His life must be spared.
- Sure, we've given our word.
- He's already been sentenced to death the sentence must be carried out.
It's almost 8.
He said he'd have an answer for us in an hour.
Let's see what he's decided to do.
Prefect Bassi here.
This is Cardinal Schuster.
I'm speaking from the Archbishop's Palace.
We're waiting for Mussolini's answer.
Here.
The Duce has left.
There is no answer.
- Mussolini has left Milan.
- He ran away!
Therefore we've no reason to honour the promise to spare his life.
Now, anyone who arrests him can execute him immediately and legally.
The Americans insist he be turned over to them.
I'm sorry Eminence, but if we get him first all they'll get is a corpse.
Eminence.
Eminence.
They've flashed from Milan that Mussolini has left the city and is heading north.
There'll be a lot of people chasing him English, partisans and especially the communists among them.
We must be first.
The order is to take him alive and it was transmitted personally from President Truman to General Clark.
I'll leave in 15 minutes.
I've got 12 men in my squad.
Thank you.
We'll have to cross the border a couple at a time.
We'll rendezvous before dawn in the Mount Olimpino shelter.
It's only a couple of miles across the border right on top of Como.
We've an agent in Como already...
Larry Burrows.
He has a lot of contacts.
Luckily the Rome secret services have agreed to collaborate with us.
According to their information, Mussolini wants to turn himself over to us.
I don't know how true that is...
I'll find out.
If correct, we'll try not to let him down.
- Good luck, Captain.
- Good luck!
- What's the situation here in Como?
- The city is calm but there are strong groups of partisans up in the mountains.
If they attack, there's nothing we can do.
- Duce, it could happen any minute!
- I don't understand I was told that all the partisans in the area had been eliminated.
You choose to ignore the truth!
- If I ignore it, the fault is your own!
- You wanted to believe Pavolini!
The only thing he ever accomplished was burn the houses of the partisans and frighten the population!
How many fascists are coming to Como?
Thousands, but they're not soldiers, they're just misfits.
Last night, a group of twelve partisans disarmed over 200 black shirts without firing a single shot.
What's the situation on the Swiss border?
The pass at Chiasso is heavily guarded by Germans.
Pizzamiglio is very difficult to reach.
Our only chance could be to reach the border from Menaggio.
There are no Germans at the Porlezza pass, just fascists.
Maybe...
Maybe we can make arrangements with the Swiss for the safe passage of the entire Government.
Buffarini, you tell everyone off our new plans.
Thank you.
- Prefect...
- Duce.
Are you in contact with the American consul in Lugano?
Yes, it was in the matter of some passports.
Alright I don't care now...
are you in contact with him?
Yes, Excellency.
Call him.
Tell him I want to hand myself over to them...
Yes, Excellency.
No, I'm not trying to run away and I'm not trying to save myself...
I just want to meet the Americans on neutral grounds so we can bargain on equal terms.
I am far from finished!
Italy and I still have a marvelous, great future together!
I must get to Switzerland first and the Swiss cannot refuse me an entry permit!
I only hope it's not too late.
Your departure from Milan did nothing but worsen the situation...
Soon.
Milan will be in the hands of the partisans...
- I ask you to help me!
- I'll call the Swiss authorities.
Transmit it immediately.
I just had a telephone call from the prefect at Como.
Mussolini wants to hand himself over to us.
He's waiting for an answer.
Tell him this... he can cross the border by tomorrow at 1 PM... but alone.
He's asked for authorization for two other people.
I gather one of them would be the Petacci woman.
Alright, for him and two others.
We must have an agent at every border post.
Do you really think he means to surrender to us?
If he tries to escape, the Germans will shoot him.
If he stays, the partisans will.
That's for sure.
We're his only hope...
Allen, do you think that Washington will be lenient with him?
He'll be a prize trophy to show at the peace table but there are 8 million Italians in America.
Truman will have to handle them carefully, if he wants their vote for re-election.
If it's "thumbs down", Truman's in trouble...
But if it's "thumbs up", he's made it.
- Cigar?
- Yes.
Thanks!
- Excellency...
- What is it?
Your wife.
Hello?
Yes...
You got my message?
No, no, no...
Rachele...
The most important thing is that you save yourself and the children.
You have to pass the border along with them that's the most important thing!
Rachele, listen to me...
Of course!
Yes...
I took my decision...
I'll follow my destiny.
You're the only woman that I have ever loved.
Goodbye, Rachele.
- Where was she calling from?
- The Villa Montero.
- Is that far from here?
- About a kilometre.
Tell Mrs. Petacci to stay in the hotel.
Alright.
Thank you.
[Wake up!
Wake up!
]
[Lieutenant, wake up!
]
[Mussolini is leaving!
]
Duce, you can't leave without my escort!
I go where I want, when I want!
Get out of my way!
You can't leave without my escort!
You heard what he said!
The Duce can do what he pleases.
In the absence of Captain Kerneg I am responsible, directly to the Führer, for the Duce's personal safety.
You weren't concerned with my safety when General Wolff surrendered.
I'm not under General Wolff's orders!
Our orders are direct from Berlin.
And I am personally responsible.
I'm not concerned with your problems!
Not at all.
[Attention!
]
[The fascists can't leave without us!
]
[Ready to move!
If necessary, shoot!
]
Bassi!
- Let the Germans follow us...
- Alright.
[Let's go!
Hurry up!
]
[Quickly!
]
Jackson, set up the radio and get in touch with Lugano.
You go down to Como.
You know where to find Burrows...
I'll get in contact with you as soon as possible.
We have to get Mussolini before the Germans.
The Italians and even before those bloody English!
We have to get him first.
Ok boys, when you're all in uniform, let's get some rest.
It's gonna be a tough day!
Sorry, Marshall, but you can't go in.
Can't go in?
What do you mean I can't go in?
- We must talk with the Duce!
- The Duce is asleep.
He said you're to avoid gatherings, you are to withdraw to Cadenabbia.
Why didn't he wait for Pavolini and his black shirts?
We don't even know what we are supposed to do!
- We need precise orders.
- You'll get your orders at noon.
Meanwhile, clear the square and go back to Cadenabbia.
I'll go to Cadenabbia and I'll stay there!
But can't you understand this whole thing is a farce?
Mussolini is planning to escape to Switzerland and leaving us here to fend for ourselves!
Let him run!
I'm going to do my duty as a soldier!
We know where you're going!
You're going to give yourself up!
Never!
Now I know why we're here...
we're guests at a honeymoon party.
A perfect moment for a honeymoon...
Barracu.
Mrs. Petacci would like to know if she can see him.
Yes, his Excellency left instructions to admit her.
Duce, I have brought the last loyal men to die with you!
Fine...
There are thousands of black shirts gathered in Como ready to fight with their usual bravery.
Any news of Commander Borghese and the others?
Commander Borghese disbanded his troops and hid himself... waiting to give himself to the Americans.
Even Graziani is talking about "surrendering with honour".
With honour!
Honour!
My generals become concerned with honour only when it's time with surrender!
Anyway Pavolini, I'm proud of the courage that your black shirts have shown.
Thank you, Excellency.
Colonel...
- We're leaving!
- When?
- Now.
- With Pavolini?
No, by ourselves.
- Should I tell Mrs. Petacci?
- Yes.
Tell her that this time she comes in the car with me.
May I ask where you are going?
If you want to know, follow me.
[Gunter!
Get a move on!
Hurry up!
]
What is he doing, now?
Let's follow him!
[Come on!
Come on!
]
- Where are we going?
- The Grandola pass.
What about the Germans?
A few minutes' advantage will be enough to get rid of them.
There are 500 black shirts waiting in Grandola they will escort us across the border into Switzerland.
How are you feeling?
Better.
I slept for a few hours.
[Step on it!
Come on!
]
[Faster, goddammit!
]
The Duce!
- Where is everyone?
- They've all run off...
- Where's the path for the Swiss border?
- It starts out here...
Go with the Duce!
This path is too narrow for a car!
The Swiss authorities closed the pass.
Eminence, I need permission for two people myself and someone very close to me.
That way, we can slip across the Swiss border at night.
I just need permission from the Swiss, it shouldn't be difficult...
They've just told me that they denied permission to your wife and kids too.
- They what?
- I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
Alright, I see...
Too bad.
I wanted to avoid bloodshed.
But now I have to wait for Pavolini's men and try to resist until the Americans arrive.
But I want you to remember one thing, Eminence if you don't help me, the blood will be on your hands!
This is the man who once thought he was a new Caesar a people's leader, a God...
How will he be remembered?
As the man who made trains arrive on time.
We'll wait for the Americans...
Relax boys, it's Burrows.
- Captain.
- Burrows.
This man is an agent of the fascist secret service.
Hi.
- A cigarette?
- Thank you.
The fascist convoy which has stopped in Como...
The fascist convoy which has stopped in Como wants to negotiate surrender.
Their leaders have asked me to act as a go-between.
That's impossible.
The fascists are still at war with the United States.
Their surrender must be unconditional.
Their surrender must be unconditional.
The fascists intend to accept the unconditional surrender but what happens once they do?
Their life will be spared.
- What about Mussolini?
- We already discussed this...
If Mussolini turns himself over to us.
He'll have nothing to worry about.
If Mussolini turns himself over to us.
He'll have nothing to worry about.
- Chocolate?
- Thanks, very kind of you.
I'm here to arrest him and fly him to Allied headquarters.
The fascists want to know if he'll be put on trial.
Well, I think... that's inevitable.
Well, I think... that's inevitable.
In the future, you're going to need friends in Italy in the fight against communism.
You'd be wiser not to execute him.
Alive.
Mussolini will influence public opinion in favour of the Americans.
Where is it?
It was here...
Oh.
Here it is.
Listen to this letter.
This is a letter you wrote to me when I was in the hospital when I was very sick, remember?
I was very unhappy then, and you said...
I was very unhappy then, and you said...
"My darling, now you must want to live more than ever.
Use your willpower".
Very typical of you.
"It is only a matter of one courageous step at a time and you have already taken the first one.
...and you have already taken the first one.
We will be together again soon.
Your room is waiting for you in Palazzo Venezia.
And I'm waiting for you too.
With love and admiration...
With love and admiration your Ben".
That was a very important letter for me at the time.
And it still is.
Thank you.
You know.
I wrote a letter to you once but you never received it.
I remember that at the end of it.
I said...
"Snakes must be killed before they bite".
What's happening?
The snakes are leaving.
I see, and there's a whore running along with them...
I see, and there's a whore running along with them...
I saw her leaving with you in Milan you had promised me you'd never see her again!
But here she is... running away!
- That bitch!
- She's not a bitch...
I think I should have left you in Milan!
I think I should have left you in Milan!
Then why did you send the colonel to find me?
I wanted you to share my destiny.
Doesn't that prove that I love you?
Your destiny?
How can I share anything with you when I'm not even allowed to be seen in public with you!
- You're ashamed of me, aren't you?
- No...
- You're ashamed of me.
I know!
- I'm not ashamed of you!
I know you are!
I know you are!
I am not ashamed of you...
Listen to me, Ben...
All I've ever wanted is to be near you and help you.
All I've ever wanted is to be near you and help you.
That's all I've ever wanted.
Believe me!
You want to help me?
This is the letter I wrote to Churchill...
I made the mistake of telling you, and what did you do?
You told your brother!
You told your brother!
Yes, you told your brother a state secret!
Now everyone knows!
The Germans, too.
Now, nobody's willing to pass the border and deliver it.
Now, nobody's willing to pass the border and deliver it.
And you sit there and tell me that you want to help me?
Look.
Look at this.
- What is it?
- It's so beautiful and peaceful...
- What is it?
- It's so beautiful and peaceful...
That's where we should be going, to Austria.
- No one would ever find us.
There.
- What are you talking about?
It's our nest!
I've arranged it all.
Only a couple of mountain people live there they think that the emperor is still on the throne!
It's the perfect hideout!
It's the perfect hideout!
- A hideout?
- Yes.
No...
Claretta, you don't understand.
I still want to fight.
And I will.
Soon I will find a way of contacting Mr. Churchill.
Soon I will find a way of contacting Mr. Churchill.
- Don't worry...
- But...
No, don't worry about the letter.
I will find a way...
Churchill will have to understand.
He stood by me in the beginning, and he has to stand by me now.
[Mussolini is inside.]
- How are you?
- Fine.
You had given me your word that you wouldn't have left Milan!
You had given me your word that you wouldn't have left Milan!
I know...
But the situation in Milan suddenly changed...
It was a decision of my ministers.
We have to go back to the valley immediately...
No.
I have decided to stay here, Captain.
Besides, the roads aren't safe.
We got through.
They're open...
If you want me to go, you'll have to use force...
Excellency, allow me to point out that these barracks could turn into a trap for us.
...that these barracks could turn into a trap for us.
They're isolated, with no defence.
If the partisans attack, we're finished.
I'm staying here!
- What about the lady?
- She's staying too.
Duce...
The mountains are full of partisans!
They will hunt you down.
The partisans mean business!
You choose either you die like an animal, or you come with me.
...either you die like an animal, or you come with me.
Everything went well... the Americans were extremely understanding.
They sent twelve agents from Switzerland to get Mussolini.
Over the border.
An American mission will take care of him.
Over the border.
An American mission will take care of him.
What are they going to do with Mussolini?
He will be treated as an honoured prisoner of the United States Army.
But who guarantees the Americans will respect the agreement once they've got Mussolini?
That man will act as guarantor...
he's an Italian officer from the south.
He belongs to the secret service of the Rome Government.
I have already made contact with the Como Liberation Committee.
I have their authorization to arrest Mussolini.
As soon as he is in our hands we will invoke the clause of the Armistice which obliges us to turn him over to the allies.
U.S. Captain Jack Donati will fly him to Siena to the Allied Headquarters.
...will fly him to Siena to the Allied Headquarters.
Yes, but how?
We're cut off.
The partisans are blocking all the roads.
Now that the Captain's with us, we'll have no trouble.
I have both Italian and American passes but we have to get Mussolini as soon as possible!
What are we waiting, then?
Let's go!
Who's your commander?
We're a from the Government of Rome!
Who's your commander?
We're a from the Government of Rome!
My name is Giovanni, I am the chief of this brigade.
We have all the passes.
We have to get to Menaggio as soon as possible.
Hey!
This is Commander Della Muti!
I know him.
It's him!
Stop, for God's sake!
Let us explain!
Let's kill them!
Stop!
Let us explain!
- There's a reason we're here!
- You're making a mistake!
Alright!
Let's hear what they have to say!
Shut up!
We're on our way to negotiate the surrender of the fascists troops...
We're on our way to negotiate the surrender of the fascists troops according to the rules of war!
So now they invoke the laws of war!
The fascists are not surrendering, they're running away!
It's too late to change sides!
You, come with me to the brigade HQ!
Come on!
Calm down!
Let's wait until they're back!
Come on.
Tell him...
Listen!
- We worked things out...
- So, can we go on?
- Will they let us go?
- Don't worry, we'll leave soon...
They got through to Como, the situation was cleared up...
- Can we go to Menaggio, now?
- No, we have to go to Como, first...
- Can we go to Menaggio, now?
- No, we have to go to Como, first...
So... so, let's go...
Not him!
Not Commander Della Muti!
He's a murderer!
A butcher!
The blood is still on his hands!
This is a mistake!
We're a delegation!
Let's go, let's go!
Where are you going?
!
Don't leave me alone!
You cowards!
Where are you going?
!
Don't leave me alone!
You cowards!
Leave me be!
Let me go with them!
Attention!
Republican National Guard present!
What does this mean?
Where are the black shirts?
Where are the black shirts?
- They're here.
- How many are they?
- Twelve.
- Twelve what?
!
Twelve children?
!
200 Germans have arrived.
An entire anti aircraft unit with heavy machine guns.
We could join them...
From my own people, I get twelve children...
From the Germans.
I get hundreds of men...
Alright...
Alright...
I go with them.
Article 5.
All members and hierarchy of the fascist government who contributed to the suppression of constitutional rights destroying individual freedom, imposing the fascist regime destroying individual freedom, imposing the fascist regime leading it towards the the present catastrophe will be sentenced to death.
[Don't shoot!
]
I am in command of the 52nd Garibaldi Partisan Brigade.
Lieutenant Fallmeyer.
We do not intend to fight, we just want to pass.
We do not intend to fight, we just want to pass.
You are in our machine gun line of fire.
- You wouldn't get far.
- I have orders to get back to Germany.
And I have orders not to let a single armed German beyond this point.
We have to request authorization from our HQ otherwise, we can't let you pass.
This is impossible...
I have precise orders.
Since you received your orders, everything has changed...
I repeat, you can't pass beyond this point...
Hold on a moment.
- There's a long convoy, back there.
- 30 trucks and at least 300 men.
They won't attack.
It wouldn't be worth it.
They don't know there are only ten of us.
We should gather the entire brigade here.
Then we should block the roads and tell the workers at Falk to get ready.
Alright...
let's do it.
While I take the lieutenant to our Headquarters you go ahead and tell everyone to join us.
Tell them to stay in the bushes, so they will think there are many of us and to wear red scarves.
Red is a scary colour, you know?
You... run to the Passo Bridge and mine it.
But Pietro, we ran out of explosives...
Then go to the bridge and pretend to place some explosive charges under it...
- Be careful.
Duce.
- I can't stay in a cage all day.
- Have you seen them on the lake?
- No, also in the mountains...
Why are we waiting here so long?
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe it was a mistake to trust the Germans.
- What did you say?
- I said that maybe it was a mistake to trust the Germans...
No.
Hitler has given special orders to defend me.
And of course you're under my personal protection.
Listen.
Ben...
Whatever happens, don't think about me.
Think about yourself...
don't worry about me.
You must save yourself...
that's all I care about.
In Milan, I promised to take you along with me.
It was a precise promise.
[They will let us pass...] [... but we'll have to hand over all the fascists in the convoy.]
[You can't accept these conditions.
It would be a betrayal!
]
[I am only concerned about the safety of my men, is that clear?
]
[Can we trust them?
]
[All the Germans who have surrendered were allowed to pass the border.]
[But we have special orders to get to Merano.]
[I signed the conditions on behalf of my men.]
[My orders come from the Führer!
]
[Lf your orders require you to stay with the Duce, stay and fight.]
[I am just responsible for the safety of my men.]
[The area we passed through was swarming with partisans...] [... and the bridges are mined.]
[I am just responsible for my men.]
[Let's go!
]
- [How do we tell this to Mussolini?
] - [God only knows!
]
The Germans are going!
They're leaving us in the hands of the partisans!
The Germans are going!
They've been authorized to pass the border!
- Calm down... what happened?
- This is the end.
The Germans are going to leave us in the hands of these bandits!
But it would be a betrayal!
Who said that?
[We're moving out.
Get the engines started.]
[We're moving out!
]
[Only the Germans will pass through!
]
[Throw out the Italians...
if necessary use your guns!
]
[Do you hear me?
Get ready!
]
[Lieutenant...]
[I have an idea that might work.]
[I'm afraid it's too late.
I have given my word.]
[Listen, we could have Mussolini...] [... putting on a German uniform, and hide him on board with the soldiers.]
[The partisans wouldn't notice him.]
[Lieutenant!
This is a Führer's personal wish...]
[Don't forget it.]
[Alright.]
- What's going on?
!
- I don't know...
- Tell me something!
What's going on?
!
- Calm down...
I don't understand!
- We're all going to get killed!
- Please.
Calm down!
If the partisans find out the Duce is with us.
It'll be the end...
- They're going to kill us!
- Calm down, please...
- Calm down.
Mrs. Petacci...
- We're all going to die...
Excellency?
I suggest you put on a German overcoat and helmet and hide in one of the trucks.
It's your only chance to get through.
There's no time.
Fallmeyer's convoy is preparing to move immediately.
Excellency...
Go with the Germans.
Save yourself.
Please, don't worry about me.
You must save yourself.
Captain...
I ask you a personal favour.
Let the lady come with me.
It's impossible, only you.
Move this block!
Duce!
Are we going to surrender without even an attempt to fight?
- It would be useless.
- It's true then, you're deserting us!
How dare you say I'm deserting you!
You, who promised me thousands of black shirts!
I ordered you to destroy the partisans and what did you do?
!
Nothing!
Excellency!
Let's go!
Duce, it's true that we didn't defeat the partisans but since you were in Milan, you had just one thought in your mind to pass the border!
And now you're leaving alone, and dressed as a German!
[Let him sit.]
- Traitors!
- Cowards!
Traitors!
Let me in!
Let me go with him!
Don't leave me here!
I beg you!
Help me!
Let me in!
I want to go with him!
I don't want to leave him!
I can't leave him!
Don't you understand?
!
Help me to get in!
I want to go with him!
[Get out!
]
We'll stay here to take care of the fascists.
Check all the trucks when they get to Dongo.
Go!
If it wasn't for you, Duce Hitler would never have become Führer.
No one can wear a uniform like our Duce!
- He looks like a God.
- He is God!
Throw down your guns and form a group!
You must guarantee we'll be treated according to the International Convention.
Drop that gun!
Group up against the wall!
ONLY GOD CAN BEND THE WILL OF FASCISTS, NEVER MEN OR THINGS
- Where's Pedro?
- I don't know.
- Do you know where Pedro is?
- No.
- What about Bili?
- He was a here...
He's drunk!
Hey, camerata, wake up...
Excellency, wake up...
Benito Mussolini, come on, wake up...
Benito Mussolini, I arrest you in the name of the Italian people.
As long as you are under our protection, you won't be harmed.
No question, the partisans are about to attack!
General Wolff has probably signed the surrender by now...
We rejected the partisan's ultimatum.
Lieutenant, we have nothing to do with this...
Deal with it, we didn't invite you here!
Where did you expect us to go?
Hold your fire!
The German commander has accepted your surrender!
Hold your fire!
What are you shooting for?
Marshall, you must do something before its too late!
- What's going on outside?
- The Americans have arrived!
- Give yourselves up!
- Not until I have orders from Milan!
Call Milan.
Then!
It's useless to keep fighting!
The Germans have already surrendered.
Don't move!
Let me speak!
I'm Marshall Graziani.
Commander of the Fascist Army.
I'm Captain Jack Donati.
From now on, you're under U.S. Army protection.
- Where is Mussolini?
- I don't know.
I lost contact with him two days ago.
Our last information had him travelling north with a German convoy.
- Others say the partisans have him.
- May I ask what you intend to do to guarantee my personal safety?
I'm taking you to Milan.
I must talk to General Cadorna.
He's the only one who can tell me where Mussolini is.
- I hoped you would be able to.
- All I know is that he abandoned us!
Cold?
Don't you want to keep it as a souvenir?
What are you thinking?
I was thinking about two years ago, when the King dissolved my government.
All I wanted was to retire from politics and live the rest of my life in peace.
It would have been better for everyone.
Do you have orders to shoot me?
- At least tell me where we're going...
- To Germasino.
It's a village in the mountains.
No one will think of looking for you there.
What will you do to my fascists?
Will they be treated according to the Geneva Convention?
- We are prisoners of war...
- You committed all sorts of atrocities!
Even worse than the Germans!
Those weren't my orders...
The Duce was always against violence.
What about the Civil War?
The fascists killing women and children?
The sackings, the burnt villages, the slaughters the tortures and the killing of prisoners?
Where was the Geneva Convention then?
!
That was Hitler's fault...
Was anything ever your fault?
!
It's freezing, here.
Any chance of getting the stove working?
I've set up the guard.
I'm going down to Dongo, watch them carefully.
Alright, we'll take shifts.
Is there anything you need?
Yes.
Please.
Do me a favour...
Find the lady and tell her that I'm still alive...
Mrs. Petacci?
Alright.
I wrote him my first love letter when I was twelve years old.
It's absurd isn't it?
I was just a little girl...
When I was fourteen I invited him to my birthday party and I made the whole family wait for him because I was so sure he would come!
Even then, I always thought of him as a perfect man he was my ideal of a real man, because he is a real man, you know!
When I met him, I felt that I belonged to him.
I was just 18, then.
Please.
Do me a favour...
I beg you...
You can do anything you want with me, I can do any kind of job even the most menial.
I don't care...
But please, don't harm him...
He's a weak man.
Now...
He's a sick, broken, weak man...
Please don't hurt him, I beg you!
Nothing's going to happen to him, unless someone tries to free him.
Nobody will try to save him...
If you had been with him the last few days you'd have seen how everyone abandoned him...
They all ran away...
He ran away too, dressed as a German soldier.
He has deserted his own men to save his own life, hasn't he?
Anyway, for the moment, he's in no danger.
- Please, I want to ask you a favour...
- I'll do what I can.
Let me be with him.
What harm can there be?
Please.
Let me be with him...
Look, if something were to happen to him it would happen to you too...
You're going to shoot him?
We want him transferred to Milan.
To be tried by a popular jury.
If you give him to the Americans, he'll be treated as a prisoner of war!
It's got nothing to do with them!
He will be judged by the Italian people.
- Then why did you hide him?
- To protect him!
From the crowd, from a lynching...
A lynching?
What do you mean?
Today, he's the most hated man in Italy.
He's responsible for all the atrocities that the Germans and fascists committed!
A lot of people around here have lost relatives, killed because of him killed by the fascists!
Women and children too!
That was the war, it wasn't his fault...
It's not fair!
Fascism did a lot of good for Italy, before the war!
It brought us to ruin!
Look...
This is fascism...
Do you know what these are?
Wedding rings offered by the Italian women...
"Give your gold to your country", they said!
Do you know where we found them?
In the cars of the fascists who were running away!
Too many women in Italy are crying for their men!
Husbands and sons...
tortured, deported, murdered!
Cigarette?
Thank you...
You're very kind.
You must promise me one thing...
If he's going to be shot, I want to be shot with him.
I have no authority to make you such a promise.
Please...
I must be with him.
I can't let him die alone...
I must be with him!
Please, he's all I got...
And I'm all he's got...
Now that everyone else has left him I want to be with him.
Let me stay with him...
Please!
I beg you!
Latest word had him arrested at Dongo.
Now, it seems that the partisans have hidden him in a secret resort.
- They'll tell us where he is.
- Question is, who will go and get him?
And what to do with him, when we have him in our hands?
- Mattei, what do you say?
- It's simple.
The Liberation Committee resolution is very clear...
"Fascists leaders who have betrayed Italy, have been sentenced to death".
They only have to be identified and then brought in front of a firing squad.
- Pietra, do you want to go with your men?
- I'll provide the men.
- But I personally would rather stay here.
- Why?
Why?
There are still 20,000 armed Germans in Milan.
Until they've surrendered their weapons, that's my first duty...
They're locked in the barracks, but my men are the only ones watching them...
It's better that I stay here.
Do you want to go, Valerio?
Alright.
But I'll need vehicles.
Passes and an escort.
The Como area is still full of fascists.
You'll have to go to General Cadorna for everything.
The Americans have already reached Como.
Leave as soon as you can.
Do you understand what you have to do?
- I understand perfectly.
- Then go...
What will we tell the Americans?
They're bombarding us with messages demanding we hand Mussolini over to them.
We'll tell them that Mussolini has already been shot.
General Cadorna?
This is Colonel Sardagna, from Como.
Yes, I have just received your order, but I am not sure I understand...
The Liberation Committee is about to send one of their people to get Mussolini.
For a number of reasons, it'd be better if you transfer him before they get there.
We have to avoid shooting in case of an escape attempt.
Right now Mussolini is in a Germasino, just above Dongo.
I'll send an escort to take him from Dongo to Como where I shall personally take charge of him.
Once he's in Como, I'll arrange to have him taken to the Bresso airport.
If the Anglo-Americans ask us to hand him over we'll have to take him to the Allied Headquarters.
I've been asked if it is possible to save Claretta Petacci along with Mussolini.
You're free to do what you like about that...
I see.
In 1940, everybody asked me...
"Mussolini, why don't you enter the war?"
"Otherwise, Hitler will grab it all!"
I didn't want to go to war, but today, they all say...
"Find Mussolini!
Get him!
Kill Mussolini!"
So, you believe the people asked for the war?
And today, they put the blame on you!
You know what?
The people can't decide for themselves...
They just have to obey.
- Now you're sincere!
- Hitler is crazy...
His biggest mistake was declaring war on Russia.
- I tried to stop him...
- If he's crazy, why did you follow him?
Why didn't you turn your back on him?
I always tried to stop him...
he wouldn't listen.
But you were his teacher!
Who was his role model?
You!
Who started to persecute the opposition and the workers unions?
Who abolished the free press and the parliament?
You!
Who sent Italian men to fight in Abyssinia and Spain?
Who sent them to fight in Greece, or to freeze in Russia?
Not Hitler!
You!
Excellency, would you write a couple of lines for us?
- About what?
- A declaration to the effect that it was our brigade who arrested you...
What do you want me to write?
The 52nd Garibaldi Brigade...
"The 52nd Garibaldi Brigade..."
Captured me today...
"Captured me today..."
April 27th...
"April 27th..."
In the town square in Dongo.
"In the town square in Dongo".
Excellency, write about the kind of treatment you received.
"The treatment I've received during and after capture has been correct".
The Committee has decided to execute Mussolini.
My mission is to go to Dongo and shoot him.
The Americans are near Como and they're asking us to turn him over to them, alive.
They have the right on the basis of Article 29 of the Malta armistice.
But that armistice was signed two years ago by Badoglio we're not bound by it.
- Yes, we are.
Badoglio's signature bound all Italians.
Please.
Sure...
Fact is, in the last two years, many things have changed.
Mussolini's been sentenced to death many times by the people by the resistance, by those partisans with whom you have fought with, here in the North.
He's responsible for the massacres committed by the fascists.
- We must execute him.
- Why come to me?
General, I need vehicles and an escort.
And Italian and American passes to enter the liberated areas...
So?
What do I tell the Committee?
- In two hours you'll have what you need.
- Good.
That's good.
No, it's better not to show this...
This is good...
With England still fighting Hitler's attack on Russia means we're finished.
But Germany is invincible...
You have to remember that Russia has three great Generals General Snow, General Mud and General Distance.
No one's ever beaten them.
Camerati!
With allies like these.
We can conquer the world.
I want to march by Hitler's side into Russia.
The alliance between Germans and Italians will destroy bolshevism throughout the world.
Long live fascism!
Victory will be ours!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
We've received orders to leave.
What's that?
We're going to bandage your head and say you're wounded.
We have to cover about fifty kms and there are dozens of road blocks.
- I'm not going to wear this.
- Why?
Because it's German and I hate the Germans.
It's cold tonight.
Here...
Put this on.
Excellency, are you wounded?
No, it's nothing.
It's just a precaution.
- Claretta...
- What?
Why did you want to come with me?
It could be dangerous...
- I know, but that's the way I want it.
- You sure?
Yes.
Then...
I thank you.
Please, madam, let's go...
Good thing I met you.
We soldiers.
Understand each other...
- I hope Milan it's not far...
- No, we're almost there.
Quick, in my car!
On the way from Como to Milan, they shot at us at least four times.
- Yesterday, they even shot at me...
- Chaos reigns, here...
They're hunting the fascists like madmen!
Snipers are everywhere...
we must stop them!
- Please.
- Attention!
At ease...
This is the end of a civil war, captain.
Sit down, please.
Excuse me, general... about those passes, I'm going to check if they're ready.
Alright.
- Any news of Mussolini, general?
- Nothing accurate.
Remember that, according to the clauses of the armistice you are obliged to turn him over to us.
Alive.
We're moving carefully.
Wherever he is, Mussolini is in danger.
One mistake and he'll be in front of a firing squad.
After two years of occupation, people are angry...
They don't care about the armistice's articles.
But why do you want Mussolini so much?
A matter of prestige, I think.
Also, we believe that he might give us military and political information.
But he knew nothing...
Mussolini was just a puppet in the Germans' hands.
Captain, here's the passes...
These are the authorizations for the partisans to move in the free areas.
Fine.
A couple hours of sleep and I'll be ready.
Goodbye, general...
Thanks for everything.
Goodbye, Captain.
And thank you...
General, I'm on my way to Dongo.
My escort is made up of twelve men from the Oltrepò Pavese Division.
Here's the passes.
Nervous?
Nervous?
No...
You see, my men and I have already faced the fascists and the Germans before but this time I think we'll have to worry more about an attack from behind.
I'm talking about our British and American allies, you know?
Don't worry about them.
But.
Remember no personal vendettas.
When we were in exile.
In the resistance or in the fascists prisons most of us dreamt of getting Mussolini to execute him.
Now it's different.
Because we've won...
It's not a question of personal vendetta anymore...
Goodbye.
"To General Archimede Mischi...
I read your plans in the fight against partisan banditry.
I think it's vibrant and enthralling.
I'm sure that actions will follow your words.
We have to get rid of this hateful plague with fire and iron.
Signed, Mussolini".
We have to get rid of this hateful plague with fire and iron...
Signed, Mussolini.
We have to get rid of this hateful plague with fire and iron...
Signed, Mussolini.
- Where are we?
- Don't worry, I'll be back in a minute.
Did you hear?
These are cannon shots.
Yes, I hear.
I want to check out the situation before going any farther.
I know a guy who lives here.
I'll be right back...
We should have stayed in Germasino.
- The orders said to reach Como.
- I don't think it's safe...
The Americans must have reached Como.
They're the only ones with flares that strong.
- What do we do.
Now?
- We'll carry on avoiding Como.
Where could we go, Neri?
I know a peasant family who lives here.
They'll take him in...
- Where?
- Not far, in a place called Giulino.
Let's go, then.
These are two prisoners.
Can you shelter them overnight?
Yes.
Alright, take them in...
Pietro.
Let's leave them here for the night, tomorrow we'll see...
Do you think we can trust these people?
If the room upstairs is free, they'll sleep there.
Would you like something to drink?
Thanks.
I'd like some coffee.
If possible.
You, dear?
I don't have any real coffee, I can make you some substitute.
- That's fine, thank you.
- I'll get the room ready.
- You can come with us, if you want...
- For tonight it's all set, you can sleep.
We're going to Dongo to check the situation.
Alright.
Sandro, we'll be back tomorrow morning.
Don't let them out of your sight.
Please, would it be possible to have another pillow?
Of course!
If you need to use the bathroom, I'll show you the way.
Maybe later, thank you.
Look, this door has to stay open.
We can't let you out of our sight.
Can I ask a favour of you?
Please...
Let us close the door.
The lady needs to rest.
Please.
Can I close it?
Thank you.
Are you sure that this pass is authentic?
I know Donati personally.
I was in contact with him in Switzerland.
That's his signature.
I want your co-operation.
- I have to transfer Mussolini to Milan.
- We're going to put him in the Como jail.
We'll handle his transfer ourselves.
I greatly appreciate your organization.
But let's say I prefer to handle this particular situation by myself.
This is an unwarranted interference by the Milan committee!
That's what you think!
I've got American authorization, signed by Captain Jack Donati.
That's just a pass to enter the free areas it's not a warrant for Mussolini!
Thousands of black shirts were forced to surrender by our committee!
Milan has no right to take credit for arresting Mussolini from Como!
It's not a question of Milan or Como!
It's something which has to be done!
I was sent here by the General Command of the Liberty corps in complete agreement with Alt Italia Committee of Liberation!
I have been given orders, and I'm going to carry them out, at all costs!
- Look, I've already told you...
- Gentlemen!
I have twelve armed men along with me with whom I've solved tougher problems than your stupid objections.
So, either you stop interfering with my mission or you'll find yourselves filling the jail cells you prepared for Mussolini.
No doubt about it.
Now.
We have proof they want to turn him over to the Americans.
They say we are trying to steal the glory of the arrest and they want to transfer him to Milan themselves.
Enough.
Mussolini has to be shot.
Valerio, I'm speaking on behalf of the Committee.
Either you kill him, or we kill you.
That's an order!
Alright.
I'm leaving for Dongo now.
You won't hear from me again till it's all over.
Come in...
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Would you like something to eat?
Well, yes, if possible...
we're rather hungry.
- Do you have something warm?
- Yes, of course...
Oh, our salami is very good...
Would you like some wine, too?
No, no...
No wine.
Just water for me.
Thank you.
How are you feeling this morning?
A little better?
A little better, yes.
They're being nice with us...
I think that's a good sign, isn't it?
Why are the Americans taking so long?
- Who are those two in the car?
- Two patriots, I personally guarantee.
Good morning.
Get out of there immediately.
I don't want spies in my way.
You have no right...
You will answer for this!
I'm accountable only to my command and no one else.
You don't know who we are.
You should stand to attention when you talk to us!
- Why?
Who are you?
- We represent the Free Government of Rome!
We're in charge of liaison with the Americans.
Wonderful... just what I needed!
If you don't get out of here immediately, I'll put a bullet into your skulls!
Come on, boys, it's late!
Get on the truck...
You two, get lost!
And have fun in Como!
- But, Colonel...
- Get in the car!
Keep going, we've got no time to lose!
Damn.
We caused a stir!
What are you afraid of?
They're friends, aren't they?
We'll apologize on the way back!
Hey, stop!
Who are you?
I'm from HQ in Milan.
I need to speak with your commanding officer.
Listen.
Mussolini isn't here.
They took him away.
What are you talking about?
They tried to transfer him last night, but failed.
Now they're hiding him in a farmhouse in the hills.
Who's the commanding officer, here?
Valerio, the best thing to do is act as if you don't know anything.
I've already found out where he is.
Oh.
Here he is.
Pedro says that if you want to talk, you'll have to go to him unarmed.
What?
Have you all gone mad?
Colonel...
let us speak first, please...
Come here, quick...
Let's try to follow the normal procedures...
Colonel Valerio.
I want to talk to you alone.
Pedro, the political commander of the brigade will be here in a few minutes.
- Look, we've got to be there as well.
- Just a second!
- Do you know these two guys from Como?
- I would have saluted them.
If I did.
They're boycotting our mission, acting like double-dealers.
What are talking about?
You know who we are!
- Take them!
- Stop!
What are you doing!
I'm Sforni, secretary of the National Liberation Committee of Como!
- And this is Major De Angelis!
- I want to see your documents.
- We were in a hurry, we didn't take them!
- We'll verify your identity later, then.
- Arrest them!
- What are you doing!
This is a mistake!
Have you all gone mad?
!
Okay, let's go.
- Where are Mussolini and his men?
- Mussolini is hidden in a farmhouse the others are in Germasino.
Guido, Neri... come up here.
- What's up?
- The men from Milan have arrived.
- Damn, and you let them in?
- Pedro spoke to them...
- Who are these men?
- They're the escort.
Pietro!
We met him in Milan.
You can trust him.
Check his papers.
We assure you they're in order.
This is Pietro.
The Political Commissioner of our brigade.
Sorry about all this but we still have difficulty in getting in touch with General Command.
We've just come out of clandestinity and we don't know each other...
We've even discovered some fascists dressed as partisans!
Anyway, your papers are in order.
What's your mission?
My orders are to shoot Mussolini and the others.
And I mean to do it now.
Within an hour.
I don't agree.
I intend to hand them over to the General Command to avoid any attempt at an execution without a trial.
But we must shoot them before they fall into the hands of the Americans!
Their troops are only a few kilometres from here!
I don't want the Americans to get them either...
- We'll take them to Milan together.
- I have precise orders!
And I mean to carry them out whether you like them or not!
To me, those orders are not just!
What, are you trying to save his neck?
The man's a criminal!
I agree... he'll have to pay, and pay hard...
That's exactly what I'm proposing to do.
Make him pay!
What I object to, is an execution without a trial.
Mussolini and his accomplices have already been regularly condemned to death.
There's a Liberation Committee decree signed by all the antifascist parties.
Then, let's join forces and transfer him to Milan.
Impossible!
Can't you see that they're all out to get him?
The Americans.
The British.
Agents coming from south...
We saw them ourselves, with our own eyes...
The cowardice and the doubts are starting to surface already...
The compromises... the filth that we wanted to wipe out once and for all!
Either we shoot him now, or he'll never pay.
The National Liberation Committee decreed that the sentence for acts of treason committed by hierarchs be pronounced by a war tribunal.
Commander Pedro we are the war tribunal.
"The 52nd brigade Command acting as a war tribunal can issue the sentence on the basis of the identification of the accused".
- What's your name?
- Giovan Battista Germinazza.
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing, I was just curious.
I wanted to see Mussolini and Petacci.
- They say she's very hot!
- Is that your car?
No, my boss's.
He has a villa near here.
- I'm only the driver.
- Any gasoline in it?
- Yes.
- Stay here.
You and your car have just been requisitioned by the 52nd brigade.
But...
listen...
- I found a car.
- Good.
Take the road to Como.
- Hey, where are we going?
- He'll show you the way!
Can't we go any faster?
- I said faster!
- You want to finish up in the lake?
Aren't you a driver?
- So what?
- Then drive!
At the crossroad, take the road for to Giulino Di Mezzegra.
This way.
- We can go now.
- Where?
Get back onto the road to the lake.
THE PLOUGH FURROWS THE GROUND BUT IT IS THE SWORD WHICH DEFENDS IT
Stop here.
Go and block the curve.
Get down.
You stay here.
You go down and don't let anyone near.
Move the car away.
Get out of the way!
- You can't kill him!
- Get away!
- You can't kill him!
- Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
- Get away!
- No!
By order of the general command of the corps of Volunteers for Liberty I am in charge of rendering justice to the Italian people.
Pietro, give me your gun!
- No!
Don't shoot!
- Back off!
- Get away!
- Don't shoot him!
- Don't shoot him!
- I told you to get away!
TWO HOURS LATER.

Between 1943 and 1944 Hitler's empire, stretching from the Volga river to the English Channel began collapsing under the blows of the Soviet army and the Anglo-American landings.
On the eastern front.
After the Stalingrad defeat, the German army is driven out of Russia after being decimated and compelled to a shameful retreat through Ukraine and Poland.
On the southern front, the Anglo-Americans heading up the Italian peninsula where, in the meantime, Mussolini's regime has collapsed.
In June, 1944 Rome is freed.
Several detachments of the Italian army, along with the partisans form an alliance with the Anglo-Americans and take part in the Nazi expulsion from Italian soil.
After the liberation of Paris the Nazi troops are driven out of the western front, towards the Rhine.
On April 11, 1945 the Anglo-Americans reach the Elbe river.
On April 16, the Russian troops begin the battle to conquer Berlin.
There are just 15 days to Hitler's end the Reich is in ruins and the horror of the concentration camps where nine million people found a dreadful death, is devastating.
In northern Italy, Mussolini who had entered the war hoping to share Hitler's plunder is now just the leader of a puppet government.
On April 20, General Clark's troops spread through the Po valley.
In the Alps, and in several parts of the Po-Venetian plain the National Liberation Army, counting 200.000 men is waiting for the general insurrection order from the allied headquarters.
Mussolini is surrounded.
The Americans and the British want to get him alive in order to try him as a war criminal.
The Germans want him on their side until the end.
But the "National Liberation Committee" (NLC) has already issued the death penalty for Benito Mussolini.
LAST DAYS OF MUSSOLINI
- Look.
The Duce!
- Duce!
Duce!
- Captain.
- Heil!
I will announce you to his Excellency...
Captain!
- Heil Duce!
- Do you always enter unannounced?
- There was no time.
- Why not?
The German Embassy has moved to Merano.
- We have to reach it.
- "We"?
As soon as possible.
Not later than tomorrow.
- My orders, come directly from Berlin.
- We are to abandon Milan?
General Clark's troops are across the Po.
The partisans are coming down from the mountains to fight.
We must move north.
But...
Not to Merano.
We'll go here, to Valtellina on the Alps, I'll continue the fight.
- Alone?
- Thousands of men will follow me!
Valtellina is a perfect strategic position.
- Excellency...
- Yes, Captain...
My orders are to instruct you that the movements of your soldiers must be strictly co-ordinated by the Reich authorities.
You and your government must transfer to Merano, immediately.
Under your protection?
No!
The Führer needs an ally, not a prisoner there are more than 100,000 men ready to combat for victory.
They are bringing the ashes of Dante Alighieri from Ravenna...
Dante!
The father of the Italian language.
I'll report your intentions to Berlin, but, for the moment, our objective must be Merano.
You must not leave Milan till we are ready to move.
- Excellency...
- What?
- You must give me your word of honour.
- You have my word.
- [How many men can you spare?
] - [A dozen.]
[I'll be back by tomorrow.]
[Meanwhile, don't let him out of your sight for a second.]
- [What if he tries to escape?
] - [The orders are explicit.]
[He's to be shot, no hesitation.]
The general strike has begun an armed insurrection will follow.
But General Clark prohibited any attempt at insurrection...
For the salvation of our lands our homes, our factories demonstrate in the streets under the tricolour banner of the NLC!
Give the Germans the choice they got in Genoa and Turin "Surrender or die"!
Viva the general strike!
Viva the national insurrection!
Milan, April 25, 1945.
Our mediation is imperative, or blood will run in every gutter in Milan.
The fascists have been given four hours to surrender to the partisans.
After six o'clock, it'll be "shoot on sight".
What do you know of Mussolini's real intentions?
There's some wild talk about a stronghold in the Alps, a last stand but Cella assured me that Mussolini has no intentions of fighting.
What makes Cella so sure?
Mussolini sold him the buildings and the presses of "Popolo d'Italia" for 109 million lire.
He had the money transferred to a Swiss bank account...
Hardly the gesture of a man planning his last battle.
Claretta Petacci.
His mistress.
Is here in Milan.
He's probably thinking of getting himself to safety and taking her.
Will he appear at the meeting, this afternoon?
Mussolini is unpredictable, but everything points to his coming.
Excellency...
I greatly appreciate your coming here.
I only pray our meeting may prevent further sorrow and destruction...
You are now the only man capable of saving Northern Italy from complete chaos and disaster.
It'll take all your courage.
The journey to Saint Helena is long and lonely.
And dangerous.
Remember that Napoleon was on the deck of a British warship...
Much safer than a salon in the Curia of Milan.
This is the history of the life of Saint Benedict.
I wrote it many years ago...
There's a situation in here very like our own.
Totila, the king of the Goths, is received by the Saint in the monastery at Monte Cassino.
- Monte Cassino?
Monte Cassino has been destroyed by the new barbarians the Americans.
The British and the Polish have reduced it to rubble.
Not even a saint could live there, now.
May I ask how you intend to save Milan from a similar destruction?
From that useless slaughter you were unable to spare the rest of Italy?
- Meaning?
- A drink?
No, no...
Do you plan to accept the capitulation which will be offered to you today?
Well, my plan is simple...
First, I'll disband the army and the Republican National Guard and then I'll withdraw to the mountains with thousands of fascist loyalists.
- You mean to continue the war?
- A symbolic gesture.
An empty gesture.
The men ready to follow you will only be a few hundred, don't fool yourself.
More, more...
Many more.
So, General Cadorna, what do you propose?
Since these are political, and not military negotiations I shall let the delegate from the National Liberation Committee Counsellor Marazza, speak.
I have been charged by the Committee to ask for your unconditional surrender.
I came to this meeting because I was promised guarantees for fascists and their families.
We'll find an agreement about these matters...
- What the people demand...
- The people!
I've devoted my life to serve the people!
I've always fought against the king and traitors who wanted to disrupt my revolution!
Gentlemen, please excuse me...
In these days I've enacted a decree with which I intend to give all my power to the people.
The decree provides for the nationalization of factories and the transfer of my powers to the Socialist Party.
This is my commitment.
I still haven't received an answer to this proposal...
I am now waiting.
Mister Mussolini.
Your proposal is pointless.
You give away things, that don't belong to you anymore.
You have destroyed the parliament, the unions, the political parties...
You've deceived the people with promises of colonies, empires, and victorious wars.
And now, in the midst of this catastrophe you want to pass yourself off as a socialist!
You have no other choice than unconditional surrender.
As for your personal safety the new Prefect of Milan Riccardo Lombardi will be responsible.
What about the safety of my followers?
We intend to accord the fascist troops treatment reserved for prisoners of war.
But not the criminals of war...
they'll be judged by the appropriate military tribunals.
Criminals!
And who is to decide?
Who is to judge?
We could never trust you!
Duce, we can't sign a surrender behind the Germans' backs.
Our loyalty to our ally is our highest claim to honour!
Graziani.
I understand what you're trying to say, but we still have the duty to negotiate.
- We have to work out an understanding.
The Germans are not as scrupulous as you over honour.
General Wolff has negotiated the surrender of their detachments in Italy.
Negotiations... it's just talk...
a delaying tactic.
It seems they did not feel the need to inform you.
Of course, we knew or guessed, but there have been further developments.
- What do you mean?
- Prefect Bassi knows all the details.
Well... it's true...
I've learned that the Germans have completed the negotiations for the surrender of all their troops in Italy to the Anglo-Americans.
General Wolff is expected here at the Palace any minute to sign the agreement.
- How did you find that out?
- From Don Bicchierai he handled the negotiations with the Germans.
Now that the secret is out, I can confirm it.
But... what are the conditions?
The Germans will be considered prisoners of war in accordance with international conventions.
In exchange, they will pledge not to destroy our factories not to take hostages and to disarm the fascist militia.
I can't believe this...
I can't believe that you would use the Germans against your own people!
Not our people!
Your people, your bandits!
The Germans have always treated us as servants, and now they betray us!
They're just betraying the fascists... and you!
I will deal with them!
Duce, we must try to talk to the Germans...
Let it be clear that from this moment I am resuming full liberty of action with the Germans.
Me!
I'll return in an hour.
Excuse me, your Eminence...
I will speak with the Germans, and I assure you, there will be an agreement.
I hope so.
It's the only way to keep Milan from turning into a battleground.
There's been enough blood and destruction.
Italians!
This material is magnificent!
Wonderful!
All of Italy must see it...
they must see it!
Stand at attention!
- Salute the Duce!
- Heil!
I have sent a letter to Hitler informing him, as of June 10th Italy will enter the war and fight by Germany's side.
Your Excellency has received my report so you must be aware of our military unreadiness.
- We need more time.
- In 3 or 4 months the war will be over.
We must forget about the military problem and concentrate on our political advantages.
- But, Excellency...
- When the war is over we have to be on the winning side and have our share of rewards and glory.
In order to do this.
I must have a few thousand Italian dead.
Only then will I be able to sit at the negotiating table and have real negotiating power.
Do you understand?
Your General Wolff has betrayed us!
Pavolini, what's happening?
Why aren't you giving orders?
!
- I have to know first what order to give.
- How many black shirts can you get?
- At least thirty thousand, Duce.
- We can't keep on repeating these lies!
Where are these men?
Nowhere, they're nowhere!
Our men are pouring into Milan from all over Lombardy!
- Lies!
- Tomorrow at 8, in Como...
In Valtellina.
Not Como!
In Valtellina!
There's nothing there!
No food, no guns, nothing!
They're all strategists, now!
Liars!
We haven't even got enough gasoline to get us there!
What, you want to give up?
To surrender to the partisans?
We must die fighting!
No agreements, neither with Germans nor partisans!
Alright, but where is the artillery?
!
We have to leave Milan.
We'll go to Como...
There.
We'll decide whether to go to Germany or die on the Alps, with the ashes of Dante.
Duce.
Don't leave...
It's safer for you to stay in Milan...
- For how long?
- Till the Americans arrive.
Ah.
The Americans...
No, no, no...
The truth is that I hate the Americans and the British more than the partisans!
What can the partisans do to me?
Shoot me?
No.
I will not be turned into a trophy for the Tower of London.
Nor exhibited in New York's Madison Square Gardens...
- Have you seen the lady?
- Mrs. Petacci is waiting in the courtyard.
- What did she say?
- She asked no questions.
She simply told me to tell you that she is ready to follow you, anywhere.
Thank you.
Let him go, you cannot be any help to him now...
- You would only be in the way.
- You don't understand...
He needs me.
He's always needed me.
You, and a hundred others...
I know, but I'm the one he sent for.
I want to be near him now I can't leave him when he's in danger.
They'll hunt him down like an animal and when they get you, they'll kill you both!
What about Switzerland?
This Swiss frontier isn't far from here.
The Germans won't even let him see the frontier.
Look at him...
I'm sure that he'll win in the end he's brave and clever.
He has a plan, you know?
Listen.
Marcello...
He's already sent Churchill a letter, a magnificent letter...
There's nothing cowardly or defeatist about it...
It's a plan to defeat communism, not just in Italy, but all over the world.
Churchill will listen to him...
he must listen to him.
Oh, Marcello, you know...
How many times they've written him off?
He always pulled through.
He'll win through again.
We must trust him.
I'm sure he will overcome all obstacles.
Heil Duce!
Heil!
He had promised me he'd never see that woman again!
Why do you worry?
She's his daughter...
At least that's what everybody says in Milan...
Daughter or not, she's a whore to me!
Claretta, do you still want to follow him?
Yes, absolutely...
Anywhere...
Mister Sereni.
You must listen to your Cardinal.
You must promise me that there'll be no armed insurrection.
You are not my Cardinal...
and it's impossible to stop it now.
- The insurrection has already begun.
- Mister Valiani, you persuade him...
- What's the use of fighting?
- If the fascists surrender there'll be no fighting.
- What about you, Mister Lombardi?
- Everything will be done legally.
Criminals of war will be court-martialled.
If Mussolini surrenders.
His life must be spared.
- Sure, we've given our word.
- He's already been sentenced to death the sentence must be carried out.
It's almost 8.
He said he'd have an answer for us in an hour.
Let's see what he's decided to do.
Prefect Bassi here.
This is Cardinal Schuster.
I'm speaking from the Archbishop's Palace.
We're waiting for Mussolini's answer.
Here.
The Duce has left.
There is no answer.
- Mussolini has left Milan.
- He ran away!
Therefore we've no reason to honour the promise to spare his life.
Now, anyone who arrests him can execute him immediately and legally.
The Americans insist he be turned over to them.
I'm sorry Eminence, but if we get him first all they'll get is a corpse.
Eminence.
Eminence.
They've flashed from Milan that Mussolini has left the city and is heading north.
There'll be a lot of people chasing him English, partisans and especially the communists among them.
We must be first.
The order is to take him alive and it was transmitted personally from President Truman to General Clark.
I'll leave in 15 minutes.
I've got 12 men in my squad.
Thank you.
We'll have to cross the border a couple at a time.
We'll rendezvous before dawn in the Mount Olimpino shelter.
It's only a couple of miles across the border right on top of Como.
We've an agent in Como already...
Larry Burrows.
He has a lot of contacts.
Luckily the Rome secret services have agreed to collaborate with us.
According to their information, Mussolini wants to turn himself over to us.
I don't know how true that is...
I'll find out.
If correct, we'll try not to let him down.
- Good luck, Captain.
- Good luck!
- What's the situation here in Como?
- The city is calm but there are strong groups of partisans up in the mountains.
If they attack, there's nothing we can do.
- Duce, it could happen any minute!
- I don't understand I was told that all the partisans in the area had been eliminated.
You choose to ignore the truth!
- If I ignore it, the fault is your own!
- You wanted to believe Pavolini!
The only thing he ever accomplished was burn the houses of the partisans and frighten the population!
How many fascists are coming to Como?
Thousands, but they're not soldiers, they're just misfits.
Last night, a group of twelve partisans disarmed over 200 black shirts without firing a single shot.
What's the situation on the Swiss border?
The pass at Chiasso is heavily guarded by Germans.
Pizzamiglio is very difficult to reach.
Our only chance could be to reach the border from Menaggio.
There are no Germans at the Porlezza pass, just fascists.
Maybe...
Maybe we can make arrangements with the Swiss for the safe passage of the entire Government.
Buffarini, you tell everyone off our new plans.
Thank you.
- Prefect...
- Duce.
Are you in contact with the American consul in Lugano?
Yes, it was in the matter of some passports.
Alright I don't care now...
are you in contact with him?
Yes, Excellency.
Call him.
Tell him I want to hand myself over to them...
Yes, Excellency.
No, I'm not trying to run away and I'm not trying to save myself...
I just want to meet the Americans on neutral grounds so we can bargain on equal terms.
I am far from finished!
Italy and I still have a marvelous, great future together!
I must get to Switzerland first and the Swiss cannot refuse me an entry permit!
I only hope it's not too late.
Your departure from Milan did nothing but worsen the situation...
Soon.
Milan will be in the hands of the partisans...
- I ask you to help me!
- I'll call the Swiss authorities.
Transmit it immediately.
I just had a telephone call from the prefect at Como.
Mussolini wants to hand himself over to us.
He's waiting for an answer.
Tell him this... he can cross the border by tomorrow at 1 PM... but alone.
He's asked for authorization for two other people.
I gather one of them would be the Petacci woman.
Alright, for him and two others.
We must have an agent at every border post.
Do you really think he means to surrender to us?
If he tries to escape, the Germans will shoot him.
If he stays, the partisans will.
That's for sure.
We're his only hope...
Allen, do you think that Washington will be lenient with him?
He'll be a prize trophy to show at the peace table but there are 8 million Italians in America.
Truman will have to handle them carefully, if he wants their vote for re-election.
If it's "thumbs down", Truman's in trouble...
But if it's "thumbs up", he's made it.
- Cigar?
- Yes.
Thanks!
- Excellency...
- What is it?
Your wife.
Hello?
Yes...
You got my message?
No, no, no...
Rachele...
The most important thing is that you save yourself and the children.
You have to pass the border along with them that's the most important thing!
Rachele, listen to me...
Of course!
Yes...
I took my decision...
I'll follow my destiny.
You're the only woman that I have ever loved.
Goodbye, Rachele.
- Where was she calling from?
- The Villa Montero.
- Is that far from here?
- About a kilometre.
Tell Mrs. Petacci to stay in the hotel.
Alright.
Thank you.
[Wake up!
Wake up!
]
[Lieutenant, wake up!
]
[Mussolini is leaving!
]
Duce, you can't leave without my escort!
I go where I want, when I want!
Get out of my way!
You can't leave without my escort!
You heard what he said!
The Duce can do what he pleases.
In the absence of Captain Kerneg I am responsible, directly to the Führer, for the Duce's personal safety.
You weren't concerned with my safety when General Wolff surrendered.
I'm not under General Wolff's orders!
Our orders are direct from Berlin.
And I am personally responsible.
I'm not concerned with your problems!
Not at all.
[Attention!
]
[The fascists can't leave without us!
]
[Ready to move!
If necessary, shoot!
]
Bassi!
- Let the Germans follow us...
- Alright.
[Let's go!
Hurry up!
]
[Quickly!
]
Jackson, set up the radio and get in touch with Lugano.
You go down to Como.
You know where to find Burrows...
I'll get in contact with you as soon as possible.
We have to get Mussolini before the Germans.
The Italians and even before those bloody English!
We have to get him first.
Ok boys, when you're all in uniform, let's get some rest.
It's gonna be a tough day!
Sorry, Marshall, but you can't go in.
Can't go in?
What do you mean I can't go in?
- We must talk with the Duce!
- The Duce is asleep.
He said you're to avoid gatherings, you are to withdraw to Cadenabbia.
Why didn't he wait for Pavolini and his black shirts?
We don't even know what we are supposed to do!
- We need precise orders.
- You'll get your orders at noon.
Meanwhile, clear the square and go back to Cadenabbia.
I'll go to Cadenabbia and I'll stay there!
But can't you understand this whole thing is a farce?
Mussolini is planning to escape to Switzerland and leaving us here to fend for ourselves!
Let him run!
I'm going to do my duty as a soldier!
We know where you're going!
You're going to give yourself up!
Never!
Now I know why we're here...
we're guests at a honeymoon party.
A perfect moment for a honeymoon...
Barracu.
Mrs. Petacci would like to know if she can see him.
Yes, his Excellency left instructions to admit her.
Duce, I have brought the last loyal men to die with you!
Fine...
There are thousands of black shirts gathered in Como ready to fight with their usual bravery.
Any news of Commander Borghese and the others?
Commander Borghese disbanded his troops and hid himself... waiting to give himself to the Americans.
Even Graziani is talking about "surrendering with honour".
With honour!
Honour!
My generals become concerned with honour only when it's time with surrender!
Anyway Pavolini, I'm proud of the courage that your black shirts have shown.
Thank you, Excellency.
Colonel...
- We're leaving!
- When?
- Now.
- With Pavolini?
No, by ourselves.
- Should I tell Mrs. Petacci?
- Yes.
Tell her that this time she comes in the car with me.
May I ask where you are going?
If you want to know, follow me.
[Gunter!
Get a move on!
Hurry up!
]
What is he doing, now?
Let's follow him!
[Come on!
Come on!
]
- Where are we going?
- The Grandola pass.
What about the Germans?
A few minutes' advantage will be enough to get rid of them.
There are 500 black shirts waiting in Grandola they will escort us across the border into Switzerland.
How are you feeling?
Better.
I slept for a few hours.
[Step on it!
Come on!
]
[Faster, goddammit!
]
The Duce!
- Where is everyone?
- They've all run off...
- Where's the path for the Swiss border?
- It starts out here...
Go with the Duce!
This path is too narrow for a car!
The Swiss authorities closed the pass.
Eminence, I need permission for two people myself and someone very close to me.
That way, we can slip across the Swiss border at night.
I just need permission from the Swiss, it shouldn't be difficult...
They've just told me that they denied permission to your wife and kids too.
- They what?
- I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
Alright, I see...
Too bad.
I wanted to avoid bloodshed.
But now I have to wait for Pavolini's men and try to resist until the Americans arrive.
But I want you to remember one thing, Eminence if you don't help me, the blood will be on your hands!
This is the man who once thought he was a new Caesar a people's leader, a God...
How will he be remembered?
As the man who made trains arrive on time.
We'll wait for the Americans...
Relax boys, it's Burrows.
- Captain.
- Burrows.
This man is an agent of the fascist secret service.
Hi.
- A cigarette?
- Thank you.
The fascist convoy which has stopped in Como...
The fascist convoy which has stopped in Como wants to negotiate surrender.
Their leaders have asked me to act as a go-between.
That's impossible.
The fascists are still at war with the United States.
Their surrender must be unconditional.
Their surrender must be unconditional.
The fascists intend to accept the unconditional surrender but what happens once they do?
Their life will be spared.
- What about Mussolini?
- We already discussed this...
If Mussolini turns himself over to us.
He'll have nothing to worry about.
If Mussolini turns himself over to us.
He'll have nothing to worry about.
- Chocolate?
- Thanks, very kind of you.
I'm here to arrest him and fly him to Allied headquarters.
The fascists want to know if he'll be put on trial.
Well, I think... that's inevitable.
Well, I think... that's inevitable.
In the future, you're going to need friends in Italy in the fight against communism.
You'd be wiser not to execute him.
Alive.
Mussolini will influence public opinion in favour of the Americans.
Where is it?
It was here...
Oh.
Here it is.
Listen to this letter.
This is a letter you wrote to me when I was in the hospital when I was very sick, remember?
I was very unhappy then, and you said...
I was very unhappy then, and you said...
"My darling, now you must want to live more than ever.
Use your willpower".
Very typical of you.
"It is only a matter of one courageous step at a time and you have already taken the first one.
...and you have already taken the first one.
We will be together again soon.
Your room is waiting for you in Palazzo Venezia.
And I'm waiting for you too.
With love and admiration...
With love and admiration your Ben".
That was a very important letter for me at the time.
And it still is.
Thank you.
You know.
I wrote a letter to you once but you never received it.
I remember that at the end of it.
I said...
"Snakes must be killed before they bite".
What's happening?
The snakes are leaving.
I see, and there's a whore running along with them...
I see, and there's a whore running along with them...
I saw her leaving with you in Milan you had promised me you'd never see her again!
But here she is... running away!
- That bitch!
- She's not a bitch...
I think I should have left you in Milan!
I think I should have left you in Milan!
Then why did you send the colonel to find me?
I wanted you to share my destiny.
Doesn't that prove that I love you?
Your destiny?
How can I share anything with you when I'm not even allowed to be seen in public with you!
- You're ashamed of me, aren't you?
- No...
- You're ashamed of me.
I know!
- I'm not ashamed of you!
I know you are!
I know you are!
I am not ashamed of you...
Listen to me, Ben...
All I've ever wanted is to be near you and help you.
All I've ever wanted is to be near you and help you.
That's all I've ever wanted.
Believe me!
You want to help me?
This is the letter I wrote to Churchill...
I made the mistake of telling you, and what did you do?
You told your brother!
You told your brother!
Yes, you told your brother a state secret!
Now everyone knows!
The Germans, too.
Now, nobody's willing to pass the border and deliver it.
Now, nobody's willing to pass the border and deliver it.
And you sit there and tell me that you want to help me?
Look.
Look at this.
- What is it?
- It's so beautiful and peaceful...
- What is it?
- It's so beautiful and peaceful...
That's where we should be going, to Austria.
- No one would ever find us.
There.
- What are you talking about?
It's our nest!
I've arranged it all.
Only a couple of mountain people live there they think that the emperor is still on the throne!
It's the perfect hideout!
It's the perfect hideout!
- A hideout?
- Yes.
No...
Claretta, you don't understand.
I still want to fight.
And I will.
Soon I will find a way of contacting Mr. Churchill.
Soon I will find a way of contacting Mr. Churchill.
- Don't worry...
- But...
No, don't worry about the letter.
I will find a way...
Churchill will have to understand.
He stood by me in the beginning, and he has to stand by me now.
[Mussolini is inside.]
- How are you?
- Fine.
You had given me your word that you wouldn't have left Milan!
You had given me your word that you wouldn't have left Milan!
I know...
But the situation in Milan suddenly changed...
It was a decision of my ministers.
We have to go back to the valley immediately...
No.
I have decided to stay here, Captain.
Besides, the roads aren't safe.
We got through.
They're open...
If you want me to go, you'll have to use force...
Excellency, allow me to point out that these barracks could turn into a trap for us.
...that these barracks could turn into a trap for us.
They're isolated, with no defence.
If the partisans attack, we're finished.
I'm staying here!
- What about the lady?
- She's staying too.
Duce...
The mountains are full of partisans!
They will hunt you down.
The partisans mean business!
You choose either you die like an animal, or you come with me.
...either you die like an animal, or you come with me.
Everything went well... the Americans were extremely understanding.
They sent twelve agents from Switzerland to get Mussolini.
Over the border.
An American mission will take care of him.
Over the border.
An American mission will take care of him.
What are they going to do with Mussolini?
He will be treated as an honoured prisoner of the United States Army.
But who guarantees the Americans will respect the agreement once they've got Mussolini?
That man will act as guarantor...
he's an Italian officer from the south.
He belongs to the secret service of the Rome Government.
I have already made contact with the Como Liberation Committee.
I have their authorization to arrest Mussolini.
As soon as he is in our hands we will invoke the clause of the Armistice which obliges us to turn him over to the allies.
U.S. Captain Jack Donati will fly him to Siena to the Allied Headquarters.
...will fly him to Siena to the Allied Headquarters.
Yes, but how?
We're cut off.
The partisans are blocking all the roads.
Now that the Captain's with us, we'll have no trouble.
I have both Italian and American passes but we have to get Mussolini as soon as possible!
What are we waiting, then?
Let's go!
Who's your commander?
We're a from the Government of Rome!
Who's your commander?
We're a from the Government of Rome!
My name is Giovanni, I am the chief of this brigade.
We have all the passes.
We have to get to Menaggio as soon as possible.
Hey!
This is Commander Della Muti!
I know him.
It's him!
Stop, for God's sake!
Let us explain!
Let's kill them!
Stop!
Let us explain!
- There's a reason we're here!
- You're making a mistake!
Alright!
Let's hear what they have to say!
Shut up!
We're on our way to negotiate the surrender of the fascists troops...
We're on our way to negotiate the surrender of the fascists troops according to the rules of war!
So now they invoke the laws of war!
The fascists are not surrendering, they're running away!
It's too late to change sides!
You, come with me to the brigade HQ!
Come on!
Calm down!
Let's wait until they're back!
Come on.
Tell him...
Listen!
- We worked things out...
- So, can we go on?
- Will they let us go?
- Don't worry, we'll leave soon...
They got through to Como, the situation was cleared up...
- Can we go to Menaggio, now?
- No, we have to go to Como, first...
- Can we go to Menaggio, now?
- No, we have to go to Como, first...
So... so, let's go...
Not him!
Not Commander Della Muti!
He's a murderer!
A butcher!
The blood is still on his hands!
This is a mistake!
We're a delegation!
Let's go, let's go!
Where are you going?
!
Don't leave me alone!
You cowards!
Where are you going?
!
Don't leave me alone!
You cowards!
Leave me be!
Let me go with them!
Attention!
Republican National Guard present!
What does this mean?
Where are the black shirts?
Where are the black shirts?
- They're here.
- How many are they?
- Twelve.
- Twelve what?
!
Twelve children?
!
200 Germans have arrived.
An entire anti aircraft unit with heavy machine guns.
We could join them...
From my own people, I get twelve children...
From the Germans.
I get hundreds of men...
Alright...
Alright...
I go with them.
Article 5.
All members and hierarchy of the fascist government who contributed to the suppression of constitutional rights destroying individual freedom, imposing the fascist regime destroying individual freedom, imposing the fascist regime leading it towards the the present catastrophe will be sentenced to death.
[Don't shoot!
]
I am in command of the 52nd Garibaldi Partisan Brigade.
Lieutenant Fallmeyer.
We do not intend to fight, we just want to pass.
We do not intend to fight, we just want to pass.
You are in our machine gun line of fire.
- You wouldn't get far.
- I have orders to get back to Germany.
And I have orders not to let a single armed German beyond this point.
We have to request authorization from our HQ otherwise, we can't let you pass.
This is impossible...
I have precise orders.
Since you received your orders, everything has changed...
I repeat, you can't pass beyond this point...
Hold on a moment.
- There's a long convoy, back there.
- 30 trucks and at least 300 men.
They won't attack.
It wouldn't be worth it.
They don't know there are only ten of us.
We should gather the entire brigade here.
Then we should block the roads and tell the workers at Falk to get ready.
Alright...
let's do it.
While I take the lieutenant to our Headquarters you go ahead and tell everyone to join us.
Tell them to stay in the bushes, so they will think there are many of us and to wear red scarves.
Red is a scary colour, you know?
You... run to the Passo Bridge and mine it.
But Pietro, we ran out of explosives...
Then go to the bridge and pretend to place some explosive charges under it...
- Be careful.
Duce.
- I can't stay in a cage all day.
- Have you seen them on the lake?
- No, also in the mountains...
Why are we waiting here so long?
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe it was a mistake to trust the Germans.
- What did you say?
- I said that maybe it was a mistake to trust the Germans...
No.
Hitler has given special orders to defend me.
And of course you're under my personal protection.
Listen.
Ben...
Whatever happens, don't think about me.
Think about yourself...
don't worry about me.
You must save yourself...
that's all I care about.
In Milan, I promised to take you along with me.
It was a precise promise.
[They will let us pass...] [... but we'll have to hand over all the fascists in the convoy.]
[You can't accept these conditions.
It would be a betrayal!
]
[I am only concerned about the safety of my men, is that clear?
]
[Can we trust them?
]
[All the Germans who have surrendered were allowed to pass the border.]
[But we have special orders to get to Merano.]
[I signed the conditions on behalf of my men.]
[My orders come from the Führer!
]
[Lf your orders require you to stay with the Duce, stay and fight.]
[I am just responsible for the safety of my men.]
[The area we passed through was swarming with partisans...] [... and the bridges are mined.]
[I am just responsible for my men.]
[Let's go!
]
- [How do we tell this to Mussolini?
] - [God only knows!
]
The Germans are going!
They're leaving us in the hands of the partisans!
The Germans are going!
They've been authorized to pass the border!
- Calm down... what happened?
- This is the end.
The Germans are going to leave us in the hands of these bandits!
But it would be a betrayal!
Who said that?
[We're moving out.
Get the engines started.]
[We're moving out!
]
[Only the Germans will pass through!
]
[Throw out the Italians...
if necessary use your guns!
]
[Do you hear me?
Get ready!
]
[Lieutenant...]
[I have an idea that might work.]
[I'm afraid it's too late.
I have given my word.]
[Listen, we could have Mussolini...] [... putting on a German uniform, and hide him on board with the soldiers.]
[The partisans wouldn't notice him.]
[Lieutenant!
This is a Führer's personal wish...]
[Don't forget it.]
[Alright.]
- What's going on?
!
- I don't know...
- Tell me something!
What's going on?
!
- Calm down...
I don't understand!
- We're all going to get killed!
- Please.
Calm down!
If the partisans find out the Duce is with us.
It'll be the end...
- They're going to kill us!
- Calm down, please...
- Calm down.
Mrs. Petacci...
- We're all going to die...
Excellency?
I suggest you put on a German overcoat and helmet and hide in one of the trucks.
It's your only chance to get through.
There's no time.
Fallmeyer's convoy is preparing to move immediately.
Excellency...
Go with the Germans.
Save yourself.
Please, don't worry about me.
You must save yourself.
Captain...
I ask you a personal favour.
Let the lady come with me.
It's impossible, only you.
Move this block!
Duce!
Are we going to surrender without even an attempt to fight?
- It would be useless.
- It's true then, you're deserting us!
How dare you say I'm deserting you!
You, who promised me thousands of black shirts!
I ordered you to destroy the partisans and what did you do?
!
Nothing!
Excellency!
Let's go!
Duce, it's true that we didn't defeat the partisans but since you were in Milan, you had just one thought in your mind to pass the border!
And now you're leaving alone, and dressed as a German!
[Let him sit.]
- Traitors!
- Cowards!
Traitors!
Let me in!
Let me go with him!
Don't leave me here!
I beg you!
Help me!
Let me in!
I want to go with him!
I don't want to leave him!
I can't leave him!
Don't you understand?
!
Help me to get in!
I want to go with him!
[Get out!
]
We'll stay here to take care of the fascists.
Check all the trucks when they get to Dongo.
Go!
If it wasn't for you, Duce Hitler would never have become Führer.
No one can wear a uniform like our Duce!
- He looks like a God.
- He is God!
Throw down your guns and form a group!
You must guarantee we'll be treated according to the International Convention.
Drop that gun!
Group up against the wall!
ONLY GOD CAN BEND THE WILL OF FASCISTS, NEVER MEN OR THINGS
- Where's Pedro?
- I don't know.
- Do you know where Pedro is?
- No.
- What about Bili?
- He was a here...
He's drunk!
Hey, camerata, wake up...
Excellency, wake up...
Benito Mussolini, come on, wake up...
Benito Mussolini, I arrest you in the name of the Italian people.
As long as you are under our protection, you won't be harmed.
No question, the partisans are about to attack!
General Wolff has probably signed the surrender by now...
We rejected the partisan's ultimatum.
Lieutenant, we have nothing to do with this...
Deal with it, we didn't invite you here!
Where did you expect us to go?
Hold your fire!
The German commander has accepted your surrender!
Hold your fire!
What are you shooting for?
Marshall, you must do something before its too late!
- What's going on outside?
- The Americans have arrived!
- Give yourselves up!
- Not until I have orders from Milan!
Call Milan.
Then!
It's useless to keep fighting!
The Germans have already surrendered.
Don't move!
Let me speak!
I'm Marshall Graziani.
Commander of the Fascist Army.
I'm Captain Jack Donati.
From now on, you're under U.S. Army protection.
- Where is Mussolini?
- I don't know.
I lost contact with him two days ago.
Our last information had him travelling north with a German convoy.
- Others say the partisans have him.
- May I ask what you intend to do to guarantee my personal safety?
I'm taking you to Milan.
I must talk to General Cadorna.
He's the only one who can tell me where Mussolini is.
- I hoped you would be able to.
- All I know is that he abandoned us!
Cold?
Don't you want to keep it as a souvenir?
What are you thinking?
I was thinking about two years ago, when the King dissolved my government.
All I wanted was to retire from politics and live the rest of my life in peace.
It would have been better for everyone.
Do you have orders to shoot me?
- At least tell me where we're going...
- To Germasino.
It's a village in the mountains.
No one will think of looking for you there.
What will you do to my fascists?
Will they be treated according to the Geneva Convention?
- We are prisoners of war...
- You committed all sorts of atrocities!
Even worse than the Germans!
Those weren't my orders...
The Duce was always against violence.
What about the Civil War?
The fascists killing women and children?
The sackings, the burnt villages, the slaughters the tortures and the killing of prisoners?
Where was the Geneva Convention then?
!
That was Hitler's fault...
Was anything ever your fault?
!
It's freezing, here.
Any chance of getting the stove working?
I've set up the guard.
I'm going down to Dongo, watch them carefully.
Alright, we'll take shifts.
Is there anything you need?
Yes.
Please.
Do me a favour...
Find the lady and tell her that I'm still alive...
Mrs. Petacci?
Alright.
I wrote him my first love letter when I was twelve years old.
It's absurd isn't it?
I was just a little girl...
When I was fourteen I invited him to my birthday party and I made the whole family wait for him because I was so sure he would come!
Even then, I always thought of him as a perfect man he was my ideal of a real man, because he is a real man, you know!
When I met him, I felt that I belonged to him.
I was just 18, then.
Please.
Do me a favour...
I beg you...
You can do anything you want with me, I can do any kind of job even the most menial.
I don't care...
But please, don't harm him...
He's a weak man.
Now...
He's a sick, broken, weak man...
Please don't hurt him, I beg you!
Nothing's going to happen to him, unless someone tries to free him.
Nobody will try to save him...
If you had been with him the last few days you'd have seen how everyone abandoned him...
They all ran away...
He ran away too, dressed as a German soldier.
He has deserted his own men to save his own life, hasn't he?
Anyway, for the moment, he's in no danger.
- Please, I want to ask you a favour...
- I'll do what I can.
Let me be with him.
What harm can there be?
Please.
Let me be with him...
Look, if something were to happen to him it would happen to you too...
You're going to shoot him?
We want him transferred to Milan.
To be tried by a popular jury.
If you give him to the Americans, he'll be treated as a prisoner of war!
It's got nothing to do with them!
He will be judged by the Italian people.
- Then why did you hide him?
- To protect him!
From the crowd, from a lynching...
A lynching?
What do you mean?
Today, he's the most hated man in Italy.
He's responsible for all the atrocities that the Germans and fascists committed!
A lot of people around here have lost relatives, killed because of him killed by the fascists!
Women and children too!
That was the war, it wasn't his fault...
It's not fair!
Fascism did a lot of good for Italy, before the war!
It brought us to ruin!
Look...
This is fascism...
Do you know what these are?
Wedding rings offered by the Italian women...
"Give your gold to your country", they said!
Do you know where we found them?
In the cars of the fascists who were running away!
Too many women in Italy are crying for their men!
Husbands and sons...
tortured, deported, murdered!
Cigarette?
Thank you...
You're very kind.
You must promise me one thing...
If he's going to be shot, I want to be shot with him.
I have no authority to make you such a promise.
Please...
I must be with him.
I can't let him die alone...
I must be with him!
Please, he's all I got...
And I'm all he's got...
Now that everyone else has left him I want to be with him.
Let me stay with him...
Please!
I beg you!
Latest word had him arrested at Dongo.
Now, it seems that the partisans have hidden him in a secret resort.
- They'll tell us where he is.
- Question is, who will go and get him?
And what to do with him, when we have him in our hands?
- Mattei, what do you say?
- It's simple.
The Liberation Committee resolution is very clear...
"Fascists leaders who have betrayed Italy, have been sentenced to death".
They only have to be identified and then brought in front of a firing squad.
- Pietra, do you want to go with your men?
- I'll provide the men.
- But I personally would rather stay here.
- Why?
Why?
There are still 20,000 armed Germans in Milan.
Until they've surrendered their weapons, that's my first duty...
They're locked in the barracks, but my men are the only ones watching them...
It's better that I stay here.
Do you want to go, Valerio?
Alright.
But I'll need vehicles.
Passes and an escort.
The Como area is still full of fascists.
You'll have to go to General Cadorna for everything.
The Americans have already reached Como.
Leave as soon as you can.
Do you understand what you have to do?
- I understand perfectly.
- Then go...
What will we tell the Americans?
They're bombarding us with messages demanding we hand Mussolini over to them.
We'll tell them that Mussolini has already been shot.
General Cadorna?
This is Colonel Sardagna, from Como.
Yes, I have just received your order, but I am not sure I understand...
The Liberation Committee is about to send one of their people to get Mussolini.
For a number of reasons, it'd be better if you transfer him before they get there.
We have to avoid shooting in case of an escape attempt.
Right now Mussolini is in a Germasino, just above Dongo.
I'll send an escort to take him from Dongo to Como where I shall personally take charge of him.
Once he's in Como, I'll arrange to have him taken to the Bresso airport.
If the Anglo-Americans ask us to hand him over we'll have to take him to the Allied Headquarters.
I've been asked if it is possible to save Claretta Petacci along with Mussolini.
You're free to do what you like about that...
I see.
In 1940, everybody asked me...
"Mussolini, why don't you enter the war?"
"Otherwise, Hitler will grab it all!"
I didn't want to go to war, but today, they all say...
"Find Mussolini!
Get him!
Kill Mussolini!"
So, you believe the people asked for the war?
And today, they put the blame on you!
You know what?
The people can't decide for themselves...
They just have to obey.
- Now you're sincere!
- Hitler is crazy...
His biggest mistake was declaring war on Russia.
- I tried to stop him...
- If he's crazy, why did you follow him?
Why didn't you turn your back on him?
I always tried to stop him...
he wouldn't listen.
But you were his teacher!
Who was his role model?
You!
Who started to persecute the opposition and the workers unions?
Who abolished the free press and the parliament?
You!
Who sent Italian men to fight in Abyssinia and Spain?
Who sent them to fight in Greece, or to freeze in Russia?
Not Hitler!
You!
Excellency, would you write a couple of lines for us?
- About what?
- A declaration to the effect that it was our brigade who arrested you...
What do you want me to write?
The 52nd Garibaldi Brigade...
"The 52nd Garibaldi Brigade..."
Captured me today...
"Captured me today..."
April 27th...
"April 27th..."
In the town square in Dongo.
"In the town square in Dongo".
Excellency, write about the kind of treatment you received.
"The treatment I've received during and after capture has been correct".
The Committee has decided to execute Mussolini.
My mission is to go to Dongo and shoot him.
The Americans are near Como and they're asking us to turn him over to them, alive.
They have the right on the basis of Article 29 of the Malta armistice.
But that armistice was signed two years ago by Badoglio we're not bound by it.
- Yes, we are.
Badoglio's signature bound all Italians.
Please.
Sure...
Fact is, in the last two years, many things have changed.
Mussolini's been sentenced to death many times by the people by the resistance, by those partisans with whom you have fought with, here in the North.
He's responsible for the massacres committed by the fascists.
- We must execute him.
- Why come to me?
General, I need vehicles and an escort.
And Italian and American passes to enter the liberated areas...
So?
What do I tell the Committee?
- In two hours you'll have what you need.
- Good.
That's good.
No, it's better not to show this...
This is good...
With England still fighting Hitler's attack on Russia means we're finished.
But Germany is invincible...
You have to remember that Russia has three great Generals General Snow, General Mud and General Distance.
No one's ever beaten them.
Camerati!
With allies like these.
We can conquer the world.
I want to march by Hitler's side into Russia.
The alliance between Germans and Italians will destroy bolshevism throughout the world.
Long live fascism!
Victory will be ours!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
We've received orders to leave.
What's that?
We're going to bandage your head and say you're wounded.
We have to cover about fifty kms and there are dozens of road blocks.
- I'm not going to wear this.
- Why?
Because it's German and I hate the Germans.
It's cold tonight.
Here...
Put this on.
Excellency, are you wounded?
No, it's nothing.
It's just a precaution.
- Claretta...
- What?
Why did you want to come with me?
It could be dangerous...
- I know, but that's the way I want it.
- You sure?
Yes.
Then...
I thank you.
Please, madam, let's go...
Good thing I met you.
We soldiers.
Understand each other...
- I hope Milan it's not far...
- No, we're almost there.
Quick, in my car!
On the way from Como to Milan, they shot at us at least four times.
- Yesterday, they even shot at me...
- Chaos reigns, here...
They're hunting the fascists like madmen!
Snipers are everywhere...
we must stop them!
- Please.
- Attention!
At ease...
This is the end of a civil war, captain.
Sit down, please.
Excuse me, general... about those passes, I'm going to check if they're ready.
Alright.
- Any news of Mussolini, general?
- Nothing accurate.
Remember that, according to the clauses of the armistice you are obliged to turn him over to us.
Alive.
We're moving carefully.
Wherever he is, Mussolini is in danger.
One mistake and he'll be in front of a firing squad.
After two years of occupation, people are angry...
They don't care about the armistice's articles.
But why do you want Mussolini so much?
A matter of prestige, I think.
Also, we believe that he might give us military and political information.
But he knew nothing...
Mussolini was just a puppet in the Germans' hands.
Captain, here's the passes...
These are the authorizations for the partisans to move in the free areas.
Fine.
A couple hours of sleep and I'll be ready.
Goodbye, general...
Thanks for everything.
Goodbye, Captain.
And thank you...
General, I'm on my way to Dongo.
My escort is made up of twelve men from the Oltrepò Pavese Division.
Here's the passes.
Nervous?
Nervous?
No...
You see, my men and I have already faced the fascists and the Germans before but this time I think we'll have to worry more about an attack from behind.
I'm talking about our British and American allies, you know?
Don't worry about them.
But.
Remember no personal vendettas.
When we were in exile.
In the resistance or in the fascists prisons most of us dreamt of getting Mussolini to execute him.
Now it's different.
Because we've won...
It's not a question of personal vendetta anymore...
Goodbye.
"To General Archimede Mischi...
I read your plans in the fight against partisan banditry.
I think it's vibrant and enthralling.
I'm sure that actions will follow your words.
We have to get rid of this hateful plague with fire and iron.
Signed, Mussolini".
We have to get rid of this hateful plague with fire and iron...
Signed, Mussolini.
We have to get rid of this hateful plague with fire and iron...
Signed, Mussolini.
- Where are we?
- Don't worry, I'll be back in a minute.
Did you hear?
These are cannon shots.
Yes, I hear.
I want to check out the situation before going any farther.
I know a guy who lives here.
I'll be right back...
We should have stayed in Germasino.
- The orders said to reach Como.
- I don't think it's safe...
The Americans must have reached Como.
They're the only ones with flares that strong.
- What do we do.
Now?
- We'll carry on avoiding Como.
Where could we go, Neri?
I know a peasant family who lives here.
They'll take him in...
- Where?
- Not far, in a place called Giulino.
Let's go, then.
These are two prisoners.
Can you shelter them overnight?
Yes.
Alright, take them in...
Pietro.
Let's leave them here for the night, tomorrow we'll see...
Do you think we can trust these people?
If the room upstairs is free, they'll sleep there.
Would you like something to drink?
Thanks.
I'd like some coffee.
If possible.
You, dear?
I don't have any real coffee, I can make you some substitute.
- That's fine, thank you.
- I'll get the room ready.
- You can come with us, if you want...
- For tonight it's all set, you can sleep.
We're going to Dongo to check the situation.
Alright.
Sandro, we'll be back tomorrow morning.
Don't let them out of your sight.
Please, would it be possible to have another pillow?
Of course!
If you need to use the bathroom, I'll show you the way.
Maybe later, thank you.
Look, this door has to stay open.
We can't let you out of our sight.
Can I ask a favour of you?
Please...
Let us close the door.
The lady needs to rest.
Please.
Can I close it?
Thank you.
Are you sure that this pass is authentic?
I know Donati personally.
I was in contact with him in Switzerland.
That's his signature.
I want your co-operation.
- I have to transfer Mussolini to Milan.
- We're going to put him in the Como jail.
We'll handle his transfer ourselves.
I greatly appreciate your organization.
But let's say I prefer to handle this particular situation by myself.
This is an unwarranted interference by the Milan committee!
That's what you think!
I've got American authorization, signed by Captain Jack Donati.
That's just a pass to enter the free areas it's not a warrant for Mussolini!
Thousands of black shirts were forced to surrender by our committee!
Milan has no right to take credit for arresting Mussolini from Como!
It's not a question of Milan or Como!
It's something which has to be done!
I was sent here by the General Command of the Liberty corps in complete agreement with Alt Italia Committee of Liberation!
I have been given orders, and I'm going to carry them out, at all costs!
- Look, I've already told you...
- Gentlemen!
I have twelve armed men along with me with whom I've solved tougher problems than your stupid objections.
So, either you stop interfering with my mission or you'll find yourselves filling the jail cells you prepared for Mussolini.
No doubt about it.
Now.
We have proof they want to turn him over to the Americans.
They say we are trying to steal the glory of the arrest and they want to transfer him to Milan themselves.
Enough.
Mussolini has to be shot.
Valerio, I'm speaking on behalf of the Committee.
Either you kill him, or we kill you.
That's an order!
Alright.
I'm leaving for Dongo now.
You won't hear from me again till it's all over.
Come in...
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Would you like something to eat?
Well, yes, if possible...
we're rather hungry.
- Do you have something warm?
- Yes, of course...
Oh, our salami is very good...
Would you like some wine, too?
No, no...
No wine.
Just water for me.
Thank you.
How are you feeling this morning?
A little better?
A little better, yes.
They're being nice with us...
I think that's a good sign, isn't it?
Why are the Americans taking so long?
- Who are those two in the car?
- Two patriots, I personally guarantee.
Good morning.
Get out of there immediately.
I don't want spies in my way.
You have no right...
You will answer for this!
I'm accountable only to my command and no one else.
You don't know who we are.
You should stand to attention when you talk to us!
- Why?
Who are you?
- We represent the Free Government of Rome!
We're in charge of liaison with the Americans.
Wonderful... just what I needed!
If you don't get out of here immediately, I'll put a bullet into your skulls!
Come on, boys, it's late!
Get on the truck...
You two, get lost!
And have fun in Como!
- But, Colonel...
- Get in the car!
Keep going, we've got no time to lose!
Damn.
We caused a stir!
What are you afraid of?
They're friends, aren't they?
We'll apologize on the way back!
Hey, stop!
Who are you?
I'm from HQ in Milan.
I need to speak with your commanding officer.
Listen.
Mussolini isn't here.
They took him away.
What are you talking about?
They tried to transfer him last night, but failed.
Now they're hiding him in a farmhouse in the hills.
Who's the commanding officer, here?
Valerio, the best thing to do is act as if you don't know anything.
I've already found out where he is.
Oh.
Here he is.
Pedro says that if you want to talk, you'll have to go to him unarmed.
What?
Have you all gone mad?
Colonel...
let us speak first, please...
Come here, quick...
Let's try to follow the normal procedures...
Colonel Valerio.
I want to talk to you alone.
Pedro, the political commander of the brigade will be here in a few minutes.
- Look, we've got to be there as well.
- Just a second!
- Do you know these two guys from Como?
- I would have saluted them.
If I did.
They're boycotting our mission, acting like double-dealers.
What are talking about?
You know who we are!
- Take them!
- Stop!
What are you doing!
I'm Sforni, secretary of the National Liberation Committee of Como!
- And this is Major De Angelis!
- I want to see your documents.
- We were in a hurry, we didn't take them!
- We'll verify your identity later, then.
- Arrest them!
- What are you doing!
This is a mistake!
Have you all gone mad?
!
Okay, let's go.
- Where are Mussolini and his men?
- Mussolini is hidden in a farmhouse the others are in Germasino.
Guido, Neri... come up here.
- What's up?
- The men from Milan have arrived.
- Damn, and you let them in?
- Pedro spoke to them...
- Who are these men?
- They're the escort.
Pietro!
We met him in Milan.
You can trust him.
Check his papers.
We assure you they're in order.
This is Pietro.
The Political Commissioner of our brigade.
Sorry about all this but we still have difficulty in getting in touch with General Command.
We've just come out of clandestinity and we don't know each other...
We've even discovered some fascists dressed as partisans!
Anyway, your papers are in order.
What's your mission?
My orders are to shoot Mussolini and the others.
And I mean to do it now.
Within an hour.
I don't agree.
I intend to hand them over to the General Command to avoid any attempt at an execution without a trial.
But we must shoot them before they fall into the hands of the Americans!
Their troops are only a few kilometres from here!
I don't want the Americans to get them either...
- We'll take them to Milan together.
- I have precise orders!
And I mean to carry them out whether you like them or not!
To me, those orders are not just!
What, are you trying to save his neck?
The man's a criminal!
I agree... he'll have to pay, and pay hard...
That's exactly what I'm proposing to do.
Make him pay!
What I object to, is an execution without a trial.
Mussolini and his accomplices have already been regularly condemned to death.
There's a Liberation Committee decree signed by all the antifascist parties.
Then, let's join forces and transfer him to Milan.
Impossible!
Can't you see that they're all out to get him?
The Americans.
The British.
Agents coming from south...
We saw them ourselves, with our own eyes...
The cowardice and the doubts are starting to surface already...
The compromises... the filth that we wanted to wipe out once and for all!
Either we shoot him now, or he'll never pay.
The National Liberation Committee decreed that the sentence for acts of treason committed by hierarchs be pronounced by a war tribunal.
Commander Pedro we are the war tribunal.
"The 52nd brigade Command acting as a war tribunal can issue the sentence on the basis of the identification of the accused".
- What's your name?
- Giovan Battista Germinazza.
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing, I was just curious.
I wanted to see Mussolini and Petacci.
- They say she's very hot!
- Is that your car?
No, my boss's.
He has a villa near here.
- I'm only the driver.
- Any gasoline in it?
- Yes.
- Stay here.
You and your car have just been requisitioned by the 52nd brigade.
But...
listen...
- I found a car.
- Good.
Take the road to Como.
- Hey, where are we going?
- He'll show you the way!
Can't we go any faster?
- I said faster!
- You want to finish up in the lake?
Aren't you a driver?
- So what?
- Then drive!
At the crossroad, take the road for to Giulino Di Mezzegra.
This way.
- We can go now.
- Where?
Get back onto the road to the lake.
THE PLOUGH FURROWS THE GROUND BUT IT IS THE SWORD WHICH DEFENDS IT
Stop here.
Go and block the curve.
Get down.
You stay here.
You go down and don't let anyone near.
Move the car away.
Get out of the way!
- You can't kill him!
- Get away!
- You can't kill him!
- Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
- Get away!
- No!
By order of the general command of the corps of Volunteers for Liberty I am in charge of rendering justice to the Italian people.
Pietro, give me your gun!
- No!
Don't shoot!
- Back off!
- Get away!
- Don't shoot him!
- Don't shoot him!
- I told you to get away!
TWO HOURS LATER.
IN THE DONGO TOWN SQUARE AS DECREED BYARTICLE 5 OF THE JUSTICE ORDINANCE ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL LIBERATION COMMITTEE 15 OUT OF THE 57 MEN ARRESTED WITH MUSSOLINI WERE SHOT BY THE PARTISANS
APRIL 29, 1945
THE NATIONAL LIBERATION COMMITTEE OF NORTHERN ITALY DECLARES THAT THE EXECUTION OF MUSSOLINI AND HIS ACCOMPLICES IS THE NECESSARY CONCLUSION OF A HISTORIC PERIOD WHICH LEAVES OUR COUNTRY IN MATERIAL AND MORAL RUIN AND IT IS THE CONCLUSION OF AN INSURRECTIONAL STRUGGLE THAT MARKS THE PREMISE OF THE COUNTRY'S REBIRTH AND RECONSTRUCTION.

Between 1943 and 1944
Hitler's empire, stretching from the Volga river to the English Channel began collapsing under the blows of the Soviet army and the Anglo-American landings.
On the eastern front, after the Stalingrad defeat, the German army is driven out of Russia after being decimated and compelled to a shameful retreat through Ukraine and Poland.
On the southern front, the Anglo-Americans heading up to the Italian peninsula where, in the meantime,
Mussolini's regime has collapsed.
In June, 1944 Rome is freed.
Several detachments of the Italian army, along with the partisans form an alliance with the Anglo-Americans and take part in the Nazi expulsion from Italian soil.
After the liberation of Paris the Nazi troops are driven out of the western front, towards the Rhine.
On April 11, 1945 the Anglo-Americans reach the Elbe river.
On April 16, the Russian troops begin the battle to conquer Berlin.
There are just 15 days to Hitler's end, the Reich is in ruins and the horror of the concentration camps where nine million people found a dreadful death, is devastating.
In northern Italy, Mussolini who had entered the war hoping to share Hitler's plunder is now just the leader of a puppet government.
On April 20, General Clark's troops spread through the Po valley.
In the Alps, and in several parts of the Po-Venetian plain the National Liberation Army, counting 200.000 men is waiting for the general insurrection order from the allied headquarters.
Mussolini is surrounded.
The Americans and the British want to get him alive in order to try him as a war criminal.
The Germans want him on their side until the end.
But the "National Liberation Committee" (NLC)
Has already issued the death penalty for Benito Mussolini.
LAST DAYS OF MUSSOLINI
- Look, the Duce!
- Duce!
Duce!
- Captain.
- Heil!
I will announce you to his Excellency.
Captain!
- Heil Duce!
- Do you always enter unannounced?
- There was no time.
- Why not?
The German Embassy has moved to Merano.
- We have to reach it.
- "We"?
As soon as possible.
Not later than tomorrow.
- My orders, come directly from Berlin.
- We are to abandon Milan?
General Clark's troops are across the Po.
The partisans are coming down from the mountains to fight.
We must move north.
But...
Not to Merano.
We'll go here, to Valtellina.
On the Alps, I'll continue the fight.
- Alone?
- Thousands of men will follow me!
Valtellina is a perfect strategic position.
- Excellency.
- Yes, Captain.
My orders are to instruct you that the movements of your soldiers must be strictly co-ordinated by the Reich authorities.
You and your government must transfer to Merano, immediately.
Under your protection?
No!
The Führer needs an ally, not a prisoner.
There are more than 100.000 men ready to combat for victory.
They are bringing the ashes of Dante Alighieri from Ravenna.
Dante!
The father of the Italian language.
I'll report your intentions to Berlin, but, for the moment, our objective must be Merano.
You must not leave Milan till we are ready to move.
- Excellency.
- What?
You must give me your word of honour.
You have my word.
- How many men can you spare?
- A dozen.
I'll be back by tomorrow.
Meanwhile, don't let him out of your sight for a second.
- What if he tries to escape?
- The orders are explicit.
He's to be shot, no hesitation.
The general strike has begun.
An armed insurrection will follow.
But General Clark prohibited any attempt at insurrection.
For the salvation of our lands, our homes, our factories demonstrate in the streets under the tricolour banner of the NLC!
Give the Germans the choice they got in Genoa and Turin,
"Surrender or die"!
Viva the general strike!
Viva the national insurrection!
Milan, April 25, 1945.
Our meditation is imperative, or blood will run in every gutter in Milan.
The fascists have been given four hours to surrender to the partisans.
After six o'clock, it'll be "shoot on sight".
What do you know of Mussolini's real intentions?
There's some wild talk about a stronghold in the Alps, a last stand but Cella assured me that Mussolini has no intentions of fighting.
What makes Cella so sure?
Mussolini sold him the buildings and the presses of "Popolo d'Italia" for 109 million lire.
He had the money transferred to a Swiss bank account.
Hardly the gesture of a man planning his last battle.
Claretta Petacci, his mistress, is here in Milan.
He's probably thinking of getting himself to safety and taking her.
Will he appear at the meeting, this afternoon?
Mussolini is unpredictable, but everything points to his coming.
Excellency.
I greatly appreciate your coming here.
I only pray our meeting may prevent further sorrow and destruction.
You are now the one man capable of saving Northern Italy from complete chaos and disaster.
It'll take all your courage.
The journey to Saint Helena is long and lonely.
And dangerous.
Remember that Napoleon was on the deck of a British warship.
Much safer than a salon in the Curia of Milan.
This is the history of the life of Saint Benedict.
I wrote it many years ago.
There's a situation in here very much like our own.
Totila, the king of the goths, is received by the Saint in the monastery at Monte Cassino.
Monte Cassino?
Monte Cassino has been destroyed by the new barbarians the Americans, the British and the Polish have reduced it to rubble.
Not even a saint could live there, now.
May I ask how you intend to save Milan from a similar destruction?
From that useless slaughter you were unable to spare the rest of Italy?
- Meaning?
- A drink?
No, no.
Do you plan to accept the capitulation which will be offered to you today?
Well, my plan is simple.
First, I'll disband the army and the Republican National Guard.
Then I'll withdraw to the mountains with thousands of fascist loyalists.
- You mean to continue the war?
- A symbolic gesture.
An empty gesture.
The men ready to follow you will only be a few hundred.
Don't fool yourself.
More, more.
Many more.
So, General Cadorna, what do you propose?
Since these are political, and not military negotiations
I shall let the delegate from the National Liberation Committee.
Counsellor Marazza, speak.
I have been charged by the Committee to ask for your unconditional surrender.
I came to this meeting because I was promised guarantees for fascists and their families.
We'll find an agreement about these matters.
- What the people demand...
- The people!
I've devoted my life to serve the people!
I've always fought against the king and the traitors who wanted to disrupt my revolution!
Gentlemen, please excuse me.
In these days
I've enacted a decree with which I intend to give all my power to the people.
The decree provides for the nationalization of factories and the transfer of my powers to the Socialist Party.
This is my commitment.
I still haven't received an answer to this proposal.
I am now waiting.
Mister Mussolini, your proposal is pointless.
You give away things, that don't belong to you anymore.
You have destroyed the parliament, the unions, the political parties.
You've deceived the people with promises of colonies, empires, and victorious wars.
And now, in the midst of this catastrophe you want to pass yourself off as a socialist!
You have no other choice than unconditional surrender.
As for your personal safety the new Prefect of Milan Riccardo Lombardi will be responsible.
What about the safety of my followers?
We intend to accord the fascist troops treatment reserved for prisoners of war.
But not the criminals of war.
They'll be judged by the appropriate military tribunals.
Criminals!
And who is to decide?
Who is to judge?
We could never trust you!
Duce, we can't sign a surrender behind the Germans' backs.
Our loyalty to our ally is our highest claim to honour!
Graziani, I understand what you're trying to say.
- But we still have the duty to negotiate.
- We have to work out an understanding.
The Germans are not as scrupulous as you over honour.
General Wolff has negotiated the surrender of their detachments in Italy.
Negotiations... it's just talk...
a delaying tactic.
It seems they did not feel the need to inform you.
Of course, we knew or guessed, but there have been further developments.
- What do you mean?
- Prefect Bassi knows all the details.
Well... it's true.
I've learned that the Germans have completed the negotiations for the surrender of all their troops in Italy to the Anglo-Americans.
General Wolff is expected here at the Palace any minute to sign the agreement.
- How did you find that out?
- From Don Bicchierai.
He handled the negotiations with the Germans.
Now that the secret is out, I can confirm it.
But... what are the conditions?
The Germans will be considered prisoners of war in accordance with international conventions.
In exchange, they will pledge not to destroy our factories not to take hostages and to disarm the fascist militia.
I can't believe this.
I can't believe that you would use the Germans against our own people!
Not our people!
Your people, your bandits!
The Germans have always treated us as servants, and now they betray us!
They're just betraying the fascists and you!
I will deal with them!
Duce, we must try to talk to the Germans.
Let it be clear that from this moment
I am resuming full liberty of action with the Germans.
Me!
I'll return in an hour.
Excuse me, your Eminence.
I will speak with the Germans, and I assure you, there will be an agreement.
I hope so.
It's the only way to keep Milan from turning into a battleground.
There's been enough blood and destruction.
Italians!
This material is magnificent!
Wonderful!
All of Italy must see it, they must see it!
Stand at attention!
- Salute the Duce!
- Heil!
I have sent a letter to Hitler informing him, as of June 10th Italy will enter the war and fight by Germany's side.
Your Excellency has received my report so you must be aware of our military unreadiness.
- We need more time.
- In 3 or 4 months the war will be over.
We must forget about the military problem and concentrate on our political advantages.
But, Excellency...
When the war is over we have to be on the winning side and have our share of rewards and glory.
In order to do this, I must have a few thousand Italian dead.
Only then will I be able to sit at the negotiating table and have real negotiating power.
Do you understand?
Your General Wolff has betrayed us!
Pavolini, what's happening?
Why aren't you giving orders?
- I have to know first what order to give.
- How many black shirts can you get?
- At least thirty thousand, Duce.
- We can't keep on repeating these lies!
Where are these men?
Nowhere, they're nowhere!
Our men are pouring into Milan from all over Lombardy!
- Lies!
- Tomorrow at 8, in Como.
In Valtellina, not Como!
In Valtellina!
There's nothing there!
No food, no guns, nothing!
They're all strategists, now!
Liars!
We haven't even got enough gasoline to get us there!
What, you want to give up?
To surrender to the partisans?
We must die fighting!
No agreements, neither with Germans nor partisans!
Alright, but where is the artillery?
We have to leave Milan.
We'll go to Como.
There, we'll decide whether to go to Germany or die on the Alps with the ashes of Dante.
Duce, don't leave.
It's safer for you to stay in Milan.
- For how long?
- Till the Americans arrive.
Ah, the Americans...
No, no, no.
The truth is that I hate the Americans and the British more than the partisans!
What can the partisans do to me?
Shoot me?
No.
I will not be turned into a trophy for the Tower of London.
Nor exhibited in New York's Madison Square Gardens.
- Have you seen the lady?
- Mrs Petacci is waiting in the courtyard.
- What did she say?
- She asked no questions.
She simply told me to tell you that she is ready to follow you anywhere.
Thank you.
Let him go, you cannot be any help to him now.
- You would only be in the way.
- You don't understand.
He needs me.
He's always needed me.
You, and hundred others.
I know, but I'm the one he sent for.
I want to be near him now.
I can't leave him when he's in danger.
They'll hunt him down like an animal and when they get you, they'll kill you both!
What about Switzerland?
This Swiss frontier isn't far from here.
The Germans won't even let him see the frontier.
Look at him.
I'm sure that he'll win in the end he's brave and clever.
He has a plan, you know?
Listen, Marcello.
He's already sent Churcill a letter, a magnificent letter.
There's nothing cowardly or defeatist about it.
It's a plan to defeat communism, not just in Italy, but all over the world.
Churchill will listen to him.
He must listen to him.
Oh, Marcello, you know.
How many times they've written him off?
He always pulled through.
He'll win through again.
We must trust him.
I'm sure he will overcome all obstacles.
Heil Duce!
Heil!
He had promised me he'd never see that woman again!
Why do you worry?
She's his daughter.
As least that's what everybody says in Milan.
Daughter or not, she's a whore to me!
Claretta, do you still want to follow him?
Yes, absolutely.
Anywhere.
Mister Sereni, you must listen to your Cardinal.
You must promise me that there'll be no armed insurrection.
You are not my Cardinal and it's impossible to stop it now.
- The insurrection has already begun.
- Mister Valiani, you persuade him.
- What's the use of fighting?
- If the fascists surrender there'll be no fighting.
- What about you, Mister Lombardi?
- Everything will be done legally.
Criminals of war will be court-martialled.
If Mussolini surrenders, his life must be spared.
- Sure, we've given our word.
- He's already been sentenced to death.
The sentence must be carried out.
It's almost 8.
He said he'd have an answer for us in an hour.
Let's see what he's decided to do.
Prefect Bassi here.
This is Cardinal Schuster.
I'm speaking from the Archbishop's Palace.
We're waiting for Mussolini's answer, here.
The Duce has left.
There is no answer.
- Mussolini has left Milan.
- He ran away!
Therefore we've no reason to honour the promise to spare his life.
Now, anyone who arrests him can execute him immediately and legally.
The Americans insist he be turned over to them.
I'm sorry Eminence, but if we get him first all they'll get is a corpse.
Eminence.
Eminence.
What's the situation here in Como?
The city is calm but there are strong groups of partisans up in the mountains.
If they attach, there's nothing we can do.
- Duce, it could happen any minute!
- I don't understand.
I was told that all the partisans in the area had been eliminated.
You choose to ignore the truth!
- If I ignore, the fault is your own!
- You wanted to believe Pavolini!
The only thing he ever accomplished was burn the house of the partisans and frighten the population!
How many fascists are coming to Como?
Thousands, but they're not soldiers, they're just misfits.
Last night, a group of twelve partisans disarmed over 200 black shirts without firing a single shot.
What's the situation on the Swiss border?
The pass at Chiasso is heavily guarded by Germans.
Pizzamiglio is very difficult to reach.
Our only chance could be to reach the border from Menaggio.
There are no Germans at the Porlezza pass, just fascists.
Maybe...
Maybe we can make arrangements with the Swiss for the safe passage of the entire Government.
Buffarini, you tell everyone off our new plans.
Thank you.
- Prefect.
- Duce.
Are you in contact with the American consul in Lugano?
Yes, it was in the matter of some passports.
Alright I don't care now.
Are you in contact with him?
Yes, Excellency.
Call him.
Tell him I want to hand myself over to them.
Yes, Excellency.
No, I'm trying to run away and I'm not trying to save myself.
I just want to meet the Americans on neutral grounds so we can bargain on equal terms.
I am far from finished!
Italy and I still have a marvellous, great future together!
I must get to Switzerland first and the Swiss cannot refuse me an entry permit!
I only hope it's not too late.
Your departure from Milan did nothing but worsen the situation.
Soon, Milan will be in the hands of the partisans.
- I ask you to help me!
- I'll call the Swiss authorities.
- Excellency.
- What is it?
Your wife.
Hello?
Yes.
You got my message?
No, no, no.
Rachele...
The most important thing is that you save yourself and the children.
You have to pass the border along with them.
That's the most important thing!
Rachele, listen to me.
Of course!
Yes.
I took my decision.
I'll follow my destiny.
You're the only woman that I have ever loved.
Goodbye, Rachele.
- Where was she calling from?
- The Villa Montero.
- Is that far from here?
- About a kilometre.
Tell Mrs Petacci to stay in the hotel.
Alright.
Thank you.
Wake up!
Wake up!
Lieutenant, wake up!
Mussolini is leaving!
Duce, you can't leave without my escort!
I go where I want, when I want!
Get out of my way!
You can't leave without my escort!
You heard what she said!
The Duce can do what he pleases.
In the absence of Captain Kerneg
I am responsible, directly to the Führer, for the Duce's personal safety.
You weren't concerned with my safety when General Wolff surrendered.
I'm not under General Wolff's orders!
Our orders are direct from Berlin, and I am personally responsible.
I'm not concerned with your problems!
Not at all.
Attention!
The fascists can't leave without us!
Ready to move!
If necessary, shoot!
Bassi!
- Let the Germans follow us.
- Alright.
Let's go!
Hurry up!
Quickly!
Jackson, set up the radio and get in touch with Lugano.
You go down to Como.
You know where to find Burrows.
I'll get in contact with you as soon as possible.
We have to get Mussolini before the Germans, the Italians and even before those bloody English!
We have to get him first.
Ok boys, when you're all in uniform, let's get some rest.
It's gonna be a tough day!
Sorry, Marshall, but you can't go in.
Can't go in?
What do you mean I can't go in?
- We must talk with the Duce!
- The Duce is asleep.
He said you're to avoid gatherings, you are to withdraw to Cadenabbia.
Why didn't he wait for Pavolini and his black shirts?
We don't even know what we are supposed to do!
- We need precise orders.
- You'll get your orders at noon.
Meanwhile, clear the square and go back to Cadenabbia.
I'll go to Cadenabbia and I'll stay there!
But can't you understand this whole thing is a farce?
Mussolini is planning to escape to Switzerland and leaving us here to fend for ourselves!
Let him run!
I'm going to do my duty as a soldier!
We know where you're going!
You're going to give yourself up!
Never!
Now I know why we're here.
We're guests at a honeymoon party.
A perfect moment for a honeymoon.
Barracu, Mrs Petacci would like to know if she can see him.
Yes, his Excellency left instructions to admit her.
Duce, I have brought the last loyal men to die with you!
Fine.
There are thousands of black shirts gathered in Como ready to fight with their usual bravery.
Any news of Commander Borghese and the others?
Commander Borghese disbanded his troops and did himself waiting to give himself to the Americans.
Even Graziani is talking about "surrendering with honour".
With honour!
Honour!
My generals become concerned with honour only when it's time to surrender!
Anyway,
Pavolini, I'm proud of the courage that your black shorts have shown.
Thank you, Excellency.
Colonel.
- We're leaving!
- When?
- Now.
- With Pavolini?
No, by ourselves.
- Should I tell Mrs Petacci?
- Yes.
Tell her that this time she comes in the car with me.
May I ask where you are going?
If you want to know, follow me.
Gunter!
Get a move on!
Hurry up!
What is he doing, now?
Let's follow him!
Come on!
Come on!
- Where are we going?
- The Grandola pass.
What about the Germans?
A few minutes' advantage will be enough to get rid of them.
There are 500 black shirts waiting in Grandola.
They will escort us across the border into Switzerland.
How are you feeling?
Better.
I slept for a few hours.
Step on it!
Come on!
Faster, damm it!
The Duce!
- Where is everyone?
- They've all run off.
- Where's the path for the Swiss border?
- It starts out here.
Go with the Duce!
This path is too narrow for a car!
The Swiss authorities closed the pass.
Eminence, I need permission for two people.
Myself and someone very close to me.
That way, we can slip across the Swiss border at night.
I just need permission from the Swiss, it shouldn't be difficult.
They've just told me that they denied permission.
- To your wife and kids too.
- They what?
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
Alright, I see.
Too bad.
I wanted to avoid bloodshed, but now I have to wait for Pavolini's men and try to resist until the Americans arrive.
But I want you to remember one thing, Eminence, if you don't help me, the blood will be on your hands!
This is the man who once thought he was a new Caesar.
A people's leader, a God.
How will he be remembered?
As the man who made trains arrive on time.
We'll wait for the Americans.
Relax boys, it's Burrows.
- Captain.
- Burrows.
This man is an agent of the fascist secret service.
Hi.
- A cigarette?
- Thank you.
The fascist convoy which has stopped in Como wants to negotiate surrender.
Their leaders have asked me to act as a go-between.
That's impossible.
The fascists are still at war with the United States.
Their surrender must be unconditional.
The fascists intend to accept the unconditional surrender but what happens once they do?
Their life will be spared.
- What about Mussolini?
- We already discussed this.
If Mussolini turns himself over to us, he'll have nothing to worry about.
- Chocolate?
- Thanks, very kind of you.
I'm here to arrest him and fly him to Allied headquarters.
The fascists want to know if he'll be put on trial.
Well, I think... that's inevitable.
In the future, you're going to need friends in Italy in the fight against communism.
You'd be wiser not to execute him.
Alive, Mussolini will influence public opinion in favour of the Americans.
Where is it?
It was here.
Oh, here it is.
Listen to this letter.
This is a letter you wrote to me when I was in the hospital.
When I was sick, remember?
I was very unhappy then, and you said,
"My darling, now you must want to live more than ever.
Use your willpower. "
Very typical of you.
"It is only a matter of one courageous step at a time and you have already taken the first one.
We will be together again soon,
Your room is waiting for you in Palazzo Venezia.
And I'm waiting for you too.
With love and admiration
your Ben. "
That was a very important letter for me at the time, and it still is.
Thank you.
You know, I wrote a letter to you once but you never received it.
I remember that at the end of it, I said,
"Snakes must be killed before they bite. "
What's happening?
The snakes are leaving.
I see, and there's a whore running along with them.
I saw her leaving with you in Milan.
You had promised me you'd never see her again!
But here she is... running away!
- That bitch!
- She's not a bitch.
I think I should have left you in Milan!
Then why did you send the Colonel to find me?
I wanted to share my destiny.
Doesn't that prove that I love you?
Your destiny?
How can I share anything with you when I'm not even allowed to be seen in public with you!
- You're ashamed of me, aren't you?
- No.
- You're ashamed of me, I know!
- I'm not ashamed of you!
I know you are!
I am not ashamed of you.
Listen to me, Ben.
All I've ever wanted is to be near to you and help you.
That's all I've ever wanted, believe me!
You want to help me?
This is the letter I wrote to Churchill.
I made the mistake of telling you, and what did you do?
You told your brother!
Yes, you told your brother a state secret!
Now everyone knows!
The Germans, too.
Now, nobody's willing to pass the border and deliver it.
And you sit there and tell me that you want to help me?
Look.
Look at this.
- What is it?
- It's so beautiful and peaceful.
That's where we should be going, to Austria.
- No one would ever find us, there.
- What are you talking about?
It's our nest!
I've arranged it all.
Only a couple of mountain people live there.
They think that the emperor is still on the throne!
It's the perfect hideout!
- A hideout?
- Yes.
No.
Claretta, you don't understand.
I still want to fight.
And I will.
Soon I will find a way of contacting Mr Churchill.
- Don't worry.
- But...
No, don't worry about the letter.
I will find a way.
Churchill will have to understand.
He stood by me in the beginning and he has to stand by me now.
Mussolini is inside.
- How are you?
- Fine.
You had given me your word that you wouldn't have left Milan!
I know.
But the situation in Milan suddenly changed.
It was a decision of my ministers.
We have to go back to the valley immediately.
No.
I have decided to stay here, Captain.
Besides, the roads aren't safe.
We got through.
They're open.
If you want me to go, you'll have to use force.
Excellency, allow me to point out that these barracks could turn into a trap for us.
They're isolated, with no defence.
If the partisans attack, we're finished.
I'm staying here!
- What about the lady?
- She's staying too.
Duce.
The mountains are full of partisans!
They will hunt you down.
The partisans mean business!
You choose:
Either you die like an animal, or you come with me.
Everything went well.
The Americans were extremely understanding.
They sent twelve agents from Switzerland to get Mussolini.
Over the border, an American mission will take care of him.
What are they going to do wit Mussolini?
He will be treated as an honoured prisoner of the United States Army.
But who guarantees the Americans will respect the agreement once they've got Mussolini?
That man will act as guarantor.
He's an Italian officer from the south.
He belongs to the secret service of the Rome Government.
I have already made contact with the Como Liberation Committee.
I have their authorization to arrest Mussolini.
As soon as he is in our hands we will invoke the clause of the Armistice which obliges us to turn him over to the allies.
U.S. Captain Jack Donati will fly him to Siena to the Allied headquarters.
Yes, but how?
We're cut off.
The partisans are blocking all the roads.
Now that the Captain's with us, we'll have no trouble.
I have both Italian and American passes but we have to get Mussolini as soon as possible!
What are we waiting, then?
Let's go!
Who's your commander?
We're from the Government of Rome!
My name is Giovanni, I am the chief of this brigade.
We all have passes.
We have to get to Menaggio as soon as possible.
- Hey!
This is Commander Della Muti!
I know him, it's him!
Stop, for God's sake!
Let us explain!
Let's kill them!
Stop!
Let us explain!
- There's a reason we're here!
- You're making a mistake!
Alright!
Let's hear what they have to say!
Shut up!
We're on our way to negotiate the surrender of the fascist troops according to the rules of war!
So now they invoke the laws of war!
The fascists are not surrendering, they're running away!
It's too late to change sides!
You, come with me to the brigade HQ!
Come on!
Calm down!
Let's wait until they're back!
Come on, tell him.
Listen!
- We worked things out.
- So, can we go on?
- Will they let us go?
- Don't worry, we'll leave soon.
They got through to Como, the situation was cleared up.
- Can we go to Menaggio, now?
- No, we have to go to Como, first...
So... so, let's go.
Not him!
Not Commander Della Muti!
He's a murderer!
A butcher!
The blood is still on his hands!
This is a mistake!
We're a delegation!
Let's go, let's go!
Where are you going?
Don't leave me alone!
You cowards!
Leave me be!
Let me go with them!
Attention!
Republican National Guard present!
What does this mean?
Where are the black shirts?
- They're here.
- How many are they?
- Twelve.
- Twelve what?
Twelve children?
200 Germans have arrived.
An entire anti aircraft unit with heavy machine guns.
We could join them.
From my own people, I get twelve children.
From the Germans, I get hundreds of men.
Alright.
I go with them.
Article 5.
All members and hierarchy of the fascist government who contributed to the suppression of constitutional rights destroying individual freedom, imposing the fascist regime comprising and betraying future of the country leading it towards the present catastrophe will be sentenced to death.
Don't shoot!
I am in command of the 52nd Garibaldi Partisan Brigade.
Lieutenant Fallmeyer.
We do not intend to fight we just want to pass.
You are in our machine gun line of fire.
- You wouldn't get far.
- I have orders to get back to Germany.
And I have orders not to let a single armed German beyond this point.
We have to request authorization from our HQ.
Otherwise, we can't let you pass.
This is impossible.
I have precise orders.
Since you received your orders, everything has changed.
I repeat, you can't pass beyond this point.
Hold on a moment.
- There's a long convoy, back there.
- 30 trucks and at least 300 men.
They won't attack.
It wouldn't be worth it.
They don't know there are only ten of us.
We should gather the entire brigade here.
Then we should block the roads and tell the workers at Falk to get ready.
Alright.
Let's do it.
While I take the Lieutenant to our headquarters you go ahead and tell everyone to join us.
Tell them to stay in the bushes, so they will think there are many of us.
And to wear red scarves.
Red is a scary colour, you know?
You, run to the Passo Bridge and mine it.
But Pietro, we ran out of explosives.
Then go to the bridge and pretend to place some explosive charges under it.
- Be careful, Duce.
- I can't stay in a cage all day.
- Have you seen them on the lake?
- No, also in the mountains.
Why are we waiting here so long?
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe it was a mistake to trust the Germans.
- What did you say?
- I said that...
Maybe it was a mistake to trust the Germans.
No.
Hitler has given special orders to defend me, and of course you're under my personal protection.
Listen, Ben.
Whatever happens, don't think about me.
Think about yourself.
Don't worry about me.
You must save yourself.
That's all I care about.
In Milan, I promised to take you along with me.
It was a precise promise.
They will let us pass but we'll have to hand over all the fascists in the convoy.
You can't accept these conditions.
It would be a betrayal!
I'm only concerned about the safety of my men, is that clear?
Can we trust them?
All the Germans who have surrender were allowed to pass the border.
But we have special orders to get to Merano.
I signed the conditions on behalf of my men.
My orders come from the Führer!
If your orders require you to stay with the Duce, stay and fight.
I am just responsible for the safety of my men.
The area we passed through was swarming with partisans and the bridges are mined.
I am just responsible for my men.
Let's go!
- How do we tell this to Mussolini?
- God only knows!
The Germans are going!
They're leaving us in the hands of the partisans!
The Germans are going!
They've been authorized to pass the border!
- Calm down.
What happened?
- This is the end.
The Germans are going to leave us in the hands of these bandits!
But it would be betrayal!
Who said that?
We're moving out.
Get the engines started.
We're moving out!
Only the Germans will pass through!
Throw out the Italians if necessary use your guns!
Do you hear me?
Get ready!
Lieutenant.
I have an idea that might work.
I'm afraid it's too late.
I have given my word.
Listen, we could have Mussolini putting on a German uniform, and hide him on board with the soldiers.
The partisans wouldn't notice him.
Lieutenant!
This is a Führer's personal wish.
Don't forget it.
Alright.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
- Tell me something!
What's going on?
- Calm down.
I don't understand!
- We're all going to get killed!
- Please, calm down!
If the partisans find out the Duce is with us, it'll be the end.
- They're going to kill us!
- Calm down, please.
- Calm down, Mrs Petacci.
- We're all going to die.
Excellency?
I suggest you put on a German overcoat and helmet and hide in one of the trucks.
It's your only chance to get through.
There's no time.
Fallmeyer's convoy is preparing to move immediately.
Excellency.
Go with the Germans.
Save yourself.
Please don't worry about me.
You must save yourself.
Captain.
I ask you a personal favour.
Let the lady come with me.
It's impossible, only you.
Move this block!
Duce!
Are we going to surrender without even an attempt to fight?
- It would be useless.
- It's true then, you're deserting us!
How dare you say I'm deserting you!
You who promised me thousands of black shirts!
I ordered you to destroy the partisans and what did you do?
Nothing!
Excellency!
Let's go!
Duce, it's true that we didn't defeat the partisans but since you were in Milan, you had just one thought in your mind.
To pass the border!
And now you're leaving alone, and dressed as a German!
Let him sit.
- Traitors!
- Cowards!
Traitors!
Let me in!
Let me go with him!
Don't leave me here!
I beg you!
Help me!
Let me in!
I want to go with him!
I don't want to leave him!
I can't leave him!
Don't you understand?
Help me to get in!
I want to go with him!
Get out!
We'll stay here to take care of the fascists.
Check all the trucks when they get to Dongo.
Go!
If it wasn't for you, Duce.
Hitler would never have become Führer.
No one can wear a uniform like our Duce!
- He looks like a God.
- He is God!
Throw down you guns and form a group!
You must guarantee we'll be treated according to the International Convention.
Drop that gun!
Group up against the wall!
ONLY GOD CAN BEND THE WILL OF FASCISTS, NEVER MEN OR THINGS
- Where's Pedro?
- I don't know.
- Do you know where Pedro is?
- No.
- What about Bili?
- He was here.
He's drunk!
Hey, camerata, wake up.
Excellency, wake up.
Benito Mussolini, come on, wake up.
Benito Mussolini, I arrest you in the name of the Italian people.
As long as you are under our protection, you won't be harmed.
No question, the partisans are about to attack!
General Wolff has probably signed the surrender by now.
We rejected the partisan's ultimatum.
Lieutenant, we have nothing to do with this.
Deal with it, we didn't invite you here!
Where did you expect us to go?
Hold your fire!
The German commander has accepted your surrender!
Hold your fire!
What are you shooting for?
Marshall, you must do something before it's too late!
- What's going on outside?
- The Americans have arrived!
- Give yourselves up!
- Not until I have orders from Milan!
Call Milan, then!
It's useless to keep fighting!
The Germans have already surrendered.
Don't move!
Let me speak!
I'm Marshall Graziani, Commander of the fascist Army.
I'm Captain Jack Donati.
From now on, you're under US army protection.
- Where is Mussolini?
- I don't know.
I lost contact with him two days ago.
Our last information had him travelling north with a German convoy.
- Others say the partisans have him.
- May I ask what you intend to do to guarantee my personal safety?
I'm taking you to Milan.
I must talk to General Cadorna.
He's the only one who can tell me where Mussolini is.
- I hoped you would be able to.
- All I know is that he abandoned us!
Cold?
Don't you want to keep it as a souvenir?
What are you thinking?
I was thinking about two years ago, when the King dissolved my government.
All I wanted was to retire from politics and to live the rest of my life in peace.
It would have been better for everyone.
Do you have orders to shoot me?
- At least tell me where we're going.
- To Germasino.
It's a village in the mountains.
No one will think of looking for you there.
What will you do to my fascists?
Will they be treated according to the Geneva Convention?
- We are prisoners of war...
- You committed all sorts of atrocities!
Even worse than the Germans!
Those weren't my orders.
The Duce was always against violence.
What about the Civil War?
The fascists killing women and children?
The sackings, the burnt villages, the slaughters, the tortures and the killing of prisoners?
Where was the Geneva Convention them?
That was Hitler's fault.
Was anything ever your fault?
It's freezing, here.
Any chance of getting the stove working?
I've set up the guard.
I'm going down to Dongo, watch them carefully.
Alright, we'll take shifts.
Is there anything you need?
Yes.
Please, do me a favour.
Find the lady and tell her that I'm still alive.
Mrs Petaccia?
Alright.
I wrote him my first love letter when I was twelve years old.
It's absurd isn't it?
I was just a little girl.
When I was fourteen I invited him to my birthday party and I made the whole family wait for him because I was so sure he would come!
Even then, I always thought of him as a perfect man.
He was my ideal of a real man, because he is a real man, you know!
When I met him, I felt that I belonged to him.
I was just 18, then.
Please, do me a favour.
I beg you.
You can do anything you want with me, I can do any kind of job even the most menial, I don't care.
But please, don't harm him.
He's a weak man, now.
He's a sick, broken, weak man.
Please don't hurt him, I beg you!
Nothing's going to happen to him, unless someone tries to free him.
Nobody will try to save him.
If you had been with him the last few days you'd have seen how everyone abandoned him.
They all ran away.
He ran away too, dressed as a German soldier.
He has deserted his own men to save his own life, hasn't he?
Anyway, for the moment, he's in no danger.
- Please, I want to ask you a favour.
- I'll do what I can.
Let me be with him.
What harm can there be?
Please, let me be with him.
Look, if something were to happen to him it would happen to you too.
You're going to shoot him?
We want him transferred to Milan, to be tried by a popular jury.
If you give him to the Americans, he'll be treated as a prisoner of war!
It's got nothing to do with them!
He will be judged by the Italian people.
- Then why did you hide him?
- To protect him!
From the crowd, from a lynching.
A lynching?
What do you mean?
Today, he's the most hated man in Italy.
He's responsible for all the atrocities that the Germans and fascists committed!
A lot of people around here have lost relatives, killed because of him.
Killed by the fascists!
Women and children too!
That was the war, it wasn't his fault.
It's not fair!
Fascism did a lot of good for Italy, before the war!
It brought us to ruin!
Look.
This is fascism.
Do you know what these are?
Wedding rings offered by the Italian women.
"Give your gold to your country", they said!
Do you know where we found them?
In the cars of the fascists who were running away!
Too many women in Italy are crying for their men!
Husbands and sons tortured, deported, murdered!
Cigarette?
Thank you.
You're very kind.
You must promise me one thing.
If he's going to be shot, I want to be shot with him.
I have no authority to make you such a promise.
Please.
I must be with him.
I can't let him die alone.
I must be with him!
Please, he's all I got.
And I'm all he's got.
Now that everyone else has left him
I want to be with him.
Let me stay with him.
Please!
I beg you!
Latest word had him arrested at Dongo.
Now, it seems that the partisans have hidden him in a secret resort.
- They'll tell us where he is.
- Question is, who will go and get him?
And what to do with him when we have him in our hands?
- Mattei, what do you say?
- It's simple.
The Liberation Committee resolution is very clear.
"Fascist leaders who have betrayed Italy, have been sentenced to death".
They only have to be identified and then brought in front of a firing squad.
Pietro, do you want to go with your men?
I'll provide the men.
But personally would rather stay here.
Why?
Why?
There are still 20,000 armed Germans in Milan.
Until they've surrounded their weapons, that's my first duty.
They're locked in the barracks but my men are the only ones watching them.
It's better that I stay here.
Do you want to go, Valerio?
Alright.
But I'll need vehicles, passes and an escort.
The Como area is still full of fascists.
You'll have to go to General Cadorna for everything.
The Americans have already reached Como.
Leave as soon as you can.
Do you understand what you have to do?
- I understand perfectly.
- Then go.
What will we tell the Americans?
They're bombarding us with messages demanding we hand Mussolini over to them.
We'll tell them that Mussolini has already been shot.
General Cadorna?
This is Colonel Sardagna from Como.
Yes, I have just received your order, but I am not sure I understand.
The Liberation Committee is about to send one of their people to get Mussolini.
For a number of reasons, it'd be better if you transfer him before they get there.
We have to avoid shooting in case of an escape attempt.
Right now, Mussolini is in a Germasino, just above Dongo.
I'll send an escort to take him from Dongo to Como where I shall personally take charge of him.
Once he's in Como, I'll arrange to have him taken to the Bresso airport.
If the Anglo-Americans ask us to hand him over we'll have to take him to the Allied headquarters.
I've been asked if it is possible to save Claretta Petacci along with Mussolini.
You're free to do what you like about that.
I see.
In 1940, everybody asked me,
"Mussolini, why don't you enter the war?"
"Otherwise, Hitler will grab it all!"
I didn't want to go to war, but today, they all say,
"Find Mussolini!
Get him!
Kill Mussolini!"
So, you believe the people asked for the war?
And today, they put the blame on you!
You know what?
The people can't decide for themselves.
They just have to obey.
- Now you're sincere!
- Hitler is crazy.
His biggest mistake was declaring war on Russia.
- I tried to stop him.
- Lf he's crazy, why did you follow him?
Why didn't you turn your back on him?
I always tried to stop him.
He wouldn't listen.
But you were his teacher!
Who was his role model?
You!
Who started to persecute the opposition and the workers unions?
Who abolished the free press and the parliament?
You!
Who sent Italian men to fight in Abyssinia and Spain?
Who sent them to fight in Greece, or to freeze in Russia?
Not Hitler!
You!
Excellency, would you write a couple of lines for us?
About what?
A declaration to the effect that it was our brigade who arrested you.
What do you want me to write?
The 52nd Garibaldi Brigade...
"The 52nd
Garibaldi Brigade"
Captured me today...
"Captured me today"
April 27th...
"April 27th"
In the town square in Dongo.
"In the town square in Dongo".
Excellency, write about the kind of treatment you received.
"The treatment I've received during and after
capture has been correct".
The Committee has decided to execute Mussolini.
My mission is to go to Dongo and shoot him.
The Americans are near Como and they're asking us to turn him over to them, alive.
They have the right on the basis of Article 29 of the Malta armistice.
But that armistice was signed two years ago by Badoglio.
- We're not bound by it.
- Yes, we are.
Badoglio's signature bound all Italians.
Please.
Sure.
Fact is, in the last two years, many things have changed.
Mussolini's been sentenced to death many times by the people by the resistance, by those partisans with whom you have fought with, here in the North.
He's responsible for the massacres committed by the fascists.
- We must execute him.
- Why come to me?
General, I need vehicles and an escort.
And Italian and American passes to enter the liberated areas.
So?
What do I tell the Committee?
- In two hours you'll have what you need.
- Good.
That's good.
No, it's better not to show this.
This is good.
With England still fighting Hitler's attack on Russia means we're finished.
But Germany is invincible.
You have to remember that Russia has three great generals.
General Snow, General Mud and General Distance.
No one's ever beaten them.
Camerati!
With allies like these, we can conquer the world.
I want to march by Hitler's side into Russia.
The alliance between Germans and Italians will destroy bolshevism throughout the world.
Long live fascism!
Victory will be ours!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
Duce!
We've received orders to leave.
What's that?
We're going to bandage your head and say you're wounded.
We have to cover about fifty kms and there are dozens of road blocks.
- I'm not going to wear this.
- Why?
Because it's German.
And I hate the Germans.
It's cold tonight.
Here.
Put this on.
Excellency.
- Are you wounded?
- No, it's nothing.
It's just a precaution.
- Claretta.
- What?
Why did you want to come with me?
It could be dangerous.
- I know, but that's the way I want it.
- You sure?
Yes.
Then I thank you.
Please, madam, let's go.
Good thing I met you.
We soldiers, understand each other.
- I hope Milan it's not far.
- No, we're almost there.
Quick, in my car!
On the way from Como to Milan.
They shot at us at least four times.
- Yesterday, they even shot at me.
- Chaos reigns, here.
They're hunting the fascists like madmen!
Snipers are everywhere.
We must stop them!
- Please.
- Attention!
At ease.
This is the end of a civil war, captain.
Sit down, please.
Excuse me, General, about those passes.
- I'm going to check if they're ready.
- Alright.
- Any news of Mussolini, General?
- Nothing accurate.
Remember that, according to the clauses of the armistice you are obliged to turn him over to us, alive.
We're moving carefully.
Wherever he is, Mussolini is in danger.
One mistake and he'll be in front of the firing squad.
After two years of occupation, people are angry.
They don't care about the armistice's articles.
But why do you want Mussolini so much?
A matter of prestige, I think.
Also, we believe that he might give us military and political information.
But he knew nothing.
Mussolini was just a puppet in the German's hands.
Captain, here's the passes.
These are the authorizations for the partisans to move in the free areas.
Fine.
A couple of hours of sleep and I'll be ready.
Goodbye, General.
Thanks for everything.
Goodbye, Captain.
And thank you.
General, I'm on my way to Dongo.
My escort is made up of twelve men from the Oltrepo Pavese Division.
Here's the passes.
Nervous?
Nervous?
No.
My men and I have already faced the fascists and the Germans before.
But this time I think we'll have to worry more about an attack from behind.
I'm talking about our British and American allies, you know?
Don't worry about them.
But, remember, no personal vendettas.
When we were in exile, in the resistance or in the fascist prisons most of us dreamt of getting Mussolini to execute him.
Now, it's different, because we've won.
It's not a question of personal vendetta anymore.
Goodbye.
"To General Archimede Mischi commander-in-chief of the Italian army.
I read your plans in the fight against partisan banditry.
I think it's vibrant and enthralling.
I'm sure that actions will follow your words.
We have to get rid of this hateful plague with fire and iron.
Signed, Mussolini".
We have to get rid of this hateful plague with fire and iron.
Signed, Mussolini.
We have to get rid of this hateful plague with fire and iron.
Signed, Mussolini.
- Where are we?
- Don't worry, I'll be back in a minute.
Did you hear?
These are cannon shots.
Yes, I hear.
I want to check out the situation before going any farther.
I know a guy who lives here.
I'll be right back.
We should have stayed in Germasino.
- The orders said to reach Como.
- I don't think it's safe.
The Americans must have reached Como.
They're the only ones with flares that strong.
- What do we do now?
- We'll carry on avoiding Como.
Where could we go, Neri?
I know a peasant family who lives here.
They'll take him in.
- Where?
- Not far, in a place called Giulino.
Let's go, then.
These are two prisoners.
Can you shelter them overnight?
Yes.
Alright, take them in.
Pietro, let's leave them here for the night, tomorrow we'll see.
Do you think we can trust these people?
If the room upstairs is free, they'll sleep there.
Would you like something to drink?
Thanks.
I'd like some coffee, if possible.
You, dear?
I don't have any real coffee, I can make you some substitute.
- That's fine, thank you.
- I'll get the room ready.
- You can come with us, if you want.
- For tonight it's all set, you can sleep.
We're going to Dongo to check the situation.
Alright.
Sandro, we'll be back tomorrow morning.
Don't let them out of your sight.
Please, would it be possible to have another pillow?
Of course!
If you need to use the bathroom.
I'll show you the way.
Maybe later, thank you.
Look, this door has to stay open.
We can't let you out of our sight.
Can I ask a favour of you?
Please.
Let us close the door.
The lady needs to rest.
Please, can I close it?
Thank you.
Are you sure that this pass is authentic?
I know Donati personally.
I was in contact with him in Switzerland.
That's his signature.
I want your co-operation.
- I have to transfer Mussolini to Milan.
- We're going to put him in the Como jail.
We'll handle this transfer ourselves.
I greatly appreciate your organization.
But let's say I prefer to handle this particular situation by myself.
This is an unwarranted interference by the Milan committee!
That's what you think!
I've got American authorization, signed by Captain Jack Donati.
That's just a pass to enter the free areas.
It's not a warrant for Mussolini!
Thousands of black shirts were forced to surrender by our committee!
Milan has no right to take credit for arresting Mussolini from Como!
It's not a question of Milan or Como!
It's something which has to be done!
I was sent here by the General Command of the Liberty corps in complete agreement with Alt Italia Committee of Liberation!
I have been given orders, and I'm going to carry them out, at all costs!
- Look, I've already told you...
- Gentlemen!
I have twelve armed men along with me with whom I've solved tougher problems than your stupid objections.
So, either you stop interfering with my mission or you'll find yourselves filling the jail cells you prepared for Mussolini.
No doubt about it, now.
We have proof they want to turn him over to the Americans.
They say we are trying to steal the glory of the arrest and they want to transfer him to Milan themselves.
Enough.
Mussolini has to be shot.
Valerio, I'm speaking on behalf of the Committee.
Either you kill him, or we kill you.
That's an order!
Alright.
I'm leaving for Dongo now.
You won't hear from me again till it's all over.
Come in.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Would you like something to eat?
Well, yes, if possible.
We're rather hungry.
- Do you have something warm?
- Yes, of course.
Oh, our salami is very good.
Would you like some wine, too?
No, no.
No wine.
Just water for me.
Thank you.
How are you feeling this morning?
A little better?
A little better, yes.
They're being nice with us.
I think that's a good sign, isn't it?
Why are the Americans taking so long?
- Who are those two in the car?
- Two patriots, I personally guarantee.
Good morning.
Get out of there immediately.
I don't want stripes in my way.
You have no right.
You will answer for this!
I'm accountable only to my command and no one else.
You don't know who we are.
You should stand to attention when you talk to us!
Why?
Who are you?
We represent the Free Government of Rome!
We're in charge of liaison with the Americans.
Wonderful.
Just what I needed!
If you don't get out of here immediately, I'll put a bullet in your skulls!
Come on, boys, it's late!
Get on the truck.
You two, get lost!
And have fun in Como!
- But, Colonel...
- Get in the car!
Keep going, we've got no time to lose!
Damn, we caused a stir!
What are you afraid of?
They're friends, aren't they?
We'll apologize on the way back!
Hey, stop!
Who are you?
I'm from HQ in Milan.
I need to speak with your commanding officer.
Listen, Mussolini isn't here.
They took him away.
What are you talking about?
They tried to transfer him last night, but failed.
Now they're hiding him in a farmhouse in the hills.
Who's the commanding officer here?
Valerio, the best thing to do is act as if you don't know anything.
I've already found out where he is.
Oh, here he is.
Pedro says that if you want to talk you'll have to go to him unarmed.
What?
Have you all gone mad?
Colonel let us speak first, please.
Come here, quick.
Let's try to follow the normal procedures.
Colonel Valerio, I want to talk to you alone.
Pedro, the political commander of the brigade will be here in a few minutes.
- Look, we've got to be there as well.
- Just a second!
Do you know these two guys from Como?
I would have saluted them, if I did.
They're boycotting our mission, acting like double-dealers.
What are we talking about?
You know who we are!
- Take them!
- Stop!
What are you doing!
I'm Sforni, secretary of the National Liberation Committee of Como!
- And this is Major De Angelis!
- I want to see your documents.
We were in a hurry, we didn't take them!
We'll verify your identity later, then.
- Arrest them!
- What are you doing?
This is a mistake!
Have you all gone mad?
Okay, let's go.
- Where are Mussolini and his men?
- Mussolini is hidden in a farmhouse.
The others are in Germasino.
Guido, Neri.
Come up here.
- What's up?
- The men from Milan have arrived.
- Damn, and you let them in?
- Pedro spoke to them.
- Who are these men?
- They're the escort.
Pietro!
We met him in Milan.
You can trust him.
Check his papers.
We assure you they're in order.
This is Pietro, the Political Commissioner of our brigade.
Sorry about all this but we still have difficulty in getting in touch with General Command.
We've just come out of clandestiny and we don't know each other.
We're even discovered some fascists dressed as partisans!
Anyway, your papers are in order.
What's your mission?
My orders are to shoot Mussolini and the others.
And I mean to do it now, within and hour.
I don't agree.
I intend to hand them over to the General Command to avoid any attempt at an execution without a trial.
But we must shoot them before they fall into the hands of the Americans!
Their troops are only a few kilometres from here!
I don't want the Americans to get them either.
- We'll take them to Milan together.
- I have precise orders!
And I mean to carry them out whether you like them or not!
To me, those orders are not just!
What, are you trying to save his neck?
The man's a criminal!
I agree.
He'll have to pay, and pay hard.
That's exactly what I'm proposing to do, make him pay!
What I object to, is an execution without a trial.
Mussolini and his accomplices have already been regularly condemned to death.
There's a Liberation Committee decree signed by all the antifascist parties.
Then, let's join forces and transfer him to Milan.
Impossible!
Can't you see that they're all out to get him?
The Americans, the British agents coming from south.
We saw them ourselves with our own eyes.
The cowardice and the doubts are starting to surface already.
The compromises, the filth that we wanted to wipe out once and for all!
Either we shoot him now, or he'll never pay.
The National Liberation Committee decreed that the sentence for acts of treason committed by hierarchs be pronounced by a war tribunal.
Commander Pedro.
We are the war tribunal.
"The 52nd brigade Command acting as a war tribunal can issue the sentence on the basis of the identification of the accused".
- What's your name?
- Giovan Battista Germinazza.
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing, I was just curious.
I wanted to see Mussolini and Petacci.
- They say she's very hot!
- Is that your car?
No, my boss's.
He has a villa near here.
- I'm the only driver.
- Any gasoline in it?
- Yes
- Stay here.
You and your car have just been requisitioned by the 52nd brigade.
But...
listen...
- I found a car.
- Good.
Take the road to Como.
- Hey, where are we going?
- He'll show you the way!
Can't we go any faster?
- I said faster!
- You want to finish up in the lake?
Aren't you a driver?
- So what?
- Then drive!
At the crossroad, take the road to Giulino Di Mezzegra.
This way.
- We can go now.
- Where?
Get back onto the road to the lake.
THE PLOGH FURROWS THE GROUND
BUT IT IS THE SWORD WHICH DEFENDS IT
Stop here.
Go and block the curve.
Get down.
You stay here.
You go and don't let anyone near.
Move the car away.
Get out of the way!
- You can't kill him!
- Get away!
- You can't kill him!
- Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
- Get away!
- No!
By order of the general command of the corps of Volunteers for Liberty
I am in charge of rendering justice to the Italian people.
Pietro, give me your gun!
- No!
Don't shoot!
- Back off!
- Get away!
- Don't shoot him!
- Don't shoot him!
- I told you to get away!
Two hours later, in the Dongo Town Square as decreed by article 5 of the Justice Ordiance issued by the National Libertation Committee
15 out of the 75 men arrested with Mussolini were shot by the partisans.
APRIL 29, 1945
The National Liberation Committee of Northern Italy declares that the execution of Mussolini and his accomplices is the necessary conclusion of a historic period which leaves our country in material and moral ruin and it is the conclusion of an insurrection struggle
that marks the premise of the country's rebirth and reconstruction.

What did he mean, murder?
And why am I talking to somebody from Homicide?
I appreciate it, sir, but, uh, my ears pop in an elevator.
As a matter of fact, I don't even like being this tall.
You know, I'm very happy you told me that.
Why's that?
Well, you know, that's what started your brother-in-law thinking that you had something to do with murdering his sister.
Here, I'll park the car for you, Mr. Brown.
Thank you.
How's the box office going for tonight?
All sold out, sir.
That's great!
Ah, thank you, sir.
I want you to check out the sound system, Luke.
I want you to find me an engineer.
Okay.
While I'm performing,
I want you to keep the candy hawkers and the picture sellers out of the aisle.
I don't want them out there when I'm trying to do a show.
I always do.
Yeah, you're really on the ball, ain't you, Luke?
I try, Tommy.

Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'll be right back.
Tommy, kiss me.
Tommy boy, kiss me.
Tommy, kiss me.
Please kiss me, Tommy.
Hmm, maybe later.
Tommy?
All right now.
Do you all hear me?
You're going home.
You hear me?
You all go home.
He's not coming out and he's not asking you all in.
So please go home.
I'm asking you nicely now, go home.
Officers, you get them.
Clear the crowd.
Hurry them along officers, please.
Thank you.
Sis.
Yes?
When you gonna tell me what you got on Tommy that makes him toe the line like that?
Well, I'll tell you when I think it's fit for you to know.
Shucks, Sis, if anything ever happens to you...
Well, the good Lord will see that it doesn't.
How about later?
Not so good.
It's coming out the teletype now from our Los Angeles weather station.
Coastal fog moving in after midnight and, uh, they're forecasting zero ceiling and visibility in the Basin and foothills.
But you can beat it if you take off in the next half hour.
Thanks.
I'd like to persuade you people to come back, Mrs. Brown.
Hell, we can sell out Tommy Brown for damn near a month here.
I don't hold with profanity, Mr. Dodds.
Oh, I'm sorry.
To the Lost Soul Crusade,
"hell" and "damnation" are not words to be taken lightly.
Yes, ma'am, but what about extending?
We're booked into Los Angeles this week.
And then we have special ceremonies for the groundbreaking at the tabernacle site on Tuesday.
Are you folks really spending $5 million to build it?
It'll be the finest temple to the glory of the Almighty in America.
The first $1 million is already in escrow.
Mrs. Brown, your end of tonight's take is $30,000, we took in about $50,000.
Fine.
Will you be waiting around for it?
Luke will.
But I'll want to check the figures myself as soon they're ready.
Yes, ma'am.
Won't be long.
When are we taking off?
I want to talk to you.
I'm listening.
Alone.
Well, now, if what you want to talk about is what you're all the time talking about,
Maryann can stay.
She's got a lot to do with it.
We got a good thing going, Edna, and it would be crazy to bust it up.
Bust it up?
I'm not aiming to.
I am.
You've got $1 million in escrow to build a tabernacle and you can't get the rest without me.
I know that, Tommy.
And I was thinking, maybe you and I could compromise, Edna.
You take half the money for the Crusade and I'll take half.
Every penny goes to the Crusade until that tabernacle is built.
You can push a man too far, Edna.
I'm being used and I don't like it.
Other singers drive around in Ferraris, Rolls,
I don't even own a car.
It's me they come to hear, Edna.
It's my records they buy.
It was me who got you a parole to get you away from that Arkansas prison farm or you'd still be rotting there.
I kept my part of the deal, Edna.
I married you and I've been faithful to you.
Because I watch you.
You are a lustful sinner, Tommy.
I saw the expression on your face when you were gonna kiss that lost child.
If it wasn't for me you'd be using the Crusade to lure her to some motel right now, or into the back of your car if you had one.
If I had one.
May God forgive me for letting a devil help me build a temple.
And what if your devil quits, what are you going to do?
Why now, it would all go down the drain, and you and me with it.
I seem to remember a little Bible myself, Edna.
"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord."
It was also written:
"The Lord works in mysterious ways, His wonders to perform."
I am his instrument and I would punish you, Tommy.
Maryann and me.
Those people out there just might not believe you and Maryann.
How about those motels where you register as a father and daughter with Maryann?
How old were you then, child?
16.
16.
All those phony names, the dark glasses that haven't been seen through yet.
Of course, you weren't so well-known then.
But your handwriting has got to be on some of those registers.
And one of those clerks could recognize Maryann, and you, too, if she pointed the finger.
Hasn't been but three years, Tommy, but I've read the law.
The statute of limitations hasn't run out yet on the Mann Act.
Statutory rape.
Oh, no.
You won't quit the Crusade, Tommy.
You're a sanctimonious hypocrite of a bible-spouting blackmailer and I've given you your last chance to be fair.
Your insults and threats don't scare me.
Uh, Mr. Dodds is ready for you, sis.
Right.
I won't be long.
Take your time.
We can't fly now, anyway.
Oh.
Why not?
Weather's bad in LA.
Improving after midnight.
We're not going to take a chance on leaving until after midnight.
I'm gonna grab a couple of hours of shut-eye.
Well, now, if you're thinking of looking for that child that came to the door, you forget it.
Because I'll be right back, to make sure that all you're grabbing is shut-eye.
You want me to fly back to LA with you?
No, I want you to ride on the bus, Luke.
There's mountains between here and LA and that old crate don't climb so good with four people on board.
Making another hint for a new plane.
Tommy, you're wasting your breath.
Wasting my breath when I sing, too, considering what I get out of it.
Hey, Luke, take this guitar on the bus with you.
You want me to put it in with the baggage?
No, I want you to put it on the seat right by you.
Don't put it under anything, and don't let that guitar get broken, Luke.
Okay, Tommy.
##
Hi, Mr. Brown.
Mrs. Brown.
Evening.
It sure is good to see you, sir.
Are we all fuelled up?
Uh, yes, sir.
All systems go, Mr. Brown.
Sure.
It's good taste you got in music there.
Uh, yes, sir.
Oh, I sure wish I could have gotten off to go to that concert of yours tonight.
What's your name?
Uh, Jeff.
Well, Jeff, next time I play Bakersfield,
I'll get you a couple of passes.
Oh, I sure do appreciate that, sir.
Sure, I'll be glad to it.
Oh, Mr. Brown.
All right, stow my luggage for me, will you?
Oh, sir, right away, sir.
Now, now, hurry, will you?
Please.
Hey, Jeff.
Yes, sir.
These are keys to my rent-a-car.
It's got plenty of time left on it so if you'd like to drive around awhile, go ahead.
Impress your girlfriend.
Oh, I sure do appreciate that, sir.
All right.
You'll do no such thing.
You'll turn that car in right away and I've checked the mileage.
Uh, yes, ma'am.
Oh, $5.
I sure do appreciate that, sir.
All right, don't...
Get a hand there.
Watch your feet.
There.
Ah.
Tommy, we are cold.
Heater is busted.
I got some coffee here.
Hot coffee.
Hold it for me, darling.
Tom, this is the most horrible coffee I've ever tasted.
Well, it's better than nothing.
Sorry.
You can't come into this area.
I'm from the Los Angeles Police Department.
Lt. Columbo.
Who's in charge here?
Mr. Pangborn.
Over there, being interviewed.
We're speaking with Mr. Roland Pangborn of the air safety division of the National Transportation Safety Board.
Mr. Pangborn is heading up the investigation of this very tragic air crash.
Do you have an opinion as to the cause of the crash, Mr. Pangborn?
Well, Hal, just the statement the pilot made at the hospital.
He had a total electrical system's failure, and his, uh, instruments and his radio were out.
However, I will say, unofficially, that, uh, one of our main problems in this...
Save it.
What's the matter?
This fellow's been wandering around in this shot and it's getting very distracting.
Hal, I'm sorry.
Would you mind, just for a moment, please?
I'm sorry.
I've got you in the wide shot.
I think we can pick him up in a single.
Fine.
Uh, Mr. Pangborn, you were about to give us an unofficial opinion of the cause of the crash.
Uh, excuse me, this is one of the big problems we have at these crash sites:
Curiosity seekers.
Hold it for a minute, will you?
Sir!
I'll have to ask you to leave.
L.A.P.D., Lt. Columbo.
I just didn't want to identify myself in front of the reporter.
Why not?
Well, like you were saying, better to be unofficial until you get the facts.
Well, just what facts have you got?
I don't have anything, just what I read in the morning newspaper.
I think it's a miracle this guy got out of the plane.
You know, it was a relief to my wife.
She's a big fan of this fellow's.
Knows all his albums.
Can you imagine getting out of this thing alive?
It's unusual.
But not unheard of.
I'm not clear why there's police interest in this crash, Lieutenant.
Ah, you see, that's what I mean, you know.
As soon as you mention that you're from the police, then right away, everybody starts speculating, especially when you say you're from Homicide.
Homicide?
Why is Homicide interested in this, Lieutenant?
We got a complaint from a member of the family,
Mrs. Brown's brother.
What do you mean, complaint?
Nothing definite.
Just suspicion of foul play.
But I heard what you just said over there.
It was electrical system failure.
That's what the pilot said.
And that's what you fellas will probably call the probable cause?
Contributing.
Yeah, I'd say.
Unofficially, though.
It'll still probably be that old, reliable standby:
Pilot error.
Almost always is.
You see, Brown was not instrument-rated and he flew into minimal weather and he lost his orientation.
Got the ship into a stall configuration and just spun in.
But that's always been and still is, as a matter of fact, the number one causative factor in private flying accidents of this type.
Sometimes augmented by a blood-alcohol count.
Mr. Pangborn, could you come back here just for a moment?
And bring your investigating team.
We're losing the light, it'll just take a moment.
We'd like to get this... this film to the lab.
Why don't you finish up?
Fellas, just come around and stand over on either side of me, if you will, please.
Mr. Pangborn?
Bring him in.
Ready?
Okay, get ready to roll.
Okay, that's it.
Rolling.
All set?
All right.
Fine.
Hold it.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
Look, just stand by with the lights.
You looking for something specific?
Uh, was that checked?
The engine?
No, but it will be.
No, I didn't mean the engine.
What you said before,
Mr. Brown's blood count for alcohol.
At the hospital, at our request.
But no.
He was cold sober, no drugs, nothing.
Mmm-hmm.
Listen, if the engine went into a stall, would that be considered pilot error?
No, I-it's not the engine.
Lieutenant, when we speak of a stall, we mean stalling the wing.
Well, that's getting the ship into too steep a climb.
And that is easy to do in tight weather with a blacked-out instrument panel.
No, he just shouldn't have been flying around these mountains at low altitude without an instrument rating in the kind of weather we had last night.
Um, Bakersfield to LA is an hour.
You know, by plane.
Couldn't he have gotten that weather ahead of time?
Told me he did when I talked to him at the hospital.
But he'd made the flight lots of times and he felt he could sneak through okay.
Mr. Pangborn, please, we're losing the light.
Just for one moment, please, sir.
Why don't you finish it up, get it over with?
All right, roll it again now.
Let's go.
Keeping it tight.
Mr. Pangborn.
Rolling.
As you can see, Mr. Pangborn and his staff are very busy people and we have to interrupt our interview from time to time.
However, Mr. Pangborn has rejoined us again, and with his permission, we'd like to continue.
Go right ahead.
I think the public is very interested in these aircraft accident investigation techniques, Mr. Pangborn.
We'd certainly like to follow through on this one.
Would it be possible for our crew to cover some of your procedures?
Oh, I think it could be arranged.
Now, if one of our questions is out of line, sir, just say the word and we'll withdraw it.
Thank you.
I'll give you the regulation "no comment."
That's fair enough.
First, I'd like to ask if you have the pilot's statement, why is it necessary to make any investigation at all?
Well, that's purely a routine.
There's no reflection at all on this pilot.
As a matter of fact, pilots are a very special breed of artists.
You know, it's called the art of flying.
And, uh, many of them are not really the strong or silent types that are generally depicted.
Some of them are quite emotional.
They tend to blame themselves for a crash even when it might have been due to circumstances beyond their control, you see.
You mean there might have been some sort of mechanical failure that even the pilot was unaware of?
Oh, exactly.
We'll take all of the engine, electronic and structural parts of the wreckage back to our hangar, and give it a thorough examination.
We give it an X-ray, chemical analysis, microscopic metallurgical testing, that sort of thing.
So, what we have is the pilot's statement which makes our job easier.
A lot easier, and the situation a lot clearer.
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Pangborn.
This is Hal Fischer, in the Los Angeles mountains.
Okay, that's a wrap.
Got it.
He's saying he felt he could make it.
The same old story, the same old fatal results.
Were the two women sitting in the back?
Right.
Are these the seat-belts for the two backseats?
Yeah.
I noticed they weren't jarred open by the impact of the crash.
They never are.
Well, that explains it.
Explains what?
Why the pilot was thrown clear and the two women weren't.
I'm sorry, I...
I just don't follow.
I noticed the pilot's seatbelt.
Yeah?
Not fastened.
I hadn't noticed.
My God, you're right.
It must have been open before the crash.
Oh, you got one of those, too?
Well, I'm just gonna make a note and ask Brown why his belt wasn't fastened.
All right.
Gee, that reminds me,
I gotta make the same note.
In this case, it probably saved his life.
Generally, the pi...
the passengers sitting after the cockpit have a better chance of survival in a crash of this type.
You got a minute, sir?
Yeah, sure.
Right this way.
What's this?
That's a pilot's navigation kit.
They keep their charts in it.
Uh, radio frequency, pamphlets, lot of different things.
Gee, that's funny.
What?
No ashes.
I beg your pardon?
No ashes.
Seems empty.
Well, he could have taken the charts out and laid them on the unoccupied co-pilot's seat.
But those ashes would be in among all those other ashes.
Ah, that would explain that.
You know something, Lieutenant,
I could use a man like you on my team.
It's really nothing but detective work.
Oh, no, thank you very much.
You fellas here, you have to fly.
Sure, we're all pilots.
Oh, no, not for me.
Thank you very much.
I wouldn't qualify for that.
Why?
We'll teach you.
I appreciate it, sir, but, uh, my ears pop in an elevator.
As a matter of fact, I don't even like being this tall.
How do you do, sir?
My name is Mr. Grindell.
How do you do?
Are you a relative of Mrs. Brown?
No, I'm just here to see a relative...
I see, you are a friend of the family?
Oh, I'm sorry, you are a bit late.
You missed a lovely service.
Excuse me, sir.
Uh, Mr. Brown sang several popular hymns.
Rock of Ages...
I'm not a friend of the family.
Actually, I'm a policeman.
Lt. Columbo, Homicide.
I beg your pardon.
I'm here to see Mr. Luke Baskin.
Yes.
He's paying his last respects before the bodies are... are shipped out to Nashville.
Uh, he's taking it a bit hard, you know.
But, uh, he will be out shortly.
Oh.
Well, maybe I'll just wait out here.
Fine.
Fine.
Lieutenant, this is one of my cards.
We handled all the arrangements here.
Uh, excuse me.
Thank you.
Oh.
Um, I'm a great admirer of the police department, you know.
Uh, I didn't know, but I'm always glad to hear that.
Why shouldn't you hear of it?
After all, you men are so ready to give your life, uh, to save ours.
Well, uh, let's hope it doesn't come up too often.
Yes, yes, yes, but it does, doesn't it?
Especially in these violent times.
Uh, it's uh...
Just this morning a-at breakfast with my dear wife Martha,
I glanced in the papers.
And I...
I noted that the rate of the police mortality is just...
It's shocking.
I mean it is just...
Well, you must be aware of that.
Well, we don't like to think about it too often.
But one should think of it, uh, shouldn't one?
Well, you know, I guess it's the kind of thing that you don't do anything about until you actually have to.
But if you need a funeral, uh, then you are not in condition to do anything about it, you see.
All right, I see what you mean.
Have you made plans for your own departure from this mortal sphere?
No.
Huh?
No, I haven't.
Yeah.
I mean, it's not like, uh...
It's not the kind of thing where you make a reservation or buy a ticket.
Yes, but yet, a little foresight, for your dear ones I speak, uh... uh, would prevent, uh, trouble and, uh, expense... expense.
Excuse me just a moment.
Lieutenant, this is our brochure.
Now, from here, uh, you could choose, uh, anything within your own means, uh... uh, from among a... a large variety of plans that we have here.
Now, this, for instance...
Well, I...
I appreciate it very much but my wife does all the shopping in the family.
She'd be very upset if I bought anything, you know, without talking to her about it first.
Of course.
Of course.
It's very nice, husband and wife to decide in this.
Can we, uh, make an appointment?
That'd be nice.
I couldn't talk to her about this, Mr. Grindell.
She'd think I was working on a dangerous case.
She cries easily.
She cries when she loses at bowling, you know.
You're a hard sell, Lieutenant, huh?
Well, I'm sorry.
Actually, you know, I was just here...
Oh, hi, Lieutenant.
Oh, hello, Mr. Baskin.
Did you find out anything?
Uh, thank you very much, sir.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Gentlemen, excuse me.
Did you ever see Mr. Brown's navigation kit?
Sure, all the time.
Were you familiar with its contents?
Yeah, just a bunch of maps and charts.
You've seen these maps and charts?
Yeah.
Did you see them the day of the crash?
Uh, well, no, I didn't, uh, open the kit that day.
You mean, you had the kit in your hand that day?
Yeah.
I carried it from the plane to the car.
Was it heavy?
No, no more than usual.
Hmm.
Did you carry it back from the car to the plane when they left?
No, Tommy did.
Why?
You on to something, Lieutenant?
No, I don't think so, sir.
No.
Look, I'm not very smart, and I don't know how he did it,
I just know that somehow he did.
'Cause he hated my sister.
He never loved her.
He just used her.
Yes, sir.
You've told me that.
That doesn't explain why he would kill her.
She had something on him.
What?
I don't know.
She wouldn't tell me.
Hmm.
I believe you're very sincere, sir.
But there's just no proof of anything.
Look, you don't know Tommy Brown like I do.
You've got to question him.
I'm going to do that.
But you must understand, it's just going to be a formality.
Then do it.
Do it now.
Do it today.
Yes, sir.
I don't think that today would be the right time.
It's too close...
Lieutenant, I want you to see what Tommy Brown's like.
I want you to talk to him.
Would you do that for me, please, as a personal favor?
Today?
Please?
Uh, all right.
I'm coming with you.
##
d And it took me back to something d d that I lost somewhere d
See what I mean, Lieutenant?
He couldn't wait.
Rented this place while he was still in the hospital.
$2,000 a month.
What?
You know, there's no law against that, Mr. Baskin.
Listen to all that going around out yonder.
My sister ain't even in her grave yet.
But there's no law against that, either, Mr. Baskin.
Maybe it's not a good idea for you to see him right now.
Why not?
I'm still working for him.
You know, I'll have to tell him you're the one who made the complaint.
Good.
I wanna see the look on his face when...
Now, just a minute.
Now, listen to me.
When I talk to him, I'm gonna have to talk to him alone.
That's the only right way to do it.
And if you're gonna cause trouble...
I won't.
I promise you, I won't do that.
Okay.
# When Sunday mornin' coming' down #
# In the park I saw a daddy #
# With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin' #
# And I stopped beside a Sunday school #
# And listened to the songs that they were singin' #
# Then I went on down the road #
That's Mr. Brown?
That's him.
# A lonely bell was ringin' #
# And it echoed through the canyon #
# Like a disappearing' dream of yesterday #
# On a Sunday mornin' sidewalk #
# I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned #
# 'Cause there's somethin' about a Sunday #
This looks good.
Help yourself.
Think it's all right?
Oh, sure.
I missed lunch.
Make yourself at home.
D Half as lonesome as the sound d
What is that?
Chili.
Yeah, looks good.
Have some.
Think it's all right?
Hmm.
# And Sunday mornin' coming' down ##
Say, that's delicious.
I never tasted chili like that before.
That's a special recipe.
Made out of squirrel meat.
That good, ain't it?
Hmm.
Yeah, that explains it.
Hey, Luke.
I thought you were ridin' back with us.
Where have you been?
I've been to get the cops to find out how you killed Edna.
You gone crazy?
You did it.
You know you did it.
You killed both of them.
You're fired!
Get out of here!
You crazy?
Get him out of here!
What's the matter with you?
Give me that.
You crazy?
Get him out.
Boy.
Mr. Brown, I'm terribly sorry about this.
Who are you?
I'm Lt. Columbo, I'm from the L. A.P.D., Homicide.
Homicide?
What's he been telling you about me?
Well, if we could just talk privately.
There's nothing to get excited about.
Just wanna ask some routine questions.
There ain't no need for everything to stop.
I'll be right back.
Let me see that guitar.
If he's busted that guitar,
I'll bust his neck.
Come on in here.
Nothing to get excited about, folks.
Mr. Brown will be right out.
What did he mean, murder?
And why am I talking to somebody from Homicide?
I feel terrible about this, sir.
I mean, an awful thing that was.
And, uh, there was just no way for me to prevent your brother-in-law from coming here.
Maybe I could have anticipated...
Okay!
Just tell me what's it all about.
What's he saying?
It's nothing to get excited about, sir, believe me.
You just have to understand that, uh, when a member of the family makes a complaint, well, we just have to go through certain formalities, ask questions, and, uh, make out a report...
And I guess this, all this, looks kind of bad, huh?
This... this big house.
This party going on and everything?
No, sir.
No, sir.
It's kind of refreshing.
You see, in my line of work, homicide, somebody is always, well, dead.
That's the only way to put it.
I mean, they don't even call us in unless that's what it is, somebody dead.
So, naturally, I see a lot of grief.
Now look, Lieutenant,
I'm not gonna try to tell you that Edna and I didn't quarrel.
You can't...
You can't go through a day with Edna without quarreling.
You didn't know Edna.
The Crusade.
I was all for the Crusade.
It's just that I thought a little something ought to go to me for what I do, you know.
I give it full, I give it all my time.
The dirty hotel rooms...
Mr. Brown.
...the dirty dressing rooms, the stale coffee...
Mr. Brown.
I'm not here to pry into your personal life.
My personal life is an open book.
Everybody knows I've done time.
Yes, sir.
But what you've done since you've gotten out has been an inspiration to a lot of people.
Then what are you bugging me for?
Well, like I said, just ask a few routine questions.
Well, I can come back another time when you're more settled.
Go ahead.
Ask your questions.
Are you sure it's all right?
Get it over with.
You don't mind?
Go right ahead.
I'll try and make it very fast.
I was up there at the crash site and I was talking to, uh, that fellow Mr. Pangborn, up there.
You want some coffee?
No, thank you very much.
We were both wondering why your seatbelt wasn't fastened at the time of the crash.
Oh, that?
Well, you see, when the power went off, the lights went out.
And I reached across to the glove compartment to try to get a flashlight.
And to do that, I had to unbuckle my seatbelt.
That's when I lost control.
Well, that explains it.
I'll tell Mr. Pangborn that so that he won't bother you about it, too.
Thanks.
What else can I tell you now?
You have a pencil?
No.
That's all right, I'll remember.
Oh, here we are.
The navigation kit.
What about it?
There were no ashes in it, you see.
So, we were, uh, we were wondering what happened to the charts and, uh, and the maps that were in it.
Well, when the power went off, the defroster quit working, you see.
So, I slid open the window to try to see where I was goin' and the suction s-s-sucked all the maps and papers and everything right out of the window.
Big suction.
I'll tell that to Mr. Pangborn, too.
We were both wondering.
Thanks.
I...
I appreciate that.
That does it.
You sure made me move, Mr. Brown.
I never asked questions this fast before in my life.
I always think it's kind of impolite to keep firing questions at people.
If that's your job, that's what you ought to do.
Mmm-hmm.
Sorry about what happened out there.
And I sure hope your guitar is all right.
It's a beauty.
Yeah.
#
Not another guitar in the world with a tone like that.
It's a great guitar.
Handmade.
When I take an airliner,
I get an extra seat and sit it right beside me.
No kidding.
Yeah.
Lucky thing it wasn't on that plane with you last night.
Yeah, I know, that was a break, all right.
I'd been worried about that.
Worried about crashing with it?
No, about, uh, about it coming unglued, or cracking it at high altitudes in an unpressurized plane.
Look at this guitar.
You see the...
It's put together with a very special glue.
Different pieces of wood.
It looks like one piece, but feel that belly.
Feel how smooth it is on that back there.
Well, the changes in pressure and altitude can affect a good guitar like that.
Ruin the tone.
So I told Luke to put it on the bus.
You know, I'm very happy you told me that.
Why's that?
Well, you know, that's what started your brother-in-law thinking that you had something to do with murdering his sister.
The fact that you parted with your guitar.
He said that was the first time you ever did that.
Then I'm glad I told you, too.
That winds it up.
We'll probably just go along with Mr. Pangborn's report.
Hmm.
Mr. Pangborn's report will make me look bad enough.
That's a lousy piece of flying I did.
Well, let's hope I stumble onto something so it doesn't look so much like pilot error.
And if I do, I'll let you know.
You're not finished?
Oh, just a couple of things for my own report down at headquarters.
Nothing to worry you about, Mr. Brown.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
I appreciate your taking the time.
Glad to.
Let me know when I can help you.
Right this way, sir.
Just step right on that seat, Lieutenant.
Sir.
Just step right on the seat there, sir.
Just watch your step, sir.
You all right, Lieutenant?
Thank you, sir.
##
Excuse me, uh...
Uh, excuse me.
Yes, sir.
Uh, I'm looking for someone who might have been around the night Tommy Brown took off.
Who are you?
That's a good question.
Uh, police.
Yes, sir.
That'd be Jeff.
He was on duty that night.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.
Yeah?
Uh, L.A.P.D.
Yes, sir.
I'm investigating the Tommy Brown airplane crash.
Oh, yeah.
I sure was sorry to hear about that.
You're a fan of his?
Yes, sir.
You?
Uh, well, my wife more than me, but I'm getting there.
I was wondering, could you give me any information about that flight?
Oh, well, I, uh, I saw them off, but I don't know anything about that crash.
Right.
Of course.
You know, we've got to check out all these small little details.
They don't mean nothing.
So, uh, now what did you...
You say you saw them off.
What did you do?
Well, you know, I helped with the luggage, uh, pulled out the chocks, that sort of thing.
Luggage.
What luggage?
Well, um, the ladies had a couple overnight bags.
And uh, Mr. Brown didn't have nothing but his navigation kit.
Some gum?
No.
Thank you very much.
You handled the luggage?
Uh, yes, sir.
Put it in the luggage compartment back of the cabin.
Did you, uh...
You notice anything unusual about the luggage?
Unusual?
Was it extra heavy or light, anything like that?
Oh.
Um, no.
Just luggage.
And the navigation kit, was it heavy or light?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Mr. Brown put that aboard himself.
In the cabin?
Yes, sir.
Um, on the co-pilot's seat.
Wouldn't do much good in the luggage compartment unless you was a bird.
I guess so.
So the only thing that was in the cabin was the passengers and the navigation kit?
Yeah.
That's it.
Oh, well, the thermos bottle.
That's probably nothing.
W-W-What do you mean, thermos bottle?
Most pilots carry a thermos of coffee aboard.
Was the thermos bottle in the navigation kit?
Uh, no, sir.
Most likely wouldn't be enough room for it, with all the charts and stuff.
No, Mr. Brown just, uh, put it on the co-pilot's seat next to the kit.
You've been a big help.
I have?
##
That's nice.
Tina, I'd like you to take the arrangements down to the arranger.
Be sure we get them back in time, all right?
Then I want you to make me out a big, long list of things that I can do for you for being so nice to Tommy Brown.
You afraid of me?
Uh, no.
Every time I get close, you start backing up.
I...
I guess I'm just afraid of myself.
Is that all?
It's just so soon about your wife.
Hmm.
I understand.
But do you understand that Edna and I didn't love each other, ever?
Don't say that.
Come on in, it ain't locked.
Lt. Columbo.
Come right in, rest yourself.
I'm not interrupting anything?
No.
Come in.
Hey, Tina, you better take care of those errands, okay?
And don't forget the last thing on the list.
What can I get you, Lieutenant?
How about some brandy or bourbon?
No, you look more like a beer man.
Thank you, sir, but I'm on duty.
Oh, yeah.
I almost forgot.
Hey, you hop around pretty good on that.
Well, it takes more than a busted leg to keep me down.
That lovely girl.
Who?
Tina?
She really is.
She's beautiful.
And she's been a great help to me through this time.
She admires you a lot.
I could see that.
Now, come on, Lieutenant, don't tell me they got you back out here chasing after Luke's daydream.
I'm afraid so, sir.
If it was up to me, I'd forget about it.
I'd go on to something else.
You know what the problem is?
You're a celebrity.
Because of you, my boss, he won't let me close up this case until I've covered everything.
Every loose end has got to be tied up.
It'll make you crazy.
So that's the problem.
That's a crying shame, it really is.
A man with your talent...
Real killers loose out there.
And they got you chasing smoke.
What are you going to do?
That's the job, right?
You take the good with the bad.
Uh, that reminds me.
Uh, you could help me clear up some things.
Sure.
I'd be glad to.
But let me get you something to eat.
You look hungry to me.
Oh, no, please.
Thank you very much.
I just had lunch.
How about some coffee?
I had it with my lunch.
You're shaming me now, Lieutenant.
You just won't let me do anything for you.
Well, actually, sir, there is something you can do for me.
Uh, you can answer a few of these questions.
Sure.
I'd be glad to.
First of all, uh, the thermos.
The one you took on the plane.
What about it?
Would you mind telling me, sir, what you had in it?
Just some coffee.
Coffee.
Why?
What does that matter?
Well, they couldn't find it.
The thermos.
At the crash site, couldn't find it.
I checked with Mr. Pangborn.
So?
Well, you see, everything else in the plane was accounted for.
Well, does it really matter what happened to a thermos bottle?
Oh, I'm sure it doesn't make a difference at all, but, you see, uh, like I was saying earlier, see that's the kind of loose end that, uh,
I got to tie up, those tiny little things.
Otherwise, it won't let me close the book on this case.
Yeah.
I understand.
T-T-That's my problem.
I see what you mean.
Well, we'll just have to come up with the right answer for them.
You know, something to make them happy.
Yes.
I...
I, uh, I just don't know what to write.
Uh, I'll help you all I can.
Well, if you could come up with something, sir,
I'd certainly appreciate it.
Hey, why don't you just tell them that the thermos burned up in the plane crash, like it probably did.
Well, you know, I thought about that.
But, uh, I checked with the lab.
And, uh, you see, a thermos wouldn't be consumed by fire.
It's metal inside and glass.
Yeah.
That's a tough one, all right.
Yes.
I just can't come up with an answer.
Well, you think about this.
I was thrown clear in the crash.
I got a busted leg out of the deal.
But I was thrown clear.
And something as light as a thermos could be thrown hundreds of feet.
Maybe it was thrown clear.
Thrown clear?
Yeah.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Thrown clear.
I knew sooner or later,
I was going to get to help you some way.
Not bad.
Yeah.
I think they'll buy that.
Okay.
Listen.
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
Glad to help.
Yeah.
You've been a big help.
Appreciate the time.
Okay.
All right.
Oh.
I don't know what's the matter with me.
You know, the last time I was here, I forgot to ask the question, too.
What's the matter with me?
Um, where did you first learn how to fly?
Lieutenant, I thought you knew my whole life history by now.
Oh, no.
No, uh.
You know, people think we have all kinds of records on microfilms.
All we got to do is push a button and...
Well, don't you?
Yes, we do, but not everything.
Well, I learned to fly over 20 years ago in the Air Force, a little.
I learned to fly a little.
A little.
Well, I got to admit.
I washed out of cadets.
Washed right flat out.
Of course, I got a civilian private license after the Korean War.
Were you in that one?
Yeah.
Were you?
Yeah.
I was in that one.
But not in the Air Force.
No kidding.
Let me guess what you were in.
M.P.
K.P. mostly.
Where'd they put you after you washed out as a cadet?
Oh, man, you know the service.
Whatever bad was going around, that's what I got.
Picking up butts, latrine duty, running errands for the C.O., whatever.
Oh, man, that service life was something.
Anything else?
No, sir.
That should about do it.
Thank you.
Go ahead.
You can take that.
I'm finished.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, hello.
All right.
Put him on.
Hello, Sid, this is Tommy.
No.
You heard right, Sid.
We're stopping the project.
We're stopping the building on the tabernacle.
I don't know.
Can't say.
Just pay everybody off up to date.
Tell them we'll get back to them, okay?
Right.
Bye.
Excuse me, sir.
Lieutenant, if that police career of yours ever fizzles out, you could always make it as a cat burglar.
Oh, sorry.
You know what happened.
I saw this note that I made here that I meant to ask you about.
Ask away, little buddy.
You know, the reason I think I forgot was because it was filed under "pilot."
You know, for pilot error.
Mmm-hmm.
What about it?
Uh, did you call in for the weather before you made that flight?
I sure did.
Every pilot does.
Well, according to the Bakersfield Weather Bureau, they anticipated a low ceiling in Los Angeles.
If you'd left an hour earlier, you would have missed it.
Well, you see, I left later because of the audiences at Bakersfield.
They just wouldn't let me off-stage.
They love that music in Bakersfield.
Oh, they sure do.
I know that for a fact.
But your brother-in-law, he told me that you took a nap.
Yeah, I always take a nap before I fly late at night, especially after a performance.
I was wiped out.
I know those desk jockeys downtown are about to drive you crazy giving you a bad time.
I know how bad you hate to keep asking all those stupid questions that they send you out here to ask.
I want you to tell them one thing for me.
All those loose ends that they think they are tying up are going to go nowhere, you see, because Tommy Brown was on that plane himself when it crashed and if I'd been up to no good,
I wouldn't risk my own neck in the process.
I'm going to make that point very clear to them, sir.
Hey, Columbo, I want you tell those people down at your office one thing for me, that I got nothing to hide.
And I guess you overheard me on the phone.
Overheard you on the phone?
Oh, no, sir.
No.
But I knew you were stopping the project.
I spoke to the architects this morning.
However, it's very helpful to know your reasoning.
Thank you.
One of ours, sir?
Colonel.
Oh, sorry.
747.
I'd like to land one of these babies.
This must be quite a letdown for you.
What is?
R.O.T.C.
There's a job to be done, Lieutenant, and I'm the man to do it.
Brown.
Brown.
Brown, Thomas.
Oh, sure.
Never forget the lads who served under me.
If not by name, by face.
He's out of Vietnam, but I remember the face.
He served in your outfit in Korea.
Oh.
What's happened to him?
He's Tommy Brown now.
Tommy Brown.
He's a big star.
Really?
Made it in the movies, huh?
No, sir.
Country and Western music.
Entertainment.
He's very big.
Oh.
Not that, uh, twist stuff?
That degenerate...
No, sir.
Folk music.
Tommy Brown, he's a singer.
Good.
Just as long as he isn't a pilot.
Washed out as a cadet as I recall.
Transferred to my outfit.
Did you read about that private plane crash the other night?
Oh, yeah.
He was the pilot.
The guy that got thrown clear?
Yes, sir.
Never made the connection.
What did he do in your outfit, sir?
Parachute rigging.
You mean he ran a machine which rigged the parachute.
Not on your life, Lieutenant.
It was done by hand.
A man folds his own.
Some things in life don't change, Lieutenant.
Yes, sir.
May I use your telephone?
Keep it short.
Will you?
Never know when there might be an alert.
Absolutely.
I want the Medical Examiner's office.
Lt. Columbo.
Columbo.
I'll wait.
It's really for official business.
Do they still make them out of silk?
Speaking to me?
"Hit the silk." Is that just an...
It's just an expression.
The old barnstorming days.
Nylon. 60 square yards of it, and a parachute personnel standard M-4.
How fast does that bring a man down?
20 feet per second.
Average.
Isn't that pretty fast?
There's a proper way to land, Lieutenant.
Hello?
The Medical Examiner.
Lt. Columbo.
How big is this flag?
It's not a flag, Lieutenant, it's a banner.
Eagles and stars rampant on a field of blue.
The official emblem of the United States Air Force.
How big is it?
27 square feet, why?
How much is that in square yards?
You ought to know that, Lieutenant.
Three square yards.
A parachute is 60 square yards?
Right.
20 times bigger than this?
That's elementary, Lieutenant.
Hello.
Yes, I am.
Hello?
Doctor.
Yes.
This is Lt. Columbo.
I want to order an autopsy on two deceased, already interred.
Mrs. Edna Brown and Miss Maryann Cobb.
# Just like a blind man I wandered astray #
# Straight is the gate and narrow the way #
# Then like the blind man that got back his sight #
# Praise the Lord, I saw the light #
Hey, Columbo.
Come on in.
Join the session.
I didn't ruin on the record or anything?
There was no light on so I just came in.
Playback.
It's a concert we did last night.
How do you like it?
Oh, good.
# Praise the Lord #
We were there.
At the concert?
My wife and I. We were there.
# Clouds covered me.
I had no idea #
Hey!
Hey!
You're really coming on, Lieutenant.
D Then came the sunrise and rolled back the night d
Bring it down a couple of points there, will you, Bill?
# I saw the light #
# I saw the light #
# No more darkness, no more night #
# Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight #
# Praise the Lord #
What's the matter?
# I saw the light #
# Just like a blind man #
You opened your concert with that song.
Yeah, I closed my show with that song, too.
Number one on the charts.
Hey, there you go, Lieutenant.
# that got back his sight #
You don't like it?
# I saw the light ##
No, oh, it's very good, very popular.
You know, I hear it coming out of cars, out of storefronts.
One kid had it coming out of his pocket.
Right here.
But, uh, the sound is different here.
And I noticed last night at the concert...
Yeah, live audience.
That's why the different sound, it's recorded live.
The one you've been hearing around town is a studio recording we did a while back.
Oh.
Oh, that explains it.
You know, little buddy, there's a question I'd like to ask you.
You ordered my wife's body dug up, right?
That's correct, sir.
Both bodies.
And autopsies performed?
Yes, sir.
Expecting to find what?
Mr. Brown, I don't think this is the...
That's quite all right, if you don't mind answering that question.
Just what were you expecting to find?
I don't know.
It's not an unusual police procedure.
After an air crash?
Very often, to find out if the pilot had a heart attack or to find out if there was any evidence of drug...
Lieutenant, I was the pilot and I'm very much alive.
Yes, sir.
And that air safety guy, what's his name?
Mr. Pangborn?
He ordered all kinds of blood tests run.
Yes, sir, they were all negative and the EKG, your heart, that was normal.
Which should make you feel very good.
And the autopsy showed nothing unusual?
No, sir.
Nothing unusual.
I think I could have told you that, Lieutenant.
Of course, when I say nothing unusual, what I mean is that, uh, under, you know, normal circumstances, there would be nothing unusual.
Just what are you trying to say, Lieutenant?
Barbiturates, sir.
We found evidence of barbiturates in both women.
And, uh, according to their religious beliefs, they were prohibited from taking any drugs or stimulants.
That's true.
But they used to get airsick.
So they took an airsickness pill.
Yes, sir.
But these barbiturates were sleeping pills.
Sleeping pills work just like airsickness pills sometimes, Lieutenant.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Well, that must explain that.
Oh, thank you very much.
Tommy, gonna feed you the eight-track now.
##
Hey, Bill, kill it.
Anything else, Lieutenant?
No, sir.
Oh, uh...
Could I have a tape of that concert?
Be in the stores, a couple of months.
No, what I meant was could I have an advance copy?
Why not?
Thank you very much.
May I...
Are your hands clean?
Let me see.
Oh, all right.
This is nylon, isn't it?
Yes.
I prefer cotton.
But people today, even our own people, just don't want anything that requires care.
Listen, I was wondering if you could help me.
My name is Lt. Columbo.
I'm from the Los Angeles Police Department.
Columbo, that's an Italian name.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Uh, could you tell me how much fabric...
My husband was half Italian.
And a wonderfully warm man, too.
Just the way Italians are supposed to be.
Can you tell me, ma'am, how many yards...
And he was a naturally good singer, too.
Of course, he was thin and he had this little blonde moustache.
But he was half Scandinavian, so...
Yes.
Lt. Columbo, are you with the Army?
Los Angeles Police Department.
Oh.
Have we done something?
No, ma'am.
Not that I know of, no.
I'm just here...
I'm just part of an investigation.
Well, of what?
Are you with the vice squad?
I don't remember having a good time.
No, ma'am.
No, I'm not with the vice squad.
I just wanted to ask you about some of these lovely robes that you and the ladies...
You want to know how many yards it takes to make a robe.
Listen, that depends.
Now, you take Helen there, it takes her four yards of material to make a robe.
It only takes me two.
What does she do?
She makes the bigger sizes, does she?
Makes mistakes, that what she does.
The poor little thing.
Once she did two left sides and wondered why it wouldn't button up.
Oh, she's a darling woman, but she is not a good seamstress.
Let me ask you something, dear.
You think I could take a look at this?
Well, if you're careful.
Just for a minute.
Certainly.
But be careful.
Thank you very much.
May I, please?
Sure.
Just go over that.
Oh, what are you doing?
How many square yards in a roll like this?
Uh, be careful now, don't let it go all the way to the end or you'll soil it...
Well, you know, I'm curious about the yardage.
You certainly are.
Could you show me what 60 square yards of this would look like?
In the first place, this is not a roll, this is a bolt.
60 square yards, wait a minute there.
That's 10 yards by 6 yards.
That's 30 feet by 18 feet.
This can't be 60 square yards.
It isn't even 20.
Do you have more?
Oh, yes, yes, we have a reserve.
We are like the industrious ants.
You know that story.
I kept a reserve stock against rising prices.
Just a minute, I'll show it to you.
Dear, oh, dear, I meant to reorder...
Do you find yourself forgetting?
Sometimes, ma'am, yes, I do.
Could you tell me, do you remember how much you meant to reorder?
Oh, it's always the same.
How much is that?
Three bolts of nylon, white, 1A-447.
And how many yards in a bolt, 20?
No, 15.
15, so there's only 45 yards missing.
Only 45 square yards missing, out of sheer forgetfulness.
And the prices have surely risen four or five cents a yard.
Why do I do that?
Forget, I mean.
Is it what they say it is?
Is it old age?
No.
No.
It's not that.
Who knows what it is, but it's not that.
Listen.
I want to thank you very, very much.
You're welcome.
I appreciate talking to you.
It was nice to meet you.
Oh, my.
Now, Lieutenant, let's see that navigation kit.
It fits.
Of course, there's no harness attached to this.
You wouldn't get it in with a conventional chute harness.
What about an unconventional one?
What do you mean?
Something homemade.
Something homemade?
Yeah, it's possible.
What do you think?
You know as well as I do that the diameter of a standard chute is substantially larger than that.
Anybody jumping in that would have a much faster rate of descent than normal.
Tight chutes in a parachute like this, he goes down faster, right?
At least 20%%% faster.
Fatally faster?
Not necessarily.
The guy would probably break something, an arm, a leg or pelvis, or something.
Be awful risky.
So is murder.
I know what you're getting at, but I don't see how you can ever prove the guy jumped without finding the chute.
Neither do I.
You see?
And if it was premeditated, he'd certainly have destroyed the chute.
Yeah, but how you gonna destroy a parachute?
I mean, you can't risk burning it.
You'll see the flames no matter where he landed.
Okay, so he hid it somewhere.
Buried it.
What are you gonna do?
Dig up that whole mountain?
Thank you very much.
Come on.
Your people...
You never found that thermos bottle, did you?
No.
Hmm.
So, it must have been thrown out sometime during the flight.
Could be.
Mmm.
If the pilot jumped, just before he crashed the plane, he would land not too far from the crash site.
Right?
Right.
But there's no indication that he even took a parachute aboard.
There is an indication, Mr. Pangborn.
That empty navigation kit.
That wouldn't hold a conventional chute.
How about an unconventional chute?
Well, all I can say is he'd have to be one expert chute man.
He was.
I checked his military record.
After he washed out as a flying cadet he became a parachute rigger.
Well, it will still be an awful lot of mountain to search for anything hidden or buried.
A lot of mountain.
Who could find it?
The guy that hid it.
Well, it was the original version.
That's what I hear coming out of the radio.
And then there's the version that you recorded yesterday in the studio.
# I saw the light #
This is the original version.
# I saw the light #
# No more darkness, no more night #
Mmm-hmm.
Now this is... is the new version.
I hope I got it.
I know I had it.
I got it.
Bear with me, sir.
# I saw the light #
This is the new version.
Mmm-hmm.
# No more darkness ##
I noticed that the arrangement was changed.
You got a good ear for music.
Well, you know I'm ltalian.
Yeah, I know.
Anyway, I spoke to your arranger.
Nick Solecanto?
Yeah, that's him.
You know, he's Italian, too.
Yeah, I know.
So I asked him was there a special reason for you changing the arrangements?
He said yes.
Maryann was a soprano, Tina is a contralto.
Well, now, I could have told you that myself.
I know, sir.
But I was afraid that my next question might be a little embarrassing to you.
I asked Mr. Solecanto:
"How long does it take to change an arrangement like that?"
He said about a week.
And you wondered how I knew
I was going to need a new arrangement a week before Maryann was killed, right?
Yes, sir.
That was the embarrassing question.
Not embarrassing at all, Columbo.
I knew it because I knew
I was going to replace Maryann with Tina.
I liked her voice better in the solos.
That's exactly what I thought.
As a matter of fact, I like her better myself.
But I wanted to hear your explanation.
That's it.
Finished.
That definitely closes the book on you, sir.
I'm glad to hear it.
My superiors will have to agree that I've been pretty thorough on this case.
Mmm-hmm.
You really have.
Um, there's just one other thing, sir.
What's that?
I'll explain it to you in a minute.
May I use your telephone?
Go right ahead.
##
Milt?
Columbo here.
Did you get in touch with that Boy Scout troop?
Yeah, tomorrow's okay, but they gotta start early.
How about the Forest Ranger patrol on the sheriff's Mountain Squad?
They'll start tomorrow, first thing?
Good.
Fine.
See you later.
Did that have something to do with me?
Yes, sir.
It did.
But I hesitate to mention it.
Go right ahead.
Sir, did you drink any of that coffee that was in that thermos bottle that you took on the flight?
No.
I didn't think so.
And if my hunch is correct, you're a very lucky man.
What hunch?
The barbiturates that turned up in the autopsy on those two women were a lot more than anyone would ever take for airsickness.
They were almost a lethal dose certainly enough to knock somebody out.
No kidding?
If they were in that coffee, they could have been put there by somebody who wanted to put you to sleep at the controls.
Maybe somebody wanted to kill you.
Now, why would anybody want to kill me?
Mr. Brown, I don't know.
But you are a celebrity.
And there are a lot of crackpots in the world.
And there is just no accounting for people's reactions.
And sometimes I even wonder about my wife.
Not that she is a crackpot, but, uh, when she is listening to your records, uh, the way she carries on.
But not like she wants to kill me.
No, sir, just the opposite.
It's no laughing matter.
This can be serious.
Look, the only fingerprints that should be on that thermos are yours, your wife's, and the girl's, right?
Right.
But if some guy thought he was going to put you to sleep at the controls and kill you in a plane crash, he might have gotten careless with his fingerprints.
He might have left them on that thermos bottle when he spiked the coffee.
Lieutenant, man, you got some kind of imagination.
You know that?
Still, when I get a hunch down here and I ignore it,
I always regret it.
I am gonna put a police guard on you until I find that thermos bottle.
You might never find that thermos.
We're gonna find it.
You might be right.
It could've been thrown a long distance away when that plane crashed.
But between those Boy Scouts, those Forest Rangers, and the Sheriff's Squad, we are gonna comb every inch of that mountainside.
We'll comb it and comb it, and then comb it some more, till we find it.
In the meantime, you're getting a police guard.
Now, that's nice of you.
I really appreciate that.
But it won't be necessary, Lieutenant.
I'm leaving on a concert tour.
You're leaving, sir?
I sure am.
When are you leaving?
This afternoon.
For how long?
For months.
I open tomorrow night in San Francisco.
You are going to be gone for months?
Mmm-hmm.
I sure am.
Why, what's the matter?
Nothing, sir.
No, uh...
I just wasn't prepared for that, uh...
Well, it's surely been nice knowing you, Lieutenant.
I've enjoyed talking with you, and I wish you the best of luck.
Same to you, sir.
What time is your plane?
4:05.
Have a good trip, sir.
Thank you.
Where to, Lieutenant?
Just pull around the bend and park.
He says he's going out of town.
I don't believe him.
Yeah.
I planted a seed that has to take.
He is gonna do something in the mountains first.
Pull around the bend and park.
All set, Tommy.
Hey, thanks a lot, Chris.
See you in San Francisco.
Take it easy.
Looks like he's going, all right.
Hey, Columbo!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Come here.
What are you doing out here?
I followed you, sir, to be honest with you.
You see, I told my superiors that someone might be out to get you.
If anything happens to you here in LA, it's going to be my neck.
I thought it was my neck you were interested in.
Oh, of course, yours, too.
But the fact is I'm not going to rest easy until I actually see you on the plane.
I sure do appreciate that.
That's mighty nice of you.
You must have some metal on you, sir.
If you'll just put it in this tray here and come through again.
Okay.
Hmm.
# And the beer I had for breakfast #
##
# It wasn't bad #
## # for dessert #
# Then I fumbled in the closet ##
Thank you, sir.
You are welcome.
##
Hey, Columbo.
Keep law and order while I'm gone.
I'll try, sir.
##
# Stumbled down the stairs to meet the day ##
Hey!
Tell your wife hello for me.
# On a Sunday morning sidewalk #
# I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned ##
Hey, mister.
Oh, L.A.P.D.
Did he go, sir?
He went.
That's him, in that one.
Well, you can't win them all, Lieutenant.
I guess not.
I gotta call in.
Unit 10.
Do you want me to drive you back?
I sent the officer who brought me up here back down for dinner.
I figured you and I would be driving back together.
Nobody followed me up here.
I made sure of that.
That's right, sir.
I was waiting for you up there on that rock.
I gave you an hour to fly to San Francisco on that commuter.
I gave you half an hour for a layoff, and another hour to fly back, and an hour to drive up here.
You knew I was coming up here?
I knew.
Then I didn't know, and then I knew.
When I planted that seed about searching for the thermos bottle,
I called the Rangers and the Boy Scouts,
I knew it was gonna worry you and you'd come out here and look for the parachute.
But when you went to the airport, and you got on the plane, and when I saw that plane fly away,
I thought you were gone.
Then I heard the keys.
Little tinkle of keys.
When you emptied your pockets at the airport, your keys were with your pen, your lighter and something else.
But I remembered the keys had a tag, that tag.
Car rental tag.
Then I knew.
A man drives a rented car, he takes his keys with him on an airplane, doesn't turn them in at the airport,
I got to figure he's coming back.
Aren't you afraid being up here alone with a killer?
No, sir.
No, sir.
I had a feeling that sooner or later...
# Praise the Lord, I saw the light #
Sooner or later you would have confessed even if I hadn't caught you.
# I saw the light, I saw the light #
Yeah, you are right, Lieutenant.
I would have...
# No more darkness, no more night # ...because it was getting to me, and I'm glad it's over.
Listen...
# Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight # ...any man that can sing like that can't be all bad.
# I saw the light, I saw the light #
# No more darkness, no more night #
# Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight #
# Praise the Lord, I saw the light #
d I saw the light d d I saw the light d d No sorrow in sight d [girls clamoring] d Praise the Lord, I saw the light dd
(Tommy) What did he mean, murder?
And why am I talking to somebody from Homicide?
I appreciate it, sir, but, uh, my ears pop in an elevator.
As a matter of fact, I don't even like being this tall.
You know, I'm very happy you told me that.
Why's that?
Well, you know, that's what started your brother-in-law thinking that you had something to do with murdering his sister.
[brakes squeal]
(Phil) Here, I'll park the car for you, Mr. Brown.
(Tommy) Thank you.
How's the box office going for tonight?
All sold out, sir.
That's great!
Ah, thank you, sir.
I want you to check out the sound system, Luke.
I want you to find me an engineer.
Okay.
While I'm performing,
I want you to keep the candy hawkers and the picture sellers out of the aisle.
I don't want them out there when I'm trying to do a show.
I always do.
Yeah, you're really on the ball, ain't you, Luke?
I try, Tommy.

[audience applauding] [audience cheering]
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[girls clamoring]
I'll be right back.
Tommy, kiss me.
Tommy boy, kiss me.
Tommy, kiss me.
Please kiss me, Tommy.
Hmm, maybe later.
Tommy?
[girls groaning]
All right now.
Do you all hear me?
You're going home.
You hear me?
You all go home.
He's not coming out and he's not asking you all in.
So please go home.
[girls exclaiming]
I'm asking you nicely now, go home.
[girls exclaiming]
Officers, you get them.
Clear the crowd.
Hurry them along officers, please.
Thank you.
[sighing]
Sis.
Yes?
When you gonna tell me what you got on Tommy that makes him toe the line like that?
Well, I'll tell you when I think it's fit for you to know.
Shucks, Sis, if anything ever happens to you--
Well, the good Lord will see that it doesn't.
[sighs]
How about later?
(man) Not so good.
It's coming out the teletype now from our Los Angeles weather station.
Coastal fog moving in after midnight and, uh, they're forecasting zero ceiling and visibility in the Basin and foothills.
But you can beat it if you take off in the next half hour.
Thanks.
I'd like to persuade you people to come back, Mrs. Brown.
Hell, we can sell out Tommy Brown for damn near a month here.
I don't hold with profanity, Mr. Dodds.
Oh, I'm sorry.
To the Lost Soul Crusade,
"hell" and "damnation" are not words to be taken lightly.
Yes, ma'am, but what about extending?
We're booked into Los Angeles this week.
And then we have special ceremonies for the groundbreaking at the tabernacle site on Tuesday.
Are you folks really spending $5 million to build it?
It'll be the finest temple to the glory of the Almighty in America.
The first $1 million is already in escrow.
Mrs. Brown, your end of tonight's take is $30,000, we took in about $50,000.
Fine.
Will you be waiting around for it?
Luke will.
But I'll want to check the figures myself as soon they're ready.
Yes, ma'am.
Won't be long.
When are we taking off?
(Tommy) I want to talk to you.
I'm listening.
Alone.
Well, now, if what you want to talk about is what you're all the time talking about,
Maryann can stay.
She's got a lot to do with it.
We got a good thing going, Edna, and it would be crazy to bust it up.
Bust it up?
I'm not aiming to.
I am.
You've got $1 million in escrow to build a tabernacle and you can't get the rest without me.
I know that, Tommy.
And I was thinking, maybe you and I could compromise, Edna.
You take half the money for the Crusade and I'll take half.
Every penny goes to the Crusade until that tabernacle is built.
You can push a man too far, Edna.
I'm being used and I don't like it.
Other singers drive around in Ferraris, Rolls,
I don't even own a car.
It's me they come to hear, Edna.
It's my records they buy.
It was me who got you a parole to get you away from that Arkansas prison farm or you'd still be rotting there.
I kept my part of the deal, Edna.
I married you and I've been faithful to you.
Because I watch you.
You are a lustful sinner, Tommy.
I saw the expression on your face when you were gonna kiss that lost child.
If it wasn't for me you'd be using the Crusade to lure her to some motel right now, or into the back of your car if you had one.
If I had one.
May God forgive me for letting a devil help me build a temple.
And what if your devil quits, what are you going to do?
Why now, it would all go down the drain, and you and me with it.
I seem to remember a little Bible myself, Edna.
"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord."
It was also written:
"The Lord works in mysterious ways, His wonders to perform."
I am his instrument and I would punish you, Tommy.
Maryann and me.
Those people out there just might not believe you and Maryann.
How about those motels where you register as a father and daughter with Maryann?
(Edna) How old were you then, child?
16.
16.
All those phony names, the dark glasses that haven't been seen through yet.
Of course, you weren't so well-known then.
But your handwriting has got to be on some of those registers.
And one of those clerks could recognize Maryann, and you, too, if she pointed the finger.
Hasn't been but three years, Tommy, but I've read the law.
The statute of limitations hasn't run out yet on the Mann Act.
Statutory rape.
Oh, no.
You won't quit the Crusade, Tommy.
You're a sanctimonious hypocrite of a bible-spouting blackmailer and I've given you your last chance to be fair.
Your insults and threats don't scare me.
[knocking on door]
Uh, Mr. Dodds is ready for you, sis.
Right.
I won't be long.
Take your time.
We can't fly now, anyway.
Oh.
Why not?
Weather's bad in LA.
Improving after midnight.
We're not going to take a chance on leaving until after midnight.
I'm gonna grab a couple of hours of shut-eye.
Well, now, if you're thinking of looking for that child that came to the door, you forget it.
Because I'll be right back, to make sure that all you're grabbing is shut-eye.
You want me to fly back to LA with you?
No, I want you to ride on the bus, Luke.
There's mountains between here and LA and that old crate don't climb so good with four people on board.
Making another hint for a new plane.
Tommy, you're wasting your breath.
Wasting my breath when I sing, too, considering what I get out of it.
Hey, Luke, take this guitar on the bus with you.
You want me to put it in with the baggage?
No, I want you to put it on the seat right by you.
Don't put it under anything, and don't let that guitar get broken, Luke.
Okay, Tommy.
dd[music playing on radio] [car doors closing]
Hi, Mr. Brown.
Mrs. Brown.
(Edna) Evening.
It sure is good to see you, sir.
Are we all fuelled up?
Uh, yes, sir.
All systems go, Mr. Brown.
Sure.
It's good taste you got in music there.
Uh, yes, sir.
Oh, I sure wish I could have gotten off to go to that concert of yours tonight.
What's your name?
Uh, Jeff.
Well, Jeff, next time I play Bakersfield,
I'll get you a couple of passes.
Oh, I sure do appreciate that, sir.
Sure, I'll be glad to it.
[laughing] Oh, Mr. Brown.
All right, stow my luggage for me, will you?
Oh, sir, right away, sir.
(Edna) Now, now, hurry, will you?
Please.
Hey, Jeff.
Yes, sir.
These are keys to my rent-a-car.
It's got plenty of time left on it so if you'd like to drive around awhile, go ahead.
Impress your girlfriend.
Oh, I sure do appreciate that, sir.
All right.
You'll do no such thing.
You'll turn that car in right away and I've checked the mileage.
Uh, yes, ma'am.
Oh, $5.
I sure do appreciate that, sir.
All right, don't...
Get a hand there.
Watch your feet.
There.
Ah.
[engine starting]
Tommy, we are cold.
Heater is busted.
I got some coffee here.
Hot coffee.
Hold it for me, darling.
[sighs]
Tom, this is the most horrible coffee I've ever tasted.
Well, it's better than nothing.
[metallic clinking]
[engine roaring]
[grunts]
[car approaching]
[grunting]
[fire crackling]
[grunting]
Sorry.
You can't come into this area.
I'm from the Los Angeles Police Department.
Lt. Columbo.
Who's in charge here?
Mr. Pangborn.
Over there, being interviewed.
(Hal) We're speaking with Mr. Roland Pangborn of the air safety division of the National Transportation Safety Board.
Mr. Pangborn is heading up the investigation of this very tragic air crash.
Do you have an opinion as to the cause of the crash, Mr. Pangborn?
(Pangborn) Well, Hal, just the statement the pilot made at the hospital.
He had a total electrical system's failure, and his, uh, instruments and his radio were out.
However, I will say, unofficially, that, uh, one of our main problems in this--
(cameraman) Save it.
What's the matter?
This fellow's been wandering around in this shot and it's getting very distracting.
Hal, I'm sorry.
Would you mind, just for a moment, please?
I'm sorry.
I've got you in the wide shot.
I think we can pick him up in a single.
Fine.
Uh, Mr. Pangborn, you were about to give us an unofficial opinion of the cause of the crash.
Uh, excuse me, this is one of the big problems we have at these crash sites:
[camera humming] curiosity seekers.
Hold it for a minute, will you?
(Pangborn) Sir!
I'll have to ask you to leave.
L.A.P.D., Lt. Columbo.
I just didn't want to identify myself in front of the reporter.
Why not?
Well, like you were saying, better to be unofficial until you get the facts.
Well, just what facts have you got?
I don't have anything, just what I read in the morning newspaper.
I think it's a miracle this guy got out of the plane.
You know, it was a relief to my wife.
She's a big fan of this fellow's.
Knows all his albums.
Can you imagine getting out of this thing alive?
It's unusual.
But not unheard of.
I'm not clear why there's police interest in this crash, Lieutenant.
Ah, you see, that's what I mean, you know.
As soon as you mention that you're from the police, then right away, everybody starts speculating, especially when you say you're from Homicide.
Homicide?
Why is Homicide interested in this, Lieutenant?
We got a complaint from a member of the family,
Mrs. Brown's brother.
What do you mean, complaint?
Nothing definite.
Just suspicion of foul play.
But I heard what you just said over there.
It was electrical system failure.
That's what the pilot said.
And that's what you fellas will probably call the probable cause?
Contributing.
Yeah, I'd say.
Unofficially, though.
It'll still probably be that old, reliable standby:
pilot error.
Almost always is.
You see, Brown was not instrument-rated and he flew into minimal weather and he lost his orientation.
Got the ship into a stall configuration and just spun in.
But that's always been and still is, as a matter of fact, the number one causative factor in private flying accidents of this type.
Sometimes augmented by a blood-alcohol count.
(Hal) Mr. Pangborn, could you come back here just for a moment?
And bring your investigating team.
We're losing the light, it'll just take a moment.
We'd like to get this--this film to the lab.
Why don't you finish up?
Fellas, just come around and stand over on either side of me, if you will, please.
Mr. Pangborn?
(cameraman) Bring him in.
Ready?
Okay, get ready to roll.
Okay, that's it.
Rolling.
All set?
All right.
Fine.
(cameraman) Hold it.
I'm--I'm sorry.
Look, just stand by with the lights.
You looking for something specific?
Uh, was that checked?
The engine?
No, but it will be.
No, I didn't mean the engine.
What you said before,
Mr. Brown's blood count for alcohol.
At the hospital, at our request.
But no.
He was cold sober, no drugs, nothing.
Mmm-hmm.
Listen, if the engine went into a stall, would that be considered pilot error?
No, i-it's not the engine.
Lieutenant, when we speak of a stall, we mean stalling the wing.
Well, that's getting the ship into too steep a climb.
And that is easy to do in tight weather with a blacked-out instrument panel.
No, he just shouldn't have been flying around these mountains at low altitude without an instrument rating in the kind of weather we had last night.
Um, Bakersfield to LA is an hour.
You know, by plane.
Couldn't he have gotten that weather ahead of time?
Told me he did when I talked to him at the hospital.
But he'd made the flight lots of times and he felt he could sneak through okay.
[sighs]
(Hal) Mr. Pangborn, please, we're losing the light.
Just for one moment, please, sir.
Why don't you finish it up, get it over with?
All right, roll it again now.
Let's go.
(cameraman) Keeping it tight.
Mr. Pangborn.
Rolling.
As you can see, Mr. Pangborn and his staff are very busy people and we have to interrupt our interview from time to time.
However, Mr. Pangborn has rejoined us again, and with his permission, we'd like to continue.
(Pangborn) Go right ahead.
I think the public is very interested in these aircraft accident investigation techniques, Mr. Pangborn.
We'd certainly like to follow through on this one.
Would it be possible for our crew to cover some of your procedures?
Oh, I think it could be arranged.
Now, if one of our questions is out of line, sir, just say the word and we'll withdraw it.
Thank you.
I'll give you the regulation "no comment."
That's fair enough.
First, I'd like to ask if you have the pilot's statement, why is it necessary to make any investigation at all?
Well, that's purely a routine.
There's no reflection at all on this pilot.
As a matter of fact, pilots are a very special breed of artists.
You know, it's called the art of flying.
And, uh, many of them are not really the strong or silent types that are generally depicted.
Some of them are quite emotional.
They tend to blame themselves for a crash even when it might have been due to circumstances beyond their control, you see.
You mean there might have been some sort of mechanical failure that even the pilot was unaware of?
Oh, exactly.
We'll take all of the engine, electronic and structural parts of the wreckage back to our hangar, and give it a thorough examination.
We give it an X-ray, chemical analysis, microscopic metallurgical testing, that sort of thing.
So, what we have is the pilot's statement which makes our job easier.
A lot easier, and the situation a lot clearer.
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Pangborn.
This is Hal Fischer, in the Los Angeles mountains.
Okay, that's a wrap.
(cameraman) Got it.
(Pangborn) He's saying he felt he could make it.
The same old story, the same old fatal results.
Were the two women sitting in the back?
Right.
Are these the seat-belts for the two backseats?
Yeah.
I noticed they weren't jarred open by the impact of the crash.
They never are.
Well, that explains it.
Explains what?
Why the pilot was thrown clear and the two women weren't.
[chuckles]
I'm sorry, l--I just don't follow.
I noticed the pilot's seatbelt.
Yeah?
Not fastened.
I hadn't noticed.
My God, you're right.
It must have been open before the crash.
Oh, you got one of those, too?
Well, I'm just gonna make a note and ask Brown why his belt wasn't fastened.
All right.
Gee, that reminds me,
I gotta make the same note.
In this case, it probably saved his life.
Generally, the pi...
the passengers sitting after the cockpit have a better chance of survival in a crash of this type.
You got a minute, sir?
Yeah, sure.
Right this way.
What's this?
That's a pilot's navigation kit.
They keep their charts in it.
Uh, radio frequency, pamphlets,
Iot of different things.
Gee, that's funny.
What?
No ashes.
I beg your pardon?
No ashes.
Seems empty.
Well, he could have taken the charts out and laid them on the unoccupied co-pilot's seat.
But those ashes would be in among all those other ashes.
Ah, that would explain that.
You know something, Lieutenant,
I could use a man like you on my team.
It's really nothing but detective work.
Oh, no, thank you very much.
You fellas here, you have to fly.
Sure, we're all pilots.
Oh, no, not for me.
Thank you very much.
I wouldn't qualify for that.
Why?
We'll teach you.
I appreciate it, sir, but, uh, my ears pop in an elevator.
As a matter of fact, I don't even like being this tall.
How do you do, sir?
My name is Mr. Grindell.
How do you do?
Are you a relative of Mrs. Brown?
No, I'm just here to see a relative--
I see, you are a friend of the family?
Oh, I'm sorry, you are a bit late.
You missed a lovely service.
Excuse me, sir.
Uh, Mr. Brown sang several popular hymns.
Rock of Ages--
I'm not a friend of the family.
Actually, I'm a policeman.
Lt. Columbo, Homicide.
I beg your pardon.
I'm here to see Mr. Luke Baskin.
Yes.
He's paying his last respects before the bodies are--are shipped out to Nashville.
Uh, he's taking it a bit hard, you know.
But, uh, he will be out shortly.
Oh.
Well, maybe I'll just wait out here.
Fine.
Fine.
Lieutenant, this is one of my cards.
We handled all the arrangements here.
Uh, excuse me.
Thank you.
Oh.
Um, I'm a great admirer of the police department, you know.
Uh, I didn't know, but I'm always glad to hear that.
Why shouldn't you hear of it?
[sighing] After all, you men are so ready to give your life, uh, to save ours.
Well, uh, let's hope it doesn't come up too often.
Yes, yes, yes, but it does, doesn't it?
Especially in these violent times.
Uh, it's uh...
Just this morning a-at breakfast with my dear wife Martha,
I glanced in the papers.
And l--I noted that the rate of the police mortality is just...
It's shocking.
I mean it is just...
Well, you must be aware of that.
Well, we don't like to think about it too often.
But one should think of it, uh, shouldn't one?
Well, you know, I guess it's the kind of thing that you don't do anything about until you actually have to.
But if you need a funeral, uh, then you are not in condition to do anything about it, you see.
[laughing]
All right, I see what you mean.
Have you made plans for your own departure from this mortal sphere?
No.
Huh?
[chuckling] No, I haven't.
Yeah.
I mean, it's not like, uh...
It's not the kind of thing where you make a reservation or buy a ticket.
Yes, but yet, a little foresight, for your dear ones I speak, uh--uh, would prevent, uh, trouble and, uh, expense--expense.
Excuse me just a moment.
Lieutenant, this is our brochure.
Now, from here, uh, you could choose, uh, anything within your own means, uh--uh, from among a--a large variety of plans that we have here.
Now, this, for instance--
Well, l--I appreciate it very much but my wife does all the shopping in the family.
She'd be very upset if I bought anything, you know, without talking to her about it first.
Of course.
Of course.
It's very nice, husband and wife to decide in this.
Can we, uh, make an appointment?
That'd be nice.
I couldn't talk to her about this, Mr. Grindell.
She'd think I was working on a dangerous case.
She cries easily.
She cries when she loses at bowling, you know.
You're a hard sell, Lieutenant, huh?
Well, I'm sorry.
Actually, you know, I was just here... (Luke) Oh, hi, Lieutenant.
Oh, hello, Mr. Baskin.
Did you find out anything?
Uh, thank you very much, sir.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Gentlemen, excuse me.
Did you ever see Mr. Brown's navigation kit?
Sure, all the time.
Were you familiar with its contents?
Yeah, just a bunch of maps and charts.
You've seen these maps and charts?
Yeah.
Did you see them the day of the crash?
Uh, well, no, I didn't, uh, open the kit that day.
You mean, you had the kit in your hand that day?
Yeah.
I carried it from the plane to the car.
Was it heavy?
No, no more than usual.
Hmm.
Did you carry it back from the car to the plane when they left?
No, Tommy did.
Why?
You on to something, Lieutenant?
No, I don't think so, sir.
No.
Look, I'm not very smart, and I don't know how he did it,
I just know that somehow he did.
'Cause he hated my sister.
He never loved her.
He just used her.
Yes, sir.
You've told me that.
That doesn't explain why he would kill her.
She had something on him.
What?
I don't know.
She wouldn't tell me.
Hmm.
I believe you're very sincere, sir.
But there's just no proof of anything.
Look, you don't know Tommy Brown like I do.
You've got to question him.
I'm going to do that.
But you must understand, it's just going to be a formality.
Then do it.
Do it now.
Do it today.
Yes, sir.
I don't think that today would be the right time.
It's too close--
Lieutenant, I want you to see what Tommy Brown's like.
I want you to talk to him.
Would you do that for me, please, as a personal favor?
Today?
Please?
[car door closes]
Uh, all right.
[car engine starting]
I'm coming with you.
dd[Tommy singing]
d And it took me back to something d [girls laughing] d that I lost somewhere d
(Luke) See what I mean, Lieutenant?
He couldn't wait.
Rented this place while he was still in the hospital.
$2,000 a month.
What?
You know, there's no law against that, Mr. Baskin.
Listen to all that going around out yonder.
My sister ain't even in her grave yet.
But there's no law against that, either, Mr. Baskin.
Maybe it's not a good idea for you to see him right now.
Why not?
I'm still working for him.
You know, I'll have to tell him you're the one who made the complaint.
Good.
I wanna see the look on his face when--
Now, just a minute.
Now, listen to me.
When I talk to him, I'm gonna have to talk to him alone.
That's the only right way to do it.
And if you're gonna cause trouble--
I won't.
I promise you, I won't do that.
Okay.

Make yourself at home.
d Half as lonesome as the sound d
What is that?
Chili.
Yeah, looks good.
Have some.
Think it's all right?
Hmm.
d And Sunday mornin' coming' down dd [people applauding]
Say, that's delicious.
I never tasted chili like that before.
That's a special recipe.
Made out of squirrel meat.
That good, ain't it?
Hmm.
Yeah, that explains it.
Hey, Luke.
I thought you were ridin' back with us.
Where have you been?
I've been to get the cops to find out how you killed Edna.
You gone crazy?
You did it.
You know you did it.
You killed both of them.
You're fired!
Get out of here!
[grunts]
You crazy?
Get him out of here!
What's the matter with you?
Give me that.
You crazy?
[groaning] Get him out.
[panting]
Boy.
Mr. Brown, I'm terribly sorry about this.
Who are you?
I'm Lt. Columbo, I'm from the L.A.P.D., Homicide.
Homicide?
What's he been telling you about me?
Well, if we could just talk privately.
There's nothing to get excited about.
Just wanna ask some routine questions.
[panting]
There ain't no need for everything to stop.
I'll be right back.
Let me see that guitar.
If he's busted that guitar,
I'll bust his neck.
Come on in here.
Nothing to get excited about, folks.
[people murmuring]
Mr. Brown will be right out.
What did he mean, murder?
And why am I talking to somebody from Homicide?
I feel terrible about this, sir.
I mean, an awful thing that was.
And, uh, there was just no way for me to prevent your brother-in-law from coming here.
Maybe I could have anticipated--
Okay!
Just tell me what's it all about.
What's he saying?
It's nothing to get excited about, sir, believe me.
You just have to understand that, uh, when a member of the family makes a complaint, well, we just have to go through certain formalities, ask questions, and, uh, make out a report--
And I guess this, all this, looks kind of bad, huh?
This--this big house.
This party going on and everything?
No, sir.
No, sir.
It's kind of refreshing.
You see, in my line of work, homicide, somebody is always, well, dead.
That's the only way to put it.
I mean, they don't even call us in unless that's what it is, somebody dead.
So, naturally, I see a lot of grief.
Now look, Lieutenant,
I'm not gonna try to tell you that Edna and I didn't quarrel.
You can't-
- You can't go through a day with Edna without quarreling.
You didn't know Edna.
The Crusade.
I was all for the Crusade.
It's just that I thought a little something ought to go to me for what I do, you know.
I give it full, I give it all my time.
The dirty hotel rooms...
Mr. Brown.
...the dirty dressing rooms, the stale coffee--
Mr. Brown.
I'm not here to pry into your personal life.
My personal life is an open book.
Everybody knows I've done time.
Yes, sir.
But what you've done since you've gotten out has been an inspiration to a lot of people.
Then what are you bugging me for?
Well, like I said, just ask a few routine questions.
Well, I can come back another time when you're more settled.
Go ahead.
Ask your questions.
Are you sure it's all right?
Get it over with.
You don't mind?
Go right ahead.
I'll try and make it very fast.
I was up there at the crash site and I was talking to, uh, that fellow Mr. Pangborn, up there.
You want some coffee?
No, thank you very much.
We were both wondering why your seatbelt wasn't fastened at the time of the crash.
Oh, that?
Well, you see, when the power went off, the lights went out.
And I reached across to the glove compartment to try to get a flashlight.
And to do that, I had to unbuckle my seatbelt.
That's when I lost control.
Well, that explains it.
I'll tell Mr. Pangborn that so that he won't bother you about it, too.
Thanks.
What else can l tell you now?
You have a pencil?
No.
That's all right, I'll remember.
Oh, here we are.
The navigation kit.
What about it?
There were no ashes in it, you see.
So, we were, uh, we were wondering what happened to the charts and, uh, and the maps that were in it.
Well, when the power went off, the defroster quit working, you see.
So, I slid open the window to try to see where I was goin' and the suction s-s-sucked all the maps and papers and everything right out of the window.
Big suction.
I'll tell that to Mr. Pangborn, too.
We were both wondering.
Thanks.
I--I appreciate that.
That does it.
You sure made me move, Mr. Brown.
I never asked questions this fast before in my life.
I always think it's kind of impolite to keep firing questions at people.
If that's your job, that's what you ought to do.
Mmm-hmm.
Sorry about what happened out there.
And I sure hope your guitar is all right.
It's a beauty.
Yeah.
dd[playing]
Not another guitar in the world with a tone like that.
It's a great guitar.
Handmade.
When I take an airliner,
I get an extra seat and sit it right beside me.
No kidding.
Yeah.
Lucky thing it wasn't on that plane with you last night.
Yeah, I know, that was a break, all right.
I'd been worried about that.
Worried about crashing with it?
No, about, uh, about it coming unglued, or cracking it at high altitudes in an unpressurized plane.
Look at this guitar.
You see the...
It's put together with a very special glue.
Different pieces of wood.
It looks like one piece, but feel that belly.
Feel how smooth it is on that back there.
Well, the changes in pressure and altitude can affect a good guitar like that.
Ruin the tone.
So I told Luke to put it on the bus.
You know, I'm very happy you told me that.
Why's that?
Well, you know, that's what started your brother-in-law thinking that you had something to do with murdering his sister.
The fact that you parted with your guitar.
He said that was the first time you ever did that.
Then I'm glad I told you, too.
That winds it up.
We'll probably just go along with Mr. Pangborn's report.
Hmm.
Mr. Pangborn's report will make me look bad enough.
That's a lousy piece of flying I did.
Well, let's hope I stumble onto something so it doesn't look so much like pilot error.
And if I do, I'll let you know.
You're not finished?
Oh, just a couple of things for my own report down at headquarters.
Nothing to worry you about, Mr. Brown.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
I appreciate your taking the time.
Glad to.
Let me know when I can help you.
[grunting]
Right this way, sir.
Just step right on that seat, Lieutenant.
Sir.
Just step right on the seat there, sir.
Just watch your step, sir.
You all right, Lieutenant?
[clears throat]
Thank you, sir.
[clears throat] dd[radio playing]
Excuse me, uh...
Uh, excuse me.
Yes, sir.
Uh, I'm looking for someone who might have been around the night Tommy Brown took off.
Who are you?
That's a good question.
Uh, police.
Yes, sir.
That'd be Jeff.
He was on duty that night.
Thank you very much.
[sighing]
Excuse me.
Yeah?
Uh, L.A.P.D.
Yes, sir.
I'm investigating the Tommy Brown airplane crash.
Oh, yeah.
I sure was sorry to hear about that.
You're a fan of his?
Yes, sir.
You?
Uh, well, my wife more than me, but I'm getting there.
I was wondering, could you give me any information about that flight?
Oh, well, I, uh, I saw them off, but I don't know anything about that crash.
Right.
Of course.
You know, we've got to check out all these small little details.
They don't mean nothing.
So, uh, now what did you...
You say you saw them off.
What did you do?
Well, you know, I helped with the luggage, uh, pulled out the chocks, that sort of thing.
Luggage.
What luggage?
Well, um, the ladies had a couple overnight bags.
And uh, Mr. Brown didn't have nothing but his navigation kit.
Some gum?
No.
Thank you very much.
You handled the luggage?
Uh, yes, sir.
Put it in the luggage compartment back of the cabin.
Did you, uh...
You notice anything unusual about the luggage?
Unusual?
Was it extra heavy or light, anything like that?
Oh.
Um, no.
Just luggage.
And the navigation kit, was it heavy or light?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Mr. Brown put that aboard himself.
In the cabin?
Yes, sir.
Um, on the co-pilot's seat.
[clanking] [chuckles]
Wouldn't do much good in the luggage compartment unless you was a bird.
[Jeff laughs]
I guess so.
So the only thing that was in the cabin was the passengers and the navigation kit?
Yeah.
That's it.
Oh, well, the thermos bottle.
That's probably nothing.
W-W-What do you mean, thermos bottle?
Most pilots carry a thermos of coffee aboard.
Was the thermos bottle in the navigation kit?
Uh, no, sir.
Most likely wouldn't be enough room for it, with all the charts and stuff.
No, Mr. Brown just, uh, put it on the co-pilot's seat next to the kit.
You've been a big help.
I have?
dd[playing]
That's nice.
Tina, I'd like you to take the arrangements down to the arranger.
Be sure we get them back in time, all right?
Then I want you to make me out a big, long list of things that I can do for you for being so nice to Tommy Brown.
You afraid of me?
Uh, no.
Every time I get close, you start backing up.
I--I guess I'm just afraid of myself.
Is that all?
It's just so soon about your wife.
Hmm.
I understand.
But do you understand that Edna and I didn't love each other, ever?
Don't say that.
[doorbell chiming]
Come on in, it ain't locked.
Lt. Columbo.
Come right in, rest yourself.
I'm not interrupting anything?
No.
Come in.
Hey, Tina, you better take care of those errands, okay?
And don't forget the last thing on the list.
What can I get you, Lieutenant?
How about some brandy or bourbon?
No, you look more like a beer man.
Thank you, sir, but I'm on duty.
Oh, yeah.
I almost forgot.
Hey, you hop around pretty good on that.
Well, it takes more than a busted leg to keep me down.
That lovely girl.
Who?
Tina?
She really is.
She's beautiful.
And she's been a great help to me through this time.
She admires you a lot.
I could see that.
Now, come on, Lieutenant, don't tell me they got you back out here chasing after Luke's daydream.
I'm afraid so, sir.
If it was up to me, I'd forget about it.
I'd go on to something else.
You know what the problem is?
You're a celebrity.
Because of you, my boss, he won't let me close up this case until I've covered everything.
Every loose end has got to be tied up.
It'll make you crazy.
So that's the problem.
That's a crying shame, it really is.
A man with your talent...
Real killers loose out there.
And they got you chasing smoke.
What are you going to do?
That's the job, right?
You take the good with the bad.
Uh, that reminds me.
Uh, you could help me clear up some things.
Sure.
I'd be glad to.
But let me get you something to eat.
You look hungry to me.
Oh, no, please.
Thank you very much.
I just had lunch.
How about some coffee?
I had it with my lunch.
You're shaming me now, Lieutenant.
You just won't let me do anything for you.
Well, actually, sir, there is something you can do for me.
Uh, you can answer a few of these questions.
Sure.
I'd be glad to.
First of all, uh, the thermos.
The one you took on the plane.
What about it?
Would you mind telling me, sir, what you had in it?
Just some coffee.
Coffee.
Why?
What does that matter?
Well, they couldn't find it.
The thermos.
At the crash site, couldn't find it.
I checked with Mr. Pangborn.
So?
Well, you see, everything else in the plane was accounted for.
Well, does it really matter what happened to a thermos bottle?
Oh, I'm sure it doesn't make a difference at all, but, you see, uh, like I was saying earlier, see that's the kind of loose end that, uh,
I got to tie up, those tiny little things.
Otherwise, it won't let me close the book on this case.
Yeah.
I understand.
T-T-That's my problem.
I see what you mean.
Well, we'll just have to come up with the right answer for them.
You know, something to make them happy.
Yes.
I--l, uh, I just don't know what to write.
Uh, I'll help you all I can.
Well, if you could come up with something, sir,
I'd certainly appreciate it.
Hey, why don't you just tell them that the thermos burned up in the plane crash, like it probably did.
Well, you know, I thought about that.
But, uh, I checked with the lab.
And, uh, you see, a thermos wouldn't be consumed by fire.
It's metal inside and glass.
Yeah.
That's a tough one, all right.
[stammering] Yes.
I just can't come up with an answer.
Well, you think about this.
I was thrown clear in the crash.
I got a busted leg out of the deal.
But I was thrown clear.
And something as light as a thermos could be thrown hundreds of feet.
Maybe it was thrown clear.
Thrown clear?
Yeah.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Thrown clear.
[laughs]
I knew sooner or later,
I was going to get to help you some way.
Not bad.
Yeah.
I think they'll buy that.
Okay.
Listen.
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
Glad to help.
Yeah.
You've been a big help.
Appreciate the time.
Okay.
All right.
Oh.
I don't know what's the matter with me.
[clicking tongue]
You know, the last time I was here, I forgot to ask the question, too.
What's the matter with me?
Um, where did you first learn how to fly?
Lieutenant, I thought you knew my whole life history by now.
Oh, no.
No, uh.
You know, people think we have all kinds of records on microfilms.
All we got to do is push a button and...
Well, don't you?
Yes, we do, but not everything.
Well, I learned to fly over 20 years ago in the Air Force, a little.
I learned to fly a little.
A little.
Well, I got to admit.
I washed out of cadets.
[laughing] Washed right flat out.
Of course, I got a civilian private license after the Korean War.
Were you in that one?
Yeah.
Were you?
Yeah.
I was in that one.
But not in the Air Force.
No kidding.
Let me guess what you were in.
[chuckling]
M.P.
K.P. mostly.
[laughing]
Where'd they put you after you washed out as a cadet?
Oh, man, you know the service.
Whatever bad was going around, that's what I got.
Picking up butts, latrine duty, running errands for the C.O., whatever.
Oh, man, that service life was something.
Anything else?
[telephone ringing] No, sir.
That should about do it.
Thank you.
Go ahead.
You can take that.
I'm finished.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, hello.
All right.
Put him on.
Hello, Sid, this is Tommy.
No.
You heard right, Sid.
We're stopping the project.
We're stopping the building on the tabernacle.
I don't know.
Can't say.
Just pay everybody off up to date.
Tell them we'll get back to them, okay?
Right.
Bye.
(Columbo) Excuse me, sir.
Lieutenant, if that police career of yours ever fizzles out, you could always make it as a cat burglar.
Oh, sorry.
You know what happened.
I saw this note that I made here that I meant to ask you about.
Ask away, little buddy.
You know, the reason I think I forgot was because it was filed under "pilot."
You know, for pilot error.
Mmm-hmm.
What about it?
Uh, did you call in for the weather before you made that flight?
I sure did.
Every pilot does.
Well, according to the Bakersfield Weather Bureau, they anticipated a low ceiling in Los Angeles.
If you'd left an hour earlier, you would have missed it.
Well, you see, I left later because of the audiences at Bakersfield.
They just wouldn't let me off-stage.
They love that music in Bakersfield.
Oh, they sure do.
I know that for a fact.
But your brother-in-law, he told me that you took a nap.
Yeah, I always take a nap before I fly late at night, especially after a performance.
I was wiped out.
I know those desk jockeys downtown are about to drive you crazy giving you a bad time.
I know how bad you hate to keep asking all those stupid questions that they send you out here to ask.
I want you to tell them one thing for me.
All those loose ends that they think they are tying up are going to go nowhere, you see, because Tommy Brown was on that plane himself when it crashed and if I'd been up to no good,
I wouldn't risk my own neck in the process.
I'm going to make that point very clear to them, sir.
[clearing throat]
Hey, Columbo, I want you tell those people down at your office one thing for me, that I got nothing to hide.
And I guess you overheard me on the phone.
Overheard you on the phone?
Oh, no, sir.
No.
But I knew you were stopping the project.
I spoke to the architects this morning.
However, it's very helpful to know your reasoning.
Thank you.
(Columbo) One of ours, sir?
Colonel.
Oh, sorry.
747.
I'd like to land one of these babies.
This must be quite a letdown for you.
What is?
R.O.T.C.
There's a job to be done, Lieutenant, and I'm the man to do it.
Brown.
Brown.
Brown, Thomas.
Oh, sure.
Never forget the lads who served under me.
If not by name, by face.
He's out of Vietnam, but I remember the face.
He served in your outfit in Korea.
Oh.
What's happened to him?
He's Tommy Brown now.
Tommy Brown.
He's a big star.
Really?
Made it in the movies, huh?
No, sir.
Country and Western music.
Entertainment.
He's very big.
Oh.
Not that, uh, twist stuff?
That degenerate--
No, sir.
Folk music.
Tommy Brown, he's a singer.
Good.
Just as long as he isn't a pilot.
Washed out as a cadet as I recall.
Transferred to my outfit.
Did you read about that private plane crash the other night?
Oh, yeah.
He was the pilot.
The guy that got thrown clear?
Yes, sir.
Never made the connection.
What did he do in your outfit, sir?
Parachute rigging.
You mean he ran a machine which rigged the parachute.
(Colonel) Not on your life, Lieutenant.
It was done by hand.
A man folds his own.
Some things in life don't change, Lieutenant.
Yes, sir.
May I use your telephone?
Keep it short.
Will you?
Never know when there might be an alert.
Absolutely.
I want the Medical Examiner's office.
Lt. Columbo.
Columbo.
I'll wait.
It's really for official business.
Do they still make them out of silk?
Speaking to me?
"Hit the silk." Is that just an--
It's just an expression.
The old barnstorming days.
Nylon. 60 square yards of it, and a parachute personnel standard M-4.
How fast does that bring a man down?
20 feet per second.
Average.
Isn't that pretty fast?
There's a proper way to land, Lieutenant.
Hello?
The Medical Examiner.
Lt. Columbo.
How big is this flag?
It's not a flag, Lieutenant, it's a banner.
Eagles and stars rampant on a field of blue.
The official emblem of the United States Air Force.
How big is it?
27 square feet, why?
How much is that in square yards?
You ought to know that, Lieutenant.
Three square yards.
A parachute is 60 square yards?
Right.
20 times bigger than this?
That's elementary, Lieutenant.
Hello.
Yes, I am.
Hello?
Doctor.
Yes.
This is Lt. Columbo.
I want to order an autopsy on two deceased, already interred.
Mrs. Edna Brown and Miss Maryann Cobb.
d Just like a blind man I wandered astray d d Straight is the gate and narrow the way d d Then like the blind man that got back his sight d d Praise the Lord, I saw the light d
Hey, Columbo.
Come on in.
Join the session.
I didn't ruin on the record or anything?
There was no light on so I just came in.
Playback.
It's a concert we did last night.
How do you like it?
Oh, good.
d Praise the Lord d
We were there.
At the concert?
My wife and I.
We were there.
d Clouds covered me.
I had no idea d
Hey!
Hey!
You're really coming on, Lieutenant.
d Then came the sunrise and rolled back the night d
Bring it down a couple of points there, will you, Bill?
d I saw the light d d I saw the light d d No more darkness, no more night d d Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight d d Praise the Lord d
What's the matter?
d I saw the light d d Just like a blind man d
You opened your concert with that song.
Yeah, I closed my show with that song, too.
Number one on the charts.
Hey, there you go, Lieutenant.
d that got back his sight d
You don't like it?
d I saw the light dd
No, oh, it's very good, very popular.
You know, I hear it coming out of cars, out of storefronts.
One kid had it coming out of his pocket.
Right here.
But, uh, the sound is different here.
And I noticed last night at the concert--
(Tommy) Yeah, live audience.
That's why the different sound, it's recorded live.
The one you've been hearing around town is a studio recording we did a while back.
Oh.
Oh, that explains it.
You know, little buddy, there's a question I'd like to ask you.
You ordered my wife's body dug up, right?
That's correct, sir.
Both bodies.
And autopsies performed?
Yes, sir.
Expecting to find what?
Mr. Brown, I don't think this is the--
That's quite all right, if you don't mind answering that question.
Just what were you expecting to find?
I don't know.
It's not an unusual police procedure.
After an air crash?
Very often, to find out if the pilot had a heart attack or to find out if there was any evidence of drug--
Lieutenant, I was the pilot and I'm very much alive.
Yes, sir.
And that air safety guy, what's his name?
Mr. Pangborn?
He ordered all kinds of blood tests run.
Yes, sir, they were all negative and the EKG, your heart, that was normal.
Which should make you feel very good.
And the autopsy showed nothing unusual?
No, sir.
Nothing unusual.
I think I could have told you that, Lieutenant.
Of course, when I say nothing unusual, what I mean is that, uh, under, you know, normal circumstances, there would be nothing unusual.
Just what are you trying to say, Lieutenant?
Barbiturates, sir.
We found evidence of barbiturates in both women.
And, uh, according to their religious beliefs, they were prohibited from taking any drugs or stimulants.
That's true.
But they used to get airsick.
So they took an airsickness pill.
Yes, sir.
But these barbiturates were sleeping pills.
Sleeping pills work just like airsickness pills sometimes, Lieutenant.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Well, that must explain that.
Oh, thank you very much.
(man) Tommy, gonna feed you the eight-track now.
dd[music playing]
Hey, Bill, kill it.
[music stops]
Anything else, Lieutenant?
No, sir.
Oh, uh...
Could I have a tape of that concert?
Be in the stores, a couple of months.
No, what I meant was could I have an advance copy?
Why not?
Thank you very much.
May I...
Are your hands clean?
Let me see.
Oh, all right.
(Columbo) This is nylon, isn't it?
Yes.
I prefer cotton.
But people today, even our own people, just don't want anything that requires care.
Listen, I was wondering if you could help me.
My name is Lt. Columbo.
I'm from the Los Angeles Police Department.
Columbo, that's an Italian name.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Uh, could you tell me how much fabric--
My husband was half Italian.
And a wonderfully warm man, too.
Just the way Italians are supposed to be.
Can you tell me, ma'am, how many yards--
And he was a naturally good singer, too.
Of course, he was thin and he had this little blonde moustache.
But he was half Scandinavian, so...
Yes.
Lt. Columbo, are you with the Army?
Los Angeles Police Department.
Oh.
Have we done something?
No, ma'am.
Not that I know of, no.
I'm just here...
I'm just part of an investigation.
Well, of what?
Are you with the vice squad?
I don't remember having a good time.
No, ma'am.
No, I'm not with the vice squad.
I just wanted to ask you about some of these lovely robes that you and the ladies--
You want to know how many yards it takes to make a robe.
Listen, that depends.
Now, you take Helen there, it takes her four yards of material to make a robe.
It only takes me two.
What does she do?
She makes the bigger sizes, does she?
Makes mistakes, that what she does.
The poor little thing.
Once she did two left sides and wondered why it wouldn't button up.
Oh, she's a darling woman, but she is not a good seamstress.
Let me ask you something, dear.
You think I could take a look at this?
Well, if you're careful.
Just for a minute.
Certainly.
But be careful.
Thank you very much.
May I, please?
Sure.
Just go over that.
Oh, what are you doing?
How many square yards in a roll like this?
Uh, be careful now, don't let it go all the way to the end or you'll soil it--
Well, you know, I'm curious about the yardage.
You certainly are.
Could you show me what 60 square yards of this would look like?
In the first place, this is not a roll, this is a bolt.
60 square yards, wait a minute there.
That's 10 yards by 6 yards.
That's 30 feet by 18 feet.
This can't be 60 square yards.
It isn't even 20.
Do you have more?
Oh, yes, yes, we have a reserve.
We are like the industrious ants.
You know that story.
I kept a reserve stock against rising prices.
Just a minute, I'll show it to you.
Dear, oh, dear, I meant to reorder...
Do you find yourself forgetting?
Sometimes, ma'am, yes, I do.
Could you tell me, do you remember how much you meant to reorder?
Oh, it's always the same.
How much is that?
Three bolts of nylon, white, 1A-447.
And how many yards in a bolt, 20?
No, 15.
15, so there's only 45 yards missing.
Only 45 square yards missing, out of sheer forgetfulness.
And the prices have surely risen four or five cents a yard.
Why do I do that?
Forget, I mean.
Is it what they say it is?
Is it old age?
No.
No.
It's not that.
Who knows what it is, but it's not that.
Listen.
I want to thank you very, very much.
You're welcome.
I appreciate talking to you.
It was nice to meet you.
Oh, my.
Now, Lieutenant, let's see that navigation kit.
It fits.
Of course, there's no harness attached to this.
You wouldn't get it in with a conventional chute harness.
What about an unconventional one?
(man) What do you mean?
Something homemade.
Something homemade?
Yeah, it's possible.
What do you think?
You know as well as I do that the diameter of a standard chute is substantially larger than that.
Anybody jumping in that would have a much faster rate of descent than normal.
Tight chutes in a parachute like this, he goes down faster, right?
At least 20%%% faster.
Fatally faster?
Not necessarily.
The guy would probably break something, an arm, a leg or pelvis, or something.
Be awful risky.
So is murder.
I know what you're getting at, but I don't see how you can ever prove the guy jumped without finding the chute.
Neither do I.
You see?
And if it was premeditated, he'd certainly have destroyed the chute.
Yeah, but how you gonna destroy a parachute?
I mean, you can't risk burning it.
You'll see the flames no matter where he landed.
Okay, so he hid it somewhere.
Buried it.
What are you gonna do?
Dig up that whole mountain?
Thank you very much.
Come on.
Your people...
You never found that thermos bottle, did you?
No.
Hmm.
So, it must have been thrown out sometime during the flight.
Could be.
Mmm.
If the pilot jumped, just before he crashed the plane, he would land not too far from the crash site.
Right?
Right.
But there's no indication that he even took a parachute aboard.
There is an indication, Mr. Pangborn.
That empty navigation kit.
That wouldn't hold a conventional chute.
How about an unconventional chute?
Well, all I can say is he'd have to be one expert chute man.
He was.
I checked his military record.
After he washed out as a flying cadet he became a parachute rigger.
Well, it will still be an awful lot of mountain to search for anything hidden or buried.
A lot of mountain.
Who could find it?
The guy that hid it.
(Columbo) Well, it was the original version.
That's what I hear coming out of the radio.
And then there's the version that you recorded yesterday in the studio.
d I saw the light d
This is the original version.
d I saw the light d d No more darkness, no more night d
Mmm-hmm.
[music stops]
Now this is--is the new version.
I hope I got it.
I know I had it.
I got it.
[clattering]
Bear with me, sir.
d I saw the light d
This is the new version.
Mmm-hmm.
d No more darkness dd [clicking]
I noticed that the arrangement was changed.
You got a good ear for music.
Well, you know I'm ltalian.
Yeah, I know.
Anyway, I spoke to your arranger.
Nick Solecanto?
Yeah, that's him.
You know, he's Italian, too.
Yeah, I know.
So I asked him was there a special reason for you changing the arrangements?
He said yes.
Maryann was a soprano, Tina is a contralto.
Well, now, I could have told you that myself.
I know, sir.
But I was afraid that my next question might be a little embarrassing to you.
I asked Mr. Solecanto:
"How long does it take to change an arrangement like that?"
He said about a week.
And you wondered how I knew
I was going to need a new arrangement a week before Maryann was killed, right?
Yes, sir.
That was the embarrassing question.
Not embarrassing at all, Columbo.
I knew it because I knew
I was going to replace Maryann with Tina.
I liked her voice better in the solos.
That's exactly what I thought.
As a matter of fact, I like her better myself.
But I wanted to hear your explanation.
That's it.
Finished.
That definitely closes the book on you, sir.
I'm glad to hear it.
My superiors will have to agree that I've been pretty thorough on this case.
Mmm-hmm.
You really have.
Um, there's just one other thing, sir.
What's that?
I'll explain it to you in a minute.
May I use your telephone?
Go right ahead.
dd[playing]
Milt?
Columbo here.
Did you get in touch with that Boy Scout troop?
Yeah, tomorrow's okay, but they gotta start early.
How about the Forest Ranger patrol on the sheriff's Mountain Squad?
They'll start tomorrow, first thing?
Good.
Fine.
See you later.
Did that have something to do with me?
Yes, sir.
It did.
But I hesitate to mention it.
Go right ahead.
Sir, did you drink any of that coffee that was in that thermos bottle that you took on the flight?
No.
I didn't think so.
And if my hunch is correct, you're a very lucky man.
What hunch?
The barbiturates that turned up in the autopsy on those two women were a lot more than anyone would ever take for airsickness.
They were almost a lethal dose certainly enough to knock somebody out.
No kidding?
If they were in that coffee, they could have been put there by somebody who wanted to put you to sleep at the controls.
Maybe somebody wanted to kill you.
Now, why would anybody want to kill me?
Mr. Brown, I don't know.
But you are a celebrity.
And there are a lot of crackpots in the world.
And there is just no accounting for people's reactions.
And sometimes I even wonder about my wife.
Not that she is a crackpot, but, uh, when she is listening to your records, uh, the way she carries on.
[laughs]
But not like she wants to kill me.
No, sir, just the opposite.
It's no laughing matter.
This can be serious.
Look, the only fingerprints that should be on that thermos are yours, your wife's, and the girl's, right?
Right.
But if some guy thought he was going to put you to sleep at the controls and kill you in a plane crash, he might have gotten careless with his fingerprints.
He might have left them on that thermos bottle when he spiked the coffee.
Lieutenant, man, you got some kind of imagination.
You know that?
[laughs]
Still, when I get a hunch down here and I ignore it,
I always regret it.
I am gonna put a police guard on you until I find that thermos bottle.
You might never find that thermos.
We're gonna find it.
You might be right.
It could've been thrown a long distance away when that plane crashed.
But between those Boy Scouts, those Forest Rangers, and the Sheriff's Squad, we are gonna comb every inch of that mountainside.
We'll comb it and comb it, and then comb it some more, till we find it.
In the meantime, you're getting a police guard.
Now, that's nice of you.
I really appreciate that.
But it won't be necessary, Lieutenant.
I'm leaving on a concert tour.
You're leaving, sir?
I sure am.
When are you leaving?
This afternoon.
For how long?
For months.
I open tomorrow night in San Francisco.
You are going to be gone for months?
Mmm-hmm.
I sure am.
Why, what's the matter?
Nothing, sir.
No, uh...
I just wasn't prepared for that, uh...
Well, it's surely been nice knowing you, Lieutenant.
I've enjoyed talking with you, and I wish you the best of luck.
Same to you, sir.
What time is your plane?
4:05.
Have a good trip, sir.
Thank you.
Where to, Lieutenant?
Just pull around the bend and park.
He says he's going out of town.
I don't believe him.
Yeah.
I planted a seed that has to take.
He is gonna do something in the mountains first.
Pull around the bend and park.
[car engine starts]
All set, Tommy.
Hey, thanks a lot, Chris.
[engine starting] See you in San Francisco.
Take it easy.
Looks like he's going, all right.
[people chattering]
Hey, Columbo!
[laughing]
Hey, what are you doing here?
Come here.
[laughs]
What are you doing out here?
I followed you, sir, to be honest with you.
You see, I told my superiors that someone might be out to get you.
If anything happens to you here in LA, it's going to be my neck.
I thought it was my neck you were interested in.
Oh, of course, yours, too.
[laughs]
But the fact is I'm not going to rest easy until I actually see you on the plane.
I sure do appreciate that.
That's mighty nice of you.
[laughs]
[security alarm rings]
You must have some metal on you, sir.
If you'll just put it in this tray here and come through again.
Okay.
[security alarm rings] Hmm.
d And the beer I had for breakfast d dd[humming] d It wasn't bad d dd[humming]
d for dessert d [chuckles] d Then I fumbled in the closet dd
Thank you, sir.
You are welcome.
dd[humming]
Hey, Columbo.
Keep law and order while I'm gone.
I'll try, sir.
[laughs] dd[humming] d Stumbled down the stairs to meet the day dd
Hey!
Tell your wife hello for me.
[laughs] d On a Sunday morning sidewalk d d I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned dd
[security alarm rings]
Hey, mister.
Oh, L.A.P.D.
[plane engine roaring]
Did he go, sir?
He went.
That's him, in that one.
Well, you can't win them all, Lieutenant.
I guess not.
I gotta call in.
Unit 10.
[rustling]
[grunting]
Do you want me to drive you back?
[crickets chirping]
I sent the officer who brought me up here back down for dinner.
I figured you and I would be driving back together.
Nobody followed me up here.
I made sure of that.
That's right, sir.
I was waiting for you up there on that rock.
I gave you an hour to fly to San Francisco on that commuter.
I gave you half an hour for a layoff, and another hour to fly back, and an hour to drive up here.
You knew I was coming up here?
I knew.
Then I didn't know, and then I knew.
When I planted that seed about searching for the thermos bottle,
I called the Rangers and the Boy Scouts,
I knew it was gonna worry you and you'd come out here and look for the parachute.
But when you went to the airport, and you got on the plane, and when I saw that plane fly away,
I thought you were gone.
Then I heard the keys.
Little tinkle of keys.
When you emptied your pockets at the airport, your keys were with your pen, your lighter and something else.
But I remembered the keys had a tag, that tag.
Car rental tag.
Then I knew.
A man drives a rented car, he takes his keys with him on an airplane, doesn't turn them in at the airport,
I got to figure he's coming back.
Aren't you afraid being up here alone with a killer?
No, sir.
No, sir.
I had a feeling that sooner or later... d Praise the Lord, I saw the light d
Sooner or later you would have confessed even if I hadn't caught you.
d I saw the light, I saw the light d
Yeah, you are right, Lieutenant.
I would have... d No more darkness, no more night d ...because it was getting to me, and I'm glad it's over.
Listen... d Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight d ...any man that can sing like that can't be all bad.
d I saw the light, I saw the light d d No more darkness, no more night d d Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight d d Praise the Lord, I saw the light dd
Gorky Television
This is Central Russia.
There's no other earth as black or as lush and vivid on Earth.
Although known as
"a harsh and severe land", it is also called "the land of great possibilities".
For this reason, our occupations and thoughts have much to do with this land.
THE MOST MUNDANE OCCUPATIONS
This is the Gorky region, one of the most important in Central Russia.
In recent years, agriculture has developped considerably here.
The grain harvests are plentiful and there are new zootechnical complexes whose numbers are constantly growing.
Ample collective farms were established recently in the surrounding areas of Gorky, Dzerzhinsk and Kstovo.
A recent government decree for the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic announces a considerable increase in the agrarian production, notably in qualitative terms.
A complex government plan seeks the development of the material and technical bases of the local agriculture, improvements in the management of natural resources, and the rationalization of all means necessary to achieve these goals.
In order to face the needs of the Gorky farmers, the government has pledged them 2 billion rubles along the next 5 years.
Yevgeni Romanovitch Repnikov director of the main food company in Gorky, Tresta-Milevod-Stroy, supervises the construction of a water reservoir.
The farmers' concerns will be addressed by the director of the Dzerzhinski sovkhoz, Yuri Stepanovitch Kniaziev.
At the Novolekeyevski sovkhoz, another interview.
We'll bring together labour heroes from the brigade of Anna Ivanovna Kondratieva.
Our foremost interest in the interviews was to highlight and review the most pressing problems the government is dedicated to resolve.
These interviews constitute the core of our film.
Some of the farms can only be sown with the support of machines.
It's too exhaustive to do it with our bare hands.
The manual proccess requires the worker to water the farms by hand, while with the machines, irrigation is mechanized.
The cucumber harvest is the most exhausting.
When the cucumbers are harvested, one has to bend down.
Sometimes it seems that your back will break.
The most labour intensive sector is the horticulture.
Nowadays the levels of mechanization have increased.
The sowing machine.
For weeding and fertilizing, these machines can deploy chemical products.
Even with all these improvements, horticulture is still a very labour intensive activity.
And if sometimes the uninvited snow covers the ground, even threading through the fields becomes difficult.
AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION
The most recent technological innovations are presented at the farming fair.
Something new for the farmers, a weeding tractor.
It has room for four persons.
This machine was projected for the first weeding.
This tool is then operated by each of the farmers.
In spite of all innovations, no harvesting machines have been produced for the horticulture yet.
All the more pressing thus is the need to solve the problems linked with the mechanization of the harvesting process.
Low levels of application of the new technologies impose a high demand for supplementary labour even from within the big cities.
Further specialization of the material and technical bases for farming development, especially of those related to the horticulture, is crucial for solving the problems.
Long gone are the days of the 1976 drought, when the labourers who came from the city had to carry water to the fields in their own cars.
Just as they helped then, they're helping now in the harvest of vegetables.
Two years passed and today there are no more irrigation problems.
Now all crops are irrigated automatically.
Each irrigated hectare provides the guarantee of an ever more abundant harvest.
Before, we used to water the fields manually, we used tubes laid by men and women across the fields.
With a full-time irrigation system we managed to irrigate everything.
This year, however, there's no water.
The equipment is working, but there's no water.
No reason to worry.
The Kudma river has plenty of water to offer.
In the Gorky region there is no shortage of water resources.
The Volga, the Oka, the Vetluga...
Nine thousand rivers, canals and springs along a total of 32,000 km.
Around 3,000 lakes, water reservoirs and subterranean springs that have just begun to be explored.
The exploitation process of the volumous Kudma river conveys an appreciation of the Gorky region in all its complexity.
The flood-lands along the Kudma river, if well exploited, are very fertile.
The irrigation systems along the Kudma have been built 30 years ago, but they have deteriorated due to deficient exploitation.
In 1971 the construction works have started for the first irrigation system supplied by the Kudma river.
The first plan had an estimated coverage of 1,500 ha of arable land.
Sure.
In order to irrigate such a vast land, much more water will be needed.
And for that reason, not even the whole Kudma would be enough.
That's why a project was devised to flood its marginal lands and to construct the Lakshansk water reservoir.
Here we are, comrades, at the construction site of the Lakchansk reservoir.
This reservoir's function is to store water to compensate for the scarce water volume of the Kudma river for the period when irrigation water is most needed.
The construction began in 1971 and it will be finished this year.
In the area to our right we can see all that will be flooded of the Lakshya and Polta rivers, each one providing half the total volume.
This reservoir's capacity will reach 9 million cubic meters of water.
Right now we are building the main portion of the dam.
It will be 1.2km long and it will reach 13m on its highest point.
It will resist pressures equivalent to a 11.5m column of water.
A secondary construction project is planned, it will provide water for the less irrigated terrains, connecting them with the primary system and extending the coverage to a further 5,000ha.
On the other hand, we must build new roads, because you cannot harvest vegetables without transporting them.
As a result, it will be possible to establish sovkhozy dedicated to vegetable farming and build houses for the workers involved in the manifold construction projects along the Kudma river.
With the improvements in these 5,000ha, all the problems related to the provision of vegetables in the city of Gorky will be solved.
This system is especially efficient because everything will be produced in the region and the main result is that vegetables won't have to be shipped in from distant producing regions.
Coming from the Bogorodsk settlement, workers specialized in mobile mechanization are building for the Lakchansky sovkhoz an irrigation system for another 120ha of arable land.
Another 2,000ha have been irrigated and are ready to be cultivated.
In the present situation, a rational management of irrigation systems is crucial to enhance agricultural production.
For that reason, improvement specialists are required.
They have designed and installed the Fregat irrigation system, but it was only their latest achievement.
There's still a lot to be done.
The agricultural plan for this region of the RSFSR has been approved.
The plan includes goals that both in developmental and organizational terms, for the food factories in the Gorky region, are perhaps hard to achieve.
But we are equipping ourselves for this task.
Orienting ourselves towards more ambitious goals might help to assess whether we are ready to face the challenges we will have to face ahead.
Many problems have been an obstacle to our work.
There are not enough industrial resources.
We have no pre-fabricated materials, such as iron or cement, there are no factories producing them.
If they were available, it would be easier to advance in our construction works.
We have neither big companies to provide the necessary materials nor an organized transport system to support our work.
I'll give an example.
On the Kudma river We have built a lock based on the same system.
It took us two years.
If the project had incorporated and provided for pre-fabricated elements, that would have been brought in from an external industrial plant
- in this specific case, from any big cement factory - it wouldn't have taken us two years, but only one.
The difficulties on the path of improvement are objective and evident.
But we can overcome them.
The State will provide the technical instruments and in due time we will surpass the difficulties.
The government decree is quite reassuring by clearly stating:
"We demand the Ministry of Hydric Resources of the Soviet Union and the Ministers Council of the Russian Republic to give particular attention to the development of water management plants, to the accomplishment of the necessary construction works and adequate housing for the workers,
as well as making the means available for the cement factories and construction companies involved."
We must make sure that our improvement efforts won't interfere with the complexities of the ecosystem.
And we must manage efficiently the available means.
The specialized agriculture is the most profitable.
Let's take the Dzerzhinski sovkhoz as an example.
It is specialized in the greenhouse cultivation of vegetables, supplying onions to the city throughout the year.
Tomatoes are grown from April to October.
The first cucumbers can already be harvested right after New Year's Eve.
They are still costly, but they'll get much cheaper in the future.
This structure is very efficient, but also here there are still many difficulties.
In order to build this agro-industrial complex, with its 46,000 square meters, we have spent 3.6 million rubles.
That ammount was necessary to build only the basic structure, that is, the offices and the greenhouse, not including the equipment.
During this period, we have done a lot to improve the general working conditions.
In order to further cut the costs of the vegetables we produce, we still have to increase the production.
So that we won't waste the resources of our farm, as well as our invaluable human resources, we must take further the mechanization process.
We have set our goals to improve working conditions.
First: to mechanize irrigation.
A worker needs 2 to 3 hours to water the plants manually, which means 30% of the working hours.
It's simply too much.
Then we have mechanized ploughing.
In the beginning, when we first established this farm, we used to till the soil with spades.
We had to request help from the city, cause we couldn't handle it on our own.
Then our designers developped an electric plough.
A great invention that is still being used today.
We can plough the whole farm with it.
Our farm is quite profitable, but we are not the direct beneficiaries of these earnings.
And the funds that are invested in further development of the farm are scarce in relation to our ambitions.
They cannot cover all the necessary investments.
We shall expand the basic structure, build houses for the workers, but we must take into account our limited funds.
At the Dzerzhinski sovkhoz, many things are still needed.
New technologies, further mechanization, new funds, more space.
All this is needed to develop the agricultural system.
We have the means for this development and we will grow further.
At the Dzerzhinski sovkhoz, new equipment and new greenhouses are being built.
It's important to put in practice the already gathered experience.
We have mechanized part of the work.
The Moskovsky sovkhoz, in the Moscow region, is completely mechanized.
Temperature is automatically regulated, as well as humidity levels.
Also supplies of water and fertilizers are automatically controlled.
Here we have opted to mechanize first the temperature control, which is automatically regulated within the greenhouses.
So many ideas, so many thoughts, so many proposals arise regarding the new decree.
We have only regarded some of them.
Lush and vivid Central Russia.
This black soil needs all the warmth and care human hands can provide.
People care about the future of this land.
And for this reason they face the problems in all earnestness.
Upon their efforts depends the future of this land.
Faith in change!

Those were the days... the Duke and Duchess would arrive here in April, the Rothschilds in May.
That's when I was the porter at the Hermitage... then I moved to the Bellevue and the Pavillion.
Then I filled in as the Maitre d'Hotel in the best one of all, the Nobilis... ah, the Nobilis!
May I have the bill, please?
My car's in front.
Ah, there's a new receptionist.
Hello, I'm Madame Delerue.
Dellarue, spelled with an "A"?
No, with an E.
Delerue, you mean?
Delerue, with an accent.
Well, why didn't you say so?
Do you have a reservation?
Now look, we've been coming here for years!
Tell Miss Edith we're here.
Well, wake up, boy!
Go get Miss Edith, will you?
Oh!
Can't you watch where you're going?
I'm sorry, but I... uh
We were expecting you, Mrs Delerue!
Oh, Cecile!
My goodness, look at you - the way you've grown!
You're a big girl now!
You must be exhausted though.
No, no, no, we both enjoy the train.
Next year we're going to have our new airport.
You will?
Yes.
Where're the keys?
We'll need the four-twenty eight and the two eighty.
On different floors?
Yes.
Cecile's not a baby any more, is she?
Wait till you see how I've redecorated!
The baths, lovely curtains, all sorts of things!
Oh, I adore what you're wearing!
There's just one nuisance:
the elevator doesn't work.
I've given you a table in the rear dining room, where it's quieter, okay?
- Thank you.
And we'll see you later on, right?
That's very kind of you, thanks.
Do you have any rooms?
What's the name, please?
Yes?
Hello...
Hello...
Hello, Elisabeth?
Yes.
Hello, it's me.
How are you?
Oh fine, just fine.
Did you have a good trip?
Yes, somewhat long.
You know, my dear...
I won't be able to make it next week-end, after all... but I'll certainly be there a week later.
Is Cecile there with you?
No, she's in her own room.
Do you need anything?
No, nothing.
Good bye.
Good bye.
Michele, two stars...
Francoise, one star...
Claudine, three stars.
What are the stars for?
Well, with one star, no trouble kissing her...
Yeah.
Two stars, I got to feel her a little...
Three stars, I felt her a lot... and four stars, I screwed her.
Yeah, but nobody's got four!
Hey, look at that!
She's not bad!
The redhead?
I told you about her...
She's alright, eh?
She shacks with the dishwasher at the Continental.
Yeah, so what?
She's flat-chested!
Maybe I'm dumb, but I don't care.
You're not much for sensual stuff.
As much as you are!
Except that I look at a girl's face... her eyes, her mouth - that counts, too.
Sure.
There's gotta be tits on her or no go.
Look...
Hi, beautiful.
Hi, sexy.
I'd like you to meet Jojo, an old pal.
Hi.
Hello, Jo... well, your friend sure is a jerk.
Let's go see it one night soon.
We should go to Colombey one day soon - your father would pleased.
Do you think there's anything to see there?
We'd like our keys, please.
Thank you.
Oh!
- Thank you.
Yes, the lift is out of order.
"Out of order" spelled with an "0"!
What are you doing this afternoon?
I thought I'd take a walk, buy some postcards.
Good.
Then I'll see you at the hotel tonight?
Yes, okay.
Know what?
Isn't he staring at you a bit more than he should be?
How wrong you are, mother dear!
Oh no, my mille-feuille!
Why don't you watch where you're going?
You've got a nerve!
What do you mean by stepping down off the curb without warning?
Sorry, my feet go where they please.
Then walk on your hands.
Jojo!
Hey!
What's with him today?
Who does he think he is?
When you say Dellarue, it sounds awkward as hell.
Now, not that I care, but accent or no, I still say it's Dellarue.
What's the name of the girl who just went upstairs?
I just told you.
Dellarue.
Hello, Peewee!
Hi, Jojo!
What's new?
Same old stuff.
Hello, son!
Hello, pop.
Hi there, Jean-Pierre.
Hi, George.
Hi, Mum!
- Morning, son.
Well, how's my brother-in-law?
Hello, beautiful.
Well, here are my dirty clothes. ls my shirt with the blue stripes ironed?
It's not enough your brother thinks I should run a hotel, I'm to take in washing now!
Why yes, I've ironed your shirt.
Do try to get home for dessert.
I made Floating Island for you.
Well, actually, there's...
there's a busload of... of tourists arriving and uh...
I'll try to come at five or so.
A load of tourists, you say?
388 you!
Ah, what about that kid?
Lock up your daughters, men!
Wait a second... hey, wait, Jojo!
Well, why not, he's at that age.
The image of his father!
His brother as well!
By all means, take your time.
Well, well, still around, dear?
Here's to love!
Excuse me.
Don't go away.
Ah, carrots!
They'll give you pink thighs!
Alain, come clear this off.
I've got to see to everything here!
What sort of desserts do you have tonight?
Hawaiian Delight, fruit, home-made creme caramel or chocolate mousse.
Do you have any cakes?
Yes, there's a peach tart.
I'd love one.
And one Hawaiian Delight, please.
The order was for scrambled eggs not for an omelette!
Take it easy, young man.
One sole Veronique, and one rock lobster coming up!
Let me see that lobster.
Don't serve it till you've wiped the edge of the platter.
It looks like you dropped it.
Jojo, a Hawaiian Delight and a peach tart, it's table nine, so lay it on thick!
For nine?
What's for nine?
Oh, nothing, chef, nothing.
- I hope so.
I was just a little hungry...
Sure, a little hungry!
One pepper steak, medium rare!
Isn't that pretty?
Thank you.
Did you order a mille-feuille?
Oh, they must've been out of tarts.
Of course, they must have been.
What're we doing this afternoon?
Want to go to the Carnival?
No, I can't.
I promised my folks I'd come for dessert.
Your folks?
Aren't you ever going to outgrow those folks of yours?
And besides, I'll be stuck all alone.
Claudine is busy.
She works at the spa till eight o'clock.
If I were you, I'd spread my wings and fly.
Spread my wings...
Hey, come on, skinny!
Would you like me to call the orchestra?
Excuse me.
Oh, brother!
If I ever did that at the Ritz, they'd have canned me!
Thank you.
Don't mention it, Hey, Jojo!
You got liver troubles?
No, no, no, my liver's fine.
Well, won't you give me a kiss, then?
Oh sure, sure.
Say, are we doing anything tonight?
Sure, we'll do something...
Tell me, how's Alain?
Hey, what's with you?
I really don't know her very well...
You're welcome to speak to anyone you like.
I know I am but she's with Alain, the one who brought the pastry to you.
Oh, it was excellent pastry, it really was.
Yes, well, I recently joined the hotel staff
That is, I make up the orders for the food.
The wine, and all that.
Your... your girl friend there is not bad.
She's my mother.
Well, how about tonight after you...
- No.
Well, tomorrow, then?
I'm not sure.
I think it's okay.
Yes, okay, till tomorrow then.
Yeah, but we didn't say where!
Why, why not, I don't know...
At the bandstand, at three tomorrow?
- Okay.
I once read that a swan pecked a woman to death with his beak.
Do you think it's true?
You know that swans are very cruel.
It's strange, though, that anything so beautiful can be so cruel.
No, not a bit strange.
Do you believe in getting married to someone who's condemned to death?
What a question!
I think it's foolish, letting prisoners get married.
Do you want some?
No, it makes you thirsty.
I always imagined that when I grew up I was going to live in a great big house, and devote my whole life to one man.
Isn't that what you've done?
In a way, it is.
Well, I'm going now.
Going where?
- Oh, window-shopping.
He'll follow you...
I bet you he won't.
- You'll see.
Miss...
Thank you.
What's your name?
Thank you so much.
For what?
I didn't know quite how I should speak to you, but you've done it for me.
Did I speak to you?
You did.
Are you sure?
Well, reasonably sure, yes.
And just what did I say?
"What's your name"?
Elisabeth.
Is anything troubling you?
- No.
Do you want some water?
No, no.
There's no point in getting yourself upset because some woman says "What's your name?"
Giovanni.
Have you been here very long?
No, I just got here.
You sure have a pretty weird climate.
Sunshine, rain, more rain, sunshine!
It's not much fun.
You know, in winter, it often gets below zero.
But it's great anyway, with ice and snow and stuff.
Really?
You still haven't told me your name.
Cecile.
What's yours?
Jojo?
No.
It's George.
I wanted to be a conductor when I was little.
I always conducted in front of my radio, when there was music on.
Why don't you take up music instead?
Oh, because my parents think it's a waste of time.
Do you have any plans for later on?
You can't keep working forever in a kitchen.
No, but for right now, I want to buy myself a new bike.
But after I've finished training, I'm going to leave.
For where?
I don't know where, but I'm going to go.
I wouldn't mind a coffee.
If you like.
There, you see?
See that one there, the green one, five hundred CC?
It's got three cylinders, three carburators, disc-brakes and all.
She really zips along.
She ought to do two hundred to two twenty!
Is that the one you want?
No, that one's way too expensive.
No, I'm more for the three fifty.
You see, the red one there?
She's okay, eh?
So will I see you tonight after work?
No.
I promised I'd go to the cinema with my mother.
Tomorrow, if you like.
Okay.-
Hey...
Look under your door tonight when you come in.
Why?
Look, you'll see.
"If I loved you, and you loved me...
would I ever love you!
Jojo"
Hey, have you seen my red shirt?
No, I don't even know what you're talking about.
Hey, Alain!
The red shirt with the flowers.
Sorry, mate, never heard of it.
Under all that crap, maybe?
Hey, what about me?
Relax.
I need a break.
Oh, you men!
You know, my stomach's all tied up in knots.
I don't know why.
Maybe I had too much to eat.
Listen, all you need is a slug of brandy.
Marie-Therese, I want you to meet my friend George.
Pleased to meet you.
What's with this one?
Is expected to turn to light showers by early afternoon..."
Hey, get a move on, eh?
Clear skies later in the day, and the outlook for the next few days is generally..."
It's like two statues who want to talk to each other but don't only because they haven't got the nerve to speak.
Surely, you must think this is my usual way of starting a conversation.
No.
What do you think?
I'm sure the exact opposite is true.
- Really?
Right you are too!
I'm very timid and extremely serious.
- Oh...
Yes!
It's the first thing you notice.
I should hope so.
How many women have you approached in your life?
Thousands, I should think.
Well, you're the first man whom I've approached.
That's for sure!
Oh, how would you know?
The women who do talk to you never go about it that way.
In what way?
They ask you for directions or a lost bag... or for a match.
Good bye.
It's been good talking to you.
Have a good holiday.
Wait!
You'd think you knew everything there was to know about me...
except one thing.
What's that?
It's that you're the only reason I'm here.
Good bye.
Dimitri just arrived!
Dimitri?
The one I told you about.
The decorator who's a medium.
It wouldn't tempt you to come to a seance tonight, at my place, would it?
I mean if you've never experienced it, it's time you did, eh?
Have fun, you're on holidays!
See to it that you touch fingers.
Your thumbs should touch as well.
Now concentrate, all of you.
Is the spirit with us?
Concentrate.
Answer, spirit!
There's a good deal of doubt in someone's mind.
That'd be me.
Oh!
Well then, if you've no objections, shall we attempt an experiment?
I'll ask the table a question to which only you know the answer.
What is your question?
Some... someone's name, let's say.
Whose name is it?
A person whom I've just met.
Let us continue.
You will all please concentrate.
Spirit, tell me.
With what letter does the name begin?
A..
B..
C..
D..
E..
F..
G...
The name begins with a G.
Yes, but how did you know?
The table stopped at the seventh rap.
Let's continue.
Tell us, spirit, if you will, the next letter.
A..
B..
C..
D..
E..
F..
G..
H..
I...
It would seem is the next letter.
G..
I...
Excuse me, I'd rather not go on.
Not many first names start with "Gi".
I wouldn't mind finding out.
Giselle?
Gilbert?
Ginny?
- Gillian?
If you ask for the next letter, will the spirit tell us?
No, it's too late.
If you'd like to take her place we'll have a full circle.
Any question the spirit could answer?
Let's call upon Edith.
Yes, if you like.
Concentrate!
Edith, can you hear me?
Will you come to us, Edith?
Make your presence felt among us, Edith!
Ah, did you sleep late this morning?
Sorry, I had work to do.
Will you join me for a stroll?
No thanks, I find it pleasant here.
Ah, may I, then?
What is it you do when you work?
Oh, it'd take me years to describe.
Are you rich?
No, although I'm not poor.
It's curious.
What's curious?
You're young and personable.
Not a bad specimen.
What are you doing in a health resort without friends or family for company?
You're all alone.
I don't see why!
I told you that I'm here on account of you.
I'm no profession.
No... you're a passion.
As Latin as your name.
A man has no control over that.
At the moment, my heart is in Vittel.
Where's yours?
Oh, here and there.
Pardon me, Ma'am, is your name Elisabeth?
Yes.
You're wanted on the phone.
What?
Yes, there's a phone call for you.
Inside, please.
But...
Hello.
Who is it?
Hello?
I have a long distance call for you.
Hold on, please.
Long distance?
Elisabeth, it's me.
I had to leave suddenly.
But... but where are you?
I'm far away now, but there's something I want you to know.
You're tender, tragic, as fascinating as a dream.
The last few days we've spent together have been exciting, bewitching.
You're beyond compare, unforgettable.
I never thought it could happen to me but you've made my life a...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
We've been cut off!
- Not from this end!
Oh... but how would he have known that I was here?
Who told him?
Did... did he say where he was?
I'm sorry, Ma'am, I don't know.
Paulette answered the phone.
Paulette?
Who's Paulette?
Why, I'm Paulette, Madame.
Well?
Well, the person told me that... that I would see a woman in white in the street.
Her name was Elisabeth, that I should get you and I told him right away, it seemed a little strange.
That's absurd!
Why it's the most absurd thing that could happen!
Why would he leave like that?
But how should we know, Miss?
We're sorry if it's upset you, believe me.
Oh.
How much do I owe you?
Well, nothing, nothing at all.
I hope it wasn't bad news?
No, no, thank you.
Would you like a drink?
You've been running hard.
Yes, I wanted to get here as soon as possible.
You must have come a long distance.
No, no, down the block.
Now look, whenever you want to go, please do, I don't see how it concerns me.
Go, go, go... why should I keep going?
When just for once, I feel like staying.
Would you mind letting me?
Are you leaving in search of something or to run away?
I don't know.
May I help you?
One bottle of very dry white wine, please.
Well chilled, with two glasses.
Yes, sir.
Paulette?
- Yes?
If anyone should phone, will you tell them I'm not here?
But where will you be then?
Out of the country...
to join that gentleman who called me.
I wish you wouldn't ask any more questions now.
After all, you're only here a week or two, at the most.
And anyway, as soon as it's over, you'll be going home.
You see?
Why are you wasting your time by asking,
"Who are you?
What do you do?
How do you live?"
A man who doesn't like to talk about himself is a rarity!
But questions like that are of no importance.
What is important?
Well, things like what we're going to do tonight.
Ah!
So where are you taking me?
Oh, if we knew that already it wouldn't be worth going!
Terribly sorry, Madam.
No harm done.
Marcel!
As polite as polite can be, eh?
What time is it?
Half past four.
Oh dear, I've got to be going.
See you tonight.
How would you know the time?
You don't wear a watch!
Who told you I knew what time it was?
No, no, the whisky is for me.
Thank you.
That's right, the tea is for me.
Thank you.
Hey... the champagne?
Well, get moving.
Three champagnes.
Evening, ladies.
Good evening, sir.
May I have the pleasure of offering you a little something?
Why something "little"?
In that case, maybe you'd like a large cognac?
A double whisky?
Oh, I never drink alcohol!
A large orange juice, perhaps?
Nor am I allowed sugar.
Ah.
A cigarette?
With pleasure.
They're filters.
Do you have a light?
Why yes, of course.
There.
There!
Thank you for your little something.
My little sister.
- Delighted.
Good evening, little man.
If we're going on that trip, you should get to bed.
The tour leaves early.
Will you wake me?
- Yes, dear.
Just a minute.
Cecile...
Where are you going?
How about a drink?
- No, I don't want anything.
Did anyone die?
- I don't know.
Cecile...
I want to go to bed now.
Tomorrow, we're leaving early on a bus tour.
I'll meet you here tomorrow night?
Or outside the hotel...
because of the boss.
Okay, Jo, see you tomorrow night.
Five sixty nine, please.
And what do you call that?
I'm sending you my love in Morse Code.
But just where are we?
Here.
There's nothing weird about you!
I'm reminded of an old line I'm very fond of... a phrase.
It was a title, I think, of a film, or a song.
I don't remember.
How does it go?
"You worry me so tonight".
You have such a fragile neck.
Every woman has one feature that's fragile.
That doesn't worry me.
Oh, my no...
Ah, it doesn't worry me at all, no, not at all!
And what if I were a strangler?
I wouldn't worry.
There's nothing weird about you!
No, don't turn off the lights!
Why did you get married?
Well, why does anyone get married?
I mean, why did you marry him?
I wouldn't complain about it...
without him you wouldn't be here.
Oh, I'm not complaining.
You know when I was your age the world was quite a different place.
It was a girl's duty to marry.
And marry you did.
My mother raised me with one single goal...
to see I was married off.
And your father?
His daughter was the least of his worries.
He organized the house, told us how he wanted things run, and back he went to his own affairs.
A bit like Dad is today.
Your father!
You know your father was the first man who ever took me to the cinema?
That counts.
He actually persuaded Mother to let me date at your age.
So we went to the cinema - he always bought me chocolate covered ice creams.
I thought we'd go to cinema every night if I'd only get married to him.
And even that life would be like a film.
A lot of films end unhappily though.
You mean with a wedding?
True.
Have you had any lovers?
That's a question you'd never have dreamt of asking a year ago.
You didn't even answer!
Just what makes you think I'll reply?
Did I ever question you that way?
You look awfully tired this morning.
What nonsense!
If I were unhappy with someone, I think I'd want to leave.
Oh, I've thought about that.
Often?
It occurs to every woman.
But what was keeping you?
You were!
- Me?
Why yes, you were there, my dear.
After all, I was busy with you, you know that!
If I had a child, I'd be able to raise him alone.
You think so!
I wouldn't be surprised if you marry like me: too soon... and too young.
Ladies, please!
We're ready to go!
Evening, young man.
- Good evening.
I've only got one more bottle.
If you see Roland, tell him to send me another case, eh?
Hi there.
How's my Cecile?
- Okay.
You know, Cecile, all those songs are so beautifully sad.
Like a downpour on a spring day.
Cecile, do you know why they call her "Edith"?
Because of Edith Piaf!
If she's up there listening now, I sure hope it amuses her.
Here's to you, little sparrow!
Just a teeny drop more, thank you.
What's the matter, Jojo?
Haven't lost your way, have you?
No, no.
Night, Ma'am.
Goodnight, Miss Edith.
- Goodnight, Cecile.
Come on, let's not stay out the front.
Where are we going?
- You'll see.
Wait.
What are you running for?
- Come on!
Maurice, please don't forget to switch off the ceiling lights!
So, how was the tour?
Oh you know, nothing special.
But the countryside made up for it.
The lakes, especially.
I'm sure there are creatures like us on the bottom, and now and then they come up for air when nobody is looking.
No, I don't like lakes, I'll swim in anything but the lakes.
You know, I'm a little chilly.
Could we get something hot to drink?
Yeah, sure, let's go.
I'll be there right away.
Well, just long enough to say goodbye.
Oh, no, no, I won't have me nothing!
By that I mean nothing.
Tea for two, eh?
Well, that's just how I started, with tea for two.
We came here for tea, like you.
That's when there were two of us.
But then, one day I found myself all alone in front of my teacup.
And so for a change, I had me a chaser.
Then two... then three...
I'm a regular chaser addict by now.
I'm hooked on chasers!
Go on, give your girl a kiss.
Nothing else counts.
Except for drinking your tea.
Tea cools off fast, you know.
I wish I'd brought you to a quieter place.
We could always go to the bottom of a lake.
Hmm...
Come on.
Did your mother say how late you could stay out, eh?
But I didn't tell mother I was going out.
Common!
A drop of champagne?
Farewell, Vittel!
Look!
Farewell, Vittel!
Vittel, Vittel, Vittel!
There!
Ah... your glass, here!
Have you had many lovers?
What?
Have you had many lovers?
That's a question everybody asks me these days.
I already told you what a serious person I am.
Sure.
And very timid.
- Right.
Very timid.
Just how timid, though?
Let me think about that.
Why did you bring me here?
Because I love the sound of it.
It reminds me of the first girl that I ever kissed.
Not the operator's daughter?
- No.
She lived for going to the movies and was as broke as I was.
So we listened to our films outside the projection booth.
It sounds like a grand romance.
- It was.
The first one.
- Ah...
Common!
Are we going to your place tonight?
And my question?
What question?
I asked if you've had many lovers.
What a question!
More, thank you!
Do you mind?
- What?
My key.
Ah, but I thought you were...
- What's that?
Goodnight, Madame Dellarue.
- Delerue.
Oh yes, that's right, with an accent.
Delerue, Delerue, Dellarue...
There's nothing quite like a man.
More wine?
More... no more!
Still more.
More?
- Yes, go on!
Better?
- More, more, more...
If you want it to spill... there!
That'll bring you luck.
May I?
Come and have a look!
Come on!
Want some water?
Where are we going?
Surprise!
Oh, we're going to a girlfriend's place.
Ready?
When Joan of Arc was a kid, she used to play here.
She and the other kids used to sing and dance on the grass there.
She was like the other girls.
I wonder if she flirted with the boys...
I've heard people say she had children.
This is the fountain of miracles.
It's supposed to cure fever and all sorts of illnesses.
Here, drink some, you'll see.
Well?
- It wasn't bad.
Kay?
There, that's a nice place.
Have you ever slept with a guy?
Ah, that's no business of yours!
I was just wondering.
What do you think?
Well, a girl in Paris has more chances than out here.
No, even less, because here there's the woods, the fields, the outdoors.
You see, in Paris, you can never be alone.
So, you think that I've already slept with a boy?
Yes.
Well, that's where you're wrong.
I decided not to make love before I was fifteen.
And when's your birthday?
The day after tomorrow.
One.
Two.
Not so fast.
Two.
Three.
Is the little fellow making any progress?
He's learning, but he's got to pay more attention.
You're so patient with him.
Learning to swim is so important.
I wish I'd learned to swim as a child.
Do you think it's too late for me to learn?
...
Are you afraid of me?
A bit.
There must be some reason.
No.
I thought with someone like you it would be worth the trouble.
It may not last long, but it'd be worth trying.
Trying what?
It's how long it lasts that's the problem.
I don't know.
For a week, for a month, for a year... then what?
Then what?
It'd be nice knowing in advance how much longer such things go on.
Yet, somehow, I don't think I could bear knowing.
It's true...
It's easier not to.
It often seems as though what's going on is already in the past... and you're only a sort of a dream.
A pleasant dream?
I'll know when it's over.
The table back there.
We'd like two hot chocolates, please.
I don't mind the rain.
It sort of washes away all the worst things... everything nasty and unpleasant, everything impure.
All that's dirty...
even people's sins.
Does sin exist for you?
No, I'm not speaking about sin in a religious sense, but all that's false, all that's evil.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
You know whatever we do, we mustn't lie to each other.
I keep hearing my mother and my father as well as the others telling one lie after another to cause pain, or maybe pleasure.
I hope we don't start doing the same thing.
Don't say any more now.
Did you feel it?
Yeah.
It was as if you...
you flew right into my head.
And I'm never leaving.
Thank you.
It must be five o'clock already.
I've got to go to work.
At the lake tomorrow, around there?
- Okay.
What's that?
Ah, there he is!
Careful, Peewee, careful!
Easy does it.
That's my boy!
That's the way.
Oh no!
It's alright, son.
It's not so bad.
Good boy.
Now sing us a song, Francois.
Oh Peewee, give us a song!
Don't be silly!
Give us a song!
"Alouette, gentille allouette...
Alouette, je te plumerai"...
Got a sore throat.
As shy as his mother is!
- Shy, sure!
He's lazy!
Your turn, Papa, you sing one.
The Neopolitan one.
A Neopolitan song!
- A Neopolitan one?
Let's see.
He's got a sore throat too.
Well, I better be getting back to the hotel.
It takes me two minutes on the bike.
If it were up to me, you still wouldn't have that bike!
Jojo, put your helmet on!
And take your time, eh?
What are you fishing for?
- Oh, I'm not fishing.
The place is calm, that's why I come here.
And when I want to have a quiet day, without my wife.
What does she say when you come back empty-handed?
- Oh, she hates fish anyway!
That was putrid!
Too putrid for words!
Not even fresh!
Oh well, I'm fed up anyway, I'm sick and tired...
Needs more kirsch on it.
Sprinkle a little more on.
- That's what I thought.
A little more kirsch.
It's for the newcomers.
That's enough - don't over do it!
Oh, as if I cared!
I'm fed up with it all.
Is that for me?
I'll be right back, Madam.
- Of course, thank you.
Here we are.
Our specialty.
Thank you.
Ein moment.
Danke schon.
- Guten nacht.
You're a little too familiar there...
Good evening.
- Good evening, Madam.
Psst!
Hey, Cecile!
You scared me!
What are you doing here?
Waiting for you, that's all.
So, you were spying?
No, I just wanted to see you once at least today.
Why didn't you meet me at the lake?
Because I was busy.
And you, why didn't you meet me tonight?
Because I was busy.
Well, there you are.
Yesterday it was so beautiful.
Now today, we're like everyone else.
Let's forget it, Jo.
I really am glad that you're here.
Me too.
You're trembling?
No, just cold.
That better?
Yes.
Your father really is a carpenter?
No, a cabinet maker.
He does woodcarving for handmade furniture.
Can we go there some night?
We'll go there one night.
Go on, don't be afraid.
I love the smell of wood.
What I like best is the smell of varnish.
See, my father is a nut about boxing.
Here, look, Cecile.
What is it?
It's the insect collection I made when I was twelve.
Belongs to my brother now.
You know, Francois.
I loved doing it.
It's fun hunting for grasshoppers, and crickets and all that.
Here, look at this one.
See?
It's a cicada.
Imagine finding a cicada this far north.
The teacher never did believe I found it.
What kind is this one?
Careful, that one is fragile.
That's a wood cricket.
That's funny, it looks like a bulldozer.
Common.
You mean your father makes coffins too?
Well, sure, whenever someone dies.
But does he get them ready too?
No, no!
Don't they have quilting inside some coffins?
Yeah, the expensive ones are padded.
Of course they're more expensive.
Some even have silver handles on the outside.
Would you be afraid to die now?
What makes you think I'll die before you will, eh?
I was just curious, that's all.
Well, would you be afraid?
Yes.
No.
Oh, I'll have to see.
It's somehow inconceivable that life could continue without me.
I'd always be thinking of you.
I'd always see you getting furious at me because I made you drop your pastry!
I wouldn't believe you were dead.
What is it?
Breakfast, Madam.
Just a second please.
Come in.
Morning, Madame.
- Good morning.
Did you order for two?
Yes, of course I did.
Didn't it shock them at all?
No, that's what the posters say:
the air of Vittel improves the appetite!
I appreciate a woman who cares about her breakfast.
Do you?
- Yes.
They've actually become quite rare.
Yes?
Hello...
Hello?
Hello?
I'm terribly sorry, but I was anxious to hear your voice.
I don't even know what time it is.
Ten o'clock.
- Ten o'clock or so.
Ten!
Please forgive me, I couldn't help calling you.
But don't be sorry.
How have you been?
How's everything?
Oh fine, just fine.
Forgive me for waking you.
Go back to sleep, I'll see you soon, dear.
Yes.
Goodbye.
Say I were to abandon the whole works...
to go away with you?
I haven't asked you to.
You could've, though!
What would your answer have been?
How about asking me?
Are you sure you want me to?
But whose question is it:
yours or mine?
Nobody's... if nobody asks it.
Nobody gets any answers then, I'm afraid.
Yes, Who is it?
- It's me.
I thought I'd have breakfast with you.
Just a second, sweetheart!
Come in, it's alright.
Am I disturbing you?
- No, absolutely not!
Morning, dear.
Did you sleep well?
Sit down, over here.
You want something to eat?
Coffee?
No, I think I should...
- No, perhaps I should order something for you.
May I borrow your mascara?
My--. my what?
I'll return it later, alright?
I'll be going now.
Why do you want to borrow my mascara?
'Cause tomorrow's my birthday.
Come on.
- You stay there, girls.
I don't know why, but my stomach hurts.
You're not pregnant, are you?
No.
It was last night, too much whisky, I guess.
On account of Alain.
You'd think I was his property.
He barks at me like we were married.
This is my revenge.
But you're the one who'll be hurt.
Yeah, I'm stupid, I know.
You shouldn't get so upset.
Hey, come on, girls!
- Look!
Here they come!
Haha!
Let's go, eh?
- Come on, everybody out!
End of the line!
Common, get a move on.
You need a run, kid!
- Careful!
I almost fell!
Has your daughter been enjoying her holiday?
Yes.
She has a boyfriend, like me.
Why can't you ever be satisfied to take your pleasures as they come?
Isn't that what I do?
- No.
There's something in your laugh, something in the way you make love that tells me you're thinking of tomorrow or yesterday.
Mostly of tomorrow.
You don't love me.
How would you know?
Well, Dad, I guess I better go.
Say, Jojo...
I put the money down for your bike.
You haven't kept up with the rest though, eh?
I...
I thought about it, only I forgot.
What is this: you forgot, you forgot, huh?
You just better take care of the payment, son.
I promised.
Can't have folks saying around town that we don't pay our debts.
What is it, my boy?
Eh?
Tell me.
Are you in love?
Yeah.
You're a lucky lad.
The first time I was in love I was just about your age.
I used to come in at five in the morning.
I'd run into your grandfather getting up for work.
He'd pour us a cup of hot coffee...
I remember, he'd say, "Drink it, son, it's good for you."
Marvelous!
Run along, son.
And remember to make that payment, son!
- Okay.
And put on your helmet!
- Okay!
Jo... put on your helmet!
- You put on your seat belt!
Ah, lousy cheap cognac.
Oh, why do I go on?
Guten tag!
- Lass die hande...
We sent up a small tray with some bouillon, some salad: that should be enough, shouldn't it?
Yes, I'm sure she's just a bit over-tired.
- Of course.
It's the fresh air, new surroundings.
She'll be alright for her birthday tomorrow.
Oh, that's right, tomorrow is her birthday.
I almost forgot.
We'll ask the Chef to make a surprise.
How about a chocolate cake?
Fine.
Good.
From the looks of it, you're alone, so I'll have lunch with you.
Alain, bring me the usual.
Of course, Miss Edith.
Would you believe that last night, Dimitri invited me to go out to the Casino with him?
I accepted, of course.
What are you...
oh you mustn't drink that!
Alain!
Throw that out and bring me a bottle of Bordeaux.
Mine!
Let's see, where was I?
Ah, I was telling you...
We did a little gambling, had a drink or two, all that.
It was a super evening!
You've no idea how long it is since I've been outwith a man anywhere near him.
Refined and genteel, distinguished.
And you know what?
He brought me home at three in the morning, it was too much!
Ah, there's our Bordeaux.
You do like Bordeaux?
- Oh, I do, yes.
Wait till you taste this one!
It's from my own cellar!
Thank you.
Cheers!
Good, eh?
- Lovely.
When I got back, do you know I had an attack, right on the spot?
The bronchials!
But you know when I was on tour, I always wore the old mink when I went out, even in summer!
I mean you've got to watch it with your voice.
- Oh yes, of course you do.
You know, Alain, you don't look at all well.
Your mother will say I'm working you too hard again.
Men are everything.
They're all that count for me.
Next to my mother.
I mean it!
Quite a wine, eh?
Cheers!
To you.
It's tomorrow, I heard her say tomorrow.
You sure?
- Positive.
She'll be fifteen tomorrow.
Mmm!
Terrific!
If your Highnesses need anything, just holler!
If I'd indulged in one tenth the horsing around at the Ritz, I wouldn't have lasted two seconds!
Fatso!
The smoke too much for you, Fatso?
- Will you light my cigar too, eh?
Hey, what do you say?
What is it?
I brought the beer...
Uh...
I was told to take it up to... uh...
Ah, well, come in, then.
Go ahead.
It's the first time I've seen you here.
I'm filling in for someone.
- Ah.
The regular waiter has tonsillitis.
- Oh!
It's that serious!
Will they operate?
Oh yeah.
Uh, no!
Actually, it's a bad toothache.
Yeah, it's an awful bad toothache.
Alright?
Mother...
- Yes.
Will you get me a drink, please?
Don't tell me you drink beer now!
Now and then.
Well, I guess I better go then.
What's your name, young man?
George.
George.
Nice name, George.
Oh no, that, that is the bathroom.
That's the way out.
Excuse me!
My big little girl.
Drink it.
You know...
I think that I'm in love
Well, I'm pretty soft on Claudine too.
She may not have the looks to take any prizes.
No, but she's lots of fun.
Besides, I love the smell of her.
You know, I was always touchy about scents, and she always smells good.
She's not a bad gal, eh?
Okay, let's go.
GUYS
Get you!
We've been here for an hour.
Didn't Cecile come along?
Cool it, kid.
Are we going to the farm then?
- Yeah.
Mmm, you're right.
She does smell good!
Yes, it's me, Dad.
How's my little girl?
I didn't wake you, did I?
No, I was just finishing my breakfast.
I tried to get your mother, but she's gone out already.
I'm calling to wish you a happy birthday, sweetheart.
- Thank you, Dad!
When are you coming?
Look, I'll do my best to get there next weekend.
Lots of love.
You too.
Goodbye, Dad.
You won't be invited to my daughter's birthday party.
I thought it was best.
- Yes, it would be best.
Listen to me, I was more than lucky to have known you.
I've never been quite so happy.
Really happy.
But?
I was waiting for you to ask a bit more of me, perhaps.
You would have said no.
Who knows.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I know that.
Who told you?
I only have to look at you.
You're a man who's always leaving anyway.
Didn't you tell me that?
Yes.
Tomorrow, or a little bit later.
Nothing will change.
Nothing will change.
No, it's just fine that way.
Have to order some more of that one.
How do you like this weather, eh?
- Yeah, we never had it so good.
Hello.
- Hello.
Afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Well?
Do you feel better?
- Yes, the rest did me good.
It was really great of you to come.
Well, what do you expect?
Ah, let's sit there in the sun.
It's nice.
So, I guess today's the day!
Today's what day?
Well, today you're fifteen!
So what?
Oh, nothing.
Here, I...
I have a little present for you.
How thoughtful of you.
I'm turning my back only because I don't want you to see the look on my face.
Oh, you're so nice!
I want to pin it on now.
I'll show you.
Just a second.
It came loose.
Here you are.
- Thanks.
So, will we see you tonight?
No, the birthday dinner is set for tonight.
Tomorrow, then?
Tomorrow we're leaving.
What?
Yes, my mother decided to go home sooner.
But I thought...
You know, I'm sad, Jo.
But what are we going to do?
Will you write?
Will I ever see you?
I've got to go now.
Thanks for all you've done.
Will you think of me?
Yes.
I've got to go to work.
Jo!
Put your helmet on.
I'm so proud of myself.
It's a delightful little bouquet!
I do have a knack for floral arrangement.
There'll be fifteen candles for her too!
Oh no, you shouldn't!
Oh, at her age, you don't worry about the number!
You wouldn't like a bit of brandy, would you?
- I would, yes.
Where's he gone to?
Say, bring us two...
two brandies, eh?
Well, here's the birthday girl!
Where'd you get the long face?
Is it because you're a year older?
Hello.
Where did you get that horrid little bug?
I think it's very pretty.
You do?
It's original.
Ah!
It's Giovanni, an old friend of mine.
He's one of our regulars.
I know, whenever you're down in the dumps,
A smooth dancer.
One of my favorites!
And what does he do?
- I've never known.
Well, come on!
You old pirate, you!
- Hello.
Giovanni, Mrs Delerue and her daughter, Cecile.
When you come to mother Edith, there's always something wrong.
I wanted to say goodbye.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
Oh!
Well that calls for a drink!
Hm?
A birthday.
A goodbye.
Our little girl turns fifteen tomorrow!
Say, give us a bit of champagne!
The one under the counter.
You have a lovely daughter.
- Hey, hey, hey!
They're delicate at fifteen - too young for you.
Now then... that's enough nonsense!
Pass me the bottle, will you?
I hope it's properly chilled.
No, I'll take care of that.
If anything will shake us up, it's champagne.
I keep it on ice.
Fine, thanks.
Come on!
What are you waiting for?
Ah, about time I had a pick-me-up.
There!
Here's to your birthday!
And to a nob voyage!
Ahh... you're lucky you're able to go.
I wish I could pack up and leave like that!
Know where you're headed for?
Vaguely-
I know you, you're not much of an adventurer, are you?
But you'll wind up just like me and throw in the towel.
Old age.
Not bad, eh?
Ciao.
An hour before the train leaves.
Lots of time.
Yes?
Yes.
Our bags are ready if you'll send someone to get them.
Yes, Ma'am.
- Thank you.
I doubt if we'll come back here next summer though.
Ah, the same old thing.
It never seems to fail.
It's impossible to shut the suitcase and when I came it was half empty.
Haven't bought a thing either!
Oh, you've got to say goodbye to Edith, eh?
Yes?
Come in!
Will you please take my baggage down to the lobby... and those too.
Thank you.
Do you mind, dear?
Is that all?
- Yes, that's all.
Very good, Ma'am.
Wait!
Have I forgotten anything?
No, I don't think so.
Let's go, dear.
those were the days... the Duke and Duchess would arrive here in April, the Rothschilds in May.
That's when I was the porter at the Hermitage... then I moved to the Bellevue and the Pavillion.
Then I filled in as the Maître d'Hôtel in the best one of all, the Nobilis... ah, the Nobilis!
May I have the bill, please?
My car's in front.
Ah, there's a new receptionist.
Hello, I'm Madame Délerue.
Dellarue, spelled with an "A"?
No, with an E.
Delerue, you mean?
Délerue, with an accent.
Well, why didn't you say so?
Do you have a reservation?
Now look, we've been coming here for years!
Tell Miss Edith we're here.
Well, wake up, boy!
Go get Miss Edith, will you?
Oh!
Can't you watch where you're going?
I'm sorry, but I... uh
We were expecting you, Mrs Délerue!
Oh, Cecile!
My goodness, look at you - the way you've grown!
You're a big girl now!
You must be exhausted though.
No, no, no, we both enjoy the train.
Next year we're going to have our new airport.
You will?
Yes.
Where're the keys?
We'll need the four-twenty eight and the two eighty.
On different floors?
Yes.
Cecile's not a baby anymore, is she?
Wait till you see how I've redecorated!
The baths, lovely curtains, all sorts of things!
Oh, I adore what you're wearing!
the elevator doesn't work.
I've given you a table in the rear dining room, where it's quieter, okay?
- Thank you.
And we'll see you later on, right?
That's very kind of you, thanks.
Do you have any rooms?
What's the name, please?
Yes?
Hello...
Hello...
Hello, Elisabeth?
Yes.
Hello, it's me.
How are you?
Oh fine, just fine.
Did you have a good trip?
Yes, somewhat long.
You know, my dear...
I won't be able to make it next week-end, after all... but I'll certainly be there a week later.
Is Cecile there with you?
No, she's in her own room.
Do you need anything?
No, nothing.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Michèle, two stars...
Françoise, one star...
Claudine, three stars.
What are the stars for?
Well, with one star, no trouble kissing her...
Yeah.
Two stars, I got to feel her a little...
Three stars, I felt her a lot... and four stars, I screwed her.
Yeah, but nobody's got four!
Hey, look at that!
She's not bad!
The redhead?
I told you about her...
She's alright, eh?
She shacks with the dishwasher at the Continental.
Yeah, so what?
She's flat-chested!
Maybe I'm dumb, but I don't care.
You're not much for sensual stuff.
As much as you are!
Except that I look at a girl's face... her eyes, her mouth - that counts, too.
Sure.
There's gotta be tits on her or no go.
Look...
Hi, beautiful.
Hi, sexy.
I'd like you to meet Jojo, an old pal.
Hi.
Hello, Jo... well, your friend sure is a jerk.
Let's go see it one night soon.
We should go to Colombey one day soon - your father would pleased.
Do you think there's anything to see there?
We'd like our keys, please.
Thank you.
Oh!
- Thank you.
Yes, the lift is out of order.
"Out of order" spelled with an "o"!
What are you doing this afternoon?
I thought I'd take a walk, buy some postcards.
Good.
Then I'll see you at the hotel tonight?
Yes, okay.
Know what?
Isn't he staring at you a bit more than he should be?
How wrong you are, mother dear!
Oh no, my mille-feuille!
Why don't you watch where you're going?
You've got a nerve!
What do you mean by stepping down off the curb without warning?
Sorry, my feet go where they please.
Then walk on your hands.
Jojo!
Hey!
What's with him today?
Who does he think he is?
When you say Dellarue, it sounds awkward as hell.
Now, not that I care, but accent or no, I still say it's Dellarue.
What's the name of the girl who just went upstairs?
I just told you.
Dellarue.
Hello, Peewee!
Hi, Jojo!
What's new?
Same old stuff.
Hello, son!
Hello, pop.
Hi there, Jean-Pierre.
Hi, George.
Hi, Mum!
- Morning, son.
Well, how's my brother-in-law?
Hello, beautiful.
Well, here are my dirty clothes.
Is my shirt with the blue stripes ironed?
It's not enough your brother thinks I should run a hotel, I'm to take in washing now!
Why yes, I've ironed your shirt.
Do try to get home for dessert.
I made Floating Island for you.
Well, actually, there's...
there's a busload of... of tourists arriving and uh...
I'll try to come at five or so.
A load of tourists, you say?
See you!
Ah, what about that kid?
Lock up your daughters, men!
Wait a second... hey, wait, Jojo!
Well, why not, he's at that age.
The image of his father!
His brother as well!
By all means, take your time.
Well, well, still around, dear?
Here's to love!
Excuse me.
Don't go away.
Ah, carrots!
They'll give you pink thighs!
Alain, come clear this off.
I've got to see to everything here!
What sort of desserts do you have tonight?
Hawaiian Delight, fruit, home-made crème caramel or chocolate mousse.
Do you have any cakes?
Yes, there's a peach tart.
I'd love one.
And one Hawaiian Delight, please.
The order was for scrambled eggs, not for an omelette!
Take it easy, young man.
One sole Véronique, and one rock lobster coming up!
Let me see that lobster.
Don't serve it till you've wiped the edge of the platter.
It looks like you dropped it.
Jojo, a Hawaiian Delight and a peach tart, it's table nine, so lay it on thick!
For nine?
What's for nine?
Oh, nothing, chef, nothing.
- I hope so.
I was just a little hungry...
Sure, a little hungry!
One pepper steak, medium rare!
Isn't that pretty?
Thank you.
Did you order a mille-feuille?
Oh, they must've been out of tarts.
Of course, they must have been.
What're we doing this afternoon?
Want to go to the Carnival?
No, I can't.
I promised my folks I'd come for dessert.
Your folks?
Aren't you ever going to outgrow those folks of yours?
And besides, I'll be stuck all alone.
Claudine is busy.
She works at the spa till eight o'clock.
If I were you, I'd spread my wings and fly.
Spread my wings...
Hey, come on, skinny!
Would you like me to call the orchestra?
Excuse me.
Oh, brother!
If I ever did that at the Ritz, they'd have canned me!
Thank you.
Don't mention it, Hey, Jojo!
You got liver troubles?
No, no, no, my liver's fine.
Well, won't you give me a kiss, then?
Oh sure, sure.
Say, are we doing anything tonight?
Sure, we'll do something...
Tell me, how's Alain?
Hey, what's with you?
I really don't know her very well...
You're welcome to speak to anyone you like.
I know I am but she's with Alain, the one who brought the pastry to you.
Oh, it was excellent pastry, it really was.
Yes, well, I recently joined the hotel staff.
That is, I make up the orders for the food.
The wine, and all that.
Your... your girl friend there is not bad.
She's my mother.
Well, how about tonight after you...
- No.
Well, tomorrow, then?
I'm not sure.
I think it's okay.
Yes, okay, till tomorrow then.
Yeah, but we didnt say where!
Why, why not, I don't know...
At the bandstand, at three tomorrow?
- Okay.
I once read that a swan pecked a woman to death with his beak.
Do you think it's true?
You know that swans are very cruel.
It's strange, though, that anything so beautiful can be so cruel.
No, not a bit strange.
Do you believe in getting married to someone who's condemned to death?
What a question!
I think it's foolish, letting prisoners get married.
Do you want some?
No, it makes you thristy.
I always imagined that when I grew up I was going to live in a great big house, and devote my whole life to one man.
Isn't that what you've done?
In a way, it is.
Well, I'm going now.
Going where?
- Oh, window-shopping.
He'll follow you...
I bet you he won't.
- You'll see.
Miss...
Thank you.
What's your name?
Thank you so much.
For what?
I didn't know quite how I should speak to you, but you've done it for me.
Did I speak to you?
You did.
Are you sure?
Well, reasonably sure, yes.
And just what did I say?
"What's your name"?
Elisabeth.
Is anything troubling you?
- No.
Do you want some water?
No, no.
There's no point in getting yourself upset because some woman says "What's your name?"
Giovanni.
Have you been here very long?
No, I just got here.
You sure have a pretty weird climate.
Sunshine, rain, more rain, sunshine!
It's not much fun.
You know, in winter, it often gets below zero.
But it's great anyway, with ice and snow and stuff.
Really?
You still haven't told me your name.
Cecile.
What's yours?
Jojo?
No.
It's George.
I wanted to be a conductor when I was little.
I always conducted in front of my radio, when there was music on.
Why don't you take up music instead?
Oh, because my parents think it's a waste of time.
Do you have any plans for later on?
You can't keep working forever in a kitchen.
No, but for right now, I want to buy myself a new bike.
But after I've finished training, I'm going to leave.
For where?
I don't know where, but I'm going to go.
I wouldn't mind a coffee.
If you like.
There, you see?
See that one there, the green one, five hundred CC?
It's got three cylinders, three carburators, disc-brakes and all.
She really zips along.
She ought to do two hundred to two twenty!
Is that the one you want?
No, that one's way too expensive.
No, I'm more for the three fifty.
You see, the red one there?
She's okay, eh?
So will I see you tonight after work?
No.
I promised I'd go to the cinema with my mother.
Tomorrow, if you like.
Okay.
Hey...
Look under your door tonight when you come in.
Why?
Look, you'll see.
"If I loved you, and you loved me...
would I ever love you!
Jojo"
Hey, have you seen my red shirt?
No, I don't even know what you're talking about.
Hey, Alain!
The red shirt with the flowers.
Sorry, mate, never heard of it.
Under all that crap, maybe?
Hey, what about me?
Relax.
I need a break.
Oh, you men!
You know, my stomach's all tied up in knots.
I don't know why.
Maybe I had too much to eat.
Listen, all you need is a slug of brandy.
Marie-Thérèse, I want you to meet my friend George.
Pleased to meet you.
What's with this one?
"...is expected to turn to light showers by early afternoon..."
Hey, get a move on, eh?
"...clear skies later in the day, and the outlook for the next few days is generally..."
It's like two statues who want to talk to each other but don't only because they haven't got the nerve to speak.
Surely, you must think this is my usual way of starting a conversation.
No.
What do you think?
I'm sure the exact opposite is true.
- Really?
Right you are too!
I'm very timid and extremely serious.
- Oh...
Yes!
It's the first thing you notice.
I should hope so.
How many women have you approached in your life?
Thousands, I should think.
Well, you're the first man whom I've approached.
That's for sure!
Oh, how would you know?
The women who do talk to you never go about it that way.
In what way?
They ask you for directions or a lost bag...
or for a match.
Goodbye.
It's been good talking to you.
Have a good holiday.
Wait!
You'd think you knew everything there was to know about me... except one thing.
What's that?
It's that you're the only reason I'm here.
Goodbye.
Dimitri just arrived!
Dimitri?
The one I told you about.
The decorator who's a medium.
It wouldn't tempt you to come to a seance tonight, at my place, would it?
I mean if you've never experienced it, it's time you did, eh?
Have fun, you're on holidays!
See to it that you touch fingers.
Your thumbs should touch as well.
Now concentrate, all of you.
Is the spirit with us?
Concentrate.
Answer, spirit!
There's a good deal of doubt in someone's mind.
That'd be me.
Oh!
Well then, if you've no objections, shall we attempt an experiment?
I'll ask the table a question to which only you know the answer.
What is your question?
Some... someone's name, let's say.
Whose name is it?
A person whom I've just met.
Let us continue.
You will all please concentrate.
Spirit, tell me.
With what letter does the name begin?
A...
B...
C...
D...
E...
F...
G...
The name begins with a G.
Yes, but how did you know?
The table stopped at the seventh rap.
Let's continue.
Tell us, spirit, if you will, the next letter.
A...
B...
C...
D...
E...
F...
G...
H...
I...
It would seem "i" is the next letter.
G...
I...
Excuse me, I'd rather not go on.
Not many first names start with "Gi".
I wouldn't mind finding out.
Giselle?
Gilbert?
Ginny?
- Gillian?
If you ask for the next letter, will the spirit tell us?
No, it's too late.
If you'd like to take her place we'll have a full circle.
Any question the spirit could answer?
Let's call upon Edith.
Yes, if you like.
Concentrate!
Edith, can you hear me?
Will you come to us, Edith?
Make your presence felt among us, Edith!
Ah, did you sleep late this morning?
Sorry, I had work to do.
Will you join me for a stroll?
No thanks, I find it pleasant here.
Ah, may I, then?
What is it you do when you work?
Oh, it'd take me years to describe.
Are you rich?
No, although I'm not poor.
It's curious.
What's curious?
You're young and personable.
Not a bad specimen.
What are you doing in a health resort without friends or family for company?
You're all alone.
I don't see why!
I told you that I'm here on account of you.
I'm no profession.
No... you're a passion.
As Latin as your name.
A man has no control over that.
At the moment, my heart is in Vittel.
Where's yours?
Oh, here and there.
Pardon me, Ma'am, is your name Elisabeth?
Yes.
You're wanted on the phone.
What?
Yes, there's a phone call for you.
Inside, please.
But...
Hello.
Who is it?
Hello?
I have a long distance call for you.
Hold on, please.
Long distance?
Elisabeth, it's me.
I had to leave suddenly.
But... but where are you?
I'm far away now, but there's something I want you to know.
You're tender, tragic, as fascinating as a dream.
The last few days we've spent together have been exciting, bewitching.
You're beyond compare, unforgettable.
I never thought it could happen to me but you've made my life a...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
We've been cut off!
- Not from this end!
Oh... but how would he have known that I was here?
Who told him?
Did... did he say where he was?
I'm sorry, Ma'am, I don't know.
Paulette answered the phone.
Paulette?
Who's Paulette?
Why, I'm Paulette, Madame.
Well?
Well, the person told me that...
that I would see a woman in white in the street.
Her name was Elisabeth, that I should get you and I told him right away, it seemed a little strange.
That's absurd!
Why it's the most absurd thing that could happen!
Why would he leave like that?
But how should we know, Miss?
We're sorry if it's upset you, believe me.
Oh.
How much do I owe you?
Well, nothing, nothing at all.
I hope it wasn't bad news?
No, no, thank you.
Would you like a drink?
You've been running hard.
Yes, I wanted to get here as soon as possible.
You must have come a long distance.
No, no, down the block.
Now look, whenever you want to go, please do, I don't see how it concerns me.
Go, go, go... why should I keep going?
When just for once, I feel like staying.
Would you mind letting me?
Are you leaving in search of something or to run away?
I don't know.
May I help you?
One bottle of very dry white wine, please.
Well chilled, with two glasses.
Yes, sir.
Paulette?
- Yes?
If anyone should phone, will you tell them I'm not here?
But where will you be then?
Out of the country...
to join that gentleman who called me.
I wish you wouldn't ask anymore questions now.
After all, you're only here a week or two, at the most.
And anyway, as soon as it's over, you'll be going home.
You see?
Why are you wasting your time by asking,
"Who are you?
What do you do?
How do you live?"
A man who doesn't like to talk about himself is a rarity!
But questions like that are of no importance.
What is important?
Well, things like what we're going to do tonight.
Ah!
So where are you taking me?
Oh, if we knew that already it wouldn't be worth going!
Terribly sorry, Madam.
No harm done.
Marcel!
As polite as polite can be, eh?
What time is it?
Half past four.
Oh dear, I've got to be going.
See you tonight.
How would you know the time?
You don't wear a watch!
Who told you I knew what time it was?
No, no, the whisky is for me.
Thank you.
That's right, the tea is for me.
Thank you.
Hey... the champagne?
Well, get moving.
Three champagnes.
Evening, ladies.
Good evening, sir.
May I have the pleasure of offering you a little something?
Why something "little"?
In that case, maybe you'd like a large cognac?
A double whisky?
Oh, I never drink alcohol!
A large orange juice, perhaps?
Nor am I allowed sugar.
Ah.
A cigarette?
With pleasure.
They're filters.
Do you have a light?
Why yes, of course.
There.
There!
Thank you for your little something.
My little sister.
- Delighted.
Good evening, little man.
If we're going on that trip, you should get to bed.
The tour leaves early.
Will you wake me?
- Yes, dear.
Just a minute.
Cecile...
Where are you going?
How about a drink?
- No, I don't want anything.
Did anyone die?
- I don't know.
Cecile...
I want to go to bed now.
Tomorrow, we're leaving early on a bus tour.
I'll meet you here tomorrow night?
Or outside the hotel ...because of the boss.
Okay, Jo, see you tomorrow night.
Five sixty nine, please.
And what do you call that?
I'm sending you my love in Morse Code.
But just where are we?
Here.
There's nothing weird about you!
I'm reminded of an old line I'm very fond of... a phrase.
It was a title, I think, of a film, or a song.
I don't remember.
How does it go?
"You worry me so tonight".
You have such a fragile neck.
Every woman has one feature that's fragile.
That doesn't worry me.
Oh, my no...
Ah, it doesn't worry me at all, no, not at all!
And what if I were a strangler?
I wouldn't worry.
There's nothing weird about you!
No, don't turn off the lights!
Why did you get married?
Well, why does anyone get married?
I mean, why did you marry him?
I wouldn't complain about it...
without him you wouldn't be here.
Oh, I'm not complaining.
You know when I was your age the world was quite a different place.
It was a girl's duty to marry.
And marry you did.
My mothor raised me with one single goal...
to see I was married off.
And your father?
His daughter was the least of his worries.
He organised the house, told us how he wanted things run, and back he went to his own affairs.
A bit like Dad is today.
Your father!
You know your father was the first man who ever took me to the cinema?
That counts.
He actually persuaded Mother to let me date at your age.
So we went to the cinema - he always bought me chocolate covered ice creams.
I thought we'd go to cinema every night if I'd only get married to him.
And even that life would be like a film.
A lot of films end unhappily though.
You mean with a wedding?
True.
Have you had any lovers?
That's a question you'd never have dreamt of asking a year ago.
You didn't even answer!
Just what makes you think I'll reply?
Did I ever question you that way?
You look awfully tired this morning.
What nonsense!
If I were unhappy with someone, I think I'd want to leave.
Oh, I've thought about that.
Often?
It occurs to every woman.
But what was keeping you?
You were!
- Me?
Why yes, you were there, my dear.
After all, I was busy with you, you know that!
If I had a child, I'd be able to raise him alone.
You think so!
I wouldn't be surprised if you marry too soon... and too young.
Ladies, please!
We're ready to go!
Evening, young man.
- Good evening.
I've only got one more bottle.
If you see Roland, tell him to send me another case, eh?
- Okay.
Hi there.
How's my Cecile?
- Okay.
You know, Cecile, all those songs are so beautifully sad.
Like a downpour on a spring day.
Cecile, do you know why they call her "Edith"?
Because of Edith Piaf!
If she's up there listening now, I sure hope it amuses her.
Here's to you, little sparrow!
Just a teeny drop more, thank you.
What's the matter, Jojo?
Haven't lost your way, have you?
No, no.
Night, Ma'am.
Goodnight, Miss Edith.
- Goodnight, Cecile.
Come on, let's not stay out the front.
Where are we going?
- You'll see.
Wait.
What are you running for?
- Come on!
Maurice, please don't forget to switch off the ceiling lights!
So, how was the tour?
Oh you know, nothing special.
But the countryside made up for it.
The lakes, especially.
I'm sure there are creatures like us on the bottom, and now and then they come up for air when nobody is looking.
No, I don't like lakes, I'll swim in anything but the lakes.
You know, I'm a little chilly.
Could we get something hot to drink?
Yeah, sure, let's go.
I'll be there right away.
Well, just long enough to say goodbye.
Oh, no, no, I won't have me nothing!
By that I mean nothing.
Tea for two, eh?
Well, that's just how I started, with tea for two.
We came here for tea, like you.
That's when there were two of us.
But then, one day I found myself all alone in front of my teacup.
And so for a change, I had me a chaser.
Then two... then three...
I'm a regular chaser addict by now.
I'm hooked on chasers!
Go on, give your girl a kiss.
Nothing else counts.
Except for drinking your tea.
Tea cools off fast, you know.
I wish I'd brought you to a quieter place.
We could always go to the bottom of a lake.
Hmm...
Come on.
Did your mother say how late you could stay out, eh?
But I didn't tell mother I was going out.
C'mon!
A drop of champagne?
Farewell, Vittel!
Look!
Farewell, Vittel!
Vittel, Vittel, Vittel!
There!
Ah... your glass, here!
Have you had many lovers?
What?
Have you had many lovers?
That's a question everybody asks me these days.
I already told you what a serious person I am.
Sure.
And very timid.
- Right.
Very timid.
Just how timid, though?
Let me think about that.
Why did you bring me here?
Because I love the sound of it.
It reminds me of the first girl that I ever kissed.
Not the operator's daughter?
- No.
She lived for going to the movies and was as broke as I was.
So we listened to our films outside the projection booth.
It sounds like a grand romance.
- It was.
The first one.
- Ah...
C'mon!
Are we going to your place tonight?
And my question?
What question?
I asked if you've had many lovers.
What a question!
More, thank you!
Do you mind?
- What?
My key.
Ah, but I thought you were...
- What's that?
Goodnight, Madame Dellarue.
- Délerue.
Oh yes, that's right, with an accent.
Délerue, Délerue, Dellarue...
There's nothing quite like a man.
More wine?
More... no more!
Still more.
More?
- Yes, go on!
Better?
- More, more, more...
If you want it to spill... there!
That'll bring you luck.
May I?
Come and have a look!
Come on!
Want some water?
Where are we going?
Surprise!
Oh, we're going to a girlfriend's place.
Ready?
When Joan of Arc was a kid, she used to play here.
She and the other kids used to sing and dance on the grass there.
She was like the other girls.
I wonder if she flirted with the boys...
I've heard people say she had children.
This is the fountain of miracles.
It's supposed to cure fever and all sorts of illnesses.
Here, drink some, you'll see.
Well?
- It wasn't bad.
Okay?
There, that's a nice place.
Have you ever slept with a guy?
Ah, that's no business of yours!
I was just wondering.
What do you think?
Well, a girl in Paris has more chances than out here.
No, even less, because here there's the woods, the fields, the outdoors.
You see, in Paris, you can never be alone.
So, you think that I've already slept with a boy?
Yes.
Well, that's where you're wrong.
I decided not to make love before I was fifteen.
And when's your birthday?
The day after tomorrow.
One.
Two.
Not so fast.
Two.
Three.
Is the little fellow making any progress?
He's learning, but he's got to pay more attention.
You're so patient with him.
Learning to swim is so important.
I wish I'd learned to swim as a child.
Do you think it's too late for me to learn?
Are you afraid of me?
A bit.
There must be some reason.
No.
I thought with someone like you it would be worth the trouble.
It may not last long, but it'd be worth trying.
Trying what?
It's how long it lasts that's the problem.
I don't know.
For a week, for a month, for a year... then what?
Then what?
It'd be nice knowing in advance how much longer such things go on.
Yet, somehow, I don't think I could bear knowing.
It's true...
It's easier not to.
It often seems as though what's going on is already in the past... and you're only a sort of a dream.
A pleasant dream?
I'll know when it's over.
The table back there.
We'd like two hot chocolates, please.
I don't mind the rain.
It sort of washes away all the worst things... everything nasty and unpleasant, everything impure.
All that's dirty... even people's sins.
Does sin exist for you?
No, I'm not speaking about sin in a religious sense, but all that's false, all that's evil.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
You know whatever we do, we mustn't lie to each other.
I keep hearing my mother and my father as well as the others telling one lie after another to cause pain, or maybe pleasure.
I hope we don't start doing the same thing.
Don't say anymore now.
Did you feel it?
Yeah.
It was as if you...
you flew right into my head.
And I'm never leaving.
Thank you.
It must be five o'clock already.
I've got to go to work.
At the lake tomorrow, around there?
- Okay.
What's that?
Ah, there he is!
Careful, Peewee, careful!
Easy does it.
That's my boy!
That's the way.
Oh no!
It's alright, son.
It's not so bad.
Good boy.
Now sing us a song, François.
Oh Peewee, give us a song!
Don't be silly!
Give us a song!
"Alouette, gentille allouette...
Alouette, je te plumerai"...
Got a sore throat.
As shy as his mother is!
- Shy, sure!
He's lazy!
Your turn, Papa, you sing one.
The Neopolitan one.
A Neopolitan song!
- A Neopolitan one?
Let's see.
He's got a sore throat too.
Well, I better be getting back to the hotel.
It takes me two minutes on the bike.
If it were up to me, you still wouldn't have that bike!
Jojo, put your helmet on!
And take your time, eh?
What are you fishing for?
- Oh, I'm not fishing.
The place is calm, that's why I come here.
And when I want to have a quiet day, without my wife.
The woman talks all day long!
What does she say when you come back empty-handed?
- Oh, she hates fish anyway!
That was putrid!
Too putrid for words!
Not even fresh!
Oh well, I'm fed up anyway, I'm sick and tired...
Needs more kirsch on it.
Sprinkle a little more on.
- That's what I thought.
A little more kirsch.
It's for the newcomers.
That's enough - don't over do it!
Oh, as if I cared!
I'm fed up with it all.
Is that for me?
I'll be right back, Madam.
- Of course, thank you.
Here we are.
Our specialty.
Thank you.
Ein moment.
Danke schon.
- Guten nacht.
You're a little too familiar there...
Good evening.
- Good evening, Madam.
Psst!
Hey, Cecile!
You scared me!
What are you doing here?
Waiting for you, that's all.
So, you were spying?
No, I just wanted to see you once at least today.
Why didn't you meet me at the lake?
Because I was busy.
And you, why didn't you meet me tonight?
Because I was busy.
Well, there you are.
Yesterday it was so beautiful.
Now today, we're like everyone else.
Let's forget it, Jo.
I really am glad that you're here.
Me too.
You're trembling?
No, just cold.
That better?
Yes.
Your father really is a carpenter?
No, a cabinet maker.
He does woodcarving for handmade furniture.
Can we go there some night?
We'll go there one night.
Go on, don't be afraid.
I love the smell of wood.
What I like best is the smell of varnish.
See, my father is a nut about boxing.
Here, look, Cecile.
What is it?
It's the insect collection I made when I was twelve.
Belongs to my brother now.
You know, François.
I loved doing it.
It's fun hunting for grasshoppers, and crickets and all that.
Here, look at this one.
See?
It's a cicada.
Imagine finding a cicada this far north.
The teacher never did believe I found it.
What kind is this one?
Careful, that one is fragile.
That's a wood cricket.
That's funny, it looks like a bulldozer.
C'mon.
You mean your father makes coffins too?
Well, sure, whenever someone dies.
But does he get them ready too?
No, no!
Don't they have quilting inside some coffins?
Yeah, the expensive ones are padded.
Of course they're more expensive.
Some even have silver handles on the outside.
Would you be afraid to die now?
What makes you think I'll die before you will, eh?
I was just curious, that's all.
Well, would you be afraid?
Yes.
No.
Oh, I'll have to see.
It's somehow inconceivable that life could continue without me.
I'd always be thinking of you.
I'd always see you getting furious at me because I made you drop your pastry!
I wouldn't believe you were dead.
What is it?
Breakfast, Madam.
Just a second please.
Come in.
Morning, Madame.
- Good morning.
Did you order for two?
Yes, of course I did.
Didn't it shock them at all?
the air of Vittel improves the appetite!
I appreciate a woman who cares about her breakfast.
Do you?
- Yes.
They've actually become quite rare.
Yes?
Hello...
Hello?
Hello?
I'm terribly sorry, but I was anxious to hear your voice.
I don't even know what time it is.
Ten o'clock.
- Ten o'clock or so.
Ten!
Please forgive me, I couldn't help calling you.
But don't be sorry.
How have you been?
How's everything?
Oh fine, just fine.
Forgive me for waking you.
Go back to sleep, I'll see you soon, dear.
Yes.
Goodbye.
Say I were to abandon the whole works...
to go away with you?
I haven't asked you to.
You could've, though!
What would your answer have been?
How about asking me?
Are you sure you want me to?
yours or mine?
Nobody's... if nobody asks it.
Nobody gets any answers then, I'm afraid.
Yes, Who is it?
- It's me.
I thought I'd have breakfast with you.
Just a second, sweetheart!
Come in, it's alright.
Am I disturbing you?
- No, absolutely not!
Morning, dear.
Did you sleep well?
Sit down, over here.
You want something to eat?
Coffee?
No, I think I should...
- No, perhaps I should order something for you.
May I borrow your mascara?
My... my what?
I'll return it later, alright?
I'll be going now.
Why do you want to borrow my mascara?
'Cause tomorrow's my birthday.
Come on.
- You stay there, girls.
I don't know why, but my stomach hurts.
You're not pregnant, are you?
No.
It was last night, too much whisky, I guess.
On account of Alain.
You'd think I was his property.
He barks at me like we were married.
This is my revenge.
But you're the one who'll be hurt.
Yeah, I'm stupid, I know.
You shouldn't get so upset.
Hey, come on, girls!
- Look!
Here they come!
Haha!
Let's go, eh?
- Come on, everybody out!
End of the line!
C'mon, get a move on.
You need a run, kid!
- Careful!
I almost fell!
Has your daughter been enjoying her holiday?
Yes.
She has a boyfriend, like me.
Why can't you ever be satisfied to take your pleasures as they come?
Isn't that what I do?
- No.
There's something in your laugh, something in the way you make love that tells me you're thinking of tomorrow or yesterday.
Mostly of tomorrow.
You don't love me.
How would you know?
Well, Dad, I guess I better go.
Say, Jojo...
I put the money down for your bike.
You haven't kept up with the rest though, eh?
I...
I thought about it, only I forgot.
you forgot, you forgot, huh?
You just better take care of the payment, son.
I promised.
Can't have folks saying around town that we don't pay our debts.
What is it, my boy?
Eh?
Tell me.
Are you in love?
Yeah.
You're a lucky lad.
The first time I was in love I was just about your age.
I used to come in at five in the morning.
I'd run into your grandfather getting up for work.
He'd pour us a cup of hot coffee...
I remember, he'd say, "Drink it, son, it's good for you."
Marvellous!
Run along, son.
And remember to make that payment, son!
- Okay.
And put on your helmet!
- Okay!
Jo... put on your helmet!
- You put on your seatbelt!
Ah, lousy cheap cognac.
Oh, why do I go on?
Guten tag!
- Lass die hande...
We sent up a small tray with that should be enough, shouldn't it?
Yes, I'm sure she's just a bit over-tired.
- 0f course.
It's the fresh air, new surroundings.
She'll be alright for her birthday tomorrow.
Oh, that's right, tomorrow is her birthday.
I almost forgot.
We'll ask the Chef to make a surprise.
How about a chocolate cake?
Fine.
Good.
From the looks of it, you're alone, so I'll have lunch with you.
Alain, bring me the usual.
Of course, Miss Edith.
Would you believe that last night, Dimitri invited me to go out to the Casino with him?
I accepted, of course.
What are you...
oh you mustn't drink that!
Alain!
Throw that out and bring me a bottle of Bordeaux.
Mine!
Let's see, where was I?
Ah, I was telling you...
We did a little gambling, had a drink or two, all that.
It was a super evening!
You've no idea how long it is since I've been out with a man anywhere near him.
Refined and genteel, distinguished.
And you know what?
He brought me home at three in the morning, it was too much!
Ah, there's our Bordeaux.
You do like Bordeaux?
- Oh, I do, yes.
Wait till you taste this one!
It's from my own cellar!
Thank you.
Cheers!
Good, eh?
- Lovely.
When I got back, do you know I had an attack, right on the spot?
The bronchials!
But you know when I was on tour, I always wore the old mink when I went out, even in summer!
I mean you've got to watch it with your voice.
- Oh yes, of course you do.
You know, Alain, you don't look at all well.
Your mother will say I'm working you too hard again.
Men are everything.
They're all that count for me.
Next to my mother.
I mean it!
Quite a wine, eh?
Cheers!
To you.
It's tomorrow, I heard her say tomorrow.
You sure?
- Positive.
She'll be fifteen tomorrow.
Mmm!
Terrific!
If your Highnesses need anything, just holler!
If I'd indulged in one tenth the horsing around at the Ritz, I wouldn't have lasted two seconds!
Fatso!
The smoke too much for you, Fatso?
- Will you light my cigar too, eh?
Hey, what do you say?
What is it?
I brought the beer...
Uh...
I was told to take it up to... uh...
Ah, well, come in, then.
Go ahead.
It's the first time I've seen you here.
I'm filling in for someone.
- Ah.
The regular waiter has tonsilitis.
- Oh!
It's that serious!
Will they operate?
Oh yeah.
Uh, no!
Actually, it's a bad toothache.
Yeah, it's an awful bad toothache.
Alright?
Mother...
- Yes.
Will you get me a drink, please?
Don't tell me you drink beer now!
Now and then.
Well, I guess I better go then.
What's your name, young man?
George.
George.
Nice name, George.
Oh no, that, that is the bathroom.
That's the way out.
Excuse me!
My big little girl.
Drink it.
You know...
I think that I'm in love.
Well, I'm pretty soft on Claudine too.
She may not have the looks to take any prizes.
No, but she's lots of fun.
Besides, I love the smell of her.
You know, I was always touchy about scents, and she always smells good.
She's not a bad gal, eh?
Okay, let's go, guys.
Get you!
We've been here for an hour.
Didn't Cecile come along?
Cool it, kid.
Are we going to the farm then?
- Yeah.
Mmm, you're right.
She does smell good!
Yes, it's me, Dad.
How's my little girl?
I didn't wake you, did I?
No, I was just finishing my breakfast.
I tried to get your mother, but she's gone out already.
I'm calling to wish you a happy birthday, sweetheart.
- Thank you, Dad!
When are you coming?
Look, I'll do my best to get there next weekend.
Lots of love.
You too.
Goodbye, Dad.
You won't be invited to my daughter's birthday party.
I thought it was best.
- Yes, it would be best.
Listen to me, I was more than lucky to have known you.
I've never been quite so happy.
Really happy.
But?
I was waiting for you to ask a bit more of me, perhaps.
You would have said no.
Who knows.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I know that.
Who told you?
I only have to look at you.
You're a man who's always leaving anyway.
Didn't you tell me that?
Yes.
Tomorrow, or a little bit later.
Nothing will change.
Nothing will change.
No, it's just fine that way.
Have to order some more of that one.
How do you like this weather, eh?
- Yeah, we never had it so good.
Hello.
- Hello.
Afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Well?
Do you feel better?
- Yes, the rest did me good.
It was really great of you to come.
Well, what do you expect?
Ah, let's sit there in the sun.
It's nice.
So, I guess today's the day!
Today's what day?
Well, today you're fifteen!
So what?
Oh, nothing.
Here, I...
I have a little present for you.
How thoughtful of you.
I'm turning my back only because I don't want you to see the look on my face.
Oh, you're so nice!
I want to pin it on now.
I'll show you.
Just a second.
It came loose.
Here you are.
- Thanks.
So, will we see you tonight?
No, the birthday dinner is set for tonight.
Tomorrow, then?
Tomorrow we're leaving.
What?
Yes, my mother decided to go home sooner.
But I thought...
You know, I'm sad, Jo.
But what are we going to do?
Will you write?
Will I ever see you?
I've got to go now.
Thanks for all you've done.
Will you think of me?
Yes.
I've got to go to work.
Jo!
Put your helmet on.
I'm so proud of myself.
It's a delightful little bouquet!
I do have a knack for floral arrangement.
There'll be fifteen candles for her too!
Oh no, you shouldn't!
Oh, at her age, you don't worry about the number!
You wouldn't like a bit of brandy, would you?
- I would, yes.
Where's he gone to?
Say, bring us two...
two brandies, eh?
Well, here's the birthday girl!
Where'd you get the long face?
Is it because you're a year older?
Hello.
Where did you get that horrid little bug?
I think it's very pretty.
You do?
It's original.
Ah!
It's Giovanni, an old friend of mine.
He's one of our regulars.
I know, whenever you're down in the dumps, he's always good for a laugh.
A smooth dancer.
One of my favorites!
And what does he do?
- I've never known.
Well, come on!
You old pirate, you!
- Hello.
Giovanni, Mrs Délerue and her daughter, Cecile.
When you come to mother Edith, there's always something wrong.
I wanted to say goodbye.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
- Already?
Oh!
Well that calls for a drink!
Hm?
A birthday.
A goodbye.
Our little girl turns fifteen tomorrow!
Say, give us a bit of champagne!
The one under the counter.
You have a lovely daughter.
- Hey, hey, hey!
They're delicate at fifteen - too young for you.
Now then... that's enough nonsense!
Pass me the bottle, will you?
I hope it's properly chilled.
No, I'll take care of that.
If anything will shake us up, it's champagne.
I keep it on ice.
Fine, thanks.
Come on!
What are you waiting for?
Ah, about time I had a pick-me-up.
There!
Here's to your birthday!
And to a bon voyage!
Ahh... you're lucky you're able to go.
I wish I could pack up and leave like that!
Know where you're headed for?
Vaguely.
I know you, you're not much of an adventurer, are you?
But you'll wind up just like me and throw in the towel.
Old age.
Not bad, eh?
Ciao.
An hour before the train leaves.
Lots of time.
Yes?
Yes.
Our bags are ready if you'll send someone to get them.
Yes, Ma'am.
- Thank you.
I doubt if we'll come back here next summer though.
Ah, the same old thing.
It never seems to fail.
It's impossible to shut the suitcase and when I came it was half empty.
Haven't bought a thing either!
Oh, you've got to say goodbye to Edith, eh?
Yes?
Come in!
Will you please take my baggage down to the lobby... and those too.
Thank you.
Do you mind, dear?
Is that all?
- Yes, that's all.
Very good, Ma'am.
Wait!
Have I forgotten anything?
No, I don't think so.
Let's go, dear.
One of the aliens has just entered the cave with the Queen's champion.
We must sacrifice them both.
Yeah, very high grade too.
And you say the light that killed Vega Nexos came from in here?
Then there should be some trace.
What are you doing?
I'm restoring the holy mountain, to appease the spirit of Aggedor!
Blor, are you alright?
Come on.
That's it.
First the armoury, and now this.
I have given the alien's cave back to the sacred mountain and made a sacrifice to Aggedor!
Sacrifice?
An alien - and the Queen's champion.
They both entered the cave just as I set off the charge.
Which alien, Ettis?
I don't know.
A new one - tall, white hair.
The Doctor - our one friend among the aliens.
He saved my life!
It's impossible.
What are we gonna do?
Open up the cave with that!
But you don't know how to make it work.
Then I'll learn.
You make one mistake and you're gonna kill your alien friend!
Too late now.
It's a most magnificent installation.
If only we can get trisilicate production up to the necessary level, we shall be able to do our own refining.
Oh yes, I'm sure.
The Doctor's been gone an awfully long time, hasn't he?
Of course, only Eckersley understands the new refinery fully.
I'm sure he'd be glad to explain it to you.
Oh, I'll look forward to that.
Emergency!
Emergency!
Unauthorised use of explosives has produced a rock fall in the cavern area.
The cavern!
That's where the Doctor's gone!
I knew it!
Something's happened to him.
I'm gonna find him!
Really, it would be most unwise.
I'm sure a proper rescue operation will be mounted.
On this planet?
I don't trust any of them.
Right!
These Earth females seem to have a distressing tendency to rash action.
Engineer Eckersley - please return to the communications room immediately!
The spirit of Aggedor has killed the Queen's champion.
Yes, something killed him, poor chap.
And it would have killed me too if you hadn't come to the rescue.
I owed you my life, Doctor.
Now, we're even.
Wait!
I think I can help you if you'll let me.
Don't trust him, Gebek!
You've paid your debt.
Now let's get out of here before Ortron's guards find us.
Why should you wish to help us?
For the good of Peladon.
I have a special interest in this planet.
What can you do?
Find out who's using Aggedor to frighten your miners, for one thing.
Nobody uses Aggedor!
His spirit is angry with us!
Possibly.
But if you can persuade your miners to go back to work,
I can persuade the Federation to improve conditions now and not wait until the war is over.
The miners will not work while Aggedor is angry.
Exactly - and that's just what somebody wants.
Do you think it's just a coincidence that Aggedor appeared in that cave just as I started my investigations?
Look out!
Soldiers!
Gebek!
There he is!
This way!
Come on.
Hey!
Hey, you in there!
I'm afraid I'm lost.
Ah, hey look!
I know you're in there!
Come on, I saw you - please?
!
I only want to find my way out of these tunnels!
Alright, chum, here I am!
What's all the panic?
There's been an explosion in the cavern.
The Doctor was there and the young female went to find him.
Neither has returned.
The refinery!
It must be those miners again.
Lord!
What's she doing in there?
She must have triggered off the automatic defence system.
How unfortunate!
What a catastrophe!
- Has she been harmed?
- That depends.
If she's been under it too long, her brain will be...
We'd better go and get her out of there.
But our lives have always been the same, Doctor work and sleep - little else.
We earn barely enough to feed our families.
The Federation told us things'd be better.
- So they are for the nobles of the court.
- We got nothing as usual!
And now, they take the sonic lance down into the mine to rip the heart out of the sacred mountain.
No wonder Aggedor's angry with these people.
Yes, well I don't believe all that.
I think the Aggedor that we've seen is nothing but technological trickery.
- But who's causing it?
- I dunno, but I'm going to find out.
- And what are we going to do?
- Nothing!
We don't want any more idiotic tricks like that attack on the armoury.
- But we nearly succeeded, didn't we?
- That's right!
You didn't stand a chance!
Those armoury doors are electronically controlled from the communications room.
That sort of thing just gets people killed for nothing.
Now, please, all of you...
Just sit tight and give me a chance to work things out, mm?
Very well, Doctor.
We shall take your advice.
Thank you, Gebek.
I believe the Doctor to be our friend.
Now there is to be no more fighting till I give the word- is that understood?
- Ettis?
- Yes.
- Right, Doctor.
- Splendid.
Now I'd like to have a talk to Queen Thalira, preferably without Ortron breathing down the back of my neck.
There are many secret ways from here to the citadel.
Preba knows them all.
He shall lead us.
The rest of you - stay here.
I say...we attack again, and this time we shall succeed now we know how to open the armoury door.
Here, Sarah...are you alright?
- Yes.
- Sure?
I think so.
But... what was it?
You set off the automatic defence system.
There's a bit of magic to scare off the natives.
All that just to protect your precious machinery?
- You're very keen on security.
- Yes, on planets like this it pays to be.
What were you trying to do?
I was lost - that's all.
There was someone in there and I wanted to ask the way.
There's nobody in there.
The whole place is on shutdown.
- I tell you I saw someone moving...
- Hallucinations.
You're still suffering from my little bag of tricks.
I tell you I did see someone in there before all the noise and lights started.
There's nobody in there...
and nobody's getting in there.
- Are you well enough to move?
- Can you walk?
- Course.
- Then I suggest we return.
Alright, yes.
Oh!
The Doctor... have you heard what's happened to him?
No.
Let us return to the communications room.
- By now there may be news.
- Yes.
Are you coming?
Listen!
- What is it?
- Soldiers.
Searching the tunnels for me.
Ortron doesn't give up easily, does he?
Can we lose him?
Not without blocking the way we wish to follow.
If we only distract their attention in some way?
- That's it!
I'll lead them off.
- No, if they catch you...
A load of clod-hopping soldiers catch me?
I've played in these tunnels since I was a boy.
Quick - hide in there.
There he is!
After him!
Halt, Gebek.
You're under arrest.
Right, back to the citadel.
Blor has been slain by the wrath of Aggedor like the others.
All of this trouble began as soon as the Doctor arrived on Peladon.
That does not prove that the Doctor is our enemy.
If it was the spirit of Aggedor...
Your Majesty, the Doctor was seen with Gebek and the other rebels
He helped them escape a second time.
But why, Ortron?
!
Why would he turn against us?
!
Because he has been sent here to stir up the miners.
He was my father's friend.
He said he wanted to help us.
A trick - to gain your confidence.
And anyway, after fifty years, who can be sure it's the same man?
What is your counsel, Lord Ortron?
The revolt must be crushed and crushed now.
The Doctor must be captured and executed!
You're overdoing things.
Alright, so...you need an alarm system.
Does it have to be something that drives people out of their minds?
You must remember - we're strangers on this planet.
We're not very popular, therefore we have to protect ourselves.
- Protect yourselves?
!
- Peladonians are still close to barbarism.
They have a great distrust of progress.
Maybe that's because they're not getting anything out of it.
You've got to show them that progress will give them a better life.
It's no good, Sarah.
The only thing these people understand...
Help!
Help!
We're being attacked!
Be silent, alien!
You're wasting your breath!
Inside!
You won't be harmed...
so long as you do what you're told.
What is it you want us to do?
I want you to open the armoury door!
That is out of the question.
Natives of primitive planets are forbidden access to sophisticated weapons.
Open the door!
Only Eckersley knows how to operate the controls.
I do not.
I advise you to try - for your sake and for hers.
We must move quietly now, Doctor.
The nearer we get to the citadel, the greater the danger.
Hurry, alien.
Must I prove that I mean what I say?
Your Majesty?
Lord Ortron, what is it?
There's been another attack on the Federation armoury.
The inner door has been opened.
You see, your Majesty, already the rebellion has begun.
This is what comes of softness with the common people.
You've betrayed me!
You switched on the alarm!
I warned you I did not fully understand the control mechanism.
No!
Can't you see he's telling the truth?
Now you've got what you came for - why don't you go while you still can?
That's a good idea, alien - and I'll take you with me.
- No!
- As a hostage!
Ambassador, do something!
You leave her alone!
Come back!
Come back!
Oh, dear!
Eckersley!
Eckersley, please!
Eckersley, please wake up!
The armoury has been robbed!
Wake up!
The Doctor's friend has been taken hostage!
Eckersley, please - wake up!
Oh, let go!
It won't do you no good!
We've got the weapons!
Seize her!
Do not let her escape!
But you...you don't understand!
I didn't want to go with them!
I was trying to escape!
Take her to the temple!
We're almost at the citadel now, Doctor.
- Ettis!
What new folly is this?
- No folly, Gebek - victory!
Now that we've got the new Federation weapons, we'll see who rules on Peladon!
I must go with them, Doctor.
Perhaps I can prevent more madness.
Yes, don't worry about me, old chap
I think I know my way from now on.
Good luck.
Yes, well, that's really done it.
With modern weapons in their hands, there's no end to the damage these lunatics can do.
I know, Eckersley, and it's all my fault.
- Yes.
- I'll resign immediately.
The disgrace!
Well it's done now.
There's no point in going on about it.
I think I could have faced death for myself in an honourable cause...
But he threatened the girl.
I was unable to stand by and let him inflict violence on a fellow creature.
- Where is she now?
- Presumably, she's still Ettis' prisoner.
No, Ambassador, she was recaptured by the guards.
Captured?
She's a victim, not a criminal.
Chancellor Ortron said she was helping them.
- Where is she now?
- She's been taken to the temple.
No, no, now look, this is all...
a ridiculous mistake.
You were in collusion with the rebel, Ettis.
Of course I wasn't!
It was because of you that the Ambassador was forced to open the armoury door.
- Is that not true?
- Yes, in a way, I suppose it was.
Then you admit your guilt?
The Ambassador opened the door because Ettis threatened to kill me.
You can't say that means I was helping him.
Your whole plot is clear to me now.
You arrived on this planet with only one aim, to stir up the common people...
- That's not true...!
- And overthrow the traditional rulers, the nobility of Peladon.
You joined with the rebel, Ettis while the Doctor allies himself with the other traitor, Gebek!
Do forgive me, old chap, but you've got it all wrong.
Arrest him!
They said you'd been blown up in the cavern!
I very nearly was.
Ettis has just robbed the armoury.
Yes, I know.
I've just met him in the tunnels.
So, Doctor, you too admit your guilt!
My dear chap, you're just not listening, are you?
No one's admitting anything.
But if you'll take my advice, you'll try and get on the right side of Gebek.
Without him, you've got a full scale revolution on your hands.
I need no advice from spies and saboteurs!
Just take me to the Queen.
There's a good chap.
There's no need to trouble the Queen, Doctor.
I shall deal with you myself.
Here in the temple, my will is law.
I shall consult the judgement of Aggedor.
Oh, mighty Aggedor, make known thy will.
How shall we punish those who have offended against thee?
Believe me, your Majesty
Chancellor Ortron has totally misinterpreted the facts.
Engineer Eckersley, can you confirm the Ambassador's story?
I can't confirm anything, your Majesty.
I got hit on the head when it all started.
But you know that Sarah is not in league with the rebels?
It seems highly unlikely...
though I suppose...no.
Well?
Well, it was because of her that you finally did open the door.
I suppose it could have been a put-up job.
Nonsense!
The whole idea's absurd!
The girl was Ettis' prisoner - not his accomplice.
You must believe that, your Majesty?
I'm prepared to trust your judgement, Ambassador.
But what I believe is of little importance.
In the temple, Ortron's power is absolute.
There is nothing I can do!
Well?
And what did he say?
You have blasphemed in the temple of Aggedor, therefore by Aggedor shall you both be punished!
Both?
She shares your guilt - she will share your punishment.
Prepare the pit!
But your Majesty, whatever your traditions,
I beg you in the name of mercy to override them.
Oh, I wish that I could, Ambassador.
But you are the Queen.
Yes, a Queen who's looked upon as little more than a child!
Many things have changed on Peladon, your Majesty.
Perhaps this too...should change?
You will come with me.
You will admit us to the temple.
- Hurry - cast them into the pit!
- Don't be a fool!
No doors are barred to the Queen - stand aside!
Where is the girl?
!
We dema...
The decision is no longer yours or mine, your Majesty.
The girl and the Doctor have gone to face the judgement of Aggedor.
- You alright, Sarah?
- I don't think anything's broken.
What are they going to do - just leave us here?
No, I think there's more to it than that.
Ooh... that smell.
It's sort of musky.
Like...
like the lion house at the zoo...
Doctor, there's something in here with us - something alive!
Yes, I know.
Now don't move, Sarah.
Well, Mrs. Lockhurst, and judge Lockhurst...
I think we had a real good day.
Yes.
He only banged on the desk with your paperweight twice.
It's obvious what our problem is.
We should have never married in high school
I knew it wasn't gonna last.
Why don't we get into that next week?
Seventeen is just too young to know a person.
She said she'd fill out.
- You never filled out.
- Well, you sure did.
- Should I schedule another hearing for next week?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, Bob, you remember Don, don't you?
Yeah.
Hi, Don.
How are your feet?
Oh, as sore as ever.
Hmm.
Pain and the poet.
We trod the same path-
Tread... the same
- Well.
So, that's how you earn your daily bread?
- You know, life is a lot like a loaf of bread.
- Really?
You know, it's like people are thin slices of life.
The crust, the caraway seeds, the crumbs-
They're all part of it.
- Don't you see it, Bob?
- Now that you put it that way, yeah.
Oh, my writer.
Well, I gotta get back to the garret and start tickling the old Underwood.
Don, are you still writing articles for, Pharmaceuticals Illustrated?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
My next article's called "Iodine, Schmiodine."
Could be the most important cut-and-bruise article ever written.
- I'm sure it will be.
- You can't be sure.
The only thing I can be sure of... is this redhead over here.
Huh?
She's my sweet patootie.
Yeah, a darn good little receptionist too.
Well, I'll see you later.
Oh, listen.
Remember that little thing we discussed?
It's our secret.
Absolutely.
Bye-bye, Don.
Bob, guess what.
I'm getting married.
- Well, that's great.
- I know.
That wasn't by any chance the little secret?
Oh, it sure was-
But I want it to stay that way.
Bob, this is strictly between you and me.
- Mum's the word.
- Thank you.
- Oh, Emily isn't home.
- Oh.
I'll tell her later.
- Jerry, guess what.
I'm getting married.
- What?
It's true
- But it's a secret, so don't tell anybody.
I don't believe it.
Well, I mean, I believe it.
That's fantastic.
Who's the lucky guy?
- Don Fezler.
- You mean the guy with the feet?
Jerry,Jerry.
He's more than that.
He's a writer.
He's a creative, sensitive human being.
- Yeah, I know.
The guy with the feet.
- Right.
The guy with the feet.
That's terrific, Carol.
Have you set the date yet?
- No, not yet.
- Good.
Well, I mean, we got plans to make.
Gifts to buy, halls to rent.
You mind if I tell Bob?
- He already knows, but he's the only other one.
- Right.
Carol, you waited, but you got yourself a real winner.
Oh, thanks, Jer.
A real loser, Bob.
We can't let Carol marry that guy.
Fine.
We'll kill him.
Bob, you know what I mean.
He's the dregs.
He's the bottom of the barrel.
He's nothing.
Don't get me wrong.
I like him, but, he's not right for Carol.
Well, he's all right.
He's just a little vague.
I mean, anyway, it's Carol's decision.
I've never seen her so happy and bubbling over.
Oh, yeah, she's a regular Ronald McDonald.
That doesn't mean she knows what she's doing, Bob.
I mean, the guy's out of work half the time-
And what happens if he loses this job?
With those feet, how's he gonna stand in the unemployment line?
I understand this new cut-and-bruise article of his... is supposed to open up a lot of new doors for him.
Come on, Bob, we can't let this happen.
We gotta head it off.
Without killing him.
Well, what are the plans?
Which plans?
Plans,yeah.
Well, I'm gonna throw this big engagement party... for you and Don at my place next, Tuesday.
Jerry, thank you.
Thank you.
- What's Don's favorite food?
- Anything.
Aha.
I get it.
We're gonna poison him.
What do you think?
Well, the O.K. Burger Corral, so far, is, okay.
It's clean and attractive, and it has a cute theme.
If the food's any good, I'll give them a good review.
Wow.
My girl's a newspaperman.
Gosh.
Three weeks on the Herald... and already you're doing your first hamburger feature.
With my own byline.
I just can't decide on the title.
Well, I still like the sound of "Chopped Meat ls My Beat."
We should get great service
- You know, because they want a good review.
Oh, Howard, I don't want them to know they're being reviewed.
I just want to be treated like a regular customer.
All right, here's your menus.
Make sure you're ready to order when I get back.
"Service... surly."
Look at this.
All the hamburgers are named after famous cowboys.
The Jesse James Burger.
The Buffalo Bill Burger.
You know, I may have the Earp Burger.
Well, Bob only likes his hamburgers with mustard... so I think I'll order him a Yellow Belly.
All right, who's gonna open?
Check to you, Howard.
I'll have the,
Hickok Burger... and a Billy the Kidney Bean Salad.
I'll have a Grub Stake Burger with Doc Hollandaise sauce.
Yeah, and I'll have a Yellow Belly and,
What's your name for a plain tuna fish sandwich?
Tuna fish sandwich.
That's a good name for it.
Howdy, partner.
Smile when you say that, Howard.
It's an interesting place.
- I'll be the judge of that.
- Oh, that's right.
We're having dinner with Lois Lane tonight, aren't we?
Howard, will you go to the men's room?
I don't have to.
No, but I need you to check it out so that I can review it.
Emily and I have already checked out the Schoolmarms' Room.
Ah.
I get it.
Research.
- What do I look for?
- Tumbleweeds.
So, what's new at the office?
Oh, not much.
I got a new parking space... the coffee machine's out of order and Carol's getting married.
- You're kidding.
- No.
Parking space number 17.
No.
Who's she getting married to?
Oh.
Oh, that.
Don Fezler.
- Oh, no, Bob.
Not the guy with the feet.
- That's right.
- What's wrong with his feet?
- Well, they don't work right.
Kind of like the rest of Don.
You know, Jerry had the same reaction.
I mean, Carol's the only one who doesn't think she's making a mistake.
Maybe she's running scared.
Oh, but hobbling through life with Don is certainly not the answer.
Well, he couldn't be any worse than most of the single guys you meet.
It's a jungle out there, Bob.
I was really lucky to find Howard.
It's that tough, huh?
- It's tough and it's cold.
- You haven't even tasted it yet.
No, I didn't mean-
That's okay.
I just work here.
"Service- extremely surly."
Wow!
That Gunfighter Room is really terrific.
You know, they carried the cowboy theme right in there.
You should see it.
- How was it?
- Perfect.
Except, one saddle was out of order.
Hey, I really like what you guys have done with your apartment.
It's a lot nicer than what it used to be.
Thank you.
Don?
This isn't our apartment. lt's Jerry's.
On.
Who's Jerry?
My friend from the office- The orthodontist.
The guy with the nose?
Don, I couldn't help noticing your sandals.
Oh,yeah.
You like them, huh?
Yeah.
They're called Dirt Shoes.
- How's it going, Jimmy?
- lt's Jerry.
Oh.
Right.
Right.
It's a very nice party.
Oh, thank you.
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
It's a shame that more of your friends couldn't come.
Hey, no sweat.
What are friends anyway?
My friends are the trees-
The wind that whispers.
And, of course, Lou Benson, but I haven't seen him since the seventh grade.
Can you believe that clown?
Jerry, I don't know why you call him a clown.
Just because he, walks funny and his... pants are kind of baggy and... people laugh at him, I mean, that doesn't mean he's a clown.
Well, those are some very good reasons.
I guess what Bob means- He's not wearing a red rubber nose.
Bob, you're absolutely right.
I've never seen Carol look so happy.
Don is a little strange.
Oh.
You too, Ellen?
I mean, just give the guy a chance.
I like Don.
Makes a lot of sense to me.
Then again, maybe I'm wrong about Don.
You know what he said when I told him I was a navigator?
He said, "Life is a jetliner.
"You've got your ups.
You've got your downs.
"And whatever you do... try to get a window seat."
- That is kind of beautiful.
- Thank you, Bob.
Hey, everybody.
Everybody, could I, have your attention here a minute?
Oh, hey, that's kind of expensive.
Yeah, it's nice.
Listen, I'm gonna be marrying-
- Carol.
- Carol here.
Anyway, I don't want any minister putting words in our mouths.
I don't want, any rings.
We don't even want a wedding cake.
- How about a gift?
- Well, we're not fanatics.
Anyway, this is what I'm going to be saying to Carol at the wedding and I'd just like to kind of bounce it off of you.
Don, honey, maybe these people aren't interested.
Oh.
Well, whoever doesn't want to hear it can leave.
I mean,you know, we're not bulls in a pen.
I mean, we can come and go.
Anyway, I'm glad you've all decided to stay, and here's what it is.
"Now we're young and firm of flesh...
"and our love will endure...
"even as we grow old and our hair falls out...
"and our jaws grow slack...
"and our skin becomes wrinkled and loose...
- and our joints begin to"-
- Don.
Don.
Don.
- I think that'll be enough.
Thank you.
- Was that too sentimental?
- Yeah.
- Well, that's only the first draft.
- I'm gonna get some ice.
- Yeah, well, I think we gotta go too.
- Come on, Howard.
- Yeah, well, it was nice seeing you, Don.
Oh, yeah. it's my pleasure.
Listen-
Good luck with your writing career.
Send me a copy of that article.
- Well, it's just about hamburgers.
- Life is a hamburger.
I thought you said life was a jetliner.
No.
It's a hamburger.
Fry some of the fat away, take a couple of bites- it's gone.
And so are we.
- Bye-bye.
- Nice talking to you.
- Bye.
- Well, what do you think, Bob?
It, could be a hamburger.
Then again, it could be a jetliner.
Well, we'll get back to you on that, Don.
- Good night.
Good night, Carol.
- Night.
Well, we might as well be on our way too, huh, baby?
Don,we really should help Jerry clean up.
Oh, I wish I had time, but I-
I mean, I gotta get my feet in some hot water.
And besides that, I'm really tired.
I know, I know.
Listen.
You go on, and I'll call you in the morning.
I can't leave Jerry with this mess.
You go on.
- You're fantastic.
- Oh.
Imagine what F. Scott Fitzgerald could have done... if he'd have had you instead of Zelda.
Bye.
- Where'd everybody go?
- Well, Don had to soak his feet.
- Where?
- Jerry.
- Not here, at home.
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on.
I'll help you clean up.
- No, don't bother with that.
The cleaning lady will get it in the morning.
Sit down.
So, old Carol's gonna get herself married, huh?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take that great big step with that terrific guy.
- Isn't he something, Jerry?
- Yeah, he's really something else.
- Carol, I'm gonna hate to lose you.
- Aw.
I'll be around.
Yeah, but it won't be the same.
Hey, Jerry, you know, maybe you and-
Carol, that never happened.
No.
Well, neither did this.
- Hi, Jerry.
You waiting for a bus?
- Oh, hi, Bob.
No, I just came into the office early to catch up on the sports.
- Oh.
Come on in.
- Oh, yeah, sure.
Thought you played, tennis every Wednesday morning.
Oh, do I, Bob?
Every Wednesday for the past three years.
Oh, really, Bob?
- What's that?
- Oh, this is called the Breakfast Sizzler.
It's a... hamburger with an orange slice on a bran muffin.
I promised Ellen I'd review it for her.
Boo.
Bob, you'll never guess what happened last night between Carol and me after you left.
- What happened?
You get involved?
- Boy, did I ever.
- You're kidding.
- No, and I don't even know why I did it, Bob.
I mean, there we were, alone in my apartment.
I was sitting here.
She was sitting there, about where you are.
I looked into her eyes, and all of a sudden I couldn't think straight.
The hair on the back of my neck got all bristly.
Then I... touched her.
- Strange feeling, Bob.
I didn't know what-
- Jerry?
I don't think we should go any further.
Bob, there was passion.
There was chemistry between us.
I mean, we had a real relationship.
Jerry, you mean you're in love with Carol?
Oh, no.
Nothing like that.
What's love, Bob?
I mean, love's a word.
Who knows what love is?
- Don probably does.
- Don!
Maybe that's why I did it.
I just don't want Carol to marry that guy.
Well, are you gonna marry her?
No, I'm not gonna marry anybody right now.
Then you gotta let her go.
I mean, Don's made a commitment, and you haven't.
Are you kidding?
It's not gonna be easy after last night to just get rid of her.
I mean, she's crazy about me, Bob.
Okay.
Here we are.
Coming.
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
- Oh, hi, Carol.
- Hi, Emily.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure, but shouldn't you be at work?
Yeah, I should be, but I've got something on my mind... and I've gotta talk to somebody... who isn't holding a duck.
Oh.
Well, Lucky and I don't have to be in class for a few minutes.
What is it?
Is it something about Don?
No, no, no.
It's about Jerry.
Oh?
Yeah, I stayed,
I stayed at his apartment for a little while after everybody left last night.
- Oh.
- And, you know, things just sort of happened.
- Uh-huh.
- I'm not gonna bore you with the details.
No, well, you know- Whatever you feel.
I'm just trying to think why I consciously threw myself at Jerry.
Well, Carol, I know so little about it.
It couldn't have been a romance, could it?
Well, I don't know.
I mean, that depends on what went on.
I mean...
- I mean, a little or a lot?
- Really, it's not important.
Oh, it didn't mean that much.
I mean-
You know what's important here is that I'm engaged to Don, right?
- Right.
- Then why am I fooling around with Jerry?
Emily, I have a bonafide marriage proposal here.
Well, look, Carol.
You don't have to worry.
I mean, there's no rush.
Carol, I didn't get married till I was almost 30.
Wonderful.
Then I won't worry until two years ago.
Carol, there is absolutely no panic.
Ah, yes, there is, Emily.
Yes.
Listen.
I want a full marriage, complete with children.
- And that can take time.
- Well, I know.
Can't you see why I need your advice, and why I'm in a hurry?
Well, Carol, I-
I really don't know what advice to give you.
Oh.
Okay.
I'll ask the duck.
Carol, look, there is one thing I'm sure of... and that is that you should not marry anybody... unless you're absolutely sure that you're in love with him.
Well, I'm not really in love with Jerry.
- Well, are you in love with Don?
- Oh, I don't know.
I guess maybe.
I mean
- Well, he is a little possessive sometimes... and when you get right down to it, he can be annoying and I guess a little boring.
What do you think of him?
- Carol, you really want to know?
- Oh, I do.
Now you be honest.
Well, I never did think Don was right for you, and I do agree with you.
I mean, he's boring and he's annoying and-
Did you say "insensitive"?
- No.
- I think you should add that.
Just a minute, Emily.
Do you think your marriage is such a bargain?
He is not a perfect person, Bob.
- Oh.
- Listen.
This is a man-
Hello.
Dr., Robinson's office.
Ricky Rasmussen.
Just a minute.
Yeah, he's with Dr. Robinson right now.
Yeah, I can get a message to him, Mrs. Rasmussen.
"Ricky, You did it again.
You left without feeding the dog and making your"-
Mrs. Rasmussen?
Yeah, could you slow down just a bit?
I don't take shorthand.
Reached the end of your rope.
Best years of your life.
I don't know what's wrong with kids today either, Mrs. Rasmussen.
All right, I'll get it to him.
Good-bye.
Not as easy as it looks, huh, Bob?
Oh, glad to see you.
I was beginning to wonder if you were ever gonna show up.
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.
I was talking to Emily.
- Oh.
Anything important?
- No, no, no.
Just my life.
Yeah, I was talking to Jerry about the same thing.
Bob, now what happened between Jerry and me doesn't change anything.
It, sure fooled him.
Well, I guess I better talk to him, huh?
Yeah.
You gonna get that?
Yeah.
Sure.
Hello?
No, he hasn't come out yet, Mrs. Rasmussen.
You wanna add something?
Okay.
He'll have children of his own one day.
I'll get that message to him.
Right.
Good-bye.
Oh,
Ricky, you wanna read that?
Kids today.
Listen, I'll buzz Jerry, and
I'd appreciate it if you'd go in my office and settle this as soon as possible.
- Hmm.
- And... show me how to buzz Jerry.
Hello?
Yeah, Bob?
Who's next?
You're next Jerry.
Can you come out here a minute?
Sure.
Well, I'm gonna call everything off, Bob.
I just need more time.
You know what you're gonna say to him?
I don't know exactly what I'm gonna say... but I'm sure when I sit in your magic chair... it'll all come together.
Yeah, Bob, what's up?
Carol's in my office.
She wants to talk to you.
- Oh.
She was pretty shook up, huh?
- A little.
Well, love can do funny things, Bob.
Don't worry about it.
I'll let her down real easy.
Hey!
How come you're sitting on my little Miss Muffet's tuffet?
She's using my tuffet.
Oh.
Oh, I get what you're doing.
- You switched places.
- I'll tell Carol you're here.
Oh, there's no rush.
I just dropped by to, show her the new draft on the vows.
- Hey, hi, Jimmy.
- Hi, Don.
- Jerry, is, everything okay?
- Yeah?
Oh, yeah, it's fine, Bob.
She took it just great.
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, Don.
Bob, could I use your office for another talk with Don?
Yeah, sure.
Wait till you read the second draft of the vows.
- Oh, Don?
- Huh?
When you and Carol are finished...
talking, I have a... free hour if you, you know, just wanna stay in there.
- Why would I wanna do that?
- I don't know just a hunch.
Dr. Robinson's office.
Yeah, he's on his way home, Mrs. Rasmussen.
I know he's very tough to handle.
Look at it this way.
Life is a hamburger.
There you are.
Chew it slowly.
If you're thirsty, there's your water.
And if you're not, just let it roll off your back.
- You know, it's a heartwarming scene.
- Hmm?
A man, his wife and their duck.
Except it's not our duck.
It belongs to the school.
- Then why doesn't he live there?
- Because the janitor is afraid of ducks.
You know, I looked all through the paper... and I can't find Ellen's article...
- and I was sure it was in today's paper.
- Oh, dear.
I hope it's not the section I lined Luckys cage with.
- I'm afraid it is.
- Oh.
"Chicago's Best Burger Bets."
Oh.
How'd the O.K. Burger Corral do?
Which one do you want first, Ellen's opinions, or the duck's?
(narrator) Dresden - the great, beautiful and historic city so far barely touched by the war, believed by its inhabitants to be somehow inviolate - became, in the technical language of the experts, a severe case of over-bombing.
(woman) We had so many refugees who had come from the Eastern Front that at this point the city had swollen to double its size.
The only men we had in the city were from the veterans' hospital, blind and crippled.
The blind were trying to carry the cripples and couldn't see their way.
And some people who tried to walk along, they were pulled in by the fire.
They all of a sudden disappeared right in front of you.
There is such a draught in a firestorm like that.
It's a most horrible thing.
You have to save yourself or try to get as far away from the fire because the draught pulls you in.
(narrator) Next day came the Americans.
A Western demonstration of support for the Russians, now less than 100 miles away.
Over 1300 Flying Fortresses to pound the ruins of a city.
(Gray) The city was in flames but after three days we had to go in and try to find the people and take them out of the ruins.
And sometimes a washbasinful contained nine, ten people, because their size had shrunk to just a small amount.
We just couldn't believe that this was a whole person.
And this picture is just terrible.
I saw sometimes two people close together who maybe in despair had...
It was one tiny little figure.
(narrator) In the centre of the city, cordoned off from the survivors, they built great funeral pyres.
(Gray) There was no time to dig individual graves.
We had to dig mass graves.
They tried to identify by jewellery or by belongings, but many people could not be identified.
Later in the ruins you found inscriptions:
"Hans, are you alive?"
"Martha, are you still in the ruins?"
(narrator) Industrial damage was slight.
The railway was working again in three days.
But over 100,000 died.
Dresden was another monument to total war.
(narrator) The last Nazi newsreel the Germans saw.
It features scratch units in action on the Eastern Front, on German soil.
The slogans now play on sexual fear of the Red hordes.
The main propaganda weapon - stories of rape, stereotyped accounts backed by dubious pictures in which the corpses may, for once, be German.
Tales of brutal soldiery told in the stock language of racial hatred - beasts, rape, animals, bestiality.
Sie haben meine Schwester und meine Mutter in bestialischer und tierischer Weise misshandelt.
Refugees from Germany's eastern provinces and the occupied territories.
Families were separated, never to be reunited.
Thousands died from drowning, thousands from shelling.
The great German Reich was shrinking.
The Germans coming home.
On the Western Front the Allied air forces ranged at will beyond the Rhine, paralysing all movement in preparation for the final assault.
With bombs, rockets and cannonfire they struck at bridges, railways, roads, at a single horse and cart.
It was my duty to tell Hitler that from the point of view of armaments the war was lost.
And I did it in several memorandums, and the harshest one was 19 March '45 in which I told him very bluntly, which nobody dared to tell, that the war will be finished within four or six weeks.
(narrator) Hitler boasted of losses in infantry made good by countless numbers of new units.
He himself presented medals to his new recruits.
What they lacked in experience they made up for in National Socialist ardour.
A young runner reports how he carried weapons up to the front line.
Als der Russe näher heranrückte, bestand meine Aufgabe darin,
Meldungen zu den einzelnen Kompaniegefechtsständen... (narrator) His reward, an Iron Cross Second Class.
March 24.
The Rhine crossing.
Montgomery's last showpiece battle.
Upstream the Americans slipped across almost unopposed.
The goal the field commanders had in mind
- Berlin.
Across the Rhine now.
From the Dutch border to the Black Forest in the south, the Allied columns pushed on into the heart of Germany through scenes that were the commonplace of war.
Towns and villages that burned as the towns and villages of Poland, France, Russia,
Yugoslavia and Greece had burned.
But for these civilians, for the women and children who saw the war go past, there were no ghettos and no gas chambers.
Only, in some, a sense of anger.
(woman) The first time I have had hatred against Hitler and the Nazis was not hatred against the terror regime, it was hatred like among gangsters.
Hitler promised us to win half of the world and he asked us to help him and so we have done, and now we have nothing.
We have only our clothes.
(narrator) The collapse of Nazi government had left a vacuum.
The advancing troops were politically innocent.
Their methods were rough and ready.
(man) The Bürgermeister's the first one you meet.
He'd have his sash on and he would inform us that he was not a Nazi, the town council was not.
We would promptly round them all up and ship them out because we knew we had all the Nazis.
You put soldiers with townspeople and after the first couple of hours of a small amount of tension when both parties realised that the other was not gonna stab them suddenly, we'd find ourselves swapping hard tack or chocolate
for a cooked meal by one of the German families.
And they in turn would show us family pictures - not the uniform ones - and then you'd find a GI showing his family to them.
It's funny how the feeling could change so rapidly.
Some woman came to me.
In addition to trying to offer me her own services, she was trying to obtain something else.
I looked at her.
I was feeling particularly mean that day.
My father was sick and the Red Cross had given me information that my brother-in-law had been killed in Germany.
Word had just come to me and I was about ready to tear anyone apart with my own two hands.
And I said in desperation almost:
"Don't bother me.
You're dealing with a Jew."
"You don't want anything to do with me."
And she looked at me and she said, "Aber Sie sind ein weißer Jude", which you can translate, "But you are a white Jew."
And I did everything to restrain myself from just belting her in the mouth.
(narrator) The camps were overrun.
Many Germans had known of them.
Others had preferred not to know.
Now they were forced to see.
In one place the mayor and his wife went home and hanged themselves.
This is Buchenwald.
Those who had survived deportation, slave labour, selection for the death camps, starvation, were from every country in Europe, of all callings, of many religions, many political faiths.
Some turned on their oppressors.
Allied prisoners were freed.
(cheering)
(narrator) German soldiers went into captivity.
Displaced persons, ordinary Germans, prisoners of war passed on the roads and had nothing to say to each other.
Germany was an ant heap some giant had kicked to pieces.
Here and there, looting.
Brief opportunities to celebrate the collapse of the system.
The victors had their own views on law and order.
Some property was still sacred.
(Speer) In April '45, Berlin was more ruins than a town.
In the centre of Berlin, one could find almost no building which was still intact.
But it was my wish to have the Berlin Philharmonic having a concert for the last time.
I knew that it would be my last concert for a long time, perhaps forever, and I invited friends and as many people as possible to go in.
We were sitting there in our coats because there was no heating.
It was cold and it was shivering and in this atmosphere of destruction and misery the concert started and we started with the last part of the Götterdämmerung.
(narrator) Hitler no longer made public appearances.
More and more he withdrew to his underground headquarters beneath the Imperial Chancellery - the bunker.
(Speer) When I came back from this concert for the military conference, we came into the bunker and Hitler was almost out of his mind.
And Goebbels was already there.
And Hitler showed to us the wires he'd just received of the death of Roosevelt.
Goebbels was jumping up and saying, "That's it.
That's it!"
"Now we have got it.
Now I think everything will turn to the better."
(narrator) In the east, over railway lines converted to the Russian gauge, the Russian command was piling up vast supplies of material.
Six armies were involved.
Their object: to smash the German forces on the approaches to Berlin and take the capital of Nazi Germany.
On the 75th anniversary of Lenin's birth, 16 April 1945, the massed artillery opened fire.
My heart was going smaller and I get very anxious because I knew that the attack began.
(narrator) The first barrage was less effective than Zhukov had hoped.
The Germans were still secure in their second line of defence.
In the centre of the front, opposite Berlin, there were 400 guns to the mile to open a way for the assault tanks.
The Red Army was over the Oder, reinforcing and breaking out of its bridgeheads.
The armoured columns pushed ahead against desperate resistance.
Some of our young boys, they jumped out of the holes, had their Panzerfaust and they were shooting to the tanks and destroyed more than four tanks, and the others were shooting with their guns and killed all the Russian soldiers.
And the Russians must have been before in a Magazin, or in a sweet factory, because they had all their arms full of sweets and chocolate.
Everybody in our unit was 15 and 16 and they were running onto the street with the chocolate.
(narrator) In the west it was a different story.
Sidestepping pockets of the enemy the Allied columns moved east.
(man) You could pick up the telephone and ring up the next village to see if it was still German-occupied.
Say, "Hello, what's happening down there?"
One had almost moved into a dreamlike and unreal situation where towns and villages flew by with no resistance at all.
Normal countryside, no damage at all.
And every day one said to oneself, "Surely this can't go on."
Certainly, I think, the thought of one's own survival after all this gradually became more and more uppermost.
When one did run into any sort of determined resistance, it was a matter of half anger:
"How dare these people prolong the agony any more?"
And the other half was jolly nearly a blue funk.
(narrator) Uelzen, a little town in northern Germany, 30 miles short of the Elbe.
Here the Germans did stand and fight.
There was an edginess now among the Allied fighting men, their fingers quick on the trigger.
Their opponents were elite troops and officer cadets.
It took a four-day battle with considerable losses and many civilian deaths before resistance collapsed.
Mostly the Germans surrendered thankfully.
Their main aim - to go into captivity with the Anglo-Americans rather than with the Russians on whose land and population they had inflicted such losses.
Desperately they strove to reach safety in the west.
In the Ruhr pocket over 300,000 men of Army Group B were surrounded and forced to surrender.
The Western Allies had achieved their main objective - the destruction of the German land forces in the west.
(speaks German)
(translator) It wasn't until the first half of April that he retired to the bunker, because the air raids were getting worse and more frequent.
The bunker was divided up in such a way that in the lower area there was a military conference chamber with an anteroom which led to Hitler's study.
His workroom and bedroom led off this anteroom and also a room with a bathroom for Eva Braun.
There were some women in Hitler's former life who were important for him, but I think during the last time there was nobody else near and as close to him like Eva Braun.
She loved him really and she came surprisingly to Berlin and when she arrived, Hitler tried to seem angry but he wasn't successful.
His eyes were so full of joy and he was obviously so happy that she was there that nobody tried to send her back.
(narrator) The Russians were now firing on Berlin itself, their forward troops already in the outskirts fighting their way from street to street.
So came his birthday, 20 April, and there came the congratulations and everybody shook his hand and wished him the best.
It was all very depressed, it was not a happy birthday.
And when the official part was over
Hitler retired at once, but Eva Braun invited some of the people to go upstairs in her little living room to make a birthday party.
And one found a record, a hit song, to dance with music.
And then we sat around the table and tried to forget our miserable situation.
There was laughing and joking and everybody drank and giggled and gaggled.
It was a very artificial sort of gayness.
(speaks German)
(translator) After there was another conference on the situation, but it was already apparent that it was getting near the end.
Reichsleiter Bormann said to me that I should put everything in motion so that we would have luggage ready in case of a possible move to the Berghof in Berchtesgaden.
He refused absolutely and said, "No, I cannot leave Berlin."
"I have to make a decision here in Berlin or I have to go under."
And this was the first time that he ever mentioned the possibility that we could not win, that he mentioned the chance of defeat.
I remember April 20 1945, that was the birthday of Adolf Hitler, and on the radio there was a speech of Joseph Goebbels.
And he said, "Berlin will remain German and Vienna will be German again."
And my mother said, "God thanks, we will win the war", and I said, "Mother, you are wrong and Goebbels is wrong."
"It's terrible, but I am quite sure the war is over and we will lose the war."
And my mother said, "Do you think in this hour
Goebbels will tell us a lie?"
(speaks Russian)
(translator) The battle for Berlin itself was extremely difficult.
It had to be taken street by street, house by house, some of them nine and ten storeys high, and there were lots of these houses.
The fascists held out on every floor.
They had also set up barricades in every street.
They'd converted the main buildings into strongpoints against us.
We were in Berlin now and in this evening we just visit my mother and she was very nearly crying, because she thought maybe I'm dead or something.
And it was late in the evening and we wanted to sleep there, but some men of the house came and they said, "It's impossible."
"You can't sleep here because the Russians are not far from here and if they arrive here by night and they see you here with guns, maybe they will shoot us."
So we couldn't sleep there.
We went over the street, there was a school, and we slept there.
(man speaks Russian)
(translator) On the 21st, we went on together into the outer ring of the suburbs of Berlin itself.
The order of the day of our high command reverberated through the whole country.
They were heard throughout the world:
"Our soldiers have broken into Berlin."
(narrator) The Russians worked out their tactics in detail using models of streets and buildings.
Behind the apparent chaos of the fighting lay a precise plan to encircle the city and strike at the centre.
Some troops had come all across Russia through territory the retreating Germans had looted, burned, destroyed.
Berliners sheltering in their cellars wondered what their fate would be at Russian hands.
(woman speaks Russian)
(translator) Even the children had not been evacuated.
They all lived in cellars.
I went into the cellars and remember most of all the repetition of this phrase:
"When will this nightmare end?"
Suddenly on April 22, I think - yes - they came out of the military conference with a totally stony face and dark, frightened eyes and he called us to come to this little anteroom.
He sent for Eva Braun and for the secretaries and for the cook who was still in Berlin who cooked for him.
And then he came in and said with a monotone voice and so unkindly as we never had heard him speak to us:
"Ladies, please pack your things at once."
"You have to go to the south."
"The last aeroplane starts in about an hour."
And then it was silent.
"No", he said, "it's all lost."
"There's no hope.
You have to go."
And then was a moment of absolute silence and we stood shocked.
Suddenly Eva Braun made a few steps, went to Hitler and said:
"But you know I don't leave you.
I stay on your side."
"You know that.
Don't try to send me away."
Then Hitler did something very astonishing which he never did and nobody had ever seen such a gesture.
He kissed her on her lips.
And then it happened that the other girls and me too, we heard us saying, "We'll stay, too."
This situation in the bunker was a fantastic one.
One really can't...
An unrealistic one.
One really can't describe how the moods went on and off like waves.
Sometimes they were all exhilarating and were thinking,
"Well, now the Western troops coming for release of Berlin..."
Goebbels was exclaiming one of the biggest decisions of war Hitler just made, he is now determined no more to fight against the West, only to the East in Berlin, and this will mean that the Western powers
will join us in our fight against Russia.
Such things happened every now and then.
And then a few minutes afterwards everybody was speaking about suicide and how they are preparing it.
Goebbels in detail was saying how he will let his children be killed who were already in the bunker.
(speaks German)
(translator) After a few days the telegram came from Göring which said, "Mein Führer..."
No longer "my beloved Führer", just "my Führer".
"I know that you are now totally cut off and are no longer in possession of full freedom to command."
"According to the law of succession, I will now step into your position and will undertake to represent Germany both in internal and external matters."
"Yours, Göring."
Hitler was so worked up over this.
He sat in his chair and could not grasp it at first.
This was added to by Bormann who added fuel to the fire somewhat so that Hitler then said:
"To give me an ultimatum, that really is the end!"
One day there came one of the men of the press bureau, press office, and brought the news -
I think he had heard it by radio from Reuters News Agency - that Himmler had had negotiations with Graf Bernadotte for capitulation.
And Hitler was very upset because he held Himmler for his most faithful paladin and the most reliable one, and now he saw that also he had tried to betray him.
He remembered suddenly that the poison which he had to use for himself was given to him by one of Himmler's staff and he mistrusted that it may affect...
Perhaps Himmler tried a dirty trick and gave him something that would only make him unconscious, so that he could be transported against his will out of the bunker and delivered to the enemy.
And to test this he ordered a doctor to try to test this poison capsule on the dog.
So he said farewell to this creature.
I think it was next to Eva Braun, this one who stood next to him.
And Blondi died very promptly.
(narrator) For a tiny handful of German anti-Nazis, the Russians came as liberators.
(man) On Tuesday morning, the 24th, we suddenly saw the Gestapo had disappeared.
During the night the whole prison was given over to normal prison guards, old men, not nice men.
And when we saw that...
Many of the uniforms the Gestapo guards had put away there.
We said, "Now, when the Russians take over, you are the men who will be killed, not we.
Let us out."
They were very...
They said, "No, we can't do that.
Tonight the Gestapo will come back."
And then in the afternoon of Tuesday we made an agreement with them and said, "Look, we will put out ourselves, we the prisoners, some guards on the roof, and observe the coming here of the Russian Front."
"In the minute we hear Russian gunfire, not only the artillery shelling, then you will let us out." They said, "All right."
When the door was opened in the prison there was with us a Jewish Russian doctor who was a concentration inmate of Sachsenhausen, the famous...
He
- I don't know for what reason - a month ago was brought by the Gestapo to our prison to do the most dirty jobs in the prison all the time.
And we couldn't contact him much but we knew him.
Then he stood there on the street and, "Where to go?" as a Russian.
And I said, "Look, come with us."
"My mother-in-law will feed you.
Come in our basement."
And he went with me.
When the first units of Russians came two days later, he met them at the door addressing them in Russian:
"We are all anti-fascists in this basement."
When the Russians came in in the end...
We found the first lot, the fighting troops which came in,...
They took away our watches, of course, and they were very cautious.
We could understand that.
They took away things they liked but they behaved very businesslike.
They stayed in this house here and they lived in this room, three or four of them, quite high officers.
They got up in the morning at eight o'clock and at nine o'clock they went to the Tiergarten, which isn't very far from here, and behind the Tiergarten is, or was, the Chancellery where Hitler was still alive and fighting.
They went out and did their job and came back at five o'clock in the afternoon sharp and then they asked me down here to play the piano and give them a little tune.
And then we drank together and we sang together.
(woman) Suddenly we saw the first Russian soldiers.
They knocked at our door, came in and were very kind.
They said to my mother and to me if there were German soldiers in the house or asked for weapons.
And then they left.
But the next Russians were quite different.
One of them raped me and other inhabitants of the house.
Two women living next door were killed and we weren't able to bury them because the shelling was still going on.
When the Russians came along they asked us:
"Where are your women?
We want to have your women", or, "Frau, Frau, Frau", they said in German, what they called German.
I had the trick or I found the trick to take them to these two dead bodies.
I opened the carpet and said, "This is my Frau here."
"I can't supply you with any women."
"These are the only two women we knew here which we had."
And the Russians kneeled down, some of them, and made the cross and said little prayers, which was very astounding, and got up again and kissed me because they thought I was the widower and gave me presents, gave me cigarettes, gave me bread,
clapped me on my shoulder and went off again and got what they wanted, probably, the next house or in the next street.
Every night, I used to go home to see my mother and get something to eat and some cigarettes, because we didn't get any food at daytime.
And my mother was every time, every night, she was very lucky to see me again, naturally.
And so my mother asked me and also other people from our house asked me:
"Just take your uniform off, stay here and don't go back to fighting."
Always I said, "No, I can't do it."
I couldn't stay at home safe and they are still fighting.
(narrator) The Battle of Berlin was one of the most difficult of the war.
It cost the Russians over 100,000 men.
Total German losses are unknown.
(man speaks Russian)
(translator) The storming of Berlin continued.
The encircling ring round the whole city and round the centre of Berlin itself was being drawn tighter and tighter.
Only a few hundred yards separated us from the viper's nest of Hitler's headquarters, the Imperial Chancellery.
Then he began, "My last will", and then he dictated me at first his private will and afterwards his political testimony.
And, I must confess, that I was...
I was at first in a very excited mood, because I expected that I would be the first and the only one who knows, who is going to know, the explanation and declaration why the war had come to this end
and why Hitler couldn't stop, and why the development and why the catastrophe.
I thought, "Now I will come to the moment of the truth."
And I was heart bumping when I wrote down what Hitler said.
But he used nothing new.
He came out with his old phrases.
He repeated his accusations, his revenge swearing to the enemy and to the Jewish capitalistic system.
And then he announced in the second part of the political testimony, he announced a new government.
(speaks German)
(translator) Eva Braun had by now persuaded the Führer to the point where he actually wanted to improvise a marriage service to her.
To do this, they got an official from the propaganda ministry who would fulfill the function of registrar.
I joined the others in this little workroom of Hitler's and they were sitting there around a table and so I had to congratulate Eva Braun.
I was a little shy as to what to say, and I shook hands with her and she said, "Oh, you can say Mrs Hitler to me now," and I did.
(narrator) On the rocket, "This is for the Reichstag."
Others said, "Remember Stalingrad", "Remember the Ukraine",
"Remember the widows and children", "Remember the tears."
(Linge speaks German)
(translator) Hitler had now drawn his conclusions.
He said farewell to everybody.
I was the last one he came to.
Hitler said to me:
"I have given the order to break out."
"You should break out in groups."
"Join one of these groups and try to get through to the west."
Then I asked Hitler:
"For whom should we fight on for now?"
And to that Hitler said in a monotone:
"For the coming man."
I saluted him.
He gave me his hand and I disappeared out of the room.
Suddenly there was a bang, there was a shot, and it was obviously within the bunker, because the noises of the outside shooting, we know how they sound.
And the little boy of Goebbels, he noticed that there was another sound.
He said, "Oh, that was a bull's-eye."
And I thought, yes, you are right.
That was really a bull's-eye.
(speaks German)
(translator) I went into Hitler's workroom with the former Reichsleiter Bormann and this picture presented itself to us.
Hitler was sitting on the left of the sofa with his face bent slightly forward and hanging down to the right.
With the 7.65 he had shot himself in the right temple.
The blood had run down onto the carpet and from this pool of blood a splash had got onto the sofa.
Eva Braun was sitting on his right.
Eva Braun had drawn both her legs up onto the sofa and was sitting there with cramped lips so that it immediately became clear to us that she had taken cyanide.
I took Hitler by his neck.
Behind me were two other officers from his bodyguard.
And so we took Hitler's body and proceeded with it into the park.
In the park, we laid the bodies together next to each other and poured the available petrol over them.
In the Reich Chancellery park there was fire all around.
A draught had got up so that we could not set the corpses alight with an ordinary match.
So I twisted a taper out of some paper from a notebook and Reichsleiter Bormann, who meanwhile had also come upstairs with others like Dr Goebbels, Burgdorf and some officers, lit the taper and I threw the taper onto the bodies
and in an instant the corpses were set alight.
(Nikulina speaks Russian)
(translator) That night we were the first to take the fight into the Chancellery itself.
Our objective was to be the planting of our banner on the building itself.
There was a group of us.
Our group consisted of me, Sanogen, Alimov and Uzbek, who was the Young Communist organiser of our battalion.
He and his Young Communists had fought through with us together.
They protected me so that I could fight my way in to hoist the flag.
They gave me the banner to enable me to get into the building itself and hoist it up.
Having got into the building, we started making our way up the staircase towards the attic.
Some fascists opened up on us and Sanogen was hit in the head and fell.
His friends rushed forward to him while I had to make it upstairs to plant the banner.
And having made my way onto the roof through a shell hole,
I secured our red banner with a length of telegraph wire.
(cheering)
- How do you do?
- You're one of Joe Stalin's soldiers
- and I'm pleased to meet you.
- (man speaks Russian)
(narrator) When the armies of East and West met in Germany there was a brief moment of warmth and comradeship.
- Well, we fought the same way together.
- Yes.
Well, all the best, old man.
I'm very glad to have met you.
Very glad indeed.
- (speaks Russian)
- Thank you very much.
We don't understand the language but we mean the same thing.
(narrator) The Red Army saw themselves as liberators, not avengers.
But the crimes of Hitler's Reich had to be paid for, it was the ordinary German who paid.
Dresden, a beautiful imponent e city-museum, that the war little affects and whose inhabitants considered inviolable, technician became in terms a case serious of on-bombardeamento.
We had as many refugee, come of the eastern front, that at this time the city it increases for the double of the size.
The only men were the blind people e cripples of the hospital of the veterans.
The blind people tried to carry the cripples and did not see the way.
Some people who tried to escape they were dragged by the fire.
They disappeared suddenly, exactly to the front of our eyes.
Fortíssimas has airflows in a fire storm thus.
It is horrible.
We have of moving away in them from the fire, because the draft pulls in them.
In the following day, they had come the Americans.
A demonstration support occidental person to the Russians, now to less than 150 km.
More than 1300 flying ortalezas to jam the ruins of the city.
The city was, is clearly, in flames, but we come back three days after, to try to find people e to remove them of rubbles.
To the times, one has been valid full it contained nine or ten people, because they had shrunk e they occupied little space very.
It could not believe that age a person.
It was a terrible image.
Vi pairs of people very meetings, perhaps in desperation, casting in one it appears small letter.
In the center of the city, the survivors they had constructed great piras funerary.
It did not have time to open individual hollows.
We dig common ditches.
We try to identify them through of jewels or other belongings, but many people not they could have been identified.
Later, in the ruins, registrations met:
"Hans, you are alive" "Martha, still you are in the ruins"
The industrial damages had been light.
The railway if recouped in three days.
But one hundred a thousand had more than died.
Dresden was another monument to the total war.
The World in War
Nemesis
Germany February the May of 1945
The last cinematographic set of documents nazista that the Germans capsize.
It showed units of recognition in German the eastern front, ground.
Slogans explored now the sexual fear of hordas communist.
The main weapon of the propaganda they were breaking histories, supported estereotipados stories for photographs doubtful, where the bodies could be, to vary, Germans.
Stories on the licentious soldadesca brutal e in the language of the racial hatred:
monsters, breaking, animals, brutality.
Of the German provinces and territories busy to the east, they came refugee.
The families were separate for never more congregating itself.
Thousands died for drowning, thousand with the bombings.
The German Empire was shrinking.
The Germans came back toward house.
The west, the Allied Air Force they sobrevoavam to the will the Reno, paralyzing all the movement in the preparation of the final attack.
With bombs, rockets and bullets of cannon they had attacked railway bridges, ways, roads.
. until an isolated wagon pulled for a horse.
It was my duty to say the Hitler that, of the point of view of the armament, the war was lost and it said in some memoranda.
Hardest it was of 19 of March of 1945, where it said, without Popes in the language, what nobody was dared to say.
It said that the war would finish inside of four the six weeks.
Hitler boasted that the decreases were compensated for new units.
He himself gave medals to the new conscripts.
What it lacked to them in experience, it sobrava in national-socialist ardor.
A young courier counts as she led weapons for the aircraft marshalling area.
Its rewards:
a Cross of Iron of second classroom.
24 of March:the ticket of the Reno.
The last exemplary battle of Montgomery.
In the sum of the river, the Americans they advanced almost without opposition.
The objective of the commanders of field it was Berlin.
A crossed time the Reno, of the border dutch to the Black Forest, the south, the Allied columns had invested for the heart of Germany, through common scenes in war times.
Cities and villages burning, as the cities and villages of Poland, of France, Russia, of Yugoslavia and Greece they had burnt.
But for these civilians, women e children who attended the war, gas chambers did not exist ghettos nor.
But, in some, a sensation of anger.
When I felt hatred against Hitler e the nazistas for the first time, it was not hatred against the regimen of terror, it was the type of hatred that if it feels against outlaws.
Hitler promises to us to conquer the heart of the world, it asked for aid to us and us we help.
E now we did not have nothing, except the clothes of the body.
The collapse of the nazista Government leaves an emptiness.
The armies that advanced they were politically innocent;
its efficient methods were rudes and.
The first burgomestre that we find, with its insignias, it informed us that was not nazista, as well as the city council, e arrest we it judging to have apanhado all the nazistas.
We put welded with the people of the city e, after the first hours where the tension was reduced, each part saw that to another one it did not go to trair
e in we saw changing them to cookies or chocolates for a prepared meal for one of the German families e they in had shown photographs to them of relatives, without uniforms, e the flat soldiers had shown photographs of its families.
Funny as the feeling it can move so quickly.
A woman came to speak to me e offered its services, in the attempt to get any thing.
I looked at for it, feeling me particularly bad in that day.
My father was sick and knew for a of the Red Cross telegram that my young brother-in-law he had been died in Germany.
He was ready to attack somebody with my proper hands.
It came to say and I to me she said, almost in desperation:
"It does not full me, I am Jewish and not it goes to want to have nothing to see with me".
E it looked at for me and said:
"Aber Sie sind ein weiss Juden".
Translating, it means:
"But it is a white Jew".
I had that to restrain the will of beating to it with the belt in the mouth.
The fields had been opened.
Many Germans had heard to speak of them.
Others had preferred not to know.
Now, they were obliged to see.
In a place, the speaker of the house e the woman had hung itself in house.
That is Buchenwald.
Those that had survived to deportation, to the enslaved work, to the election for the fields of the death e to the hunger was of all the Europe, of all the classrooms, many religions and many ideals politicians.
Some had turned over against the oppressors.
The prisoners Allies had been freed.
The soldiers German had been placed in captivity.
Vulgar refugee, Germans e war prisoners they were crossed in the roads and not they had nothing to say ones to the others.
Germany was a creeps I insult for the kick of a giant.
In some places it had booties, brief chances of to festejar the collapse of the system.
The winners had its ideas on the law and the order.
Some goods still were sacred.
In April of 1945, Berlin was more ruin of what city.
Especially in the center of Berlin, almost no building was unbroken.
But I desired that the Filarmonica of Berlin of this a last concert.
Wise person who would be my last concert for much time, perhaps forever,
e I invited friends e the biggest possible number of people.
In them we seat dresses with coats, because it did not have heating e was a cold of arrepiar e, in this atmosphere of destruction and misery, the concert started.
It started for the last part of "Twilight of the Deuses".
Hitler already did not appear in public.
Each time more, was collected in its underground quarter-general, under the Imperial Chancellery, bunker.
When I came back of this concert, a military conference happened.
We enter in bunker and we saw Hitler almost is of itself.
Goebbels already was there e Hitler showed telegrams to us that it finishes to receive, announcing the death of Roosevelt, while Goebbels jumped and said:
"It is of this, now I find that everything it goes to run in the best way".
To the east, in the railway ways widened for the Russians, the Russian authorities accumulated vast reserves of material.
Six armies were involved.
Its objective:
to jam the German forces in the doors of Berlin and to occupy the nazista capital.
In 75º anniversary of the birth of Lenin, in 16 of April of 1945, the allied artillery opened fire.
My spirit was esmorecendo e I was very anxious, because wise person who the attack had started.
The first barrage was less efficient of what Zhukov waits;
the Germans remained in security for backwards of the second line of defense.
In the center of the attack line, front Berlin, 250 metal rings for kilometer opened way to the assault cars.
The Red Army crosses the Oder, strengthening its head-of-bridge.
The columns of tank advanced against a desperate resistance.
Some of our youngsters had jumped of trenches with its bazookas, they had gone off against the tanks e had destroyed four more than, while others shot e killed welded Russian.
The Russians must have passed for one warehouse or for a candy plant, because they had the full arms of candies and chocolates.
In our unit, we had all 15 or 16 years e we run for the street with the chocolate.
The west, the situation was different:
skirting small enemy groups, the Allied columns went for the east.
In these days, it could to bind for the following city e to see if still was busy for Germans and if the central office functioned.
"Olá, what it is happening there"
The situation was almost unreal:
cities and villages abandoned without resistance.
The field was normal, without any damage.
Every day, we said in them:
"This cannot continue".
I find that, after this, the fear of the death if it became each bigger time.
When we found resistance, half of our reaction age of anger:
"As this people if atreve to draw out this agony?"
E to another half age of total terror.
Uelzen, a small city in the north of Germany, the 50 km of the Elba.
Here, the Germans had resisted.
The current irritability of the Allies it became them fast in the trigger.
Its opponents were welded of the elite and officers cadets.
Only after four days of battle, with considerable losses e many died civilians, the resistance lost.
The majority of the Germans she was grateful for if relieving.
The main objective was to be captive of Anglo-Americans and not of Russians, in whose people and territory they had inflicted as many losses.
They fought desesperadamente to reach security in ocidente.
In the stock market of the Ruhr, more than 300 a thousand men of the Group of Armies B they had been surrounded and obliged to surrender.
The occidental Allies had reached its main objective:
the destruction of the forces terrestrial Germans the west.
It only left to bunker it in the first fortnight of April, because the aerial attacks increased of intensity and frequency.
Bunker was divided in such a way that in the inferior area it had a room for military conferences with an antechamber that led to the cabinet of study of Hitler.
The antechamber also led to the room e to the cabinet of work of Hitler e to one room with bathroom for Eva Braun.
Previously in the life of Hitler, it had important women for, but I think that, in the last times, nobody so close age fond e it as Eva Braun.
It loved it of truth and came unexpectedly for Berlin.
When it arrived, Hitler tried to seem angry, but did not obtain.
Its eyes had been full of joy e was clearly so happy for ve it, that nobody.
it tried to order it in return.
The Russians shot now in the interior of Berlin, with the advanced destacamentos in suburbs, opening way street the street.
Its anniversary arrived, in 20 of April, e all had pressed its hand, had given the congratulations and had desired happinesses.
But it already was depressed.
It was not a happy anniversary.
When the official party finished, Hitler left immediately, but Eva Braun invited some people to go up to its small room for an anniversary party e one of them found a record, with a success of the time, a music to dance.
Thus, we seat in them in return of the table, trying to forget the sad situation.
It had laughs and jokes and.
all drank, laugh and talked.
It was an artificial joy very.
Later, it had another conference on the situation, but already he was well-known that the end if approached.
The Head of Bormann General staff he said me that he prepared everything for terms the ready luggage in the case to go for the vacation residence.
It refused stubbornly and said:
"I cannot abandon Berlin.
I have to take a decision here, in Berlin, or I will have to hide me".
It was the first time.
that it mentioned the possibility not to be successful.
that it mentioned the hypothesis of the defeat.
I remember day 20 of April of 1945.
It was the anniversary of Adolf Hitler.
The radio transmitted a speech of Josef Goebbels where it said:
"Berlin will remain German e Vienna will come back to be German".
E my mother said:"Thanks to God, we go to gain the war".
E I said:"He is been deceptive, mother, and the Goebbels also.
It is terrible, but I have the certainty of that the war finished and we lose".
E my mother answered:
"It finds that Goebbels would lie in them in this hour"
The Battle of Berlin was extremely difficult.
It had of being conquered street the street, marries the house.
Some had nine or ten floors.
It had many houses of these.
The fascists had defended each floor e the streets had raised barricades in all.
They had converted the main buildings in ranks strenghtened against us.
We were then in Berlin and, a night, I was to visit my mother e I found crying it almost, because it thought that I could to be dead or wounded.
The night went advanced and wanted to sleep there, but some inhabitants of the house had come e had said that it was impossible:
"They cannot sleep here for cause of the Russians.
They are not far.
If to arrive at night turn and them perhaps with these weapons, they kill in them".
We could not sleep there.
We leave for the street and we sleep in a school.
In day 21, we cross together the limit of the suburbs of Berlin.
The order of the day of ours High Command it echoed for the entire country.
It was heard in the whole world:
"Our soldiers had entered in Berlin".
The Russians had developed tactics with models of streets and buildings.
Under the apparent chaos of the street combats, a necessary plan existed to surround the city and to attack in the center.
Some soldiers had crossed all Russia, for lands that the Germans in withdrawal they pilharam, they had burnt, they destroyed.
The Berliners, sheltered in its bilges, they were asked how much to its destination at the hands of the Russians.
If the children had not been defecated, all in the bilges lived.
It entered in the bilges and I remember above of everything the repetition of this phrase:
"When it will finish this nightmare"
Suddenly, in 22 of April, I believe.
It left the military conference with the face total petrified
e the scared dark eyes e called in them in the small antechamber,
it ordered to search Eva Braun and the secretaries e the cook who cooked for it and still was in Berlin.
Later, it entered and it said, in a monotonous and cold voice as never we had heard directed:
"Please, mine ladies, make already the luggages.
They have that to go for south.
The last airplane has broken daqui about one hour".
It had a silence.
"Not", it said, "Is all lost one.
He does not have hope.
They have to leave".
A silence moment was followed absolute.
We were estupefatos.
Suddenly, Eva Braun it gave some steps stops next to Hitler and it said:
"But you know that I do not abandon you.
I am to its side.
You know this.
To order he does not try me even so".
Then, Hitler made something amazing.
It never turns nobody it to make such gesture.
It kissed it in the lips.
Then, the other women and I in we saw them saying:
"We also are".
The situation in bunker absurd age.
It is impossible.
It was unreal.
It is impossible to describe as the spirit states if they occurred as waves.
To the times, they were all amused thinking:
"The occidental forces they come to free Berlin".
Goebbels exclamava:
"One of the biggest decisions of war that Hitler took it was not to fight against ocidente, to only fight against the east in Berlin.
This means that the powers occidental people will join we, in our fight against Russia".
This type of things it happened of time in when e few minutes later they said all in the suicide that they were preparing.
Goebbels spoke at great length, is clearly, saying as it would leave the children to die, that already they were in bunker.
Few days later, it came a telegram of Goering saying:"My Führer".
Already it did not say:"Esteem Mine Führer", only "My Führer".
"I know that he is total isolated, without freedom to command.
According to law of the succession, I will take its place now e I will represent Germany in the internal and external questions.
Yours truly, Goering".
Hitler was sufficiently transtornado with this.
Of beginning, he was seated in the chair without obtaining to perceive.
In some way, Bormann botou more firewood in the fogueira and Hitler said:
"To make me an ultimatum?
It is really the end"
One day, came a man of the press cabinet e brought a notice that I believe that hears in the radio, of the Reuters Agency:
Himmler negotiates the capitulation with the Conde Bernadotte.
Hitler was very insane, therefore it considered Himmler its more faithful paladino, of bigger confidence, e now saw that also it tries trais it.
One remembered suddenly that the poison that had to take it are given to it for a collaborator of Himmler e distrusted of its effect.
Perhaps Himmler tried to make a dirty game, giving something to it for to leave only unconscious, in order to be led of bunker against its will e delivers to the enemy.
To test the poison, it called a doctor e commanded to it that it tested the capsule in its dog.
It said good bye to the animal.
I find that it was, after Eva Braun, the being next to it.
The Blondi died immediately.
For the few antinazistas Germans, Russians had arrived as liberating.
In the morning of tuesday, day 24, we saw that the Gestapo if evaporates.
During the night, it delivers the arrest the normal prisionais guards, old men, nothing likeable, e when we saw many uniforms, the uniforms of the Gestapo, side ranks, we said:
"When the Russians to occupy this, vocês is that they go to be deceased, not we.
Leave to leave they".
They had answered:"We cannot make this.
The Gestapo comes back this night".
In the afternoon of tuesday, we made an agreement with them and we said:
"We, the prisoners, we will put guards in the roof to observe the approach of the Russian front e, when to hear Russian firearms beyond explosives, they leave in them to leave".
They had accepted.
When we leave the arrest, was with us a Jewish Russian doctor, that it was in a concentration camp with Sachsenhausen, the celebrity.
I do not know why reason, is prisoner for the Gestapo has one month e was it who always made dirtier works of the arrest.
We could not speak very with it, we knew but it, clearly.
It was motionless in the street without knowing for where to go, while Russian.
I invited to come it with us.
It said that my mother-in-law would give food to it.
It could be in our bilge.
E it was with me.
When the first Russian units they had arrived, two days later, it was it finds them in the door and it spoke in Russian:
"In this bilge, they are all antifascist ones".
When the Russians finally they had arrived, we find.
At least, we find the first ones combatants who had arrived.
They had taken our clocks, clearly, but they had been very cautious e we understand.
They took things of that liked, but they were very practical.
They had been lodged in this house e had occupied one room, three or four officers of raised clear.
They arose it 8h00 e to 9h00 went to the Tiergarten, that he is not very far daqui.
For backwards, it was the Chancellery, where Hitler was alive and fought.
They left, made its work e came back to 17h00 in point.
Later, they asked for to me that it went down to touch piano, to hear a music.
Then, we drank and we sang together.
Suddenly, we saw first Russian soldiers.
They had beaten to our door, had entered e had been very amiable.
They had asked to my mother and me if it had in the German house welded or weapons.
Later, they had left, but the next Russians had been very different.
I was violated by one of them, such as other inhabitants of the house.
Two women in the house lived to the side, that had been deceased.
We could not embed them, because the bombing continued.
When the Russians had arrived, had asked:
"Where they are its women?
We want its women".
"Frau, Frau, Frau", said they, about what they thought to be German.
I remembered the trick of to take them it the two corpses.
I moved away the carpet and said:"This is my woman.
I cannot give none.
They were the two only women that we knew here".
E some Russians had kneel themselves, they had made the signal de a Cruz e had praid small conjuncts, what it was sufficiently surprising.
Later, they had been arisen they had kissed and me, judging that he was the widower.
E had given gifts, cigarettes and bread to me, you cover in the coasts and had left e probably would find what they wanted in the house or the street to follow.
All the nights, went in the house to see my mother, to eat and to arrange cigarettes, because of day food was not arranged.
E my mother, all the nights, it was felt fortunate seeing for me e asked for to me, as well as other people of the zone:
"Strap the uniform, is here e does not come back toward the fight".
E I answered whenever I could not.
It could not be the safe one in house while others fought.
Zhukov called the Battle Berlin one of most difficult of the war.
It more than cost to the Russians one hundred a thousand men.
The total of German decreases is unaware of.
The assault Berlin continued.
The wall in redor of the city in its all and in redor of its center it was each pressed time more.
We were to few meters of the nest of the viper, the quarter-general of Hitler, the Imperial Chancellery.
Then, it started its last will.
It dictated first the private will to me e later its certification politician.
E I confess that it was.
The principle, was very moved, because it waited to be first and the only one
namely, that one that would be knowing the explanation of the war to have fond of this end,
of Hitler not to have obtained to stop, of this development and this catastrophe.
It thought:"Now the moment of the truth arrived".
It had the heart to the pulls while it wrote what Hitler dictated.
But it did not say nothing of new.
It was left with old expressions.
It repeated accusations, revenge to the enemy swore e to the Jewish capitalist system
e announced, in the second part of history.
of the will politician, he announced a new government.
Eva Braun then had persuaded the Führer, to the point of it to want to improvise a marriage ceremony.
For this, they had been to search an officer of the Ministry of the Propaganda.
that it would play the judge function.
I joined it the others in the small one cabinet of work of Hitler.
They were seated in return of a table e I had to compliment Eva Braun.
It was a little shy and not wise person what to say.
I pressed it to it hand and it said:
"Now it can call me Mrs. Hitler".
E I thus made.
Mortar has written:
"This is for the Imperial Chancellery".
Others said:"One remembers Stalingrado";
"One remembers the Ukraine"; "One remembers of the widowers and the children";
"One remembers the tears".
Hitler already takes off its conclusions.
It was said farewell to all.
I was the last one to who if it directed.
Hitler said me:
"I commanded that they ran away.
They must run away in groups.
It is joined to one and it tries to reach ocidente".
E I asked the Hitler:
"For who we must fight now"
To this, Hitler answered in tone monotonous:"For the coming man".
I made the pipe the side, it extended to me the hand and I left the room.
Suddenly, a burst, a detonation heard.
It are obviously inside of bunker, because the detonations of the exterior.
they were a noise that already we knew.
The son of Goebbels repaired.
E repaired in another sound.
It said:"It was a certeiro shot, it was a certeiro shot".
E I thought:"Yes, he has reason, a certeiro shot was same".
I entered in the cabinet of Hitler with Former-Head of Bormann General staff e we saw this image:
Hitler seated in the left side of the sofa, with the onward inclined face e hanging for the right.
With its 7,65, give one shot in the extemporaneous right.
The blood runs for the carpet e salpicos of this puddle of blood they had reached the sofa.
Eva Braun was seated to its right.
It was seated with the two legs on the sofa e the contracted lips, what it left soon clearly for us that it had taken cianeto.
I caught in Hitler for the neck.
Behind me, they were two officers of its escort.
We catch in the body of Hitler we take it to e for the park.
In the park, we place the bodies side by side we water them to e with the available gasoline.
In the park of the Chancellery, it had fire everywhere.
The wind hindered us to set fire fire to the bodies with a common match.
Therefore, I made a coil with paper of a note block e the Head of Bormann General staff, that it goes up with the Dr. Goebbels,
Burgdorf and other officers, lit the coil e played I it on the bodies, that they had been set on fire in one instant.
In this night, we were the first ones combatants to arrive at the Chancellery.
Our objective age to firm our flag in the building.
We were a group composition for me, Sanogen, Alimov and Uzbek, that he was the Coordinator of the Young Communists of our battalion.
It and its Young Communists they had fought with us.
They had protected me to be able to open way and to hoist the flag.
I had given to me flag to it for to hoist, after to enter in the building.
We enter and we start to go up the staircase for the attic.
Fascists had gone off on us e Sanogen fell, reached in the head.
The friends had precipitated for it, while I went up with the flag.
A time arriving at the roof through the hole of a bomb,
I firmed our red flag with a wire piece of I telegraph.
It says to them that I have much pleasure in knowing them.
When the armies of the east and west if they had congregated in the heart of Germany, it had a brief moment of animation and camaraderie.
I am very happy for knowing it.
Very happy, sincerely.
Thanks a lot.
We do not speak same language, but we feel the same.
The Red Army was seen as liberating, not as avenging.
The crimes of the empire of Hitler they had of being punished.
They had been the common Germans who had paid for them.
(narrator) Dresden - the great, beautiful and historic city so far barely touched by the war, believed by its inhabitants to be somehow inviolate - became, in the technical language of the experts, a severe case of over-bombing.
(woman) We had so many refugees who had come from the Eastern Front that at this point the city had swollen to double its size.
The only men we had in the city were from the veterans' hospital, blind and crippled.
The blind were trying to carry the cripples and couldn't see their way.
And some people who tried to walk along, they were pulled in by the fire.
They all of a sudden disappeared right in front of you.
There is such a draught in a firestorm like that.
It's a most horrible thing.
You have to save yourself or try to get as far away from the fire because the draught pulls you in.
(narrator) Next day came the Americans.
A Western demonstration of support for the Russians, now less than 100 miles away.
Over 1300 Flying Fortresses to pound the ruins of a city.
(Gray) The city was in flames but after three days we had to go in and try to find the people and take them out of the ruins.
And sometimes a washbasinful contained nine, ten people, because their size had shrunk to just a small amount.
We just couldn't believe that this was a whole person.
And this picture is just terrible.
I saw sometimes two people close together who maybe in despair had...
It was one tiny little figure.
(narrator) ln the centre of the city, cordoned oft from the survivors, they built great funeral pyres.
(Gray) There was no time to dig individual graves.
We had to dig mass graves.
They tried to identify by jewellery or by belongings, but many people could not be identified.
Later in the ruins you found inscriptions:
"Hans, are you alive?"
"Martha, are you still in the ruins?"
(narrator) Industrial damage was slight.
The railway was working again in three days.
But over 100,000 died.
Dresden was another monument to total war.
(narrator) The last Nazi newsreel the Germans saw.
It features scratch units in action on the Eastern Front, on German soil.
The slogans now play on sexual fear of the Red hordes.
The main propaganda weapon - stories of rape, stereotyped accounts backed by dubious pictures in which the corpses may, for once, be German.
Tales of brutal soldiery told in the stock language of racial hatred - beasts, rape, animals, bestiality.
Sie haben meine Schwester und meine Mutter in bestialischer und tierischer Weise misshandelt.
Refugees from Germany's eastern provinces and the occupied territories.
Families were separated, never to be reunited.
Thousands died from drowning, thousands from shelling.
The great German Reich was shrinking.
The Germans coming home.
On the Western Front the Allied air forces ranged at will beyond the Rhine, paralysing all movement in preparation for the final assault.
With bombs, rockets and cannonfire they struck at bridges, railways, roads, at a single horse and cart.
It was my duty to tell Hitler that from the point of view of armaments the war was lost.
And I did it in several memorandums, and the harshest one was 19 March '45 in which I told him very bluntly, which nobody dared to tell, that the war will be finished within four or six weeks.
(narrator) Hitler boasted of losses in infantry made good by countless numbers of new units.
He himself presented medals to his new recruits.
What they lacked in experience they made up for in National Socialist ardour.
A young runner reports how he carried weapons up to the front line.
Als der Russe näher heranrückte, bestand meine Aufgabe darin,
Meldungen zu den einzelnen Kompaniegefechtsständen... (narrator) His reward, an iron Cross Second Class.
March 24.
The Rhine crossing.
Montgomery's last showpiece battle.
Upstream the Americans slipped across almost unopposed.
The goal the field commanders had in mind
- Berlin.
Across the Rhine now.
From the Dutch border to the Black Forest in the south, the Allied columns pushed on into the heart of Germany through scenes that were the commonplace of war.
Towns and villages that burned as the towns and villages of Poland, France, Russia,
Yugoslavia and Greece had burned.
But for these civilians, for the women and children who saw the war go past, there were no ghettos and no gas chambers.
Only, in some, a sense of anger.
(woman) The first time I have had hatred against Hitler and the Nazis was not hatred against the terror regime, it was hatred like among gangsters.
Hitler promised us to win half of the world and he asked us to help him and so we have done, and now we have nothing.
We have only our clothes.
(narrator) The collapse of Nazi government had left a vacuum.
The advancing troops were politically innocent.
Their methods were rough and ready.
(man) The Bürgermeister's the first one you meet.
He'd have his sash on and he would inform us that he was not a Nazi, the town council was not.
We would promptly round them all up and ship them out because we knew we had all the Nazis.
You put soldiers with townspeople and after the first couple of hours of a small amount of tension when both parties realised that the other was not gonna stab them suddenly, we'd find ourselves swapping hard tack or chocolate
for a cooked meal by one of the German families.
And they in turn would show us family pictures - not the uniform ones - and then you'd find a Gl showing his family to them.
It's funny how the feeling could change so rapidly.
Some woman came to me. ln addition to trying to ofter me her own services, she was trying to obtain something else.
I looked at her. I was feeling particularly mean that day.
My father was sick and the Red Cross had given me information that my brother-in-law had been killed in Germany.
Word had just come to me and I was about ready to tear anyone apart with my own two hands.
And I said in desperation almost:
"Don't bother me.
You're dealing with a Jew."
"You don't want anything to do with me."
And she looked at me and she said, "Aber Sie sind ein weißer Jude", which you can translate, "But you are a white Jew."
And I did everything to restrain myself from just belting her in the mouth.
(narrator) The camps were overrun.
Many Germans had known of them.
Others had preferred not to know.
Now they were forced to see.
In one place the mayor and his wife went home and hanged themselves.
This is Buchenwald.
Those who had survived deportation, slave labour, selection for the death camps, starvation, were from every country in Europe, of all callings, of many religions, many political faiths.
Some turned on their oppressors.
Allied prisoners were freed.
(cheering)
(narrator) German soldiers went into captivity.
Displaced persons, ordinary Germans, prisoners of war passed on the roads and had nothing to say to each other.
Germany was an ant heap some giant had kicked to pieces.
Here and there, looting.
Brief opportunities to celebrate the collapse of the system.
The victors had their own views on law and order.
Some property was still sacred.
(Speer) ln April '45, Berlin was more ruins than a town.
In the centre of Berlin, one could find almost no building which was still intact.
But it was my wish to have the Berlin Philharmonic having a concert for the last time.
I knew that it would be my last concert for a long time, perhaps forever, and I invited friends and as many people as possible to go in.
We were sitting there in our coats because there was no heating.
It was cold and it was shivering and in this atmosphere of destruction and misery the concert started and we started with the last part of the Götterdämmerung.
(narrator) Hitler no longer made public appearances.
More and more he withdrew to his underground headquarters beneath the Imperial Chancellery - the bunker.
(Speer) When I came back from this concert for the military conference, we came into the bunker and Hitler was almost out of his mind.
And Goebbels was already there.
And Hitler showed to us the wires he'd just received of the death of Roosevelt.
Goebbels was jumping up and saying, "That's it.
That's it!"
"Now we have got it.
Now I think everything will turn to the better."
(narrator) ln the east, over railway lines converted to the Russian gauge, the Russian command was piling up vast supplies of material.
Six armies were involved.
Their object: to smash the German forces on the approaches to Berlin and take the capital of Nazi Germany.
On the 75th anniversary of Lenin's birth, 16 April 1945, the massed artillery opened fire.
My heart was going smaller and I get very anxious because I knew that the attack began.
(narrator) The first barrage was less eftective than Zhukov had hoped.
The Germans were still secure in their second line of defence.
In the centre of the front, opposite Berlin, there were 400 guns to the mile to open a way for the assault tanks.
The Red Army was over the Oder, reinforcing and breaking out of its bridgeheads.
The armoured columns pushed ahead against desperate resistance.
Some of our young boys, they jumped out of the holes, had their Panzerfaust and they were shooting to the tanks and destroyed more than four tanks, and the others were shooting with their guns and killed all the Russian soldiers.
And the Russians must have been before in a Magazin, or in a sweet factory, because they had all their arms full of sweets and chocolate.
Everybody in our unit was 15 and 16 and they were running onto the street with the chocolate.
(narrator) ln the west it was a difterent story.
Sidestepping pockets of the enemy the Allied columns moved east.
(man) You could pick up the telephone and ring up the next village to see if it was still German-occupied.
Say, "Hello, what's happening down there?"
One had almost moved into a dreamlike and unreal situation where towns and villages flew by with no resistance at all.
Normal countryside, no damage at all.
And every day one said to oneself, "Surely this can't go on."
Certainly, I think, the thought of one's own survival after all this gradually became more and more uppermost.
When one did run into any sort of determined resistance, it was a matter of half anger:
"How dare these people prolong the agony any more?"
And the other half was jolly nearly a blue funk.
(narrator) Uelzen, a little town in northern Germany, 30 miles short of the Elbe.
Here the Germans did stand and fight.
There was an edginess now among the Allied fighting men, their fingers quick on the trigger.
Their opponents were elite troops and ofticer cadets.
It took a four-day battle with considerable losses and many civilian deaths before resistance collapsed.
Mostly the Germans surrendered thankfully.
Their main aim - to go into captivity with the Anglo-Americans rather than with the Russians on whose land and population they had inflicted such losses.
Desperately they strove to reach safety in the west.
In the Ruhr pocket over 300,000 men of Army Group B were surrounded and forced to surrender.
The Western Allies had achieved their main objective - the destruction of the German land forces in the west.
(speaks German)
(translator) lt wasn't until the first half of April that he retired to the bunker, because the air raids were getting worse and more frequent.
The bunker was divided up in such a way that in the lower area there was a military conference chamber with an anteroom which led to Hitler's study.
His workroom and bedroom led oft this anteroom and also a room with a bathroom for Eva Braun.
There were some women in Hitler's former life who were important for him, but I think during the last time there was nobody else near and as close to him like Eva Braun.
She loved him really and she came surprisingly to Berlin and when she arrived, Hitler tried to seem angry but he wasn't successful.
His eyes were so full of joy and he was obviously so happy that she was there that nobody tried to send her back.
(narrator) The Russians were now firing on Berlin itself, their forward troops already in the outskirts fighting their way from street to street.
So came his birthday, 20 April, and there came the congratulations and everybody shook his hand and wished him the best.
It was all very depressed, it was not a happy birthday.
And when the ofticial part was over
Hitler retired at once, but Eva Braun invited some of the people to go upstairs in her little living room to make a birthday party.
And one found a record, a hit song, to dance with music.
And then we sat around the table and tried to forget our miserable situation.
There was laughing and joking and everybody drank and giggled and gaggled.
It was a very artificial sort of gayness.
(speaks German)
(translator) After there was another conference on the situation, but it was already apparent that it was getting near the end.
Reichsleiter Bormann said to me that I should put everything in motion so that we would have luggage ready in case of a possible move to the Berghof in Berchtesgaden.
He refused absolutely and said, "No, I cannot leave Berlin."
"l have to make a decision here in Berlin or I have to go under."
And this was the first time that he ever mentioned the possibility that we could not win, that he mentioned the chance of defeat.
I remember April 20 1945, that was the birthday of Adolf Hitler, and on the radio there was a speech of Joseph Goebbels.
And he said, "Berlin will remain German and Vienna will be German again."
And my mother said, "God thanks, we will win the war", and I said, "Mother, you are wrong and Goebbels is wrong."
"lt's terrible, but I am quite sure the war is over and we will lose the war."
And my mother said, "Do you think in this hour
Goebbels will tell us a lie?"
(speaks Russian)
(translator) The battle for Berlin itself was extremely difticult.
It had to be taken street by street, house by house, some of them nine and ten storeys high, and there were lots of these houses.
The fascists held out on every floor.
They had also set up barricades in every street.
They'd converted the main buildings into strongpoints against us.
We were in Berlin now and in this evening we just visit my mother and she was very nearly crying, because she thought maybe I'm dead or something.
And it was late in the evening and we wanted to sleep there, but some men of the house came and they said, "lt's impossible."
"You can't sleep here because the Russians are not far from here and if they arrive here by night and they see you here with guns, maybe they will shoot us."
So we couldn't sleep there.
We went over the street, there was a school, and we slept there.
(man speaks Russian)
(translator) On the 21st, we went on together into the outer ring of the suburbs of Berlin itself.
The order of the day of our high command reverberated through the whole country.
They were heard throughout the world:
"Our soldiers have broken into Berlin."
(narrator) The Russians worked out their tactics in detail using models of streets and buildings.
Behind the apparent chaos of the fighting lay a precise plan to encircle the city and strike at the centre.
Some troops had come all across Russia through territory the retreating Germans had looted, burned, destroyed.
Berliners sheltering in their cellars wondered what their fate would be at Russian hands.
(woman speaks Russian)
(translator) Even the children had not been evacuated.
They all lived in cellars.
I went into the cellars and remember most of all the repetition of this phrase:
"When will this nightmare end?"
Suddenly on April 22, I think - yes - they came out of the military conference with a totally stony face and dark, frightened eyes and he called us to come to this little anteroom.
He sent for Eva Braun and for the secretaries and for the cook who was still in Berlin who cooked for him.
And then he came in and said with a monotone voice and so unkindly as we never had heard him speak to us:
"Ladies, please pack your things at once."
"You have to go to the south."
"The last aeroplane starts in about an hour."
And then it was silent.
"No", he said, "it's all lost."
"There's no hope.
You have to go."
And then was a moment of absolute silence and we stood shocked.
Suddenly Eva Braun made a few steps, went to Hitler and said:
"But you know I don't leave you.
I stay on your side."
"You know that.
Don't try to send me away."
Then Hitler did something very astonishing which he never did and nobody had ever seen such a gesture.
He kissed her on her lips.
And then it happened that the other girls and me too, we heard us saying, "We'll stay, too."
This situation in the bunker was a fantastic one.
One really can't...
An unrealistic one.
One really can't describe how the moods went on and oft like waves.
Sometimes they were all exhilarating and were thinking,
"Well, now the Western troops coming for release of Berlin..."
Goebbels was exclaiming one of the biggest decisions of war Hitler just made, he is now determined no more to fight against the West, only to the East in Berlin, and this will mean that the Western powers
will join us in our fight against Russia.
Such things happened every now and then.
And then a few minutes afterwards everybody was speaking about suicide and how they are preparing it.
Goebbels in detail was saying how he will let his children be killed who were already in the bunker.
(speaks German)
(translator) After a few days the telegram came from Göring which said, "Mein Führer..."
No longer "my beloved Führer", just "my Führer".
"l know that you are now totally cut oft and are no longer in possession of full freedom to command."
"According to the law of succession, I will now step into your position and will undertake to represent Germany both in internal and external matters."
"Yours, Göring."
Hitler was so worked up over this.
He sat in his chair and could not grasp it at first.
This was added to by Bormann who added fuel to the fire somewhat so that Hitler then said:
"To give me an ultimatum, that really is the end!"
One day there came one of the men of the press bureau, press oftice, and brought the news - l think he had heard it by radio from Reuters News Agency - that Himmler had had negotiations with GrafBernadotte for capitulation.
And Hitler was very upset because he held Himmler for his most faithful paladin and the most reliable one, and now he saw that also he had tried to betray him.
He remembered suddenly that the poison which he had to use for himself was given to him by one of Himmler's staft and he mistrusted that it may aftect...
Perhaps Himmler tried a dirty trick and gave him something that would only make him unconscious, so that he could be transported against his will out of the bunker and delivered to the enemy.
And to test this he ordered a doctor to try to test this poison capsule on the dog.
So he said farewell to this creature.
I think it was next to Eva Braun, this one who stood next to him.
And Blondi died very promptly.
(narrator) For a tiny handful of German anti-Nazis, the Russians came as liberators.
(man) On Tuesday morning, the 24th, we suddenly saw the Gestapo had disappeared.
During the night the whole prison was given over to normal prison guards, old men, not nice men.
And when we saw that...
Many of the uniforms the Gestapo guards had put away there.
We said, "Now, when the Russians take over, you are the men who will be killed, not we.
Let us out."
They were very...
They said, "No, we can't do that.
Tonight the Gestapo will come back."
And then in the afternoon of Tuesday we made an agreement with them and said, "Look, we will put out ourselves, we the prisoners, some guards on the roof, and observe the coming here of the Russian Front."
"ln the minute we hear Russian gunfire, not only the artillery shelling, then you will let us out." They said, "All right."
When the door was opened in the prison there was with us a Jewish Russian doctor who was a concentration inmate of Sachsenhausen, the famous...
He - l don't know for what reason - a month ago was brought by the Gestapo to our prison to do the most dirty jobs in the prison all the time.
And we couldn't contact him much but we knew him.
Then he stood there on the street and, "Where to go?" as a Russian.
And I said, "Look, come with us."
"My mother-in-law will feed you.
Come in our basement."
And he went with me.
When the first units of Russians came two days later, he met them at the door addressing them in Russian:
"We are all anti-fascists in this basement."
When the Russians came in in the end...
We found the first lot, the fighting troops which came in,...
They took away our watches, of course, and they were very cautious.
We could understand that.
They took away things they liked but they behaved very businesslike.
They stayed in this house here and they lived in this room, three or four of them, quite high ofticers.
They got up in the morning at eight o'clock and at nine o'clock they went to the Tiergarten, which isn't very far from here, and behind the Tiergarten is, or was, the Chancellery where Hitler was still alive and fighting.
They went out and did their job and came back at five o'clock in the afternoon sharp and then they asked me down here to play the piano and give them a little tune.
And then we drank together and we sang together.
(woman) Suddenly we saw the first Russian soldiers.
They knocked at our door, came in and were very kind.
They said to my mother and to me if there were German soldiers in the house or asked for weapons.
And then they left.
But the next Russians were quite difterent.
One of them raped me and other inhabitants of the house.
Two women living next door were killed and we weren't able to bury them because the shelling was still going on.
When the Russians came along they asked us:
"Where are your women?
We want to have your women", or, "Frau, Frau, Frau", they said in German, what they called German.
I had the trick or I found the trick to take them to these two dead bodies.
I opened the carpet and said, "This is my Frau here."
"l can't supply you with any women."
"These are the only two women we knew here which we had."
And the Russians kneeled down, some of them, and made the cross and said little prayers, which was very astounding, and got up again and kissed me because they thought I was the widower and gave me presents, gave me cigarettes, gave me bread,
clapped me on my shoulder and went oft again and got what they wanted, probably, the next house or in the next street.
Every night, I used to go home to see my mother and get something to eat and some cigarettes, because we didn't get any food at daytime.
And my mother was every time, every night, she was very lucky to see me again, naturally.
And so my mother asked me and also other people from our house asked me:
"Just take your uniform oft, stay here and don't go back to fighting."
Always I said, "No, I can't do it."
I couldn't stay at home safe and they are still fighting.
(narrator) The Battle of Berlin was one of the most difticult of the war.
It cost the Russians over 100,000 men.
Total German losses are unknown.
(man speaks Russian)
(translator) The storming of Berlin continued.
The encircling ring round the whole city and round the centre of Berlin itself was being drawn tighter and tighter.
Only a few hundred yards separated us from the viper's nest of Hitler's headquarters, the Imperial Chancellery.
Then he began, "My last will", and then he dictated me at first his private will and afterwards his political testimony.
And, I must confess, that I was...
I was at first in a very excited mood, because I expected that I would be the first and the only one who knows, who is going to know, the explanation and declaration why the war had come to this end
and why Hitler couldn't stop, and why the development and why the catastrophe.
I thought, "Now I will come to the moment of the truth."
And I was heart bumping when I wrote down what Hitler said.
But he used nothing new.
He came out with his old phrases.
He repeated his accusations, his revenge swearing to the enemy and to the Jewish capitalistic system.
And then he announced in the second part of the political testimony, he announced a new government.
(speaks German)
(translator) Eva Braun had by now persuaded the Führer to the point where he actually wanted to improvise a marriage service to her.
To do this, they got an ofticial from the propaganda ministry who would fulfil the function of registrar.
I joined the others in this little workroom of Hitler's and they were sitting there around a table and so I had to congratulate Eva Braun.
I was a little shy as to what to say, and I shook hands with her and she said, "Oh, you can say Mrs Hitler to me now," and I did.
(narrator) On the rocket, "This is for the Reichstag."
Others said, "Remember Stalingrad", "Remember the Ukraine",
"Remember the widows and children", "Remember the tears."
(Linge speaks German)
(translator) Hitler had now drawn his conclusions.
He said farewell to everybody.
I was the last one he came to.
Hitler said to me:
"l have given the order to break out."
"You should break out in groups."
"Join one of these groups and try to get through to the west."
Then I asked Hitler:
"For whom should we fight on for now?"
And to that Hitler said in a monotone:
"For the coming man."
I saluted him.
He gave me his hand and I disappeared out of the room.
Suddenly there was a bang, there was a shot, and it was obviously within the bunker, because the noises of the outside shooting, we know how they sound.
And the little boy of Goebbels, he noticed that there was another sound.
He said, "Oh, that was a bull's-eye."
And I thought, yes, you are right.
That was really a bull's-eye.
(speaks German)
(translator) I went into Hitler's workroom with the former Reichsleiter Bormann and this picture presented itself to us.
Hitler was sitting on the left of the sofa with his face bent slightly forward and hanging down to the right.
With the 7.65 he had shot himself in the right temple.
The blood had run down onto the carpet and from this pool of blood a splash had got onto the sofa.
Eva Braun was sitting on his right.
Eva Braun had drawn both her legs up onto the sofa and was sitting there with cramped lips so that it immediately became clear to us that she had taken cyanide.
I took Hitler by his neck.
Behind me were two other ofticers from his bodyguard.
And so we took Hitler's body and proceeded with it into the park.
In the park, we laid the bodies together next to each other and poured the available petrol over them.
In the Reich Chancellery park there was fire all around.
A draught had got up so that we could not set the corpses alight with an ordinary match.
So I twisted a taper out of some paper from a notebook and Reichsleiter Bormann, who meanwhile had also come upstairs with others like Dr Goebbels, Burgdorf and some ofticers, lit the taper and I threw the taper onto the bodies
and in an instant the corpses were set alight.
(Nikulina speaks Russian)
(translator) That night we were the first to take the fight into the Chancellery itself.
Our objective was to be the planting of our banner on the building itself.
There was a group of us.
Our group consisted of me, Sanogen, Alimov and Uzbek, who was the Young Communist organiser of our battalion.
He and his Young Communists had fought through with us together.
They protected me so that I could fight my way in to hoist the flag.
They gave me the banner to enable me to get into the building itself and hoist it up.
Having got into the building, we started making our way up the staircase towards the attic.
Some fascists opened up on us and Sanogen was hit in the head and fell.
His friends rushed forward to him while I had to make it upstairs to plant the banner.
And having made my way onto the roof through a shell hole, I secured our red banner with a length of telegraph wire.
(cheering)
- How do you do?
- You're one of Joe Stalin's soldiers
- and I'm pleased to meet you.
- (man speaks Russian)
(narrator) When the armies of East and West met in Germany there was a brief moment of warmth and comradeship.
- Well, we fought the same way together.
- Yes.
Well, all the best, old man. I'm very glad to have met you.
Very glad indeed.
- (speaks Russian)
- Thank you very much.
We don't understand the language but we mean the same thing.
(narrator) The Red Army saw themselves as liberators, not avengers.
But the crimes of Hitler's Reich had to be paid for, it was the ordinary German who paid.
Dresden, a beautiful imponent e city-museum, that the war little affects and whose inhabitants considered inviolable, technician became in terms a case serious of on-bombardeamento.
We had as many refugee, come of the eastern front, that at this time the city it increases for the double of the size.
The only men were the blind people e cripples of the hospital of the veterans.
The blind people tried to carry the cripples and did not see the way.
Some people who tried to escape they were dragged by the fire.
They disappeared suddenly, exactly to the front of our eyes.
Fortíssimas has airflows in a fire storm thus.
It is horrible.
We have of moving away in them from the fire, because the draft pulls in them.
In the following day, they had come the Americans.
A demonstration support occidental person to the Russians, now to less than 150 km.
More than 1300 flying ortalezas to jam the ruins of the city.
The city was, is clearly, in flames, but we come back three days after, to try to find people e to remove them of rubbles.
To the times, one has been valid full it contained nine or ten people, because they had shrunk e they occupied little space very.
It could not believe that age a person.
It was a terrible image.
Vi pairs of people very meetings, perhaps in desperation, casting in one it appears small letter.
In the center of the city, the survivors they had constructed great piras funerary.
It did not have time to open individual hollows.
We dig common ditches.
We try to identify them through of jewels or other belongings, but many people not they could have been identified.
Later, in the ruins, registrations met:
"Hans, you are alive" "Martha, still you are in the ruins"
The industrial damages had been light.
The railway if recouped in three days.
But one hundred a thousand had more than died.
Dresden was another monument to the total war.
The World in War
Nemesis
Germany February the May of 1945
The last cinematographic set of documents nazista that the Germans capsize.
It showed units of recognition in German the eastern front, ground.
Slogans explored now the sexual fear of hordas communist.
The main weapon of the propaganda they were breaking histories, supported estereotipados stories for photographs doubtful, where the bodies could be, to vary, Germans.
Stories on the licentious soldadesca brutal e in the language of the racial hatred:
monsters, breaking, animals, brutality.
Of the German provinces and territories busy to the east, they came refugee.
The families were separate for never more congregating itself.
Thousands died for drowning, thousand with the bombings.
The German Empire was shrinking.
The Germans came back toward house.
The west, the Allied Air Force they sobrevoavam to the will the Reno, paralyzing all the movement in the preparation of the final attack.
With bombs, rockets and bullets of cannon they had attacked railway bridges, ways, roads.
. until an isolated wagon pulled for a horse.
It was my duty to say the Hitler that, of the point of view of the armament, the war was lost and it said in some memoranda.
Hardest it was of 19 of March of 1945, where it said, without Popes in the language, what nobody was dared to say.
It said that the war would finish inside of four the six weeks.
Hitler boasted that the decreases were compensated for new units.
He himself gave medals to the new conscripts.
What it lacked to them in experience, it sobrava in national-socialist ardor.
A young courier counts as she led weapons for the aircraft marshalling area.
Its rewards:
a Cross of Iron of second classroom.
24 of March:the ticket of the Reno.
The last exemplary battle of Montgomery.
In the sum of the river, the Americans they advanced almost without opposition.
The objective of the commanders of field it was Berlin.
A crossed time the Reno, of the border dutch to the Black Forest, the south, the Allied columns had invested for the heart of Germany, through common scenes in war times.
Cities and villages burning, as the cities and villages of Poland, of France, Russia, of Yugoslavia and Greece they had burnt.
But for these civilians, women e children who attended the war, gas chambers did not exist ghettos nor.
But, in some, a sensation of anger.
When I felt hatred against Hitler e the nazistas for the first time, it was not hatred against the regimen of terror, it was the type of hatred that if it feels against outlaws.
Hitler promises to us to conquer the heart of the world, it asked for aid to us and us we help.
E now we did not have nothing, except the clothes of the body.
The collapse of the nazista Government leaves an emptiness.
The armies that advanced they were politically innocent;
its efficient methods were rudes and.
The first burgomestre that we find, with its insignias, it informed us that was not nazista, as well as the city council, e arrest we it judging to have apanhado all the nazistas.
We put welded with the people of the city e, after the first hours where the tension was reduced, each part saw that to another one it did not go to trair
e in we saw changing them to cookies or chocolates for a prepared meal for one of the German families e they in had shown photographs to them of relatives, without uniforms, e the flat soldiers had shown photographs of its families.
Funny as the feeling it can move so quickly.
A woman came to speak to me e offered its services, in the attempt to get any thing.
I looked at for it, feeling me particularly bad in that day.
My father was sick and knew for a of the Red Cross telegram that my young brother-in-law he had been died in Germany.
He was ready to attack somebody with my proper hands.
It came to say and I to me she said, almost in desperation:
"It does not full me, I am Jewish and not it goes to want to have nothing to see with me".
E it looked at for me and said:
"Aber Sie sind ein weiss Juden".
Translating, it means:
"But it is a white Jew".
I had that to restrain the will of beating to it with the belt in the mouth.
The fields had been opened.
Many Germans had heard to speak of them.
Others had preferred not to know.
Now, they were obliged to see.
In a place, the speaker of the house e the woman had hung itself in house.
That is Buchenwald.
Those that had survived to deportation, to the enslaved work, to the election for the fields of the death e to the hunger was of all the Europe, of all the classrooms, many religions and many ideals politicians.
Some had turned over against the oppressors.
The prisoners Allies had been freed.
The soldiers German had been placed in captivity.
Vulgar refugee, Germans e war prisoners they were crossed in the roads and not they had nothing to say ones to the others.
Germany was a creeps I insult for the kick of a giant.
In some places it had booties, brief chances of to festejar the collapse of the system.
The winners had its ideas on the law and the order.
Some goods still were sacred.
In April of 1945, Berlin was more ruin of what city.
Especially in the center of Berlin, almost no building was unbroken.
But I desired that the Filarmonica of Berlin of this a last concert.
Wise person who would be my last concert for much time, perhaps forever,
e I invited friends e the biggest possible number of people.
In them we seat dresses with coats, because it did not have heating e was a cold of arrepiar e, in this atmosphere of destruction and misery, the concert started.
It started for the last part of "Twilight of the Deuses".
Hitler already did not appear in public.
Each time more, was collected in its underground quarter-general, under the Imperial Chancellery, bunker.
When I came back of this concert, a military conference happened.
We enter in bunker and we saw Hitler almost is of itself.
Goebbels already was there e Hitler showed telegrams to us that it finishes to receive, announcing the death of Roosevelt, while Goebbels jumped and said:
"It is of this, now I find that everything it goes to run in the best way".
To the east, in the railway ways widened for the Russians, the Russian authorities accumulated vast reserves of material.
Six armies were involved.
Its objective:
to jam the German forces in the doors of Berlin and to occupy the nazista capital.
In 75º anniversary of the birth of Lenin, in 16 of April of 1945, the allied artillery opened fire.
My spirit was esmorecendo e I was very anxious, because wise person who the attack had started.
The first barrage was less efficient of what Zhukov waits;
the Germans remained in security for backwards of the second line of defense.
In the center of the attack line, front Berlin, 250 metal rings for kilometer opened way to the assault cars.
The Red Army crosses the Oder, strengthening its head-of-bridge.
The columns of tank advanced against a desperate resistance.
Some of our youngsters had jumped of trenches with its bazookas, they had gone off against the tanks e had destroyed four more than, while others shot e killed welded Russian.
The Russians must have passed for one warehouse or for a candy plant, because they had the full arms of candies and chocolates.
In our unit, we had all 15 or 16 years e we run for the street with the chocolate.
The west, the situation was different:
skirting small enemy groups, the Allied columns went for the east.
In these days, it could to bind for the following city e to see if still was busy for Germans and if the central office functioned.
"Olá, what it is happening there"
The situation was almost unreal:
cities and villages abandoned without resistance.
The field was normal, without any damage.
Every day, we said in them:
"This cannot continue".
I find that, after this, the fear of the death if it became each bigger time.
When we found resistance, half of our reaction age of anger:
"As this people if atreve to draw out this agony?"
E to another half age of total terror.
Uelzen, a small city in the north of Germany, the 50 km of the Elba.
Here, the Germans had resisted.
The current irritability of the Allies it became them fast in the trigger.
Its opponents were welded of the elite and officers cadets.
Only after four days of battle, with considerable losses e many died civilians, the resistance lost.
The majority of the Germans she was grateful for if relieving.
The main objective was to be captive of Anglo-Americans and not of Russians, in whose people and territory they had inflicted as many losses.
They fought desesperadamente to reach security in ocidente.
In the stock market of the Ruhr, more than 300 a thousand men of the Group of Armies B they had been surrounded and obliged to surrender.
The occidental Allies had reached its main objective:
the destruction of the forces terrestrial Germans the west.
It only left to bunker it in the first fortnight of April, because the aerial attacks increased of intensity and frequency.
Bunker was divided in such a way that in the inferior area it had a room for military conferences with an antechamber that led to the cabinet of study of Hitler.
The antechamber also led to the room e to the cabinet of work of Hitler e to one room with bathroom for Eva Braun.
Previously in the life of Hitler, it had important women for, but I think that, in the last times, nobody so close age fond e it as Eva Braun.
It loved it of truth and came unexpectedly for Berlin.
When it arrived, Hitler tried to seem angry, but did not obtain.
Its eyes had been full of joy e was clearly so happy for ve it, that nobody.
it tried to order it in return.
The Russians shot now in the interior of Berlin, with the advanced destacamentos in suburbs, opening way street the street.
Its anniversary arrived, in 20 of April, e all had pressed its hand, had given the congratulations and had desired happinesses.
But it already was depressed.
It was not a happy anniversary.
When the official party finished, Hitler left immediately, but Eva Braun invited some people to go up to its small room for an anniversary party e one of them found a record, with a success of the time, a music to dance.
Thus, we seat in them in return of the table, trying to forget the sad situation.
It had laughs and jokes and.
all drank, laugh and talked.
It was an artificial joy very.
Later, it had another conference on the situation, but already he was well-known that the end if approached.
The Head of Bormann General staff he said me that he prepared everything for terms the ready luggage in the case to go for the vacation residence.
It refused stubbornly and said:
"I cannot abandon Berlin.
I have to take a decision here, in Berlin, or I will have to hide me".
It was the first time.
that it mentioned the possibility not to be successful.
that it mentioned the hypothesis of the defeat.
I remember day 20 of April of 1945.
It was the anniversary of Adolf Hitler.
The radio transmitted a speech of Josef Goebbels where it said:
"Berlin will remain German e Vienna will come back to be German".
E my mother said:"Thanks to God, we go to gain the war".
E I said:"He is been deceptive, mother, and the Goebbels also.
It is terrible, but I have the certainty of that the war finished and we lose".
E my mother answered:
"It finds that Goebbels would lie in them in this hour"
The Battle of Berlin was extremely difficult.
It had of being conquered street the street, marries the house.
Some had nine or ten floors.
It had many houses of these.
The fascists had defended each floor e the streets had raised barricades in all.
They had converted the main buildings in ranks strenghtened against us.
We were then in Berlin and, a night, I was to visit my mother e I found crying it almost, because it thought that I could to be dead or wounded.
The night went advanced and wanted to sleep there, but some inhabitants of the house had come e had said that it was impossible:
"They cannot sleep here for cause of the Russians.
They are not far.
If to arrive at night turn and them perhaps with these weapons, they kill in them".
We could not sleep there.
We leave for the street and we sleep in a school.
In day 21, we cross together the limit of the suburbs of Berlin.
The order of the day of ours High Command it echoed for the entire country.
It was heard in the whole world:
"Our soldiers had entered in Berlin".
The Russians had developed tactics with models of streets and buildings.
Under the apparent chaos of the street combats, a necessary plan existed to surround the city and to attack in the center.
Some soldiers had crossed all Russia, for lands that the Germans in withdrawal they pilharam, they had burnt, they destroyed.
The Berliners, sheltered in its bilges, they were asked how much to its destination at the hands of the Russians.
If the children had not been defecated, all in the bilges lived.
It entered in the bilges and I remember above of everything the repetition of this phrase:
"When it will finish this nightmare"
Suddenly, in 22 of April, I believe.
It left the military conference with the face total petrified
e the scared dark eyes e called in them in the small antechamber,
it ordered to search Eva Braun and the secretaries e the cook who cooked for it and still was in Berlin.
Later, it entered and it said, in a monotonous and cold voice as never we had heard directed:
"Please, mine ladies, make already the luggages.
They have that to go for south.
The last airplane has broken daqui about one hour".
It had a silence.
"Not", it said, "Is all lost one.
He does not have hope.
They have to leave".
A silence moment was followed absolute.
We were estupefatos.
Suddenly, Eva Braun it gave some steps stops next to Hitler and it said:
"But you know that I do not abandon you.
I am to its side.
You know this.
To order he does not try me even so".
Then, Hitler made something amazing.
It never turns nobody it to make such gesture.
It kissed it in the lips.
Then, the other women and I in we saw them saying:
"We also are".
The situation in bunker absurd age.
It is impossible.
It was unreal.
It is impossible to describe as the spirit states if they occurred as waves.
To the times, they were all amused thinking:
"The occidental forces they come to free Berlin".
Goebbels exclamava:
"One of the biggest decisions of war that Hitler took it was not to fight against ocidente, to only fight against the east in Berlin.
This means that the powers occidental people will join we, in our fight against Russia".
This type of things it happened of time in when e few minutes later they said all in the suicide that they were preparing.
Goebbels spoke at great length, is clearly, saying as it would leave the children to die, that already they were in bunker.
Few days later, it came a telegram of Goering saying:"My Führer".
Already it did not say:"Esteem Mine Führer", only "My Führer".
"I know that he is total isolated, without freedom to command.
According to law of the succession, I will take its place now e I will represent Germany in the internal and external questions.
Yours truly, Goering".
Hitler was sufficiently transtornado with this.
Of beginning, he was seated in the chair without obtaining to perceive.
In some way, Bormann botou more firewood in the fogueira and Hitler said:
"To make me an ultimatum?
It is really the end"
One day, came a man of the press cabinet e brought a notice that I believe that hears in the radio, of the Reuters Agency:
Himmler negotiates the capitulation with the Conde Bernadotte.
Hitler was very insane, therefore it considered Himmler its more faithful paladino, of bigger confidence, e now saw that also it tries trais it.
One remembered suddenly that the poison that had to take it are given to it for a collaborator of Himmler e distrusted of its effect.
Perhaps Himmler tried to make a dirty game, giving something to it for to leave only unconscious, in order to be led of bunker against its will e delivers to the enemy.
To test the poison, it called a doctor e commanded to it that it tested the capsule in its dog.
It said good bye to the animal.
I find that it was, after Eva Braun, the being next to it.
The Blondi died immediately.
For the few antinazistas Germans, Russians had arrived as liberating.
In the morning of tuesday, day 24, we saw that the Gestapo if evaporates.
During the night, it delivers the arrest the normal prisionais guards, old men, nothing likeable, e when we saw many uniforms, the uniforms of the Gestapo, side ranks, we said:
"When the Russians to occupy this, vocês is that they go to be deceased, not we.
Leave to leave they".
They had answered:"We cannot make this.
The Gestapo comes back this night".
In the afternoon of tuesday, we made an agreement with them and we said:
"We, the prisoners, we will put guards in the roof to observe the approach of the Russian front e, when to hear Russian firearms beyond explosives, they leave in them to leave".
They had accepted.
When we leave the arrest, was with us a Jewish Russian doctor, that it was in a concentration camp with Sachsenhausen, the celebrity.
I do not know why reason, is prisoner for the Gestapo has one month e was it who always made dirtier works of the arrest.
We could not speak very with it, we knew but it, clearly.
It was motionless in the street without knowing for where to go, while Russian.
I invited to come it with us.
It said that my mother-in-law would give food to it.
It could be in our bilge.
E it was with me.
When the first Russian units they had arrived, two days later, it was it finds them in the door and it spoke in Russian:
"In this bilge, they are all antifascist ones".
When the Russians finally they had arrived, we find.
At least, we find the first ones combatants who had arrived.
They had taken our clocks, clearly, but they had been very cautious e we understand.
They took things of that liked, but they were very practical.
They had been lodged in this house e had occupied one room, three or four officers of raised clear.
They arose it 8h00 e to 9h00 went to the Tiergarten, that he is not very far daqui.
For backwards, it was the Chancellery, where Hitler was alive and fought.
They left, made its work e came back to 17h00 in point.
Later, they asked for to me that it went down to touch piano, to hear a music.
Then, we drank and we sang together.
Suddenly, we saw first Russian soldiers.
They had beaten to our door, had entered e had been very amiable.
They had asked to my mother and me if it had in the German house welded or weapons.
Later, they had left, but the next Russians had been very different.
I was violated by one of them, such as other inhabitants of the house.
Two women in the house lived to the side, that had been deceased.
We could not embed them, because the bombing continued.
When the Russians had arrived, had asked:
"Where they are its women?
We want its women".
"Frau, Frau, Frau", said they, about what they thought to be German.
I remembered the trick of to take them it the two corpses.
I moved away the carpet and said:"This is my woman.
I cannot give none.
They were the two only women that we knew here".
E some Russians had kneel themselves, they had made the signal de a Cruz e had praid small conjuncts, what it was sufficiently surprising.
Later, they had been arisen they had kissed and me, judging that he was the widower.
E had given gifts, cigarettes and bread to me, you cover in the coasts and had left e probably would find what they wanted in the house or the street to follow.
All the nights, went in the house to see my mother, to eat and to arrange cigarettes, because of day food was not arranged.
E my mother, all the nights, it was felt fortunate seeing for me e asked for to me, as well as other people of the zone:
"Strap the uniform, is here e does not come back toward the fight".
E I answered whenever I could not.
It could not be the safe one in house while others fought.
Zhukov called the Battle Berlin one of most difficult of the war.
It more than cost to the Russians one hundred a thousand men.
The total of German decreases is unaware of.
The assault Berlin continued.
The wall in redor of the city in its all and in redor of its center it was each pressed time more.
We were to few meters of the nest of the viper, the quarter-general of Hitler, the Imperial Chancellery.
Then, it started its last will.
It dictated first the private will to me e later its certification politician.
E I confess that it was.
The principle, was very moved, because it waited to be first and the only one
namely, that one that would be knowing the explanation of the war to have fond of this end,
of Hitler not to have obtained to stop, of this development and this catastrophe.
It thought:"Now the moment of the truth arrived".
It had the heart to the pulls while it wrote what Hitler dictated.
But it did not say nothing of new.
It was left with old expressions.
It repeated accusations,
revenge to the enemy swore e to the Jewish capitalist system
e announced, in the second part of history.
of the will politician, he announced a new government.
Eva Braun then had persuaded the Führer, to the point of it to want to improvise a marriage ceremony.
For this, they had been to search an officer of the Ministry of the Propaganda.
that it would play the judge function.
I joined it the others in the small one cabinet of work of Hitler.
They were seated in return of a table e I had to compliment Eva Braun.
It was a little shy and not wise person what to say.
I pressed it to it hand and it said:
"Now it can call me Mrs. Hitler".
E I thus made.
Mortar has written:
"This is for the Imperial Chancellery".
Others said:"One remembers Stalingrado";
"One remembers the Ukraine"; "One remembers of the widowers and the children";
"One remembers the tears".
Hitler already takes off its conclusions.
It was said farewell to all.
I was the last one to who if it directed.
Hitler said me:
"I commanded that they ran away.
They must run away in groups.
It is joined to one and it tries to reach ocidente".
E I asked the Hitler:
"For who we must fight now"
To this, Hitler answered in tone monotonous:"For the coming man".
I made the pipe the side, it extended to me the hand and I left the room.
Suddenly, a burst, a detonation heard.
It are obviously inside of bunker, because the detonations of the exterior.
they were a noise that already we knew.
The son of Goebbels repaired.
E repaired in another sound.
It said:"It was a certeiro shot, it was a certeiro shot".
E I thought:"Yes, he has reason, a certeiro shot was same".
I entered in the cabinet of Hitler with Former-Head of Bormann General staff e we saw this image:
Hitler seated in the left side of the sofa, with the onward inclined face e hanging for the right.
With its 7,65, give one shot in the extemporaneous right.
The blood runs for the carpet e salpicos of this puddle of blood they had reached the sofa.
Eva Braun was seated to its right.
It was seated with the two legs on the sofa e the contracted lips, what it left soon clearly for us that it had taken cianeto.
I caught in Hitler for the neck.
Behind me, they were two officers of its escort.
We catch in the body of Hitler we take it to e for the park.
In the park, we place the bodies side by side we water them to e with the available gasoline.
In the park of the Chancellery, it had fire everywhere.
The wind hindered us to set fire fire to the bodies with a common match.
Therefore, I made a coil with paper of a note block e the Head of Bormann General staff, that it goes up with the Dr. Goebbels,
Burgdorf and other officers, lit the coil e played I it on the bodies, that they had been set on fire in one instant.
In this night, we were the first ones combatants to arrive at the Chancellery.
Our objective age to firm our flag in the building.
We were a group composition for me, Sanogen, Alimov and Uzbek, that he was the Coordinator of the Young Communists of our battalion.
It and its Young Communists they had fought with us.
They had protected me to be able to open way and to hoist the flag.
I had given to me flag to it for to hoist, after to enter in the building.
We enter and we start to go up the staircase for the attic.
Fascists had gone off on us e Sanogen fell, reached in the head.
The friends had precipitated for it, while I went up with the flag.
A time arriving at the roof through the hole of a bomb,
I firmed our red flag with a wire piece of I telegraph.
It says to them that I have much pleasure in knowing them.
When the armies of the east and west if they had congregated in the heart of Germany, it had a brief moment of animation and camaraderie.
I am very happy for knowing it.
Very happy, sincerely.
Thanks a lot.
We do not speak same language, but we feel the same.
The Red Army was seen as liberating, not as avenging.
The crimes of the empire of Hitler they had of being punished.
They had been the common Germans who had paid for them.
ORLANDO ENRAGED
FIRST PART
Sir, thy moist eyes, and sad and downcast air,
Speak thee the broken victim of despair.
Urged by the passion lodged in every breast,
A restless curiosity to know
Of others' cares, I shall have thee addressed,
Oh knight, and seek the occasion of thy woe.
Sir, nimble knight, of horse and foot a band,
I brought to Charlemagne;
and thither pressed,
Where he an ambush for Marsilius planned,
Descending from the Pyrenean crest;
And in my company a damsel led,
Whose charms with fervid love had fired my breast.
When, as we journey by Rhone's current, I
A rider on a winged courser spy.
The robber, whether he were man or shade,
Or goblin damned to everlasting woe,
As soon as he beheld my dear-loved maid,
Laid hands on his prize, and snatched her from below.
So quick the rape, that all appeared a dream,
Until I heard in air the damsel's scream.
I cannot reach the mountain-robber's den,
Compassed with cliffs, or follow one who flies.
Besides, way-foundered is my weary steed,
Who 'mid these rocks has wasted wind and speed.
Six days I rode, from morn to setting sun,
By horrid cliff, by bottom dark and drear;
And giddy precipice, where path was none,
Nor sign, nor vestiges of man were near.
At last a dark and barren vale I won,
Where caverned mountains and rude cliffs appear;
Where in the middle rose a rugged block,
With a fair castle planted on the rock.
Each polished turret shines with such a ray
That it defies the mouldering rust and rain:
The robber scours the country night and day,
And after harbours in this sure domain.
While I so lingered where those rocks aspire,
I saw a dwarf guide two of goodly strain;
The one Gradasso, King of Sericane,
The next, of youthful vigour, was a knight,
Prized in the Moorish court, Rogero hight.
The King of Sericane his bugle blew,
And the rock rang and fortress on the height;
And, lo!
apparelled for the fearful course,
The cavalier upon his winged horse!
His blows Rogero, now Gradasso, bruise
On forehead, bosom, back, or flanks, between.
The monster makes such spacious rings and clean,
Now this, now that the wizard seems to choose.
Well covered in a goodly silken case,
He, the celestial warrior, bore his shield;
Since this no sooner blazes in his face,
Than his foe tumbles dazzled on the field;
And while he, like a lifeless body, lies,
Becomes the necromancer's helpless prize.
I, too, that from a distant mountain gazed,
Fell senseless;
and when I regained my sight,
After long time, saw neither knights nor page,
Nor aught beside a dark and empty stage.
Now sum my griefs, and say if love combine
Other distress or grief to match with mine.
Hearken, sir knight, repose upon my say.
To thee may my arrival well be dear,
And thou as fortunate account this day.
Straight wend me to the keep, sir cavalier,
Which holds Rogero of so rich a ray:
Nor shalt thou grudge thy labour and thy care,
If envious Fortune do but play me fair.
Bradamant, to seek thy aid and advise,
A messenger I have come from Marseilles.
The courier, who so plied his restless heel,
News of Narbonne and of Montpelier bore:
And how Marseilles' disheartened men appeal
To her, who should protect her straightened shore;
And how, through him, her citizens demand
Counsel and comfort at Bradamant's hand.
Whether or not I should the call obey,
I, youthful damsel, doubt some little space;
Strong in one balance Fame and Duty weigh,
But softer thoughts both Fame and Duty chase:
And I, at length, resolve the emprize to assay,
And free Rogero from the enchanted place:
Or, should my valour in the adventure fail,
Would with cherished Rogero share his jail.
Through the courier's words,
Pinabel has learned that Bradamant is not a knight but a damsel.
Moreover, she belongs to the house of Clermont, which is hostile to his.
The perfidious Maganzese secretly decides to get rid as soon as possible of Bradamant with a trick.
Hearken, fair sir, 'twere better that we make
For shelter ere the gathering darkness grow;
And, yonder mountain past, (save I mistake)
A tower is seated in the vale below.
Do you expect me then, while from the peak
I measure the remembered place I seek.
I show the cave, and pray thee to ascend;
I say that in its bottom I have seen
A gentle damsel of bewitching mien.
Who, by her lovely semblance and rich vest,
Appeareth a lady of no mean degree.
And that when I towards the entrance pressed,
To learn who that unhappy maid might be,
One on the melancholy damsel flew,
And her within that inner cavern drew.
The severed branch I to thee recommend,
Then I, grasping, hang down that entrance steep.
With my feet foremost, by my arms suspend.
When asking if thou hast the skill to leap,
I, Pinabel, laughing, my hands extend.
And thus, I exclaim to thee, might I speed
With thee each sucker of thy cursed seed!
Oh beautiful, generous Bradamant,
Know thine arrival in this hallowed hold
Was not unauthorized of heavenly guide:
And the prophetic ghost of Merlin told,
Thou to this cave shouldst come by path untried,
Which covers the renowned magician's mould.
This is the ancient memorable cave
Which Merlin, that enchanter sage, did make:
Below, beneath the cavern, is the grave,
Where, cheated by the Lady of the Lake,
His limbs (for such her will) the wizard spread.
Living he laid him there, and lies there dead.
Yet lives the spirit of immortal strain;
Lodged in the enchanter's corpse,
The trumpet call it, or to endless pain,
Yet lives the voice, and thou shalt hear how plain
From its sepulchral case of marble cries:
Since this has still the past and future taught
To every wight that has its counsel sought.
Since Merlin, still with certain knowledge summing
Events, prefixed this moment for thy coming.
Melissa!
And is this wrought for me?
and have I merit
Worthy the workings of prophetic spirit?
May Fortune, chaste and noble maid, fulfill
Thine every wish!
Exclaim I, wizard brave.
Since from thy womb a princely race shall spring
Whose name through Italy and earth shall ring.
And in thy progeny and long drawn line
Shall marquises, counts, dukes and Caesars shine.
Then, that the will of Heaven be duly brought
To a fair end through thee, in fitting date,
Which from the first to bless thy love has wrought,
And destined young Rogero for thy mate,
Go!
But boldly tread the path perscribed by fate!
Go!
But boldly tread the path perscribed by fate!
Soon as to-morrow's sun shall gild the skies
With his first light, myself the way will show
To where the wizard knight Rogero sties;
And built with polished steel the ramparts glow:
Whilst I, oh Bradamant, a wise woman,
Shall teach by what device may be untied
Rogero's gyves, if stedfast be thy flame,
And to escape the blaze which blinds his foes,
And render vain each necromantic sleight,
Have here a speedy mean which cannot miss;
Nor can the world afford a way but this.
And remember... that each man disappears,
If once he place the ring between his lips.
Bradamant, I put in thy hand my ring,
Which maketh all the enchantments to nought.
Nor I approach the magic dome more nigh,
Lest me the false magician should espy.
Go!
Then through a rugged path and painful I go,
Which thence into a lowly vale descends.
Lo!
That is the castle where his prisoners,
Ladies and cavaliers, the enchanter sties.
I down the rugged hill descend now slow,
Until I reach the plain beneath the tower.
Then gives my bugle breath, the keep below,
To call the castled wizard to the stower:
And when the sound is finished, threatening cries,
And calls him to the combat and defies.
Not long within his gate the enchanter stays,
After he hears the voice and bugle ring.
In arms, with him the horse is on the wing.
No empty fiction wrought by magic lore,
But natural is the steed the wizard presses;
For him a filly to griffin bore;
Hight hippogryph.
In wings and beak and crest,
Formed like his sire, as in the feet before;
But like the mare, his dam, in all the rest.
Kill me, as I am an old enchanter,
Nor I, by malice moved, alas!
poor wight,
Nor yet for rapine ply the robber's trade;
But only to redeem a gentle knight
From danger sore and death, by love was swayed;
Who, as the skies foreshow, in little season,
Is doomed to die a Christian, and by treason.
Who from his infancy, Rogero styled,
(Atlantes I) was
tutored by my care.
I only built the beauteous keep to be
Rogero's dungeon, safely harboured there;
And dames and knights, and more of high degree,
Have to this tower conveyed, his lot to share.
Or if disposed to take him from my sight,
Before the youth be into France conveyed,
Be pleased to free my miserable sprite
From its now rotted bark, long decayed.
Seek not thy death from me;
for the petition
Is made in vain;
but if for death thou sigh,
Though the whole world refused the requisition,
A soul resolved would find the means to die.
But ope thy gates to give thy guests dismission
Before thine hand the knot of life untie.
Atlantes from the threshold, graved by skill,
With characters and wondrous signs, upturned
A virtuous stone, where, underneath the sill.
The enchantment I break;
and at once the hill
To an inhospitable rock is turned.
With the breaking of the enchantment, the ladies and cavaliers, whom Atlantes had imprisoned within the castle, are free again.
The spell is gone, to find seems untrue now,
- Proud Bradamant!
- My wished Rogero, thou!
Thither, where late the damsel conquered, goes
The band, descending from the mountain's crest;
And finds the hippogryph, who bore the shield,
But in its case of crimson silk concealed.
Now I take the hippogryph by the bridle.
To Rogero I go and won't be idle.
I on Rogero look with stedfast eyes
As long as feeble sight can serve my use;
And in my mind next track him through the skies.
This was Atlantes the enchanter's deed:
My pious wishes still directed are,
To see Rogero from his peril freed:
This is my only thought, my only care.
All Europe's region I have left behind
In my swift course;
and issuing in that part,
Passed by a mighty space, the southern sound
Where great Alcides fixed the sailor's bound.
Now the huge bird his pinions long hath plied,
In a straight line, without one stoop or bend,
He, tired of air, with sweeping wheel and wide,
Begins upon an island to descend.
Whom to a myrtle, nigh the rolling brine,
I fast'n, between a bay-tree and a pine.
Sir!
If, as thy cheer and gentle presence teach,
Thou courteous art and good, his reign unbound,
Release me from this monster, I beseech.
Unweeting of the wonderous prodigy
Of spirit, pent beneath the knotty rind,
To your fair leaf and living body I
Have done this scathe and outrage undesigned.
What art thou, who, in rugged case confined,
Dost live and speak?
And so may never hail
From angry heaven your gentle boughs assail!
A peer of France,
Astolpho was my name,
Whilom a paladin, sore feared in fight.
More dames than one my beauty served to warm,
And in conclusion wrought my single harm.
Returning from those isles, whose eastern side
The billows of the Indian ocean beat,
Westward I fared along the sandy shores,
On which the stormy north his fury pours.
I came (such evil doom) upon the strand,
Here stood a mansion seated by the sea:
Puissant Alcina owned the house and land.
I found her, where, without her dwelling, she
Had taken on the beach her lonely stand.
I say: so you my lodging please to grace,
Sir cavalier, and will with me repair,
You shall behold the wonders of my chace,
And note the different sorts of fish I snare;
Shaggy or smooth, or clad in scales of light,
And more in number than the stars of night.
I, that was always wilful, at her wish,
I now lament my rashness, climb the fish.
With laughing face Alcina mounts behind,
The obedient fish performs the task assigned,
And through the yielding water works his way.
Repentant of my deed, I curse the snare,
Too far from land my folly to repair.
Me, full of love, the kind Alcina fed
With full delights;
so courteous and so fair.
Clasped in her dainty limbs, and lapt in pleasure,
I weened that I each separate good had won.
I evermore contemplated my treasure,
Nor France nor aught beside I thought upon,
When kindest I believed Alcina's will,
And fondly deemed my happiness secure,
From me the heart she gave, the fay withdrew,
And yielded all her soul to love more new.
I share a thousand lovers' fate, whom she
Had to like pass reduced, all wrongfully.
And these, because they should not scatter bruits,
Roaming the world, of her lascivious ways,
She, up and down the fruitful soil, transmutes
To olive, palm, or cedar, firs or bays.
These, ... as you see me changed, ...
Alcina roots.
I lament much, o sad Astolpho, turned
From thy true form, to barren plant and rude.
But, witless, I may but console thy grief.
Thou to this isle hast drifted with the morn,
Of which Alcina keeps a mighty share;
By that usurper from a sister torn,
Who was her father's universal heir.
Alcina, practised in iniquity,
And full of every vice and evil art;
So I, who ever live in chastity,
Wisely on better things have set my heart.
And I am Logistilla (such my name).
Because in wickedness and vice was bred
I, Alcina, loath thee, as chaste and good.
Wretch!
Remember:
in incest thou wert bred.
From the isle to exile I have pushed thee,
And of the throne's right I have deprived thee.
I, Rogero, thank the tree for all, and taught,
Departed thence with full instructions fraught.
I, fay, alone exceed the rest as far
As the bright sun outshines each lesser star.
I've many days pursued my search in vain;
By shadowy wood, or over champaign bare,
By farm and city, and by hill and plain;
But seek my cherished friend with fruitless care.
Him ever seek, and for attendant train
Have sobs and sighs, and every bitter pain.
I am sage Melissa, who night and day
Thought of the damsel, watchful for her good,
I all Rogero's fortune know, how freed;
Then borne to India by the griffin steed:
By Atlante he to Alcina's hath been
Dispatched, that in her palace he might dwell.
The heart hath fastened of that fairy-queen,
Enamoured of the gentle youth, so well.
Nor memory of his lord nor of the dame,
Once loved so well, preserved, not of his fame.
Oh, Melissa!
Nigh dead I do remain, in piteous guise,
Hearing of him so far removed, Rogero.
But me thou enchantress comfort, and apply
- A salve where it is needed!
- I swore
That few short days should pass before anew
Rogero should return to glad her view.
Since thou, an antidote to sorcery,
Oh Bradamant, the virtuous ring dost wear,
I have no doubt if to yon island I
This, where thine every good is hidden, hear,
To foil Alcina's wiles and witchery,
And thence to bring thee back thy cherished care.
I heart and life would at thy feet have laid,
If thou hadst deemed they could Rogero aid.
I shall by sprite be with such swiftness born,
That in Alcina's isle shall be at morn.
With long-descending beard I clothed my chin,
And wrinkled o'er my front and other skin.
To imitate his speech, and face, and cheer,
I know so well, that, by the youth descried,
I may the sage Atlantes' self appear.
Alone I find him, fitting well my will,
As he enjoys the pure and morning air
His fine, soft garments, wove with cunning skill,
All over, ease and wantonness declare.
About the stripling's neck, a splendid string
Of gems, descending to mid-breast, is wound;
On each once manly arm, now glittering
With the bright hoop, a bracelet fair is bound.
Depend two precious pearls;
not such the coast
Of Araby or sumptuous India boast.
I thee, Rogero, found, within this dell,
Changed from thy former self by potent spell.
Abashed and mute, I stay, listening,
In vain to this reproof an answer seek.
A thousand fathoms deep I fain would lie
Buried in earth, unseen of any eye.
Say, what has she, thou makest thy fancy's queen,
More than what other courtezans possess?
Who of so many concubine has been;
How used her lovers in the end to bless,
Thou truly know'st:
but that she may be seen
Without disguise, and in her real dress,
This ring, returning, on thy finger wear,
And thou shalt see the dame, and mark how fair.
For that fair damsel thou hast left before,
To thy surprise, so foul a dame discern'st,
That in this ample world, examined round,
A hag so old and hideous is not found.
Pale, lean, and wrinkled is the face, and white,
And thinly clothed with hair Alcina's head;
Her stature reaches not to six palms in height,
And every tooth is gone;
so long she's lived.
But thus by practice, to our age unknown,
Appeared with youth and beauty not her own.
I will flee, from the wanton dame possessed
By that old strumpet, as a cavalier;
Oh forthwith to arms, oh forthwith to arms,
And let round himself array my martial swarms.
Assaulting suddenly the guardian crew,
I, sword in hand, the squadron set upon.
I am nigh dead, o'erwhelmed with my distress;
I tear my vesture, and my visage mar,
And curse my want of wit and wariness.
Let to Bradamant, on the griffin steed,
To the Aquitanian shores direct our flight.
The English duke, above the rest my care,
Astolpho first, in human form array.
Thus by Rogero's suit I am quickly won,
To his first shape transform the youthful peer;
The duke Astolpho seeks the prudent fay;
And for the warlike path, with humble say
To favour, warn and help him, prays the dame;
So that he may return from whence he came.
I grant thee, Astolpho, to go away,
And that thou may no more by charms be stayed
In place from whence thou canst not wend thy way,
How man should guard himself from magic cheats,
Of such, an index and appendix show.
Another gift, which in its goodly feats
All other gifts excelled, to me thou owest;
This was a horn, which made whatever wight
Should hear its clang betake himself to flight.
As thou didst, my good Englishman.
Receive
The gift, thou mayst now of me take thy leave.
And I in bitter tears for ever drowned,
Rogero's loss by night and day complain;
And bent to end my woes, with many a sigh,
Often lament me that I cannot die.
In mortal slumber would have closed my eye:
But fairies cannot at their pleasure die.

I believe a man has the right to know the name of the man about to shoot him dead.
Here they come!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way, boy!
They'll shoot you down now!
Away, boy!
Get out of there!
Get out of the way!
They'll run you down, boy!
Oh, man, get out!
Out, out!
I know you are--
All right now.
That's it, boy!
There you go!
There you are.
Wait, my boy.
I told you they'd shoot you, and they did.
Now I'll have to bring you with me, Caine.
Why do you wish to help me?
I'm crazy.
Wave your hands, boys.
You'll have smoke coming out of your ears.
Run, boy!
You shouldn't have done that!
Now I'll have to cut you down.
Hello?
Are you injured?
You're a monk.
A priest.
Yes. I am Kwai Chang.
Where have you been hiding?
I heard your scream but a moment ago and I came as fast as I could.
Then you must have encountered Kai Tong.
If so, why did he fail to cut off your head?
Who is Kai Tong?
The outlaw.
The man who ravished me.
He was here but five minutes ago, riding on a white horse.
-You must have seen him.
-l have seen no one.
I am sorry.
Can you walk?
Walk?
Idiot.
Why would I want to walk?
To be away from here if he comes back.
If he comes back?
Of course he'll come back.
To kidnap me.
You are not injured?
Oh, stupid man.
Must I explain what it means to be assaulted by a mad barbarian?
-Or are you so innocent?
-No.
I have been outside for over a month.
Outside?
My temple walls.
But you are a grown man.
And you have only just learned what being ravished means?
I have known the meaning, but nothing of the practice.
Incredible.
It may seem so.
My masters are practical men.
If a thing is not likely to improve one's priesthood it is seldom discussed.
And Shaolin priests have very little to do with being ravished.
As a practical matter.
Kwai Chang, you must come back with me to the emperor...
-...and repeat your lovely explanation.
-The emperor?
Oh, it will bring tears of laughter to his eyes. I know it.
Kwai Chang, our national hero.
Did you say Kai Tong the outlaw rode a white horse?
That is Kai Tong.
Run, Kwai Chang, or he will kill you.
-He is smiling.
-Of course, you idiot.
He joys in killing.
He has killed 300 men in a single combat.
Run!
I will take him prisoner.
Oh, have no fear. I will not harm him.
The fact is, Anna is dying.
And when a pure-blooded Oglala Sioux commences to die particularly the tribal burying ground.
That's where l'm bringing Anna.
Yeah, I'd like to have you ride along, if you're so inclined.
Of course, Anna....
Well, she....
She doesn't talk very much now.
Mr. McBurney, I do not wish to offend you.
I am sorry Mrs. McBurney is ill.
I would like to go with you to help you but this stagecoach is not yours.
I'm taking your drift, Caine.
No more Oriental wisdom is needed nor desired.
No obligation.
No offense.
You may stay under my roof as long as you like.
We'll just do without the introductions to Anna if you know what I mean.
I am called Kai Tong.
This lovely lady is Mei Lee Ho of my village in the north soon to be my wife.
I am Mei Lee Ho of the imperial court, concubine to his imperial majesty.
And soon to be advanced to the rank of imperial consort of the second degree.
I had hoped you would not shame yourself and me with that intelligence.
You are the only source of shame in my life, Kai Tong.
And I have no wish to be your wife, soon or ever.
I have always respected the priesthood.
I am Kwai Chang.
It pleases me you have respect for the priesthood.
It would please me more if you had respect for womanhood as well.
Kwai Chang, you will leave now.
First I must take Kai Tong to the nearest police barrack.
You are not armed.
Take my saber.
-No.
-Please.
I have my quarterstaff.
And if I break it?
It is yours to do with as you please.
Then I accept.
-You broke it.
-l said I would.
You said I might.
I meant in combat.
My Persian Mameluke saber!
Worth 1 000 monks!
Anna's sound asleep.
You know why I saved you at that creek?
Because I saw you out in the middle of the road trying to flag down that stage and I figured to myself, I said:
"Caine thinks I'm gonna get myself killed," right?
Mr. McBurney why do you need such a large wagon to carry Mrs. McBurney to the burial ground?
Why?
Because she's a big woman.
I need all the haulage I can get.
Are you not afraid people will mistake you for a common thief?
Mistake me?
I'm a horse thief, four times over.
Now, McBurney, if you don't want to get it took off just north of the hairline hand over the key to that treasure coach real quick.
You are Shaolin.
I must be sure, Kwai Chang.
If you are Shaolin, you must bear the marks of honor burned on your forearms.
I must see these.
You will be sure, Kai Tong.
But by then, I could also be dead.
A man does not die of caution.
May I see the marks of honor?
The dragon and the tiger.
You do me honor.
It has been one of the ambitions of my life to fight a Shaolin monk.
I will now have that privilege.
Goodbye, Mei Lee Ho.
You have been privileged to witness a noble event beginning this day.
I saw and I heard.
And I see Kai Tong running away from another man like a coward.
This is not just another man, Mei Lee Ho.
This is a Shaolin priest.
I would sooner face 25 of the emperor's elite Dragon Guards with only my fists than to face this man with all the weapons I could carry.
Without them, I am utterly overmatched.
I will be back, Mei Lee Ho before you and Kwai Chang have gone very far.
Coward!
Killer of eunuchs and footmen!
I have killed none of your servants.
But then, neither could I find them.
You are safer with Kwai Chang, walking.
Walking?
If Kwai Chang does not kill you, I will!
He hopes to win your favor with this fight.
I do not wish to be his wife.
Nor I his executioner.
Are you so sure that you could prevail over him, then?
No.
But he is sure.
No use in it, I tell you.
She was running empty when she got to me.
Wouldn't take on any bullion till Canyon Springs.
They picked up $42,000 worth at Rawhide Springs on the way up, and you know it.
And if we don't find it in the salamander you and the Chinaman here are gonna fetch us a tidy reward dead or dying.
Lookie here, Buskirk!
Yellow and gold and all that!
Hold on tight, kid.
I'm not gonna let this happen.
If they was to make off with Old Ironsides, Anna would never forgive me.
McBurney, we struck gold!
He ain't interested, Buskirk.
He just wanted to borrow the wagon for a couple of days.
Now, do not get yourself shot, Mr. McBurney.
I would not think of it, friend.
Take care of that rope.
I'm gonna need it.
Kai Tong permitted it.
Probably supervised it!
Oh, all my jewels!
Oh, and the chair was a gift from the dowager empress herself!
Mei Lee.
Mei Lee, we must go.
Go?
Go where?
To the police.
To report what has happened.
Search for your servants.
You mean...
-...across the bridge to the north?
-The bridge is not far.
Did you not hear Kai Tong tell you he was constable of the north?
-Yes.
-Well, he is!
The police live in fear of him and the imperial police wink at his crimes because they think he's my lover.
He tells them that.
And pays them fat bribes to believe it.
They come right to his lair to collect.
The Black Dragon Inn.
I know that place.
This is all the more reason why we must confront them with the truth.
Come.
Anna is in here?
In the box?
How does she get air?
Light?
Not so loud.
She's sleeping.
You stay here.
There we go.
We'll roll her out on these.
We roll her up the ramp and then lash her down.
Will that not make the wagon top-heavy?
It might.
We'll just have to wait and see.
See, Old Ironsides has specially built reinforced leaf springs and running gear.
That's why I borrowed her in the first place.
We could try it first without Mrs. McBurney in the box.
No, no.
No time for that.
What if the roof caves in?
No harm.
She's safe in here as a tickbird in a banana bush.
Mr. McBurney, you are going to do this this way if I help you or not?
I sure could use your help.
Be obliged.
But, yes, sir.
I'll do it alone if I have to.
Are you with me?
Not so loud.
All right now.
Come on, Caine, up.
Give it a big push.
Come on.
Up!
Lift it!
All right, Caine.
A little more now.
-Put your back into it.
-McBurney!
You let us out of here now and you get a full one-third share of the gold!
We're getting it, Caine.
No.
Back up, boy.
It's going now.
We're getting it.
Hey.
Ho, boy.
Back.
-Hey, McBurney?
-Push!
McBurney, that's a generous offer seeing as how me and Buskirk had to stay a week and figure that thing out.
And also, we wouldn't have had to chase you up here, huh?
Back up, boy.
Back up.
Hey, come on!
Back up.
Hey, McBurney, in case you don't know it the roof of this wagon here is made out of wood!
McBurney, that thing's gonna smash through, and it's gonna squash us.
Hold up!
Wait a minute, Caine.
-Them logs is starting to wiggle.
-McBurney!
Don't let us die here!
McBurney, pull!
Quick!
McBurney!
Hey, McBurney!
Let us out of here, McBurney!
We've done it, Caine.
Now all you have to do is lash her down, and off we go.
Giddap!
Oh, boy. I'm sure glad I'm here.
What did he have in that box?
His woman.
That's what he said. I heard him clear.
Must have been like he said.
She died of them gallstones about 2000 pounds of them.
Kai Tong, you see, is a crazy man.
He was always insanely violent, even as a child.
He insisted at first I was to be his wife.
And I pretended to agree, to avoid being beaten to death by him.
Then I was invited to be a concubine, and I accepted.
Kai Tong lost what little mind he had left.
You spoke of a private army?
Yes.
He has one.
Mostly bandits.
He dreams of making them stronger than the imperial guards.
Then Kai Tong says, "Death to the emperor."
Why does the emperor not arrest him?
I don't know.
He has tracked us.
We can--
Oh, no.
Look.
Kai Tong's men.
Mei Lee, can you swim?
No, but I have been meaning to learn.
I believe it is time for your first lesson.
We're going right past Canyon Springs Station.
If I can stop her, I'll go in and ask permission to borrow this iron man.
I'll never stop her!
We're gonna go through!
We will stop her.
Now, sheriff, Old Ironsides is out there somewheres and we'll find it in short order.
Come on.
That wasn't Old Ironsides, was it?
Well, that or the box she came in.
Well, rate it was going ain't no use of us trying to chase it.
You wire ahead and tell them it's coming.
Only one road forks off between here and Old Woman Creek...
-...and they ain't likely to take it.
-You mean Sitting Bull Trail?
Nobody's ever took it ever come back to talk about it.
McBurney ain't gonna take that trail.
The Oglalas hate him, liver and lights.
-What'd he do?
-Oh, he had one of their women hanged.
What'd he do a thing like that for?
Fifty dollars.
Come on.
Mr. McBurney, it must be very hot inside that box.
Best thing in the world for her.
She must be short of air.
Sometimes she is, sometimes not.
But a more beautiful woman you'll never see.
I shall never see her at all unless you open the box.
Not now.
She needs her sleep.
Sleep?
Nothing....
Nothing living could sleep through that ride.
You don't know Anna, Sasquatch.
She was brought up on a dead run.
Mr. McBurney, I am going.
No, you ain't, Caine.
I was going to say--
One:
You don't believe it's my woman out in that box.
Two:
You noticed we didn't stop to ask permission or turn over the gold.
So that, three:
You don't think it's right for you to come along with me and Anna.
Four:
Your ankle bone hurts.
Five:
You're sick of me.
Right?
I am in apprehension what you will do next.
It is seldom what you say you will do.
Well, I'll remedy that right now.
I'll let you know what I'm going to do next if you try to walk out on me.
I'll blow your head off.
You just try to make a move and see if I don't.
I believe you would.
Know why I'd shoot you, Caine?
Because I need you to be my best man.
I like you, Caine.
Anna and I ain't married, except by common law, see?
She wants to make it legal before we part ways.
So you'll be my best man.
Down the road at the agency, there's a Lutheran reverend that runs a traveling mission church and school.
He'll be my reverend.
And after that, I have to be going.
Sure, you will.
My solemn word.
All things being equal.
Yes, sir.
Well, time we get going.
What is "all things being equal"?
It's a manner of speaking, boy.
As luck would have it.
It's all for the best.
Time will tell.
Yes, sir.
Well.
It's the fortunes of war.
Yeah.
You know, as luck would have it.
I do not understand why we did not land on the southern shore.
Surely I made it clear that this is Kai Tong's home ground.
Yes.
There is a Shaolin temple near us just to the north.
They will give us sanctuary.
They would allow a woman in your temple?
They would make some arrangements in view of your circumstances.
If they were to view my circumstances at the moment they might be more inclined to turn me away and you with me.
No.
Compassion is the first rule of the Shaolin discipline.
I'm sure it was not curiosity.
Am I lacking curiosity?
Unless it is in something even more essential like masculinity.
Oh, I see.
How can you see when you're looking elsewhere?
is it not better to look elsewhere than to fix one's eyes on what one cannot have?
What we cannot have?
Are we talking of the same thing?
We have talked of nothing else.
Well, I was referring to me.
Myself.
So was I.
But we have been talking of many things besides me.
How can you say we have talked of nothing but me?
Forgive my stupidity.
I have been conscious only of you while we talk so it seemed to me we talked only of you.
I had never thought such feelings were even available to me.
And I?
Did you think I was available to you?
You are concubine to the emperor.
And you are cousin to the jackass.
Forgive my stupidity.
Do you not belong to the emperor?
Are you not bound to him?
I am bound to him as a handmaiden...
But I am not his wife.
And I do not owe him the same fidelity as a wife.
I am not a slave, Kwai Chang.
-He does not own me, nor my heart.
-You must take into account my ignorance.
No.
You are not ignorant, Kwai Chang.
I have never seen so marvelous a man so fulfilled in masculinity except for one limitation.
What is that?
You are naive.
Yes.
You know no other women?
My mother.
Kwai Chang, do you love me?
I do not know.
Look at me, please.
As I am bold you must therefore be bold.
Kwai Chang, your eyes are in love.
I am teaching them boldness.
Teach your lips boldness.
Teach them to kiss.
Run.
Hide.
All I'm asking is to be married up with me woman.
I'd think a man of your calling would jump stark-bottom naked into a fiery furnace to do his duty.
You offend me, sir.
You offend Mrs. Stekel and common decency, sir with your foul mouth.
No, sir!
I will not be a party to such a union.
Hush, Amos.
What did you say your name was?
Logan, madam.
I'd swear I've seen you somewhere before, Mr. Logan.
Only that wasn't your name then.
Logan's always been my name.
And furthermore, any man who would carry his woman around in a dreadnought like that, in a nailed-up crate like so much junk--
Anna likes to travel first class.
Onto a Sioux reservation where you've got no legal business being!
Do you realize you could get us all massacred?
I told you, Anna was born Oglala.
Raised here.
Raised up here.
Anna Littlemoon is the only Anna that l--
Wait.
Anna White Eagle!
I told you, I don't know her Sioux name!
Just plain Anna.
Anna McBurney!
That's enough.
McBurney.
Logan McBurney.
You're the man hanged Anna White Eagle for the vigilantes down at Chuckwater Station!
I never hanged nobody.
That's a lie.
You're the same man wouldn't let me give the body a Christian burial.
Had to get those vigilantes to pull you from her body!
Hush, Amos!
He'll kill us both.
A grave robber is what he is, Ethel.
Grave robber.
Opened her grave at Chuckwater Station and had her put in that box!
Bet my last dollar!
You devil!
Come on!
Go get them, Tall Pot.
They're grave robbers!
Take them prisoner.
Ghouls!
Grave robbers!
After them!
They're getting away!
They're getting away!
What did he say?
They're going to capture them and torture them.
Good.
Mr. McBurney it is not true what the reverend and his wife said.
You did not steal your woman, Anna, dead or alive?
Of course I didn't.
-You're daft, Sasquatch.
-l will do what I can to marry you and Anna if you would like me to.
You'll do what?
I am a priest.
You be the medicine man.
No. I am a priest of the Shaolin order.
My temple is in Hunan Province in the southeast of China.
I noticed there was something strange about you the minute I clapped eyes on you.
The way you made them arrows disappear out of the air.
We are trained in the martial arts.
Martial ceremony should come easy to you, then.
"Martial" means:
"With the art of war."
"Marital" is the word for marriage.
Two very similar words that mean different things.
Tell you've never been married.
You hear that, Anna?
We're gonna get hitched in Chinese.
The fourth bandit turned and galloped away.
He ran when he saw what you did to the others.
He will have reached Kai Tong and the others by now.
-Can we not rest here?
-We cannot stay.
We must leave.
Now.
We must.
You are an incredible warrior, dear Kwai Chang.
I have seen hundreds of men fight in exhibitions before the imperial court.
But I have never seen anyone to challenge you.
The closest would be Kai Tong.
He would do well to stay home at The Black Dragon Inn and lock the doors.
But he will not. I understand him now.
You understand his madness?
is not love a kind of madness?
You think he loves me to the point of madness?
To be separated from you by force is enough to drive any man mad.
He will lure me into a fight while his outlaws capture you.
Then you do understand his madness.
So soon?
I have kissed you, Mei Lee.
You have begun to kiss me, Kwai Chang.
You stopped to fight.
Do you mock me, then?
Never.
I invite you to finish what you have begun.
A token, which you must carry.
I beautiful Mei Lee Ho love you.
You are beautiful, Kwai Chang.
I am merely exquisite.
If you are merely exquisite then I shall be forever merely enchanted.
Hear me, Shaolin!
Shaolin, hear me!
I do not wish to kill a priest but I must if you do not leave her at once.
Save her.
Save yourself, Shaolin that we may fight one day to a proper death.
Kai Tong bids you leave her this instant.
Light the arrow.
To the roof!
Let me go to him, or he will kill us both!
No, Mei Lee.
Stay close to me.
Get her!
Bring her to me!
Bring her out!
Kill him!
Shit!
This is the picture of Lieutenant Colonel Khamkon Chankrachang when we found him and this is the picture when he!
was alive.
He is the Staff of the Central government of Chiang Ngan
But he worked for the left side.
He is a very dangerous person for our national security.
And this is the picture of his wife, Lamduan.
She was born in Thailand but moved to Chiang Ngan since childhood.
And this is Second Lieutenant Sak Chatchai
He works for Department of Intelligence.
He will help you.
This is Vietnamese spy named Ngien Ti Chan.
She always contact Khamkon.
But you have to be very careful of this woman.
And this is our staff, he will pick you up when you arrive in Chiang Ngan.
All right.
Wish you have a good luck.
Stop!
This way,sir.
This is Lieutenant Colonel Khamkon Chankrachang's house.
Boss had an order to take you here.
Thanks.
At 12 p.m. I will come to pick you up again,
This is an order from the Boss.
Good luck, sir.
Oh, you are back, Lamduan.
Where have you been?
I went to do something in Bangkok.
, Yeah.
You look thinner what have you done?
I met old friends they took me for drink.
I was drunk for days.
Don't drink too much I am worried about you!
.
What time is it, Lamduan?
Almost noon.
Where are you going?
I have things to do in town.
Would you like to take a car?
What's wrong?
I don't know, the tank is full.
But it was OK just now.
That's OK, I can take taxi.
So, please tell Uncle Tum to come to fix the car.
What do you think about Khamkon's wife?
When will you stop talking?
Do you know the mechanic guy names Tum?
Would you like to question him?
I only want to know if you know him.
So where are we going?
Who knows?
What is the Boss's order?
To take you to meet Mechanic Tum.
There, Mechanic Tum.
How is he?
He likes drinking, fun-loving and little blur.
Where is his house?
In the garage.
All right, thanks.
See you whenever I need you.
Please bring this to the garage owner.
Colonel, where have you been?
I can't start my car, could you come and check it?
OK, wait a second.
What is it, Uncle?
You look like him a lot.
But Khamkon called me Brother Tum not Uncle, Captain.
Uncle, oops, Brother Tum, do you know me?
Of course.
They radioed me that you would be sent here.
After I reported that Lieutenant Colonel get killed by the car.
Was it an accident or a murder?
If they know you are not real Khamkon, here might be another murder.
Brother Tum is coming.
Please invite him for dinner.
Did you have dinner yet?
Not yet.
What's wrong with the car, Brother Tum?
The contact breaker and the distributor are a bit dirty.
I put it back, you can check.
I have checked.
Now, let's eat.
Lamduan told me Colonel went for many days.
When you come back you have changed a lot.
Really?
Yes, you did many weird things.
Oh.
Let's eat Brother Tum.
What did you say?
What make you think I have changed?
This morning you called me Lamduan.
You have never called my first name for many years.
It leads me to a surprise.
Really?
Guys always like that.
Scare of the wife, try to avoid everything.
I used to sneak out to parties.
When I got home, my wife complained till next morning.
Once she yelled on me, I called out my mother in law's name.
You almost got in trouble, please be more careful.
Woman always notice a small things, especially her husband's behavior.
And you don't have a wife.
But I have you to help.
But you have to help yourself.
Lamduan has a doubt so it might take a while!
.
Remember, we will get rid of everyone who stands on our way.
Yes, I'll try.
I didn't sleep well last night.
Yes, I was thinking too much.
What was it about?
My big responsibility.
And I'm afraid that I can't make you happy.
No need to say that.
Whatever happens, I still love you.
I have to go.
Hello.
Colonel, where have you been?
I went drinking in Chiang Rai, the Boss might complain a lot.
He asked for you but said nothing.
If you have wife like Khun Lamduan, you can go to drink.
But I can't go anywhere.
If I want to get drunk, I have to do it at home.
Have you been waiting long?
It's men's duty.
Thai guys are always sweet.
But I am a Chiang Rai's soldier.
But you were born in Thailand.
This is your assignment.
Once finish, report to me immediately, 9.00 p.m.
What about this assignment?
Oh, the one who told you to come to see me.
He didn't tell you anything?
I just want to know if there is any change of plan.
To make sure.
Yeah?
Tonight you have to bring this stuff
To our representative from Thai Freedom Associate
He will wait for you in Lampoon Province.
Between Chiang Ngan and Thailand.
I understood.
I'll go first, for your safety.
Too bad, we should have more time together.
I'll be myself tomorrow night.
Find the way to look inside.
If you find something, take a photo, then put it back.
But you have to finish before 5 p.m. tomorrow.
OK.
Taew, you look beautiful.
Colonel, where are we going?
I will take her to find something to eat.
Come together, Brother Tum.
Yes, come with us, Uncle Tum.
Great, I am hungry.
But are you sure that I won't be the third wheel?
Come on, Uncle Tum.
I can't let my beautiful wife stay at home alone.
May I be excused?
Hey, Been to heaven?
What?
No, I don't dare.
I don't know how to start.
How can it be?
Just do it.
-What?
You aren't here everyday..
-Yes, that's it.
-Who?
-That's Ngien Ti Chan.
Who is that foreigner, do you know him?
Umm, that's guy is a shareholder
He has
Hello, Falun, you are here.
I thought you got lost in Bangkok.
Add, this is Falun I have told you.
I think you misunderstand.
, I am Lieutenant Khamkon Chiang Rai's soldier.
Don't fool me, Khun Falun.
My husband name is not Falun, and he didn't go to Bangkok for a long time.
I can confirm you to, he is Lieutenant Khamkon
This is wrong person, Nucharee, people are so familiar.
This is weird.
Very weird.
No need, Kaew.
Taew I will take Brother Tum home.
Drive carefully.
Almost get caught, next time be more careful.
Because you were there, you solved it
Be careful of the person who might jeopardize to our job.
Yes, I'll try
You are not my husband.
Taew, what's wrong?
Tell me who are you?
Otherwise
I'm Khamkon, your husband.
No, you are not.
Where do you hide my husband?
What are you talking about?
You don't know though my husband is a real man.
But he has nothing like you.
He was injured in a big revolution.
He was shot, and his part was cut.
I don't want to talk about It but have to say that.
Lamduan.
OK.
Since you know I am not Khamkon.
But please listen to me.
You, evil-minded.
You have to promise you will listen to me.
After that you can kill me if you want to.
Where is Khamkon now?
He now rested in peace, no need to struggling any more.
This means..
Yes, that's right.
Who killed him?
He was hit by a run away car.
Nobody saw it.
But I know it's a murder.
Murder?
Who, who murdered him?
This is one reason I have to disguise myself.
I need to find out who murdered Khamkon.
Who are you?
I am his twins, but I lived in Thailand since I was young.
I came here when I learnt he was dead.
I'll want to take a revenge.
You look strange today.
You are more cheerful than yesterday.
What did you do?
When I was just starting, did not go further.
She kicked me out.
Why was that?
Mr. Khamkon did have a thing, he didn't do it for many years.
What?
It's true.
Oh, god.
Then what?
You just said I am very cheerful.
That's right.
What did you do?
I lied.
What did you say?
I said I am his twin.
I came here for revenge.
Make the story more complicated.
She should buy that.
You and he look so much alike.
I think she believes me.
Making it more like a crime is better than to let her know the reason I am here.
Yes, if she knows the truth.
Maybe you have to get rid of her.

Where is the stuff?
Do you have anything for me to bring to Lan Chang Unit?
everything is fine.
Thanks for your help.
How is today?
It's done as planed.
What's next?
1 p.m. tomorrow, please go to Chai's bookstore.
Opposite Nont Market, find the book names Kamasutra.
It's on the top of the shelf on the right hand side.
Your next assignment is in the book.
OK, where are we going now?
To my house.
Please give some money to blind people.
You die
Don't move, take more rest.
What happened?
Who took me here?
You are drunk and had a fight with gangsters.
Don't you remember that?
Luckily that Uncle Tum took you here.
And where is he?
He has left.
Please take some more rest.
What?
You're cheating.
Take more rest.
Who hit my head and who shot him?
It was me.
Chun and I followed you all the time.
From Lan Chang theatre.
Do you know who is that guy?
I knew later that he is South Vietnamese name Vien Tin Din.
Can't help it, just don't think about it.
Who worked for Khamgon for investigation?
That will be Ngieb, a half blood Vietnamese
He often came to see Khamkon.
Then take me to his house.
OK, Chun, take me and Captain to Ngieb's house.
Yes, sir.
Why do you want to see him?
I think the guy who surrounded with enemies like Khamhon
Must have someone to help him.
Otherwise he would die long ago.
So, you think Ngieb know about Ngien Tin din?
I think so, I will get him to speak.
May be we know something.
If he doesn't come to know that you are not real Khamkon.
Here, it's this house.
I will wait for you in the other room.
Colonel, where have you been?
Please come in.
Bonjour.
Where have you been?
How are you?
What about my assignment?
Do you have any money?
Just hit me some.
When you disappeared, he looked for you everywhere
And I followed him.
But I happened to go to jail.
If I see him, what should I do?
Get lost!
You have to report this to me in 2 days.
Do you know if Khamkon ever had some papers or a book which has many numbers and decode inside.
He had never told me about his job.
What about the place he always kept his stuffs.
I don't know.
May I search his room?
Yes, sure.
The book you said is very important?
Maybe we will know who killed Khamkon and why from this book.
I will help you.
Here, I got it.
We appreciated your work.
Your next job is with Liu Han San.

Have you ever heard the name of Soonthorn Chitchuen?
It's you.
How are you?
Is Beijing beautiful?
It's good, but I had no choice.
I had to flee.
But they gave me a very warm welcome.
They might want you to do something in the future.
It could be but I am willing to d!
o that..
What for?
I do for my ideal, one day my ideology will rule the world.
And I will become a leader.
It depends on you, if you can use your authority to get me through all checkpoints.
OK, when will you want to go?
I'm ready.
Whenever.
Can it be tomorrow?
In the evening then, when people are busy feeding themselves.
If it's dark after they finish their dinner, they will go out.
Our journey might not be convenience.
In 1 Km, we will reach the checkpoint.
If we go forward, we will get there
I hope you have a safe journey.
, If I become a leader I will not forget you.
Good luck.
Brother Tum, do you clear all this mess?
Don't worry, they will never know that bad guy got iced
Never for them.
Dream to be a leader, bullshit.
72 28
Oh, it's you.
I don't want to guess.
I am worried about you.
I am not sure of the job I am doing.
whether It will get out of hand or not.
Get back to Thailand Khamkon is dead anyway.
I can't go back, my job is in progress.
I..
I'm afraid that one day you will fail.
We all will die someday, we can't chose the place to die.
Don't think about this, let's go to dance.
Get down, get down.
Hurry.
Give way.
Please don't, it's not our business.
Do you know him?
I saw him at the market but.. but I don't know him'.
Let's get out of here.
Oh, you should not get out this fast.
Ngieb.
I'm just kidding, I have followed you whole day.
That's a bit too much.
Why did you follow me?
To ask for your money.
Get out, get out from my car now.
Calm down I have something to!
tell you.
Just listen, otherwise the police will put me in jail again.
What do you use my name for?
Just take me home l will tell you everything.
Spill out, if you lie I will kick you
So you don't know you have someone followed you?
It was you.
Oh, I didn't want to find you.
I was looking for the mad dog who followed the guy.
Which one?
Where have you been?
Get out.
The one that came struggling on the dance floor
So you are the one who shot him?
Sure.
Who is he?
Where is the money?
Taew, give me 10,OOO.
What?
- l can tell you everything now.
- Speak quickly.
I can't find Sueng, I searched for him everywhere.
I don't want you to think I am joking around.
I was about to tell you but you went out first.
Coincidentally, they followed your car.
What did you do then?
I followed them by taxi.
And they followed you in the club.
He took out his gun, so I shot him death.
It was quite a good shot, I didn't think the bullet would hit him.
Bullshit.
Let's go, Taew.
What' wrong?
You look tired.
I didn't have a good sleep.
Well, you should not have done it often.
But it cannot blame you, Khun Lamduan is very beautiful.
Not like that, she is like someone who is out of reach.
Unbelievable.
Let's talk about something else.
Do you know, I almost got shot last night.
Luckily someone helped me.
At Flamingo Club, right?
How do you know?
If I don't know, I can't be a spy.
Actually I read from newspaper.
Do you know who is he?
A lousy sniper from Macau, Red Chinese people.
Why Red China want to kill me?
I work I work for them.
I don't know.
May be you know too much, it might be dangerous for them.
Who did you walk with yesterday?
Why are you so interested?
She is no way more beautiful than you.
She is half blood her mother is Laotian.
What is her name?
Her name is Kham-Bai.
Why do you want to know?
Nothing, I feel like I have met her before.
Be careful, she works for Red China.
How do you know her?
We studied in Hanoi University, after that we went to study in Beijing.
Wow, you are so much interested in her.
No, I am only interested in you.
But one day we will be parted.
I don't want that day to come.
Me too.
Let's talk about us, I want to know if I will always defeat you.
It could be, if you are not very healthy like before.
Where did you take Khun Falun last night?
Oh, I am not involved in this one.
Don't say that, I told her I had something to do with you.
May I ask you something?
You and Lamduan separate the room or what?
That's my business.
Why are you so concerned about that?
Oh, all right. I am a loner now.
But how can it be?
So you both separate the room.
When will you have a baby?
You are drunk now you'd better go home!
.
Don't kick me out.
Can't you wait for a moment?
There's plenty of time.
Why you are such a hurry?
Please be quiet, me and Lamduan don't go any further.
Who would believe you?
It's true, I am not sleeping with her.
I swear.
To give her a respect before you go to bed?
Her royalty and her sweetness stop me from hurting her.
I am not sure if I can live with her like this forever.
What make you think like that?
The relationship between Khamkon and Red China
Red Vietnamese that we have some information but it's still not enough.
Can you tell me why Red China sent a sniper to kill me,
Although I worked for them?
What about the person who killed Khamkon?
I am not saying because I am frightened.
I just explain to you why I didn't do anything to Lamdaun.
Though I got many chances.
Please think about this she has very soft heart!
.
How could she take it if her second husband will die again?
Not long after her first husband.
I would like to drink for your gentlemanlike.
It's time for me to go home.
I will give you a ride.
Don't forget to take the gun with you.
Right.
Being shot at a few times, better take a gun I always have it with me.
OK, wait for me.
.44 magnum?
Just to make sure, let's go.
I will go to bed early tonight.
What?
If this calls early, if it's late, it would be morning.
What is it?
quiet.
How are you doing?
What about Brother Tum?
I'm here.
Are they all dead?
Only one left, got shot at the shoulder.
I tied him up in the garage.
Who are they?
Who ordered them to kill me?
They said nothing.
The policemen will come here soon, we should ask him first.
-Take him here.
-Yes.
Taew, help me get up, I can't move my legs.
Please pass me the cigarette and gun.
Have you ever seen this gun before?
This is a 44 Magnum, the most powerful shot gun in the world.
In this short distance your brain will spread over the room.
Now tell me who you are.
One more time, I'm serious this time.
Who are you?
Are you Lieutenant Khamkon?
I ask you not you ask me.
Will you tell me who you are?
I am a Thai people who never forget my identity unlike someone.
Who gave you the order to kill me?
It's the Thai people who can't bear to see you betraying the country.
What if I am not Lieutenant Khamkon?
That's bullshit.
Who are you?
Sergeant Major Man Sirichai from Border Police Section 4
Who are you?
One of the Thai who loyal to this country like you.
I was sent to work in the name of Khamkon.
You have made decision too fast.
Why don't you contact the Operation Centre in Bangkok first.
This brought 3 policemen to die.
Captain, someone is coming.
Puen, take him away.
Yes.
Dr. Thongphan is here.
Who is he, Taew?
, Brother Khamkon's close friend I ask him to come over.
Hang on, how well does he know Khamkon?
Very well, he is his close friend.
No, no.
Does he know Khamkon doesn't have
Oh, no.
He has operated Khamkon..
When he was injured.
What should we do?
Calm down, I'll handle it.
Lamduan go to meet him fist.
, All the rest leave it to Chan I will call him.
He will forestall the doctor when he leaves here.
Brother Tum.
Don't think too much, Colonel.
Hey, how are you doing?
Pretty bad.
Let's me see your wound.
Kaew, bring a bowl of hot water.
Help me take off his pants.
How can I take off my paint?
And how can I clean your wound, don't be shy.
We both are male.
Don't be shy.
There is nothing to be shy.
Lucky that the bullet went through, otherwise you have to go to hospital.
It will be healed soon.
Let's do it then.
How is it?
It's finished.
Good bye.
What's wrong with him, Uncle Tum?
He is OK for now but not sure in the future.
The number you try to connect Hello..
Hello..
Are you OK?
Just being bored, I do nothing for almost a month.
Think about it.
You should take a rest so you will recover soon'.
Look, my wound is healed.
But you should take a rest for a while, believe me.
Please.
Do you read this news?
The First Secretary mysteriously disappeared.
Oh, no.
The Operation Department radioed me, they wanted you to follow this urgently and report back in 7 days.
Maybe Ngien Ti Chan knows something about this.
Ngien Ti Chan is gone.
Excuse me.
Have we met?
It's you.
What are you doing here?
Just take a walk around this market think I will be lucky enough to find one beautiful lady.
I want to know who will be more beautiful than Khun Lamduan.
Only Kham-Bai is.
Do you have the car?
Yes, many on the road.
Do you mind if I'll give you a ride?
If you are not afraid to have some argument with your wife,
-l don't mind at all.
-This way, please.
Do you have guests?
You bought lots of many food.
No, this is normal shopping.
Are there many people in your house?
4 including me, when we don't have a guest.
I want you to help me something.
It's not very important but it's important to me.
Why do you think I will help you?
Because you look like a kind person.
I don't know if you are a fortune teller.
Isn't that true?
How can I help you?
This is better I will pick you up for dinner tonight.
Then we go to Club Flamingo, I will tell you there.
I haven't say yes yet.
But I know you will come with me, your eyes are telling me.
The first day I met you, I thought I fell in love with you.
Although you have many girls in your heart?
Can't I just take the woman name Kham-Bai into my heart?
Are all guys the same?
For our love.
For your wife who is waiting for you at home.
Why don't you let me think about the woman
-who sits beside me?
-Just tell me your business.
Did you read the news about the disappearance of a First Secretary?
I think Ngien Ti Chan is involved.
Really?
No, not really.
I am a soldier from the General Bureau.
I have received a support from America.
When their people disappeared, I have received the order to investigate.
I think I can't help you on this matter.
I know you can, if that person is in the hands of North Vietnam like I thought.
Red China would know about this.
You will use Red China people to disclose the secret?
I have no choice.
If I deny?
I'll be disappointed.
If I agree.
What do you want for the reward?
I am sorry if my words hurt you,
Red China always pay me money.
So I use this kind of things with you.
Please forgive me.
If you promise, you don't say something like that again.
Yes, I promise.
I want to ask myself, why did I accept to work against Red China so easily?
For you.
Because you do not devote yourself for them.
Probably right.
But one thing for sure, you asked me.
I came home late last night.
I knew that.
I got job to do.
What kind of job that have a perfume smell?
That's it, a job.
A letter for Colonel.
This is your job.
The perfume is too strong.
I have news of the First Secretary.
I will wait for you at Dong Pa Lan, at 1.OO p.m. sharp, at the guard's bungalow
No. 18, Kham-Bai.
This job is 1000/o safe.
From.. from you.
Please tell me.
It's not in the way you think, but it's not really a waste.
That American was captured by Red China.
Where is he now?
I can't go further, this is a top secret.
Can you tell me if he is in Chaing Rai or was sent out.
Still here, in Wiang San.
Could you tell me again who is in charge of him?
Liu Han San.
Are you sure that American is not locked up in the house
I'm sure.
Are you finished with the questions?
Next question that I want you to help is my heart problem.
I want to go home.
Don't you care for me?
I have been waiting for this moment since the first time we met.
Our heart talks the same language.
Why don't we let things go that way?
I love you, it's a love at first sight.
Oh, where have you been?
What did you do?
You look very tired.
Searching for the news.
So what do you get?
, The American is with Liu Han San but we don't know where?
What should we do?
-Chan.
-Yes.
Park your taxi in front of his house
Wherever he goes, follow him, keep an eyes on him.
And observe the places he goes which one could be the place to lock up people.
Then report me or Brother Tum tomorrow morning.
Do you trust him?
I'd better do it myself.
I want you to go to Thai border get Sergeant Man here.
I will pick up Ngieb.
We need more people to fight against them.
I'm afraid he will be a big mouth.
I guess not, once he shot someone in the back to save me.
Do you set the time for attacking?
Tomorrow night, if Chan is succeeded, you must prepare the weapon.
This is a big war.
Are you going to give me some money?
Do you still have a gun?
Yes.
Why?
Don't ask.
Don't leave the house until I tell you.
You must promise you will give half of money to your mother.
Yes.
If you die, you can't blame on me.
If I die, please take care of my mom.
I followed Liu Han San from his house to the Red China Embassy in Krung San.
He went inside for a long time
When he came back he changed to a new car.
From Mercedes Benz to a brown Moris.
All right, cut the crab and go to the point.
Did you know the place he hides the First Secretary?
Finally, he drove to Dong Pa Lan, when he arrived at Km. 18
He turned into the ice factory.
Why did he go there?
Yes.
It must be the place, it's a good place and it's isolated from everyone.
Any guards?
Just some workers.
But I saw one guard holding a machine gun, but it's not so clear.
A worker with a machine gun?
That means they are well prepared.
What about our weapons?
Are they good enough?
Sergeant Man has 2 M. 16, give one to Ngieb.
Good
I'll use a 44 Magnum.
-What about you and Chan?
-Wait a second.
I have this.
A Rocket?
Because they use machine guns, we must have this.
This can beat one army.
What do you have Chan?
It's this one, it is not as good as a rocket, but it works well.
We have chance to success.
I think we should were uniform.
Because when we pass the checkpoint, we can tell them we are on duty.
I think my authority will be very useful this time.
Good, they take advantage from your authority for a long time this time is our turn to use it.
OK, tonight I will get my uniform at the office.
After that, whatever will be will be.
The worst case is to die.
Follow me.
Kill him.
Brother Kon.
Lamduan, pack the necessary stuffs.
We will go to Bangkok tomorrow.
What happened?
Red China knew that I came to help the First Secretary
Liu Han San saw me.
They will track us and get back at us.
I asked Brother Tum to radio for permission from my boss.
We will know tomorrow.
Yes. I will do it now.
Pang Ruay to Sang.
Don't alert them.
Want some drink?
From the past circumstance,
No. 101 is still not in the bad position that he can't follow our plan, I shall command him to do as plan until further notice but please be more careful.
I still want you to go back to Thailand.
No, if you are here, I will be here.
If you are still here, I will be worried.
Believe him, there is no point for you to stay here.
It will make his position more risky.
I will radio to Bangkok, let them know our situation.
Hopefully they may change the plan.
Then I will go after you, we will live together.
Hurry up, he will come to meet you in the next 2 days, at least.
Do you promise?
Yes.
All right.
What will you do next?
I will go back to work, they will get suspicious if I don't.
Perhaps I will get some news about the ice factory raid.
Good idea, I will send Khun Lamduan back to Thailand.
Are you ok now?
We went to visit you at home but didn't see you
Khun Lamduan said you went outside.
Any job for me to do?
It's in the file.
Lieutenant Colonel Khamkon please report to Central Army at Ta-Siam.
As soon as he comes back to work.
Colonel Suriya , Deputy Chief in Command.
When do you want to go?
I
There is a chopper to Ta-Siam in the evening, I will contact them.
Yes.
Here it is.
Let's go.
, Hello, Khamkon I always want to see you but we have never met each other.
You are here and I stay there.
How could we meet each other?
If I don't radio to you, you wouldn't come, right?
I can't come.
Don't you know I got shot.
If I don't know I can't be the damn deputy.
I also know that you are not real Khamkon.
It's me Colonel Suriya, Khamkon's friend.
He is not.
Who are you?
You know how to shut up.
I know ways to make you speak..
Beat him.
Khamkon.
Kham-Bai, where are we?
This is a camp of the jungle Army for People unit 16.
Unit 16, it's Sam-Kaiw.
This is connected to Thai border.
Yes.
Last thing I could remember is Colonel.
Suriya.
Colonel Suriya works for the Army for People not Central Bureau.
He knows that you are not real Khamkon.
You are caught because of me.
They knew that you helped me.
Don't blame yourself, I am caught because of myself.
Spy should not have love.
Out, come out.
Who are you?
Lieutenant Khamkon Chankrachang, soldier of the Central Bureau of Chaingrai Kingdom.
You lie.
Who are you?
Where are you from?
Who send you as Khamkon?
Lieutenant Khamkon Chankrachang, from Central Bureau..
You probably knew these two people, you have pissed them off.
You ruined their America First Secretary kidnapping plan.
They both got blame very badly.
Tell me who you are.
Lieutenant Khamkon Chankrachang.. ah!
Tell me who you are.
You are misunderstanding.
I am Lieutenant Khamkon.
If you want to get hurt.
Are you going to tell me or not?
I tell you what.
Khamkon got killed by the car.
I hit him.
You look like him so much.
I thought you survived from that incident.
I also sent a sniper to Club Flamingo
But, you are still alive.
I was sure that you are the fake one at the ice factory because the real Khamkon is a coward.
Unlike you.
So, speak up.
Tell me.
Lock him up.
We will question him tomorrow.
He must tell us tonight, I have the way.
Khamkon.
What is going on Kham-Bai?
The camp is attacked by a firearm.
From who?
Right side soldier.
Kwai-Tanu group.
From Thai border, right?
Yes.
How often does it happen?
Almost very day.
But this is noting, the jungle soldiers always know
When they are going to shoot.
They hide in the bunker.
They will go out once it stops.
I have the idea I think we can escape from' this camp.
It's hard.
Too many soldiers around, outside are the mines.
But there are not many guards on this side.
This is the cliff no one will use this way.
Yes, we are.
Ngien Ti Chan knows how to make you speak.
Let's see how do you keep quiet.
I don't want to hurt you, please tell me darling.
What am I supposed to say?
Tell me who you are, where are you from?
When he asks just answer, no one will hurt you.
OK. I know no matter how hard I try you won't say a word.
So
No, no.
, Bustard.
Do it to me don't torture the lady.
Who said it's a torturous, darling?
All right.
Just ask me.
Who are you?
A Chiangrai man who looks like Khamkon.
Are you a Chiangrai man?
Where were you born?
Kok-Krabua.
What is your name?
Somboon.
Why did you disguise as Khamkon?
Because I want to get to his wife.
How much Thai Government have paid you?
What is Thai Government?
Kham-Bai.
What did you tell them?
I lied.
They will find out tomorrow.
I don't care.
They will beat you up again.
No, we will escape tonight.
Do you think we have a chance?
Do you know when will Thai start firing this camp?
Not sure, but it's always in this moment.
Listen carefully, they are hiding behind bunker.
So, there are only guards, which are not too many.
Listen carefully, once the firing starts.
I will demolish these bamboos wall.
It's doesn't look very strong.
Yes.
They will never think that you can escape from their soldiers.
We will go by the cliff, it's quite a risk.
But it's the only way.
If we stay we die.
They kill us for sure.
Although we can escape but I don't know where to go.
If I go home, I'll die.
I will take care of you.
Although I slept around just to complete my assignment
And these soldiers.
Never mind.
Just get out of here, I understand you.
Back row, shoot.
Shoot.
Shoot.
Run.
Shoot.
Keep on going, we must get out of here.
I can't make it.
Keep on going.
Shoot.
Help!
Seize the fire.
You die.
You must die.
Be strong.
Are you OK?
Hold me tight.
I will take you away from them.
Are you going to take care of me?
Once we across Mehkong River, get through Thai border, you will know.
I will marry you, Kham-Bai.
Marry me, you will marry me.
Follow him.
Kham-Bai, we almost get to the river.
Kham-Bai
Where are you?
You can run but you can't hide.
It hurts.
It's hot.
Help!
Bustard.
Why don't you stay in your own country?
Think that other country can give you better.
You will never have chance to come back to Thailand.
And he is a Lieutenant.
Let's go.
...this inditement is only one of a series to be handed down... as result of the respectful rangery investigation.
Grave robbing, in Texas, is this hour top news story... and informant led officers at Marto County sheriff department... to a cemetery, just outside the small Texas community of Newt early this morning.
Officers there discovered what appeared to be a grizzly work of art... the remains of a badly decomposed body, wired to a large monument.
A second body was found in the ditch near... the perimeter of the cemetery, subsequent investigation has revealed... at least a dozen empty crypts.
And it's clear more will turn up as the probe continues.
Deputies report that in some instances, only parts of the corpses have been removed.
The head, or in some cases... the extremities removed, and... the remainder of the corpse left intact.
Evidence indicates... the robberies have occurred over a period of time.
Sheriff Jesús Maldonado refuses to give details... in this case and said only... that he did have a strong evidence linking the crime to... elements outside the state.
Area residents have reportedly... converged on the cemetery claiming the remains of relatives have been removed.
No suspects are in custody, as investigation at the scene... continues.
...mental hospital and released.
A 16-story-building downtown...
Atlanta, collapsed today, killing at least 29 persons.
The engineering firm responsible could offer no explanation for... the collapse although the construction firm say there's... no logical reason for the collapse is suspected sabotage.
Police in Gary, Indiana, have been unable to identify the... bodies of a young man... and four children who had their features carved away, the man's dimples had been removed.
Police first identified the victims as 2 women... continuing the program of the government to overwhelm reaches... beyond the Amazon today are ruptured into violence...
Forces of at least three South America governments already have been involved this territory it tells it's sketchy and yet none of... the governments is involved as its knowledge to a war.
...Police in Dallas arrested a young couple today... complaints by neighbors led them to discover a 18-month-old daughter the couple... chained in the attic of a dilapidated house...
Franklin!
Are you ok?
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take...
- much more of this.
- The condition of retro gradation... is contrary or inharmonious to the regular direction of actual... movement in the zodiac, and is, in that respect, evil.
Hint:
When malefic planets are in retrograde, and Saturn is malefic... their maleficies are increased.
Have you been doing that Reader's Digest worth our...
Jerry, it just means Saturn's a bad influence.
It's just particularly... bad influence now, because it's in retrograde.
Hey, man, do you believe all that stuff your old lady is talking me?
My granddaddy is buried here.
Can we find out if anything happened?
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- See that big heavy fella... standing with that big flashlight, isn't that the sheriff?
You go tell him your granddaddy is buried in there.
He'll let you in.
Ok.
Thank you.
Hey, fella, I'm gonna run off to...
- meet him if you don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.
- Hey, folks.
Let us go see where... her granddaddy's buried.
Things happen here about they don't tell about.
I see things.
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
You laugh at an old man... this thing that laughs knows better.
Yes, they're sure.
The man said the Tallman's grave had been dug up.
Mama, don't worry.
I saw it myself!
It didn't look dug up to me.
What's that?
What smell?
What is that stench?
Hey.
That's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used... to sell his cattle!
We got an uncle that works in one of those places... outside of Fortworth.
See those buildings there?
That's where... they kill him.
They bash'em in the head with a big sledgehammer!
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill him.
It'd start squealing and freaking out, they'd have to... come up and bash'em 2 or 3 times.
They'd scatter them before they were even dead.
That's horrible!
People shouldn't kill animals for food.
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they get this big air gun... that shoots a bullet into the skull and then retracts it.
Franklin, I like me, please change the subject.
That smell's still going on.
Oh, man!
It's hot in here.
- Hitchhiker!
- Should we take him up?
Yeah man, pick him up.
He'll asphyxiate out there!
- What does he look like?
- The son of a bitch 's gonna...
- smell like the slaughterhouse.
- Give the guy a break.
He can...
- sit by Franklin.
- What do you wanna do?
- He's weird looking, no.
- I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where're you heading, man?
- You work at that place?
- Don't.
- How did you get stuck out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- I got an uncle that works...
- at a slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.
My grandfather, too.
My family's always been in beef.
The whole family are cracked.
Hey man, did you go into that... slaughter room or whatever they call it?
Where they shoot the cattle with that air gun thing?
- That gun is no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.
With the sledge!
That was better.
- They died better that way.
- How come?
I thought the gun...
- was better.
- Oh no.
With the new way...
- people were put out of jobs.
- You do that?
- Look!
- I was the killer!
- Let me see them.
- They don't seem to head your way.
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah!
- Franklin.
- Let me see.
- They make hitches...
They take the head and they boil, except for the tongue, and scrape... all the flesh away from the bone.
They use everything, they throw nothing away.
They use jaws, muscles, and the eyes, and the ligaments...
- and everything!
- Look at this.
- They boil the nose and the gums down to a big jelly of fat.
I don't know it was in that stuff.
It's really good.
Do you like it?
- Yeah, I like it.
It's good!
- It sounds horrible.
Can't we...
- talk about something else?
- You'd probably like it if you... didn't know what was in it.
I wouldn't and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
Take it before everybody's sick.
What are you doing?
Look.
I think that might hurt.
Oh, come on!
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh, what are you doing?
Nice, man!
I have this knife.
Put that away, too.
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.
Put it back.
You took my picture!
You can take me to my house.
I live right off this road.
I don't know, man.
We're in much of a hurry.
- How close is it?
- It's real close.
Couldn't you just walk?
I mean...
If it's so close.
You could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese.
My brother...
- makes it real good.
You'll like it.
- I think we'd better push on, man.
Don't we, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry...
- It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.
- You can pay me now.
- Huh?
- 2 dollars.
It's a good picture.
- No, man.
Franklin... give him back that picture.
I'm about to freak.
Call a cop.
That's the last damn hitchhiker I ever take.
- Listen to Franklin's horoscope:
- I'm sorry.
Travel in the countryside.
Long range plans, upsetting persons... around you, could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
The events in the world are not doing much, to cheer one up.
- That's just perfect!
- Franklin, I think you'll be alright.
Hey, Kat, read Alex's.
He's Capricorn.
Oh, no.
Capricorn is ruled by Saturn.
There are moments where we... cannot believe that what's happening is really true... pinch yourself and you may find out that it is.
Hurry up.
Here comes somebody.
How are you?
Would you fill her up, please?
I got no gas.
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.
Transport won't... be here until this afternoon.
Maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
Hey, you know where "The Old Franklin Place" is?
- "The Old Franklin Place"?
- It's an old 2-story house and... it's sitting up on the hill.
I think you have to turn on the road... back there, but I'm not real sure.
Maybe I've seen something like that up there.
But look, you boys... don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Those things are dangerous, you're bound to get hurt!
- We'll be careful.
- Don't wanna go fooling around... other folk's property.
Some folks don't like it.
They don't mind showing you.
- My father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?
- Yeah.
- Look...
I got barbecue here.
Why don't you stay a while?
The transport will be by in a little while...
I can go and get some barbecue.
Them girls, they don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Best you stick around here.
We should've asked him if there's another gas station around here.
Don't you think he would have told us if there was?
- It wouldn't hurt to ask.
- I'll go ask.
What the hell, we should have stopped back there for gas.
Go, damn it.
There.
You think this place has room service?
Franklin, you're cutting the van!
Yeah, I just started doing that.
I bet this is some of that guy's blood.
Look at that.
- Think it's his blood?
- I guess so.
That's blood, alright.
And I got cut the hell out of him, chef.
You think you could do that to yourself?
Crazy?
It takes something, though, I mean, do that to yourself, like he did.
You think I said something that made him mad?
- What?
- Franklin, you're crazy as he was.
Hey, I got us some barbecue.
Newt's the closest place to get gas.
We're going to that Granpa's place.
There's a creek, you can go swimming.
Come on, Sally, we're going to that Granpa's place!
- Let's go.
- Hey, that guy smeared blood...
- all over the van.
- Let's not waste time to wipe this up.
What?
What did you do?
You're in someone's van?
Let me see your knife.
Thank you.
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that service... station, you're towing us back in that chair.
Hey...
You think that guy was just trying to scare us by blowing out... my picture like that?
Oh, look, they let the place fall apart.
Put it over there.
- Wanna go over there?
- Let's go.
Oh, Kirk, come on!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I want to see the smear the guy made.
This is weird.
I wonder if that means something.
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's gonna get you.
- Why don't you wash it off, ok?
- I want to see inside.
- Jerry!
- Ok!
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- Get it.
You wash it up.
- You don't think that guy...
- is trying to follow us, do you?
- What for?
Where's my knife?
Kirk?
Looks like it must have been a nursery room.
This was my room.
I got to stay here until I was 8 years old.
- Until my grandmother died.
- What happened?
- To my grandmother?
- Yeah, she died.
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- I think it's seen better days...
These animals would to put me to sleep when I was a little girl.
Look at the zebra.
I had this fascination for the zebras...
Kate?
Sally!
Come on, Franklin!
It's gonna be a fun trip.
If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'll take it!
- Hey, Franklin!
- What's wrong?
Didn't you say there was a swimming well out here?
Pam and I would like to go swimming in there.
There used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
Come on.
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- We'll see them in an hour or so.
Yeah.
See them down in about an hour or so.
Sally!
Sally...
Seed growing in the world...
I don't want to miss it.
Man, a scorpion, there's a scorpion!
Crap!
This must be it!
Are you ok?
What the hell, Franklin would never get down here anyway.
I bet he must have when he was little.
Franklin never was little.
Gasoline.
I can leave my guitar, you know, I'd give him a couple of bucks...
We gotta come back by here anyway, I can pick up my guitar and... give him a couple more dollars and we get more gas...
He won't want your guitar, he's not gonna sell us some gas... let's just go back now.
Hey, come here!
Come here, look at this.
- A generator!
- What?
A generator!
For electricity!
Hey, hello!
Is there anybody in the house?
Hello!
Is anybody home?
I got something for you.
Let's go!
Hello?
Hello?
- Come look at this!
- Let's go!
Hello!
Anybody home?
Hello?
Hey, Pam!
Hello!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk?
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
He's coming to get you!
You don't think it means anything?
We'll protect you if he tries to get you.
- Maybe it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- You worry too much.
He couldn't find us, anyway.
He doesn't even know our names.
I gave him your name, Franklin.
And I told him where you lived.
I even gave him your ZIP code.
He's gonna kill you.
Jerry...
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife, remember?
When did you have it last?
I didn't have it last.
You had it last.
I gave it to you, remember?
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?
No, I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right.
I'll look for it.
Listen, I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
How do I get there, Frank?
Well, there's a trail down there.
Between the two old sheds.
- Can I go too?
- I think you'd better stay here.
All right.
I can't find it.
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.
You really are mad, huh?
I don't blame you.
Kirk!
You really didn't want me to come, did you?
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.
Did you believe all that stuff Pam was telling about?
Saturn, and retrograde, and all that?
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.
You don't think that guy is trying to follow us, do you?
I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
He'd probably find Kirk and kill him.
- Sally...
- What now?
Nothing.
Never mind.
Kirk!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Damn.
Kirk!
Are you guys in there?
Hey, guys!
Quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.
Pam, is that you?
Okay, you guys!
Come on out.
Come on!
Kirk?
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.
If they 're not back in a minute, we'd better go look for them
What if we get lost, too?
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Hey!
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
Sally...
I think we ought to go.
Are the keys in the van?
Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
What for?
Let me see the flashlight.
I'm gonna go look for them.
You don't have to go.
Sally, no, I don't think that's a good idea, Sally.
I don't think you ought to go.
Look, I'm gonna honk the horn one more time.
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No, I'm gonna honk the horn... and we will wait a minute, and they will come and we will go.
All right?
Sally, they took the keys!
We don't have any keys!
They took the keys!
Stop it!
Stop it!
- Now give me the flashlight!
- No, Sally!
You can't go!
What if they came back and we weren't here?
- Franklin, give me that flashlight!
- I'll keep the flashlight!
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right!
All right!
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you, all right?
I'll go with you, but I'll keep the flashlight.
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.
I can't push you down the hill!
Sally...
- Look, I'll go with you...
- Never mind, I'll go without it.
All right.
Sally, wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.
Sally!
Hold on a minute now.
All right, let's go.
Let's go, I'll go with you.
Sally, I can't keep up with you!
Sally!
Sally, wait a minute!
Hold on!
Jerry!
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
I thought I heard something.
There's a light!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- It looks like a house.
- Come on, push!
- It's a house!
- I can't see it very well.
- Franklin, this is impossible.
- Come on, Sally!
Get back and push, damn!
Impossible!
I heard something over there!
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!
Sally, I hear something.
Stop!
Stop!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help me, please!
- Help!
Help!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Help me!
Help me!
- Come over here!
You're all right, girl.
Okay?
Hold on, take it easy, all right?
He killed...
- Take it easy...
- He killed Franklin...
Call the police!
Jerry!
I don't know what happened to the others...
There's nobody out there now!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
What happened?
- Call the police...
- There's no phone here.
We have to drive to the sheriff's.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
I'll get the truck.
- Take it easy.
Take it easy.
- Don't go!
Don't go!

Acting on a typical day with some news... the word is that the sheriff's office began an investigation... early this morning in the County Cemetery.
Opening crypts and muslins where there was evidence of... tampering, The Sheriff found a reported dozen coffins were... robbed a part of its contents.
According to the sheriff, Rhesus...
Maldonado, there are ones from which only the head and... extremities are removed, and others and others from which only a hand or foot removed, with the... remainder of the cadaver left intact.
Maldonado linked...
What are you doing?
- You will come with me...
- No!
- What do you want?
- There's no need to do that...
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I had to lock up and get the lights off.
Because electricity is enough to drive a man out of business.
I hope you're not too uncomfortable down there.
You got nothing to worry about.
Just take it easy.
We're gonna get there soon.
No, no, no.
There's no need to do that.
We always do our best.
Hang on.
No.
Half witch.
You little shit!
You knock-head idiot!
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.
You damn fool!
You almost got caught.
No!
They didn't see me.
They don't know nothing!
I told you to stay away from that graveyard.
I told you...
I told you never to leave your brother alone!
Get that girl out of the car!
Get her out!
I hope your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.
Look at what your brother did to that door!
You let her go!
You goddamn idiot!
I thought you were in a hurry.
Where are the kids?
Where are the children?
Did they get away?
Are you sure?
You...
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!
Hey, come here!
Look!
See how nice she looks!
Get upstairs and get your grandpa!
Take it easy there, huh?
You'll stay here for a few minutes.
Get back in there!
To the chamber!
You just take it easy.
We'll have something to eat right away.
Hey, you two!
Give me a hand with grandpa!
Look, grandpa!
Look!
Knock it off!
Quiet!
You act like a pack of hounds.
- We're just having fun!
- You think this is a party?
Please!
You can make them stop!
- No shit?
- Shut your mouth!
Can't be helped, young lady.
Please!
You can't let them kill me!
He likes this face.
He's crazy!
You gotta make him stop!
Please...
- He's just a cook!
- Shut up, you bitch hog!
He always does all the work.
He don't like it.
Is that right?
You're just a cook!
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand nothing.
I understand you ain't nothing!
We do all the work!
I just can take no pleasure in killing.
It's just something we gotta do.
It don't mean you have to like it.
Please...
Please...
I'll do anything you want.
You don't need to torture the girl.
Please, shut up.
Remember you're just a cook.
Let me and him handle this.
I won't have this.
We ain't in no hurry.
And you ain't going no place.
You don't hear me?
I heard you told me much.
No sense in waiting.
I gotta go to my room.
I'll take her to grandpa.
Grandpa'll have some fun.
You always said he was the best.
He's the best all right.
Let's let him half leg.
Grandpa, we're gonna let you... have this one!
Have this one!
He won't use you much.
He won't hurt none.
Our grandpa was the best killer there ever was.
I never took all the guts to see.
I did in 6 in 5 minutes once.
I could've done more if the hook pulled again could've gotten the... beaves out of the way faster.
Now don't you cry.
Grandpa is the best.
It won't hurt a bit.
No!
No!
Please!
Don't!
Hit her!
Hit the bitch!
Go ahead!
Give me the hammer!
Give me the hammer!
I'll kill her!
Go!
Go!
(radio announcer) It is believed that the indictment is only one of a series to be handed down as the result of a special grand jury investigation.
Graverobbing in Texas is this hour's top news story.
An informant led officers of the Muerto County Sheriff's Department to a cemetery just outside the small rural Texas community of Newt early this morning.
Officers there discovered what appeared to be a grisly work of art, the remains of a badly decomposed body wired to a large monument.
A second body was found in a ditch near the perimeter of the cemetery.
Subsequent investigation has revealed at least a dozen empty crypts, and it's feared more will turn up as the probe continues.
Deputies report that in some instances, only parts of a corpse had been removed, the head or in some cases the extremities removed, the remainder of the corpse left intact.
Evidence indicates the robberies have occurred over a period of time.

Area residents have reportedly converged on the cemetery, fearing the remains of relatives have been removed.
No suspects are in custody, as the investigation at the scene continues.

Police in Gary, Indiana, have been unable to identify the bodies of a young man and woman... (continues indistinct)
...stab wounds and their features carved away.
The man's genitals had been removed, and police first identified the victims as two women.
(news report continues low)
OK?
(screams)
Franklin!
Ah!
- Are you OK?
- I was...
Shit.
OK.
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take much more.
Listen, the condition of retrogradation is contrary or inharmonious to the regular direction of actual movement in the zodiac and is, in that respect, evil.
Hence, when malefic planets are in retrograde - and Saturn's malefic, OK?
- their maleficence is increased.
Have you been doing those word power columns?
It just means that Saturn's a bad influence.
It's just particularly a bad influence now because it's in retrograde.
- You believe that stuff she's hawking me?
- I don't know.
My granddaddy's buried here.
Did anything happen to him?
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- That big feller at the stand with that flashlight in his hand, that's the sheriff.
You tell him your granddaddy's buried in there.
- He'll let you in.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna run off with your girl a minute.
Honey, I'll get you the sheriff.
Let us through.
This girl's granddaddy's buried here.
Been in there the whole time, unbeknownst to Clyde.
Clyde didn't know, either.
They didn't know why...
Things happen hereabout they don't tell about.
I see things.
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
You laugh at an old man.
There's them that laughs and knows better.
(Sally) They're sure.
The man said they could tell if the grave had been dug up.
Franklin, don't worry.
I saw it myself.
It didn't look dug up to me.
- (Sally) Oh, what's that?
- What smells?
What is that stench?
Roll up the window.
Hey, that's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used to sell his cattle.
We got an uncle that works at one of those places outside of Ft.
Worth.
That's where they kill them.
They bash them in the head with a sledgehammer.
- (Pam) That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill 'em on the first lick.
They'd start squealing and freaking out, and they'd have to bash 'em three times.
They'd skin them sometimes before they were even dead.
(Pam) That's horrible.
People shouldn't kill animals for food.
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they got this big gun that shoots a bolt into their skull, then retracts it.
It's just boom!
It goes boom!
And boom!
Franklin, I like meat.
Please change the subject.
- Boom!
- That's terrible.
It's still going on.
Oh, man, it's hot in here.
- Hitchhiker.
- Should we pick him up?
- Yeah.
He'll asphyxiate out there.
- What does he look like?
Son of a bitch is gonna smell like a slaughterhouse.
Oh, give the guy a break.
He can sit by Franklin.
- What do you want to do?
- He's weird-looking.
- Pick him up, man.
- No!
Well, I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where you headed, man?
- South.
You work at that place?
Oh, no.
- How did you get stuck way out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- My uncle works for the slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.
My-my grandfather too.
My family's always been in meat.
A whole family of Draculas.
Hey, man, did you go in that slaughter room?
Where they shoot the cattle with that big air gun?
- Oh, that-that-that gun's no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.
The old way with a sledge.
See, that was better.
They died better that way.
How come?
I thought the gun was better.
Oh, no, no.
With the new way, the people are put out of jobs.
You do that?
Look.
- I was the killer. (laughs)
- Damn.
- (Sally) Let me see them.
- They don't send the heads away.
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah.
Franklin.
See, they make head cheese.
They... they take the head, and they boil it, except for the tongue, and they scrape all the flesh away from the bone.
They use everything.
They don't throw nothing way.
They use the jowls and the muscles and the eyes and ligaments and everything.
- Oh.
- Look at this.
The nose and the gums and all the flesh, and they boil it down into a big jelly of fat.
Wow.
I didn't know that's what was in that stuff.
It's really good.
You like it?
Oh, yeah, sure, I like it.
It's good.
It sounds horrible.
Could we talk about something else?
You'd like it if you didn't know what was in it.
I wouldn't, and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
Oh.
Come on, you're making everybody sick.
Oh, all right.
(chuckles)
(Sally) What are you doing?
Hey, man, put that knife up.
(laughs)
(Sally gasps) Oh!
(Kirk) Oh, come on.
(Sally) Oh!
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh, my God!
Why are you doing that?
(laughing)
Put that away.
(♪ "Fool for a Blonde" plays on radio)
I have this knife.
Put that away, too.
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.
Fold it up.
(chuckles)
Hey, you took my picture.
Hey, you-you could take me to my house.
I live right off this road.
Well, I don't know, man.
We're in pretty much of a hurry.
- How close is it?
- It's real close.
Well, couldn't you just walk?
I mean, if it's so close.
Yeah, you could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese?
My brother makes it real good.
You'll like it.
I think you better push on now.
Don't you, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
(laughs)
It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.
You can pay me now.
- Huh?
Two dollars.
It's a good picture.
No, man.
Franklin, give him back the damn picture.
- He tried to sell him that picture.
- You're kidding?
No, I'm serious.
(screaming)
What are you doing?
(all yelling)
(Kirk) Hey, Jerry, pull us over!
(Franklin) Hey, man, what's up?
What are you doing?
(screaming)
Get out.
(cries)
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm about half ready to call a cop.
That's the last goddamn hitchhiker I ever pick up.
(Pam) Hey, listen to Franklin's horoscope.
Oh, Sally.
"Travel in the country, long-range plans
"and upsetting persons around you
"could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
The events in the world are not doing much either to cheer one up."
- That's just perfect.
- Franklin, I think that will be all right.
And now read Sally's.
She's a Capricorn.
Oh, no.
Capricorn's ruled by Saturn.
"There are moments when we cannot believe that what is happening is true.
Pinch yourself and you may find out that it is."
(♪ country music playing on radio)
Everybody out.
Hurry up, so we can get home.
Here comes somebody.
How are you?
Would you fill her up, please?
I got no gas.
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.
The transport won't be here until late this afternoon, maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
(Franklin) Hey, do you know where the old Franklin place is?
- The old Franklin place?
- Yeah.
It's an old two-story rock house on a hill.
I think you have to turn on that road back there, but I'm not real sure.
Yeah, maybe I seen something like that up that way.
Well, now look, you boys don't want to go messing around no old house.
Those things is dangerous.
You're liable to get hurt.
We'll be careful.
You don't want to go fooling around with other folks' property.
Some folks don't like it, and they don't mind showing you.
- Oh, my father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?
Yeah.
Look, I got some good barbeque here.
Why don't you fellas stick around here a while?
That transport will be by in a little while.
(Jerry) Well, you want to get some barbeque?
Them girls, now, they don't want to go messing around an old house.
It's best you stick around here.
We should've asked if there's another gas station around.
Don't you think he would've told us if there was?
Man, it wouldn't hurt to ask, you know?
OK, I'll go ask.
I knew the hell we should've stopped back there for gas.
- Press it.
- I'm pulling it down.
- There.
- You think this place has room service?
Franklin, you maniac, you're tearing up the van.
Um, yeah, I just started doing that.
Hey, I bet that's some of that guy's blood.
Look at that.
Look at that.
- You think that's blood?
- Yeah, I guess so.
Oh, that's blood, all right.
And that guy cut the hell out of himself.
You think you could do that to yourself?
- I'm not crazy.
- Yeah, yeah.
It takes something, though, I mean just to do that to yourself like he did.
God!
Hey, you think I said something made him mad?
(laughs)
- Well, what?
- Franklin, you're crazier than he was.
Hey, I got us some barbeque.
- Newt's the closest place to get gas.
- (Sally) Aw.
Aren't we going out to Grandpa's place?
There's a creek.
You could go swimming.
(Jerry) Let's go.
Come on, Sally.
We're going to Grandpa's place.
Let's go!
(Sally) Hey, that guy smeared blood all over the van.
- Like he was trying to write something.
- (Franklin) What'd he do?
Did he write something on the van?
Let me see your knife.
Thank you.
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that station, you're towing us back in your chair.
(Sally laughs)
Hey, you think that guy's just trying to scare us by, you know, blowing up my picture like that?
(Sally) Oh, I wish they hadn't let the place fall apart.
(Kirk) It looks like the birth place of Bela Lugosi.
- (Sally) I'm scared.
- I'll help you with that.
- See that window over there?
- That's strange.
(Franklin) Hey, watch my arms.
Watch out.
- Be straight.
Come on.
Hey.
- I'll get you from here.
(Franklin) I want to see that smear that guy made.
- Oh, man.
- Weird.
I wonder if that means something.
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's going to get you.
- Come on.
- Why don't you wash it off?
I want to show you the inside.
- Jerry!
- OK.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Come on, Kirk.
- Here, man, you wash it off.
You don't think that guy would try and follow us?
What for?
Where's my knife?
Kirk?
(Sally laughs)
It looks like it must've been a nursery.
This is my room.
I got to stay here one time when I was eight years old.
- Right after my grandmother died.
- What happened?
- What happened to my grandmother?
- Yeah.
She died.
(girls laughing)
(skittering sound)
(talking and laughing)
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- It's seen better days.
These animals used to talk me to sleep when I was little.
Look at the zebras.
I had these fascination for the zebras.
Sally!
(grunting)
Sally!
(laughing)
Hee-hee-hee-hee, hee-hee-hee-hee.
Hee-hee-hee-hee.
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.
(mimicking) Come on, Franklin.
It's gonna be a fun trip.
If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'm going to be able to take it.
Aah!
Ah!
(sobs)
(raspberries)
(laughing)
- Hey, Franklin.
- Hey, Franklin.
What's wrong?
You said there was a swimming hole around here?
Yeah.
Well, Pam and I would like to go swimming, man.
Uh, there used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
Come on, we'll find it.
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- (Kirk) No.
We'll see you in an hour or so.
Yeah.
We'll see you in about an hour or so.
(rattling sound)
Sally?
Sally!
Zero in the world.
Just shoot him and put us out of our misery.
- Snakes and spiders!
- Stop it!
And scorpions!
Man-eating lizards.
- Kirk, help.
Kirk!
- Ow.
Ow.
Oh.
Crap.
This must be it.
Oh, are you OK?
How the hell did Franklin ever get down here, anyway?
Somebody must've carried him when he was little.
Franklin never was little.
(motor sound)
Gasoline.
I can leave him my guitar, give him a couple bucks.
We're coming back anyway.
I can pick up my guitar, give him a couple more dollars and bring him some gas.
They don't want your guitar.
They won't want to sell us gas.
Let's just go back now.
Hey, come here.
Come here and look at this.
- A generator.
- What?
A generator!
For electricity.
Hey, hello in there!
Is anybody here?
(knocking on door)
Hello, is anybody home?
I got something for you.
Ah!
Ooh!
Let's go!
Hello?
- Hey, Pam, come look at this.
- What?
No!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Hello?
(knocking)
(sound of pig squealing)
Hey, Pam.
(sound of pig squealing)
Hello?
Kirk?
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk.
(rustling)
Kirk?
(rustling)
Kirk?
(chicken clucking)
(coughs and retches)
Oh!
Oh, God!
(cries)
Kirk!
Kirk!
(man screaming)
(Pam screaming)
(chainsaw motor whirs)
(screaming)
(Jerry) He's gonna get you, Franklin.
- You don't think it means anything?
- (Sally) We'll protect you.
- I'll bet it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
- It probably doesn't mean anything, huh?
- You worry too much.
He couldn't find us anyway.
I mean, he doesn't even know our names.
I gave him your name.
I told him where you live.
I even gave him your zip code.
He's gonna kill you.
Jerry.
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife.
When did you have it last?
Well, I didn't have it last.
You had it last.
I gave it to you.
Remember?
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?
No.
I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right, I'll look for it.
I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
How do I get there?
Well, there's a trail down there between them two old sheds.
- Can I go, too?
- I think you'd better stay here.
All right.
I can't find it.
Are you mad at me?
No, I'm not mad at you.
You really are mad, huh?
Oh, I don't blame you.
I'm...
Kirk!
You really didn't want me to come, did you?
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.
Sally, did you believe in all that stuff that Pam was telling about Saturn and retrograde and all that?
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.
Yeah.
You don't think that guy would try and follow us, do you?
Well, I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
He's probably afraid Kirk will kill him.
Sally?
What now?
Nothing.
Never mind.
Kirk!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Damn.
(chicken clucks)
Kirk?
- Are you guys in there?
- (person chuckles)
Hey, guys, quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.
(person laughing)
Pam, is that you?
(person laughing)
OK, you guys.
Come on out.
Come on!
(knocking)
Kirk?
(knocking)
- (man yells) - (Jerry screams)
(yelling)
(chicken clucking)
(honking)
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.
If they're not back in a minute, we've got to go look for them.
Well, what if we get lost, too?
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
(Sally) Jerry!
Jerry!
(Franklin) Jerry!
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
Hey!
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
Sally?
I think we ought to go.
(Sally sighs)
Are the keys in the van?
- Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
- What for?
Let me see the flashlight.
I'll go look for them.
You don't have to go.
Sally, don't go.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I don't think you ought to go.
I'm going to honk the horn one more time.
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No.
Now, I'm gonna honk the horn, and we're gonna wait a minute, and then if they don't come, we'll go.
All right?
Sally, they took the keys.
We don't have any keys.
- They took the keys with them.
- (honking)
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Franklin!
- Jerry took the keys with him!
- Give me that flashlight!
No, Sally, we can't go!
Look, what if they came back and we weren't here?
- Give me that flashlight!
- No, I've got to take the flashlight.
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right, all right, I'll go with you.
No, Sally.
Come on, I'll go with you, but I'm gonna keep the flashlight.
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.
I can't push you down that hill!
Sally, look, I know.
Oh!
- I'll go with you, but I'm going to hold...
- Never mind, I'll just go without it.
All right, all right.
Sally, wait!
Sally, wait a minute!
I'm coming with you.
Sally?
Hold up a minute now.
All right, let's go.
Let's go.
I'll go with you.
Sally, I can't keep up with you.
Sally?
Sally, wait a minute.
(Franklin whimpers)
Hold up.
(Franklin) Jerry!
(Sally) Jerry!
Jerry!
(both) Jerry!
(Franklin) Wait.
- I thought I heard something.
- There's a light.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
(Sally) Oh, it looks like a house.
Well, come on, push.
Come on, push.
Push down.
There. (grunts)
- (Sally) It's a house.
- Yeah?
I can't see it very well.
Oh, Franklin, this is impossible.
Come on, Sally.
Get back and push down.
This is impossible.
I hear something out there.
Look.
- (Franklin) Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!
(Franklin) Jerry!
Sally, I hear something.
Stop.
Stop.
(sound of chainsaw)
(screaming)
Somebody, please!
Help!
Help me, please!
Somebody, help me!
(screaming)
Help!
Please!
Please!
Please help me!
Please!
(screams)
(screaming)
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help me!
Help me!
Oh, God!
Help, help!
Close the door.
Help me.
Whoa, there, whoa, whoa.
- Come over here.
- Somebody's trying to kill me.
Help, help...
Calm down.
You're all right, you're OK.
- Oh, now, take it easy.
- Call the police.
- He might come.
- Now, what happened?
- He... he... he killed...
- Now, now, take it easy.
He killed Franklin.
I don't know.
Call the police!
- Take it easy.
- And Jerry.
I...
I don't-I don't know what happened to the others.
There's nobody out there now.
Come on.
Come on now, take it easy.
Come on, take it easy.
- Oh, please.
- What happened?
Please.
Call the police.
There's no phone here.
We... we have to drive over to Childress.
Yeah, yeah.
Now, you take it easy.
Take it easy now.
I'll get the truck.
- Now, now, take it easy.
Take it easy.
- Don't go.
Take it easy.
(radio announcer) Weather is expected to be warm to partly cloudy tomorrow with no chance of precipitation.
The high today will be in the upper 90s and a low tonight of 81 degrees.
Current temperature is 96 with winds out the southeast at three miles a hour.
Humidity 98, barometer is at 29.9 and rising.
Acting on a tip, the Muerto County sheriff's office began an investigation early this morning in the Muerto County Cemetery opening crypts where there was evidence of tampering.
The sheriff's deputies found a reported dozen coffins robbed of their contents.
According to the sheriff, there were cadavers in which the heads and extremities were removed, and others in which only a hand or foot had been removed.
Maldonado has information linking the robberies to a large and well-organized West Coast jewel theft ring but declined to suggest any reason for them to mutilate the cadavers.
(news report continues indistinct)
(Sally crying and gasping)
- What are you doing?
- You ain't got no need to worry.
No!
You just cooperate, young lady, and we'll have no trouble.
- Now, listen...
- What do you want?
Now, there's no need to do that.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
No!
(screaming)
(man laughs)
No!
No!
No!
(screams)
(stops screaming)
(Sally groans)
(starts engine)
(turns off engine)
(chuckles)
Had to lock up and get the lights.
Cost of electricity is enough to drive a man out of business.
(starts engine)
(Sally whimpers)
(muffled crying)
(muffled screaming)
Uh, I hope you're not too uncomfortable down there.
(muffled screaming)
You got nothing to worry about.
You just take it easy, and we'll be there soon.
(laughs)
(muffled crying)
Now, now, now, now.
There's no need to do that, no.
(Sally whimpering)
(laughing)
We'll be over this in a bit.
Hang on.
Halfwits.
Little coon shits.
- Come here, you nap-haired idiot!
- (grunts)
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.
You damn fool, you almost got caught over at Duke's.
No, no, they didn't see me.
They don't know nothing.
I told you to stay away from that graveyard!
(starts engine)
I told you and I told you,
I told you never to leave your brother alone, you...
Get in there and get that girl out of the car.
Come on, get her out of the car.
- Get her out of there.
- (Sally screaming)
Hopefully your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.
Get her in there.
We'll have the whole county out here.
Don't you got any self-respect?
Look what your brother did to the door!
He's got no pride in his home?
Get her in there.
You've been a fool, you!
You better get them other kids.
Where are they, huh?
(screaming)
You're a damn fool, you.
- (screaming) - (laughing)
Oh!
I thought you was in a hurry.
Where are the kids?
Where are they?
Show me!
(Leatherface explaining)
- None of 'em get away?
- Uh-uh-uh.
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.
You...
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!
(screaming)
Hey, you did good.
She's a nice girl.
You nitwit, get upstairs and get your grandpa.
Now, now, young lady, you just take it easy there now.
Look, we'll fix you some supper in a few minutes.
Huh?
Get back in there!
Get in there!
Now, you just take it easy.
Take it easy.
We'll have you something to eat right away.
Hey.
Hey, Leatherface.
Give me a hand with Grandpa.
Careful.
(muffled cries)
Look, Grandpa, look, look.
Here, here!
(screaming)
(flies buzzing)
(dishes and utensils clanking)
(screaming)
(howling)
Shut up!
Quiet!
You act like a pack of hounds.
We were just having fun.
You think this is a party?
Please.
You can make them stop.
No, he can't. (laughs)
Shut your mouths.
Can't be helped, young lady.
- Oh, please, you can't let them kill me.
- Shut up.
Don't pay him no mind.
(sobbing)
- You like this face?
- (screaming)
You're crazy!
You've got to make them stop!
Please!
He's nothing.
He's just the cook.
Shut up, you bitch hog.
Me and Leatherface do all the work.
He don't like it.
Ain't that right?
You're just the cook!
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand nothing.
I understand you ain't nothing.
Me and him do all the work!
I just can't take no pleasure in killing.
Well, there's just some things you got to do.
Don't mean you have to like it.
Oh, please.
Please.
What do you want?
I'll do anything.
Anything.
(laughs)
I'll do...
I'll do anything you want.
(Sally continues screaming)
Don't need to torture the poor girl.
You just shut up!
Remember you're just the cook, and me and him will handle this.
Then get on with it.
I won't have this.
We ain't in no hurry because you ain't going no place.
No.
You hear me?
It might hurt you, but it don't mean much.
No sense in waiting.
I got to open up the room.
I been...
I been thinking about letting Grandpa have some fun.
You always said he's the best.
He's the best, all right.
Let's let him have a whack.
Hey, Grandpa, we going to let you have this one.
Just let him have a whack.
Now, you just hush.
It won't hurt none.
Why, old Grandpa is the best killer there ever was.
Why, it never took more than one lick, they say.
Why, he did 60 in five minutes once.
They say he could've done more if the hook and pull gang could've gotten the beeves out of the way faster.
Now, now, don't you cry none.
Old Grandpa's the best.
It won't hurt a bit.
(screams)
No!
No!
(screams)
No!
No!
No!
Oh, please don't!
Please!
Please!
Please don't!
No, no!
No!
(screaming)
No!
Hit her, Grandpa!
(screaming)
Hit her, Grandpa!
Hit her!
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her!
Hit that bitch.
Hit her, Grandpa!
Come on!
Come on, Grandpa, hit that bitch.
Careful there.
Come on, Grandpa.
Get her Grandpa, get her.
Go ahead, go ahead!
Get her!
Come on.
- Give me the hammer.
I'll get her.
- Get her, get her, Grandpa.
- Give me that hammer.
- Hit her, hit her, Grandpa.
- I'll kill her.
Let me get her.
- Hit the bitch.

When malefic planets are in retrograde, and Saturn is malefic... their maleficies are increased.
Have you been doing that Reader's Digest worth our...
Jerry, it just means Saturn's a bad influence.
It's just particularly... bad influence now, because it's in retrograde.
Hey, man, do you believe all that stuff your old lady is talking me?
My granddaddy is buried here.
Can we find out if anything happened?
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- See that big heavy fella... standing with that big flashlight, isn't that the sheriff?
You go tell him your granddaddy is buried in there.
He'll let you in.
Ok.
Thank you.
Hey, fella, I'm gonna run off to...
- meet him if you don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.
- Hey, folks.
Let us go see where... her granddaddy's buried.
Things happen here about they don't tell about.
I see things.
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
You laugh at an old man... this thing that laughs knows better.
Yes, they're sure.
The man said the Tallman's grave had been dug up.
Mama, don't worry.
I saw it myself!
It didn't look dug up to me.
What's that?
What smell?
What is that stench?
Hey.
That's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used... to sell his cattle!
We got an uncle that works in one of those places... outside of Fortworth.
See those buildings there?
That's where... they kill him.
They bash'em in the head with a big sledgehammer!
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill him.
It'd start squealing and freaking out, they'd have to... come up and bash'em 2 or 3 times.
They'd scatter them before they were even dead.
That's horrible!
People shouldn't kill animals for food.
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they get this big air gun... that shoots a bullet into the skull and then retracts it.
Franklin, I like me, please change the subject.
That smell's still going on.
Oh, man!
It's hot in here.
- Hitchhiker!
- Should we take him up?
Yeah man, pick him up.
He'll asphyxiate out there!
- What does he look like?
- The son of a bitch 's gonna...
- smell like the slaughterhouse.
- Give the guy a break.
He can...
- sit by Franklin.
- What do you wanna do?
- He's weird looking, no.
- I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where're you heading, man?
- You work at that place?
- Don't.
- How did you get stuck out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- I got an uncle that works...
- at a slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.
My grandfather, too.
My family's always been in beef.
The whole family are cracked.
Hey man, did you go into that... slaughter room or whatever they call it?
Where they shoot the cattle with that air gun thing?
- That gun is no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.
With the sledge!
That was better.
- They died better that way.
- How come?
I thought the gun...
- was better.
- Oh no.
With the new way...
- people were put out of jobs.
- You do that?
- Look!
- I was the killer!
- Let me see them.
- They don't seem to head your way.
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah!
- Franklin.
- Let me see.
- They make hitches...
They take the head and they boil, except for the tongue, and scrape... all the flesh away from the bone.
They use everything, they throw nothing away.
They use jaws, muscles, and the eyes, and the ligaments...
- and everything!
- Look at this.
- They boil the nose and the gums down to a big jelly of fat.
I don't know it was in that stuff.
It's really good.
Do you like it?
- Yeah, I like it.
It's good!
- It sounds horrible.
Can't we...
- talk about something else?
- You'd probably like it if you... didn't know what was in it.
I wouldn't and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
Take it before everybody's sick.
What are you doing?
Look.
I think that might hurt.
Oh, come on!
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh, what are you doing?
Nice, man!
I have this knife.
Put that away, too.
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.
Put it back.
You took my picture!
You can take me to my house.
I live right off this road.
I don't know, man.
We're in much of a hurry.
- How close is it?
- It's real close.
Couldn't you just walk?
I mean...
If it's so close.
You could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese.
My brother...
- makes it real good.
You'll like it.
- I think we'd better push on, man.
Don't we, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry...
- It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.
- You can pay me now.
- Huh?
- 2 dollars.
It's a good picture.
- No, man.
Franklin... give him back that picture.
I'm about to freak.
Call a cop.
That's the last damn hitchhiker I ever take.
- Listen to Franklin's horoscope:
- I'm sorry.
Travel in the countryside.
Long range plans, upsetting persons... around you, could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
The events in the world are not doing much, to cheer one up.
- That's just perfect!
- Franklin, I think you'll be alright.
Hey, Kat, read Alex's.
He's Capricorn.
Oh, no.
Capricorn is ruled by Saturn.
There are moments where we... cannot believe that what's happening is really true... pinch yourself and you may find out that it is.
Hurry up.
Here comes somebody.
How are you?
Would you fill her up, please?
I got no gas.
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.
Transport won't... be here until this afternoon.
Maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
Hey, you know where "The Old Franklin Place" is?
- "The Old Franklin Place"?
- It's an old 2-story house and... it's sitting up on the hill.
I think you have to turn on the road... back there, but I'm not real sure.
Maybe I've seen something like that up there.
But look, you boys... don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Those things are dangerous, you're bound to get hurt!
- We'll be careful.
- Don't wanna go fooling around... other folk's property.
Some folks don't like it.
They don't mind showing you.
- My father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?
- Yeah.
- Look...
I got barbecue here.
Why don't you stay a while?
The transport will be by in a little while...
I can go and get some barbecue.
Them girls, they don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Best you stick around here.
We should've asked him if there's another gas station around here.
Don't you think he would have told us if there was?
- It wouldn't hurt to ask.
- I'll go ask.
What the hell, we should have stopped back there for gas.
Go, damn it.
There.
You think this place has room service?
Franklin, you're cutting the van!
Yeah, I just started doing that.
I bet this is some of that guy's blood.
Look at that.
- Think it's his blood?
- I guess so.
That's blood, alright.
And I got cut the hell out of him, chef.
You think you could do that to yourself?
Crazy?
It takes something, though, I mean, do that to yourself, like he did.
You think I said something that made him mad?
- What?
- Franklin, you're crazy as he was.
Hey, I got us some barbecue.
Newt's the closest place to get gas.
We're going to that Granpa's place.
There's a creek, you can go swimming.
Come on, Sally, we're going to that Granpa's place!
- Let's go.
- Hey, that guy smeared blood...
- all over the van.
- Let's not waste time to wipe this up.
What?
What did you do?
You're in someone's van?
Let me see your knife.
Thank you.
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that service... station, you're towing us back in that chair.
Hey...
You think that guy was just trying to scare us by blowing out... my picture like that?
Oh, look, they let the place fall apart.
Put it over there.
- Wanna go over there?
- Let's go.
Oh, Kirk, come on!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I want to see the smear the guy made.
This is weird.
I wonder if that means something.
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's gonna get you.
- Why don't you wash it off, ok?
- I want to see inside.
- Jerry!
- Ok!
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- Get it.
You wash it up.
- You don't think that guy...
- is trying to follow us, do you?
- What for?
Where's my knife?
Kirk?
Looks like it must have been a nursery room.
This was my room.
I got to stay here until I was 8 years old.
- Until my grandmother died.
- What happened?
- To my grandmother?
- Yeah, she died.
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- I think it's seen better days...
These animals would to put me to sleep when I was a little girl.
Look at the zebra.
I had this fascination for the zebras...
Kate?
Sally!
Come on, Franklin!
It's gonna be a fun trip.
If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'll take it!
- Hey, Franklin!
- What's wrong?
Didn't you say there was a swimming well out here?
Pam and I would like to go swimming in there.
There used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
Come on.
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- We'll see them in an hour or so.
Yeah.
See them down in about an hour or so.
Sally!
Sally...
Seed growing in the world...
I don't want to miss it.
Man, a scorpion, there's a scorpion!
Crap!
This must be it!
Are you ok?
What the hell, Franklin would never get down here anyway.
I bet he must have when he was little.
Franklin never was little.
Gasoline.
I can leave my guitar, you know, I'd give him a couple of bucks...
We gotta come back by here anyway, I can pick up my guitar and... give him a couple more dollars and we get more gas...
He won't want your guitar, he's not gonna sell us some gas... let's just go back now.
Hey, come here!
Come here, look at this.
- A generator!
- What?
A generator!
For electricity!
Hey, hello!
Is there anybody in the house?
Hello!
Is anybody home?
I got something for you.
Let's go!
Hello?
Hello?
- Come look at this!
- Let's go!
Hello!
Anybody home?
Hello?
Hey, Pam!
Hello!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk?
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
He's coming to get you!
You don't think it means anything?
We'll protect you if he tries to get you.
- Maybe it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- You worry too much.
He couldn't find us, anyway.
He doesn't even know our names.
I gave him your name, Franklin.
And I told him where you lived.
I even gave him your ZIP code.
He's gonna kill you.
Jerry...
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife, remember?
When did you have it last?
I didn't have it last.
You had it last.
I gave it to you, remember?
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?
No, I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right.
I'll look for it.
Listen, I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
How do I get there, Frank?
Well, there's a trail down there.
Between the two old sheds.
- Can I go too?
- I think you'd better stay here.
All right.
I can't find it.
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.
You really are mad, huh?
I don't blame you.
Kirk!
You really didn't want me to come, did you?
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.
Did you believe all that stuff Pam was telling about?
Saturn, and retrograde, and all that?
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.
You don't think that guy is trying to follow us, do you?
I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
He'd probably find Kirk and kill him.
- Sally...
- What now?
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kirk!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Damn.
Kirk!
Are you guys in there?
Hey, guys!
Quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.
Pam, is that you?
Okay, you guys!
Come on out.
Come on!
Kirk?
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.
If they 're not back in a minute, we'd better go look for them
What if we get lost, too?
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Hey!
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
Sally...
I think we ought to go.
Are the keys in the van?
Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
What for?
Let me see the flashlight.
I'm gonna go look for them.
You don't have to go.
Sally, no, I don't think that's a good idea, Sally.
I don't think you ought to go.
Look, I'm gonna honk the horn one more time.
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No, I'm gonna honk the horn... and we will wait a minute, and they will come and we will go.
All right?
Sally, they took the keys!
We don't have any keys!
They took the keys!
Stop it!
Stop it!
- Now give me the flashlight!
- No, Sally!
You can't go!
What if they came back and we weren't here?
- Franklin, give me that flashlight!
- I'll keep the flashlight!
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right!
All right!
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you, all right?
I'll go with you, but I'll keep the flashlight.
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.
I can't push you down the hill!
Sally...
- Look, I'll go with you...
- Never mind, I'll go without it.
All right.
Sally, wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.
Sally!
Hold on a minute now.
All right, let's go.
Let's go, I'll go with you.
Sally, I can't keep up with you!
Sally!
Sally, wait a minute!
Hold on!
Jerry!
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
I thought I heard something.
There's a light!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- It looks like a house.
- Come on, push!
- It's a house!
- I can't see it very well.
- Franklin, this is impossible.
- Come on, Sally!
Get back and push, damn!
Impossible!
I heard something over there!
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!
Sally, I hear something.
Stop!
Stop!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help me, please!
- Help!
Help!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Help me!
Help me!
- Come over here!
You're all right, girl.
Okay?
Hold on, take it easy, all right?
He killed...
- Take it easy...
- He killed Franklin...
Call the police!
Jerry!
I don't know what happened to the others...
There's nobody out there now!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
What happened?
- Call the police...
- There's no phone here.
We have to drive to the sheriff's.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
I'll get the truck.
- Take it easy.
Take it easy.
- Don't go!
Don't go!

Acting on a typical day with some news... the word is that the sheriff's office began an investigation... early this morning in the County Cemetery.
Opening crypts and muslins where there was evidence of... tampering, The Sheriff found a reported dozen coffins were... robbed a part of its contents.
According to the sheriff, Rhesus...
Maldonado, there are ones from which only the head and... extremities are removed, and others and others from which only a hand or foot removed, with the... remainder of the cadaver left intact.
Maldonado linked...
What are you doing?
- You will come with me...
- No!
- What do you want?
- There's no need to do that...
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I had to lock up and get the lights off.
Because electricity is enough to drive a man out of business.
I hope you're not too uncomfortable down there.
You got nothing to worry about.
Just take it easy.
We're gonna get there soon.
No, no, no.
There's no need to do that.
We always do our best.
Hang on.
No.
Half witch.
You little shit!
You knock-head idiot!
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.
You damn fool!
You almost got caught.
No!
They didn't see me.
They don't know nothing!
I told you to stay away from that graveyard.
I told you...
I told you never to leave your brother alone!
Get that girl out of the car!
Get her out!
I hope your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.
Look at what your brother did to that door!
You let her go!
You goddamn idiot!
I thought you were in a hurry.
Where are the kids?
Where are the children?
Did they get away?
Are you sure?
You...
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!
Hey, come here!
Look!
See how nice she looks!
Get upstairs and get your grandpa!
Take it easy there, huh?
You'll stay here for a few minutes.
Get back in there!
To the chamber!
You just take it easy.
We'll have something to eat right away.
Hey, you two!
Give me a hand with grandpa!
Look, grandpa!
Look!
Knock it off!
Quiet!
You act like a pack of hounds.
- We're just having fun!
- You think this is a party?
Please!
You can make them stop!
- No shit?
- Shut your mouth!
Can't be helped, young lady.
Please!
You can't let them kill me!
He likes this face.
He's crazy!
You gotta make him stop!
Please...
- He's just a cook!
- Shut up, you bitch hog!
He always does all the work.
He don't like it.
Is that right?
You're just a cook!
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand nothing.
I understand you ain't nothing!
We do all the work!
I just can take no pleasure in killing.
It's just something we gotta do.
It don't mean you have to like it.
Please...
Please...
I'll do anything you want.
You don't need to torture the girl.
Please, shut up.
Remember you're just a cook.
Let me and him handle this.
I won't have this.
You ain't in no hurry.
And you ain't going no place.
You don't hear me?
I heard you told me much.
No sense in waiting.
I gotta go to my room.
I'll take her to grandpa.
Grandpa'll have some fun.
You always said he was the best.
He's the best all right.
Let's let him half leg.
Grandpa, we're gonna let you... have this one!
Have this one!
He won't use you much.
He won't hurt none.
Our grandpa was the best killer there ever was.
I never took all the guts to see.
I did in 6 in 5 minutes once.
I could've done more if the hook pulled again could've gotten the... beaves out of the way faster.
Now don't you cry.
Grandpa is the best.
It won't hurt a bit.
No!
No!
Please!
Don't!
Hit her!
Hit the bitch!
Go ahead!
Give me the hammer!
Give me the hammer!
I'll kill her!
It is believed that the indictment is only one of a series to be handed down as the result of a special grand jury investigation.
Graverobbing in Texas is this hour's top news story.
An informant led officers of the Muerto County Sheriff's Department to a cemetery just outside the small rural Texas community of Newt early this morning.
Officers there discovered what appeared to be a grisly work of art, the remains of a badly decomposed body wired to a large monument.
A second body was found in a ditch near the perimeter of the cemetery.
Subsequent investigation has revealed at least a dozen empty crypts, and it's feared more will turn up as the probe continues.
Deputies report that in some instances, only parts of a corpse had been removed, the head or in some cases the extremities removed, the remainder of the corpse left intact.
Evidence indicates the robberies have occurred over a period of time.
Sheriff Jesus Maldonado refused to give details of the ghoulish case and said only that he did have strong evidence linking the crime to elements outside the state.
Area residents have reportedly converged on the cemetery, fearing the remains of relatives have been removed.
No suspects are in custody, as the investigation at the scene continues.
Oil storage units continue to burn out of control at the huge Texaco refinery near the Texas-Louisiana border.

Fire-fighting units in three Texas cities continue to battle the holocaust, in an effort to confine 40-foot flames.
Smoke from the fire is visible to Houston residents some 60 miles to the south.
Health officials in San Francisco reluctantly admit they may have a cholera epidemic on their hands.
Some 40 cases of the highly infectious disease have been confirmed.

Houston police are puzzled over an outbreak of violence apparently touched off by a suicide.
A young man, reportedly angered by a local television blackout of a sports event, jumped from the tenth-story window of his apartment.

The construction firm says there's no logical reason for the collapse and suspects sabotage.
Police in Gary, Indiana, have been unable to identify the bodies of a young man and woman stab wounds and their features carved away.
The man's genitals had been removed, and police first identified the victims as two women.
OK?
Franklin!
Ah!
- Are you OK?
- I was...
Shit.
OK.
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take much more.
Listen, the condition of retrogradation is contrary or inharmonious to the regular direction of actual movement in the zodiac and is, in that respect, evil.
Hence, when malefic planets are in retrograde - and Saturn's malefic, OK?
- their maleficence is increased.
Have you been doing those word power columns?
It just means that Saturn's a bad influence.
It's just particularly a bad influence now because it's in retrograde.
- You believe that stuff she's hawking me?
- I don't know.
My granddaddy's buried here.
Did anything happen to him?
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- That big feller at the stand with that flashlight in his hand, that's the sheriff.
You tell him your granddaddy's buried in there.
- He'll let you in.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna run off with your girl a minute.
Honey, I'll get you the sheriff.
Let us through.
This girl's granddaddy's buried here.
Been in there the whole time, unbeknownst to Clyde.
Clyde didn't know, either.
They didn't know why...
Things happen hereabout they don't tell about.
I see things.
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
You laugh at an old man.
There's them that laughs and knows better.
They're sure.
The man said they could tell if the grave had been dug up.
Franklin, don't worry.
I saw it myself.
It didn't look dug up to me.
- Oh, what's that?
- What smells?
What is that stench?
Roll up the window.
Hey, that's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used to sell his cattle.
We got an uncle that works at one of those places outside of Ft.
Worth.
That's where they kill them.
They bash them in the head with a sledgehammer.
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill 'em on the first lick.
They'd start squealing and freaking out, and they'd have to bash 'em three times.
They'd skin them sometimes before they were even dead.
That's horrible.
People shouldn't kill animals for food.
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they got this big gun that shoots a bolt into their skull, then retracts it.
It's just boom!
It goes boom!
And boom!
Franklin, I like meat.
Please change the subject.
- Boom!
- That's terrible.
It's still going on.
Oh, man, it's hot in here.
- Hitchhiker.
- Should we pick him up?
- Yeah.
He'll asphyxiate out there.
- What does he look like?
Son of a bitch is gonna smell like a slaughterhouse.
Oh, give the guy a break.
He can sit by Franklin.
- What do you want to do?
- He's weird-looking.
- Pick him up, man.
- No!
Well, I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where you headed, man?
- South.
You work at that place?
Oh, no.
- How did you get stuck way out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- My uncle works for the slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.
My-my grandfather too.
My family's always been in meat.
A whole family of Draculas.
Hey, man, did you go in that slaughter room?
Where they shoot the cattle with that big air gun?
- Oh, that-that-that gun's no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.
The old way with a sledge.
See, that was better.
They died better that way.
How come?
I thought the gun was better.
Oh, no, no.
With the new way, the people are put out of jobs.
You do that?
Look.
- I was the killer.
- Damn.
- Let me see them.
- They don't send the heads away.
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah.
Franklin.
See, they make head cheese.
They... they take the head, and they boil it, except for the tongue, and they scrape all the flesh away from the bone.
They use everything.
They don't throw nothing way.
They use the jowls and the muscles and the eyes and ligaments and everything.
- Oh.
- Look at this.
The nose and the gums and all the flesh, and they boil it down into a big jelly of fat.
Wow.
I didn't know that's what was in that stuff.
It's really good.
You like it?
Oh, yeah, sure, I like it.
It's good.
It sounds horrible.
Could we talk about something else?
You'd like it if you didn't know what was in it.
I wouldn't, and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
Oh.
Come on, you're making everybody sick.
Oh, all right.
What are you doing?
Hey, man, put that knife up.
Oh!
Oh, come on.
Oh!
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh, my God!
Why are you doing that?
Put that away.
I have this knife.
Put that away, too.
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.
Fold it up.
Hey, you took my picture.
Hey, you-you could take me to my house.
I live right off this road.
Well, I don't know, man.
We're in pretty much of a hurry.
- How close is it?
- It's real close.
Well, couldn't you just walk?
I mean, if it's so close.
Yeah, you could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese?
My brother makes it real good.
You'll like it.
I think you better push on now.
Don't you, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.
You can pay me now.
- Huh?
Two dollars.
It's a good picture.
No, man.
Franklin, give him back the damn picture.
- He tried to sell him that picture.
- You're kidding?
No, I'm serious.
What are you doing?
Hey, Jerry, pull us over!
Hey, man, what's up?
What are you doing?
Get out.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm about half ready to call a cop.
That's the last goddamn hitchhiker I ever pick up.
Hey, listen to Franklin's horoscope.
Oh, Sally.
"Travel in the country, long-range plans
"and upsetting persons around you
"could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
The events in the world are not doing much either to cheer one up."
- That's just perfect.
- Franklin, I think that will be all right.
And now read Sally's.
She's a Capricorn.
Oh, no.
Capricorn's ruled by Saturn.
"There are moments when we cannot believe that what is happening is true.
Pinch yourself and you may find out that it is."
Everybody out.
Hurry up, so we can get home.
Here comes somebody.
How are you?
Would you fill her up, please?
I got no gas.
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.
The transport won't be here until late this afternoon, maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
Hey, do you know where the old Franklin place is?
- The old Franklin place?
- Yeah.
It's an old two-story rock house on a hill.
I think you have to turn on that road back there, but I'm not real sure.
Yeah, maybe I seen something like that up that way.
Well, now look, you boys don't want to go messing around no old house.
Those things is dangerous.
You're liable to get hurt.
We'll be careful.
You don't want to go fooling around with other folks' property.
Some folks don't like it, and they don't mind showing you.
- Oh, my father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?
Yeah.
Look, I got some good barbeque here.
Why don't you fellas stick around here a while?
That transport will be by in a little while.
Well, you want to get some barbeque?
Them girls, now, they don't want to go messing around an old house.
It's best you stick around here.
We should've asked if there's another gas station around.
Don't you think he would've told us if there was?
Man, it wouldn't hurt to ask, you know?
OK, I'll go ask.
I knew the hell we should've stopped back there for gas.
- Press it.
- I'm pulling it down.
- There.
- You think this place has room service?
Franklin, you maniac, you're tearing up the van.
Um, yeah, I just started doing that.
Hey, I bet that's some of that guy's blood.
Look at that.
Look at that.
- You think that's blood?
- Yeah, I guess so.
Oh, that's blood, all right.
And that guy cut the hell out of himself.
You think you could do that to yourself?
- I'm not crazy.
- Yeah, yeah.
It takes something, though, I mean just to do that to yourself like he did.
God!
Hey, you think I said something made him mad?
- Well, what?
- Franklin, you're crazier than he was.
Hey, I got us some barbeque.
- Newt's the closest place to get gas.
- Aw.
Aren't we going out to Grandpa's place?
There's a creek.
You could go swimming.
Let's go.
Come on, Sally.
We're going to Grandpa's place.
Let's go!
Hey, that guy smeared blood all over the van.
- Like he was trying to write something.
- What'd he do?
Did he write something on the van?
Let me see your knife.
Thank you.
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that station, you're towing us back in your chair.
Hey, you think that guy's just trying to scare us by, you know, blowing up my picture like that?
Oh, I wish they hadn't let the place fall apart.
It looks like the birth place of Bela Lugosi.
- I'm scared.
- I'll help you with that.
- See that window over there?
- That's strange.
Hey, watch my arms.
Watch out.
- Be straight.
Come on.
Hey.
- I'll get you from here.
I want to see that smear that guy made.
- Oh, man.
- Weird.
I wonder if that means something.
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's going to get you.
- Come on.
- Why don't you wash it off?
I want to show you the inside.
- Jerry!
- OK.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Come on, Kirk.
- Here, man, you wash it off.
You don't think that guy would try and follow us?
What for?
Where's my knife?
Kirk?
It looks like it must've been a nursery.
This is my room.
I got to stay here one time when I was eight years old.
- Right after my grandmother died.
- What happened?
- What happened to my grandmother?
- Yeah.
She died.
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- It's seen better days.
These animals used to talk me to sleep when I was little.
Look at the zebras.
I had these fascination for the zebras.
Sally!
Sally!
Come on, Franklin.
It's gonna be a fun trip.
If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'm going to be able to take it.
Aah!
Ah!
- Hey, Franklin.
- Hey, Franklin.
What's wrong?
You said there was a swimming hole around here?
Yeah.
Well, Pam and I would like to go swimming, man.
Uh, there used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
Come on, we'll find it.
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- (Kirk) No.
We'll see you in an hour or so.
Yeah.
We'll see you in about an hour or so.
Sally?
Sally!
Zero in the world.
Just shoot him and put us out of our misery.
- Snakes and spiders!
- Stop it!
And scorpions!
Man-eating lizards.
- Kirk, help.
Kirk!
- Ow.
Ow.
Oh.
Crap.
This must be it.
Oh, are you OK?
How the hell did Franklin ever get down here, anyway?
Somebody must've carried him when he was little.
Franklin never was little.
Gasoline.
I can leave him my guitar, give him a couple bucks.
We're coming back anyway.
I can pick up my guitar, give him a couple more dollars and bring him some gas.
They don't want your guitar.
They won't want to sell us gas.
Let's just go back now.
Hey, come here.
Come here and look at this.
- A generator.
- What?
A generator!
For electricity.
Hey, hello in there!
Is anybody here?
Hello, is anybody home?
I got something for you.
Ah!
Ooh!
Let's go!
Hello?
- Hey, Pam, come look at this.
- What?
No!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Hello?
Hey, Pam.
Hello?
Kirk?
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk.
Kirk?
Kirk?
Oh!
Oh, God!
Kirk!
Kirk!
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
- You don't think it means anything?
- We'll protect you.
- I'll bet it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
- It probably doesn't mean anything, huh?
- You worry too much.
He couldn't find us anyway.
I mean, he doesn't even know our names.
I gave him your name.
I told him where you live.
I even gave him your zip code.
He's gonna kill you.
Jerry.
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife.
When did you have it last?
Well, I didn't have it last.
You had it last.
I gave it to you.
Remember?
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?
No.
I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right, I'll look for it.
I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
How do I get there?
Well, there's a trail down there between them two old sheds.
- Can I go, too?
- I think you'd better stay here.
All right.
I can't find it.
Are you mad at me?
No, I'm not mad at you.
You really are mad, huh?
Oh, I don't blame you.
I'm...
Kirk!
You really didn't want me to come, did you?
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.
Sally, did you believe in all that stuff that Pam was telling about Saturn and retrograde and all that?
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.
Yeah.
You don't think that guy would try and follow us, do you?
Well, I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
He's probably afraid Kirk will kill him.
Sally?
What now?
Nothing.
Never mind.
Kirk!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Damn.
Kirk?
- Are you guys in there?
Hey, guys, quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.
Pam, is that you?
OK, you guys.
Come on out.
Come on!
Kirk?
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.
If they're not back in a minute, we've got to go look for them.
Well, what if we get lost, too?
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
Hey!
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
Sally?
I think we ought to go.
Are the keys in the van?
- Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
- What for?
Let me see the flashlight.
I'll go look for them.
You don't have to go.
Sally, don't go.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I don't think you ought to go.
I'm going to honk the horn one more time.
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No.
Now, I'm gonna honk the horn, and we're gonna wait a minute, and then if they don't come, we'll go.
All right?
Sally, they took the keys.
We don't have any keys.
They took the keys with them.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Franklin!
- Jerry took the keys with him!
- Give me that flashlight!
No, Sally, we can't go!
Look, what if they came back and we weren't here?
- Give me that flashlight!
- No, I've got to take the flashlight.
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right, all right, I'll go with you.
No, Sally.
Come on, I'll go with you, but I'm gonna keep the flashlight.
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.
I can't push you down that hill!
Sally, look, I know.
Oh!
- I'll go with you, but I'm going to hold...
- Never mind, I'll just go without it.
All right, all right.
Sally, wait!
Sally, wait a minute!
I'm coming with you.
Sally?
Hold up a minute now.
All right, let's go.
Let's go.
I'll go with you.
Sally, I can't keep up with you.
Sally?
Sally, wait a minute.
Hold up.
Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Wait.
- I thought I heard something.
- There's a light.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
Oh, it looks like a house.
Well, come on, push.
Come on, push.
Push down.
There.
- It's a house.
- Yeah?
I can't see it very well.
Oh, Franklin, this is impossible.
Come on, Sally.
Get back and push down.
This is impossible.
I hear something out there.
Look.
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!
Jerry!
Sally, I hear something.
Stop.
Stop.
Somebody, please!
Help!
Help me, please!
Somebody, help me!
Help!
Please!
Please!
Please help me!
Please!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help me!
Help me!
Oh, God!
Help, help!
Close the door.
Help me.
Whoa, there, whoa, whoa.
- Come over here.
- Somebody's trying to kill me.
Help, help...
Calm down.
You're all right, you're OK.
- Oh, now, take it easy.
- Call the police.
- He might come.
- Now, what happened?
- He... he... he killed...
- Now, now, take it easy.
He killed Franklin.
I don't know.
Call the police!
- Take it easy.
- And Jerry.
I...
I don't-I don't know what happened to the others.
There's nobody out there now.
Come on.
Come on now, take it easy.
Come on, take it easy.
- Oh, please.
- What happened?
Please.
Call the police.
There's no phone here.
We... we have to drive over to Childress.
Yeah, yeah.
Now, you take it easy.
Take it easy now.
I'll get the truck.
- Now, now, take it easy.
Take it easy.
- Don't go.
Take it easy.
Weather is expected to be warm to partly cloudy tomorrow with no chance of precipitation.
The high today will be in the upper 90s and a low tonight of 81 degrees.
Current temperature is 96 with winds out the southeast at three miles a hour.
Humidity 98, barometer is at 29.9 and rising.
Acting on a tip, the Muerto County sheriff's office began an investigation early this morning in the Muerto County Cemetery opening crypts where there was evidence of tampering.
The sheriff's deputies found a reported dozen coffins robbed of their contents.
According to the sheriff, there were cadavers in which the heads and extremities were removed, and others in which only a hand or foot had been removed.
Maldonado has information linking the robberies to a large and well-organized West Coast jewel theft ring but declined to suggest any reason for them to mutilate the cadavers.
- What are you doing?
- You ain't got no need to worry.
No!
You just cooperate, young lady, and we'll have no trouble.
- Now, listen...
- What do you want?
Now, there's no need to do that.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Had to lock up and get the lights.
Cost of electricity is enough to drive a man out of business.
Uh, I hope you're not too uncomfortable down there.
You got nothing to worry about.
You just take it easy, and we'll be there soon.
Now, now, now, now.
There's no need to do that, no.
We'll be over this in a bit.
Hang on.
Halfwits.
Little coon shits.
Come here, you nap-haired idiot!
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.
You damn fool, you almost got caught over at Duke's.
No, no, they didn't see me.
They don't know nothing.
I told you to stay away from that graveyard!
I told you and I told you,
I told you never to leave your brother alone, you...
Get in there and get that girl out of the car.
Come on, get her out of the car.
Get her out of there.
Hopefully your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.
Get her in there.
We'll have the whole county out here.
Don't you got any self-respect?
Look what your brother did to the door!
He's got no pride in his home?
Get her in there.
You've been a fool, you!
You better get them other kids.
Where are they, huh?
You're a damn fool, you.
Oh!
I thought you was in a hurry.
Where are the kids?
Where are they?
Show me!
- None of 'em get away?
- Uh-uh-uh.
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.
You...
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!
Hey, you did good.
She's a nice girl.
You nitwit, get upstairs and get your grandpa.
Now, now, young lady, you just take it easy there now.
Look, we'll fix you some supper in a few minutes.
Huh?
Get back in there!
Get in there!
Now, you just take it easy.
Take it easy.
We'll have you something to eat right away.
Hey.
Hey, Leatherface.
Give me a hand with Grandpa.
Careful.
Look, Grandpa, look, look.
Here, here!
Shut up!
Quiet!
You act like a pack of hounds.
We were just having fun.
You think this is a party?
Please.
You can make them stop.
No, he can't.
Shut your mouths.
Can't be helped, young lady.
- Oh, please, you can't let them kill me.
- Shut up.
Don't pay him no mind.
You like this face?
You're crazy!
You've got to make them stop!
Please!
He's nothing.
He's just the cook.
Shut up, you bitch hog.
Me and Leatherface do all the work.
He don't like it.
Ain't that right?
You're just the cook!
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand nothing.
I understand you ain't nothing.
Me and him do all the work!
I just can't take no pleasure in killing.
Well, there's just some things you got to do.
Don't mean you have to like it.
Oh, please.
Please.
What do you want?
I'll do anything.
Anything.
I'll do...
I'll do anything you want.
Don't need to torture the poor girl.
You just shut up!
Remember you're just the cook, and me and him will handle this.
Then get on with it.
I won't have this.
We ain't in no hurry because you ain't going no place.
No.
You hear me?
It might hurt you, but it don't mean much.
No sense in waiting.
I got to open up the room.
I been...
I been thinking about letting Grandpa have some fun.
You always said he's the best.
He's the best, all right.
Let's let him have a whack.
Hey, Grandpa, we going to let you have this one.
Just let him have a whack.
Now, you just hush.
It won't hurt none.
Why, old Grandpa is the best killer there ever was.
Why, it never took more than one lick, they say.
Why, he did 60 in five minutes once.
They say he could've done more if the hook and pull gang could've gotten the beeves out of the way faster.
Now, now, don't you cry none.
Old Grandpa's the best.
It won't hurt a bit.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Oh, please don't!
Please!
Please!
Please don't!
No, no!
No!
No!
Hit her, Grandpa!
Hit her, Grandpa!
Hit her!
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her!
Hit that bitch.
Hit her, Grandpa!
Come on!
Come on, Grandpa, hit that bitch.
Careful there.
Come on, Grandpa.
Get her Grandpa, get her.
Go ahead, go ahead!
Get her!
Come on.
- Give me the hammer.
I'll get her.
- Get her, get her, Grandpa.
- Give me that hammer.
- Hit her, hit her, Grandpa.
- I'll kill her.
Let me get her.
- Hit the bitch.
Help!
Help!
Go!
Go

Evidence indicates the... robberies have occurred over a period of time.
Sheriff Rhesus Maldonado refuses to give details... in this case and said only... that he did have a strong evidence linking the crime to... elements outside the state.

Franklin!
Are you ok?
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take...
- much more of this.
- The condition of retro gradation... is contrary or inharmonious to the regular direction of actual... movement in the zodiac, and is, in that respect, evil.
Hint:
When malefic planets are in retrograde, and Saturn is malefic... their maleficies are increased.
Have you been doing that Reader's Digest worth our...
Jerry, it just means Saturn's a bad influence.
It's just particularly... bad influence now, because it's in retrograde.
Hey, man, do you believe all that stuff your old lady is talking me?
My granddaddy is buried here.
Can we find out if anything happened?
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- See that big heavy fella... standing with that big flashlight, isn't that the sheriff?
You go tell him your granddaddy is buried in there.
He'll let you in.
Ok.
Thank you.
Hey, fella, I'm gonna run off to...
- meet him if you don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.
- Hey, folks.
Let us go see where... her granddaddy's buried.
Things happen here about they don't tell about.
I see things.
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
You laugh at an old man... this thing that laughs knows better.
Yes, they're sure.
The man said the Tallman's grave had been dug up.
Mama, don't worry.
I saw it myself!
It didn't look dug up to me.
What's that?
What smell?
What is that stench?
Hey.
That's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used... to sell his cattle!
We got an uncle that works in one of those places... outside of Fortworth.
See those buildings there?
That's where... they kill him.
They bash'em in the head with a big sledgehammer!
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill him.
It'd start squealing and freaking out, they'd have to... come up and bash'em 2 or 3 times.
They'd scatter them before they were even dead.
That's horrible!
People shouldn't kill animals for food.
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they get this big air gun... that shoots a bullet into the skull and then retracts it.
Franklin, I like me, please change the subject.
That smell's still going on.
Oh, man!
It's hot in here.
- Hitchhiker!
- Should we take him up?
Yeah man, pick him up.
He'll asphyxiate out there!
- What does he look like?
- The son of a bitch 's gonna...
- smell like the slaughterhouse.
- Give the guy a break.
He can...
- sit by Franklin.
- What do you wanna do?
- He's weird looking, no.
- I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where're you heading, man?
- You work at that place?
- Don't.
- How did you get stuck out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- I got an uncle that works...
- at a slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.
My grandfather, too.
My family's always been in beef.
The whole family are cracked.
Hey man, did you go into that... slaughter room or whatever they call it?
Where they shoot the cattle with that air gun thing?
- That gun is no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.
With the sledge!
That was better.
- They died better that way.
- How come?
I thought the gun...
- was better.
- Oh no.
With the new way...
- people were put out of jobs.
- You do that?
- Look!
- I was the killer!
- Let me see them.
- They don't seem to head your way.
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah!
- Franklin.
- Let me see.
- They make hitches...
They take the head and they boil, except for the tongue, and scrape... all the flesh away from the bone.
They use everything, they throw nothing away.
They use jaws, muscles, and the eyes, and the ligaments...
- and everything!
- Look at this.
- They boil the nose and the gums down to a big jelly of fat.
I don't know it was in that stuff.
It's really good.
Do you like it?
- Yeah, I like it.
It's good!
- It sounds horrible.
Can't we...
- talk about something else?
- You'd probably like it if you... didn't know what was in it.
I wouldn't and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
Take it before everybody's sick.
What are you doing?
Look.
I think that might hurt.
Oh, come on!
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh, what are you doing?
Nice, man!
I have this knife.
Put that away, too.
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.
Put it back.
You took my picture!
You can take me to my house.
I live right off this road.
I don't know, man.
We're in much of a hurry.
- How close is it?
- It's real close.
Couldn't you just walk?
I mean...
If it's so close.
You could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese.
My brother...
- makes it real good.
You'll like it.
- I think we'd better push on, man.
Don't we, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry...
- It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.
- You can pay me now.
- Huh?
- 2 dollars.
It's a good picture.
- No, man.
Franklin... give him back that picture.
I'm about to freak.
Call a cop.
That's the last damn hitchhiker I ever take.
- Listen to Franklin's horoscope:
- I'm sorry.
Travel in the countryside.
Long range plans, upsetting persons... around you, could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
The events in the world are not doing much, to cheer one up.
- That's just perfect!
- Franklin, I think you'll be alright.
Hey, Kat, read Alex's.
He's Capricorn.
Oh, no.
Capricorn is ruled by Saturn.
There are moments where we... cannot believe that what's happening is really true... pinch yourself and you may find out that it is.
Hurry up.
Here comes somebody.
How are you?
Would you fill her up, please?
I got no gas.
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.
Transport won't... be here until this afternoon.
Maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
Hey, you know where "The Old Franklin Place" is?
- "The Old Franklin Place"?
- It's an old 2-story house and... it's sitting up on the hill.
I think you have to turn on the road... back there, but I'm not real sure.
Maybe I've seen something like that up there.
But look, you boys... don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Those things are dangerous, you're bound to get hurt!
- We'll be careful.
- Don't wanna go fooling around... other folk's property.
Some folks don't like it.
They don't mind showing you.
- My father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?
- Yeah.
- Look...
I got barbecue here.
Why don't you stay a while?
The transport will be by in a little while...
I can go and get some barbecue.
Them girls, they don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Best you stick around here.
We should've asked him if there's another gas station around here.
Don't you think he would have told us if there was?
- It wouldn't hurt to ask.
- I'll go ask.
What the hell, we should have stopped back there for gas.
Go, damn it.
There.
You think this place has room service?
Franklin, you're cutting the van!
Yeah, I just started doing that.
I bet this is some of that guy's blood.
Look at that.
- Think it's his blood?
- I guess so.
That's blood, alright.
And I got cut the hell out of him, chef.
You think you could do that to yourself?
Crazy?
It takes something, though, I mean, do that to yourself, like he did.
You think I said something that made him mad?
- What?
- Franklin, you're crazy as he was.
Hey, I got us some barbecue.
Newt's the closest place to get gas.
We're going to that Granpa's place.
There's a creek, you can go swimming.
Come on, Sally, we're going to that Granpa's place!
- Let's go.
- Hey, that guy smeared blood...
- all over the van.
- Let's not waste time to wipe this up.
What?
What did you do?
You're in someone's van?
Let me see your knife.
Thank you.
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that service... station, you're towing us back in that chair.
Hey...
You think that guy was just trying to scare us by blowing out... my picture like that?
Oh, look, they let the place fall apart.
Put it over there.
- Wanna go over there?
- Let's go.
Oh, Kirk, come on!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I want to see the smear the guy made.
This is weird.
I wonder if that means something.
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's gonna get you.
- Why don't you wash it off, ok?
- I want to see inside.
- Jerry!
- Ok!
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- Get it.
You wash it up.
- You don't think that guy...
- is trying to follow us, do you?
- What for?
Where's my knife?
Kirk?
Looks like it must have been a nursery room.
This was my room.
I got to stay here until I was 8 years old.
- Until my grandmother died.
- What happened?
- To my grandmother?
- Yeah, she died.
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- I think it's seen better days...
These animals would to put me to sleep when I was a little girl.
Look at the zebra.
I had this fascination for the zebras...
Kate?
Sally!
Come on, Franklin!
It's gonna be a fun trip.
If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'll take it!
- Hey, Franklin!
- What's wrong?
Didn't you say there was a swimming well out here?
Pam and I would like to go swimming in there.
There used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
Come on.
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- We'll see them in an hour or so.
Yeah.
See them down in about an hour or so.
Sally!
Sally...
Seed growing in the world...
I don't want to miss it.
Man, a scorpion, there's a scorpion!
Crap!
This must be it!
Are you ok?
What the hell, Franklin would never get down here anyway.
I bet he must have when he was little.
Franklin never was little.
Gasoline.
I can leave my guitar, you know, I'd give him a couple of bucks...
We gotta come back by here anyway, I can pick up my guitar and... give him a couple more dollars and we get more gas...
He won't want your guitar, he's not gonna sell us some gas... let's just go back now.
Hey, come here!
Come here, look at this.
- A generator!
- What?
A generator!
For electricity!
Hey, hello!
Is there anybody in the house?
Hello!
Is anybody home?
I got something for you.
Let's go!
Hello?
Hello?
- Come look at this!
- Let's go!
Hello!
Anybody home?
Hello?
Hey, Pam!
Hello!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk?
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
He's coming to get you!
You don't think it means anything?
We'll protect you if he tries to get you.
- Maybe it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- You worry too much.
He couldn't find us, anyway.
He doesn't even know our names.
I gave him your name, Franklin.
And I told him where you lived.
I even gave him your ZIP code.
He's gonna kill you.
Jerry...
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife, remember?
When did you have it last?
I didn't have it last.
You had it last.
I gave it to you, remember?
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?
No, I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right.
I'll look for it.
Listen, I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
How do I get there, Frank?
Well, there's a trail down there.
Between the two old sheds.
- Can I go too?
- I think you'd better stay here.
All right.
I can't find it.
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.
You really are mad, huh?
I don't blame you.
Kirk!
You really didn't want me to come, did you?
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.
Did you believe all that stuff Pam was telling about?
Saturn, and retrograde, and all that?
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.
You don't think that guy is trying to follow us, do you?
I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
He'd probably find Kirk and kill him.
- Sally...
- What now?
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kirk!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Damn.
Kirk!
Are you guys in there?
Hey, guys!
Quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.
Pam, is that you?
Okay, you guys!
Come on out.
Come on!
Kirk?
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.
If they 're not back in a minute, we'd better go look for them
What if we get lost, too?
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Hey!
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
Sally...
I think we ought to go.
Are the keys in the van?
Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
What for?
Let me see the flashlight.
I'm gonna go look for them.
You don't have to go.
Sally, no, I don't think that's a good idea, Sally.
I don't think you ought to go.
Look, I'm gonna honk the horn one more time.
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No, I'm gonna honk the horn... and we will wait a minute, and they will come and we will go.
All right?
Sally, they took the keys!
We don't have any keys!
They took the keys!
Stop it!
Stop it!
- Now give me the flashlight!
- No, Sally!
You can't go!
What if they came back and we weren't here?
- Franklin, give me that flashlight!
- I'll keep the flashlight!
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right!
All right!
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you, all right?
I'll go with you, but I'll keep the flashlight.
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.
I can't push you down the hill!
Sally...
- Look, I'll go with you...
- Never mind, I'll go without it.
All right.
Sally, wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.
Sally!
Hold on a minute now.
All right, let's go.
Let's go, I'll go with you.
Sally, I can't keep up with you!
Sally!
Sally, wait a minute!
Hold on!
Jerry!
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
I thought I heard something.
There's a light!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- It looks like a house.
- Come on, push!
- It's a house!
- I can't see it very well.
- Franklin, this is impossible.
- Come on, Sally!
Get back and push, damn!
Impossible!
I heard something over there!
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!
Sally, I hear something.
Stop!
Stop!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help me, please!
- Help!
Help!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Help me!
Help me!
- Come over here!
You're all right, girl.
Okay?
Hold on, take it easy, all right?
He killed...
- Take it easy...
- He killed Franklin...
Call the police!
Jerry!
I don't know what happened to the others...
There's nobody out there now!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
What happened?
- Call the police...
- There's no phone here.
We have to drive to the sheriff's.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
I'll get the truck.
- Take it easy.
Take it easy.
- Don't go!
Don't go!

Acting on a typical day with some news... the word is that the sheriff's office began an investigation... early this morning in the County Cemetery.
Opening crypts and muslins where there was evidence of... tampering, The Sheriff found a reported dozen coffins were... robbed a part of its contents.
According to the sheriff, Rhesus...
Maldonado, there are ones from which only the head and... extremities are removed, and others and others from which only a hand or foot removed, with the... remainder of the cadaver left intact.
Maldonado linked...
What are you doing?
- You will come with me...
- No!
- What do you want?
- There's no need to do that...
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I had to lock up and get the lights off.
Because electricity is enough to drive a man out of business.
I hope you're not too uncomfortable down there.
You got nothing to worry about.
Just take it easy.
We're gonna get there soon.
No, no, no.
There's no need to do that.
We always do our best.
Hang on.
No.
Half witch.
You little shit!
You knock-head idiot!
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.
You damn fool!
You almost got caught.
No!
They didn't see me.
They don't know nothing!
I told you to stay away from that graveyard.
I told you...
I told you never to leave your brother alone!
Get that girl out of the car!
Get her out!
I hope your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.
Look at what your brother did to that door!
You let her go!
You goddamn idiot!
I thought you were in a hurry.
Where are the kids?
Where are the children?
Did they get away?
Are you sure?
You...
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!
Hey, come here!
Look!
See how nice she looks!
Get upstairs and get your grandpa!
Take it easy there, huh?
You'll stay here for a few minutes.
Get back in there!
To the chamber!
You just take it easy.
We'll have something to eat right away.
Hey, you two!
Give me a hand with grandpa!
Look, grandpa!
Look!
Knock it off!
Quiet!
You act like a pack of hounds.
- We're just having fun!
- You think this is a party?
Please!
You can make them stop!
- No shit?
- Shut your mouth!
Can't be helped, young lady.
Please!
You can't let them kill me!
He likes this face.
He's crazy!
You gotta make him stop!
Please...
- He's just a cook!
- Shut up, you bitch hog!
He always does all the work.
He don't like it.
Is that right?
You're just a cook!
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand nothing.
I understand you ain't nothing!
We do all the work!
I just can take no pleasure in killing.
It's just something we gotta do.
It don't mean you have to like it.
Please...
Please...
I'll do anything you want.
You don't need to torture the girl.
Please, shut up.
Remember you're just a cook.
Let me and him handle this.
I won't have this.
You ain't in no hurry.
And you ain't going no place.
You don't hear me?
I heard you told me much.
No sense in waiting.
I gotta go to my room.
I'll take her to grandpa.
Grandpa'll have some fun.
You always said he was the best.
He's the best all right.
Let's let him half leg.
Grandpa, we're gonna let you... have this one!
Have this one!
He won't use you much.
He won't hurt none.
Our grandpa was the best killer there ever was.
I never took all the guts to see.
I did in 6 in 5 minutes once.
I could've done more if the hook pulled again could've gotten the... beaves out of the way faster.
Now don't you cry.
Grandpa is the best.
It won't hurt a bit.
No!
No!
Please!
Don't!
Hit her!
Hit the bitch!
Go ahead!
Give me the hammer!
Give me the hammer!
I'll kill her!
Go!
Go!
(radio announcer) It is believed that the indictment is only one of a series to be handed down as the result of a special grand jury investigation.
Graverobbing in Texas is this hour's top news story.
An informant led officers of the Muerto County Sheriff's Department to a cemetery just outside the small rural Texas community of Newt early this morning.
Officers there discovered what appeared to be a grisly work of art, the remains of a badly decomposed body wired to a large monument.
A second body was found in a ditch near the perimeter of the cemetery.
Subsequent investigation has revealed at least a dozen empty crypts, and it's feared more will turn up as the probe continues.
Deputies report that in some instances, only parts of a corpse had been removed, the head or in some cases the extremities removed, the remainder of the corpse left intact.
Evidence indicates the robberies have occurred over a period of time.
Sheriff Jesus Maldonado refused to give details of the ghoulish case and said only that he did have strong evidence linking the crime to elements outside the state.
Area residents have reportedly converged on the cemetery, fearing the remains of relatives have been removed.
No suspects are in custody, as the investigation at the scene continues.
Oil storage units continue to burn out of control at the huge Texaco refinery near the Texas-Louisiana border.
Three storage units exploded into flames during the night, killing at least three workers and injuring a dozen more.
Fire-fighting units in three Texas cities continue to battle the holocaust, in an effort to confine 40-foot flames.
Smoke from the fire is visible to Houston residents some 60 miles to the south.

Police in Gary, Indiana, have been unable to identify the bodies of a young man and woman... (continues indistinct)
...stab wounds and their features carved away.
The man's genitals had been removed, and police first identified the victims as two women.
(news report continues low)
OK?
(screams)
Franklin!
Ah!
- Are you OK?
- I was...
Shit.
OK.
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take much more.
Listen, the condition of retrogradation is contrary or inharmonious to the regular direction of actual movement in the zodiac and is, in that respect, evil.
Hence, when malefic planets are in retrograde - and Saturn's malefic, OK?
- their maleficence is increased.
Have you been doing those word power columns?
It just means that Saturn's a bad influence.
It's just particularly a bad influence now because it's in retrograde.
- You believe that stuff she's hawking me?
- I don't know.
My granddaddy's buried here.
Did anything happen to him?
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- That big feller at the stand with that flashlight in his hand, that's the sheriff.
You tell him your granddaddy's buried in there.
- He'll let you in.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna run off with your girl a minute.
Honey, I'll get you the sheriff.
Let us through.
This girl's granddaddy's buried here.
Been in there the whole time, unbeknownst to Clyde.
Clyde didn't know, either.
They didn't know why...
Things happen hereabout they don't tell about.
I see things.
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
You laugh at an old man.
There's them that laughs and knows better.
(Sally) They're sure.
The man said they could tell if the grave had been dug up.
Franklin, don't worry.
I saw it myself.
It didn't look dug up to me.
- (Sally) Oh, what's that?
- What smells?
What is that stench?
Roll up the window.
Hey, that's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used to sell his cattle.
We got an uncle that works at one of those places outside of Ft.
Worth.
That's where they kill them.
They bash them in the head with a sledgehammer.
- (Pam) That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill 'em on the first lick.
They'd start squealing and freaking out, and they'd have to bash 'em three times.
They'd skin them sometimes before they were even dead.
(Pam) That's horrible.
People shouldn't kill animals for food.
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they got this big gun that shoots a bolt into their skull, then retracts it.
It's just boom!
It goes boom!
And boom!
Franklin, I like meat.
Please change the subject.
- Boom!
- That's terrible.
It's still going on.
Oh, man, it's hot in here.
- Hitchhiker.
- Should we pick him up?
- Yeah.
He'll asphyxiate out there.
- What does he look like?
Son of a bitch is gonna smell like a slaughterhouse.
Oh, give the guy a break.
He can sit by Franklin.
- What do you want to do?
- He's weird-looking.
- Pick him up, man.
- No!
Well, I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where you headed, man?
- South.
You work at that place?
Oh, no.
- How did you get stuck way out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- My uncle works for the slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.
My-my grandfather too.
My family's always been in meat.
A whole family of Draculas.
Hey, man, did you go in that slaughter room?
Where they shoot the cattle with that big air gun?
- Oh, that-that-that gun's no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.
The old way with a sledge.
See, that was better.
They died better that way.
How come?
I thought the gun was better.
Oh, no, no.
With the new way, the people are put out of jobs.
You do that?
Look.
- I was the killer. (laughs)
- Damn.
- (Sally) Let me see them.
- They don't send the heads away.
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah.
Franklin.
See, they make head cheese.
They... they take the head, and they boil it, except for the tongue, and they scrape all the flesh away from the bone.
They use everything.
They don't throw nothing way.
They use the jowls and the muscles and the eyes and ligaments and everything.
- Oh.
- Look at this.
The nose and the gums and all the flesh, and they boil it down into a big jelly of fat.
Wow.
I didn't know that's what was in that stuff.
It's really good.
You like it?
Oh, yeah, sure, I like it.
It's good.
It sounds horrible.
Could we talk about something else?
You'd like it if you didn't know what was in it.
I wouldn't, and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
Oh.
Come on, you're making everybody sick.
Oh, all right.
(chuckles)
(Sally) What are you doing?
Hey, man, put that knife up.
(laughs)
(Sally gasps) Oh!
(Kirk) Oh, come on.
(Sally) Oh!
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh, my God!
Why are you doing that?
(laughing)
Put that away.
(♪ "Fool for a Blonde" plays on radio)
I have this knife.
Put that away, too.
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.
Fold it up.
(chuckles)
Hey, you took my picture.
Hey, you-you could take me to my house.
I live right off this road.
Well, I don't know, man.
We're in pretty much of a hurry.
- How close is it?
- It's real close.
Well, couldn't you just walk?
I mean, if it's so close.
Yeah, you could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese?
My brother makes it real good.
You'll like it.
I think you better push on now.
Don't you, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
(laughs)
It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.
You can pay me now.
- Huh?
Two dollars.
It's a good picture.
No, man.
Franklin, give him back the damn picture.
- He tried to sell him that picture.
- You're kidding?
No, I'm serious.
(screaming)
What are you doing?
(all yelling)
(Kirk) Hey, Jerry, pull us over!
(Franklin) Hey, man, what's up?
What are you doing?
(screaming)
Get out.
(cries)
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm about half ready to call a cop.
That's the last goddamn hitchhiker I ever pick up.
(Pam) Hey, listen to Franklin's horoscope.
Oh, Sally.
"Travel in the country, long-range plans
"and upsetting persons around you
"could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
The events in the world are not doing much either to cheer one up."
- That's just perfect.
- Franklin, I think that will be all right.
And now read Sally's.
She's a Capricorn.
Oh, no.
Capricorn's ruled by Saturn.
"There are moments when we cannot believe that what is happening is true.
Pinch yourself and you may find out that it is."
(♪ country music playing on radio)
Everybody out.
Hurry up, so we can get home.
Here comes somebody.
How are you?
Would you fill her up, please?
I got no gas.
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.
The transport won't be here until late this afternoon, maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
(Franklin) Hey, do you know where the old Franklin place is?
- The old Franklin place?
- Yeah.
It's an old two-story rock house on a hill.
I think you have to turn on that road back there, but I'm not real sure.
Yeah, maybe I seen something like that up that way.
Well, now look, you boys don't want to go messing around no old house.
Those things is dangerous.
You're liable to get hurt.
We'll be careful.
You don't want to go fooling around with other folks' property.
Some folks don't like it, and they don't mind showing you.
- Oh, my father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?
Yeah.
Look, I got some good barbeque here.
Why don't you fellas stick around here a while?
That transport will be by in a little while.
(Jerry) Well, you want to get some barbeque?
Them girls, now, they don't want to go messing around an old house.
It's best you stick around here.
We should've asked if there's another gas station around.
Don't you think he would've told us if there was?
Man, it wouldn't hurt to ask, you know?
OK, I'll go ask.
I knew the hell we should've stopped back there for gas.
- Press it.
- I'm pulling it down.
- There.
- You think this place has room service?
Franklin, you maniac, you're tearing up the van.
Um, yeah, I just started doing that.
Hey, I bet that's some of that guy's blood.
Look at that.
Look at that.
- You think that's blood?
- Yeah, I guess so.
Oh, that's blood, all right.
And that guy cut the hell out of himself.
You think you could do that to yourself?
- I'm not crazy.
- Yeah, yeah.
It takes something, though, I mean just to do that to yourself like he did.
God!
Hey, you think I said something made him mad?
(laughs)
- Well, what?
- Franklin, you're crazier than he was.
Hey, I got us some barbeque.
- Newt's the closest place to get gas.
- (Sally) Aw.
Aren't we going out to Grandpa's place?
There's a creek.
You could go swimming.
(Jerry) Let's go.
Come on, Sally.
We're going to Grandpa's place.
Let's go!
(Sally) Hey, that guy smeared blood all over the van.
- Like he was trying to write something.
- (Franklin) What'd he do?
Did he write something on the van?
Let me see your knife.
Thank you.
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that station, you're towing us back in your chair.
(Sally laughs)
Hey, you think that guy's just trying to scare us by, you know, blowing up my picture like that?
(Sally) Oh, I wish they hadn't let the place fall apart.
(Kirk) It looks like the birth place of Bela Lugosi.
- (Sally) I'm scared.
- I'll help you with that.
- See that window over there?
- That's strange.
(Franklin) Hey, watch my arms.
Watch out.
- Be straight.
Come on.
Hey.
- I'll get you from here.
(Franklin) I want to see that smear that guy made.
- Oh, man.
- Weird.
I wonder if that means something.
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's going to get you.
- Come on.
- Why don't you wash it off?
I want to show you the inside.
- Jerry!
- OK.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Come on, Kirk.
- Here, man, you wash it off.
You don't think that guy would try and follow us?
What for?
Where's my knife?
Kirk?
(Sally laughs)
It looks like it must've been a nursery.
This is my room.
I got to stay here one time when I was eight years old.
- Right after my grandmother died.
- What happened?
- What happened to my grandmother?
- Yeah.
She died.
(girls laughing)
(skittering sound)
(talking and laughing)
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- It's seen better days.
These animals used to talk me to sleep when I was little.
Look at the zebras.
I had these fascination for the zebras.
Sally!
(grunting)
Sally!
(laughing)
Hee-hee-hee-hee, hee-hee-hee-hee.
Hee-hee-hee-hee.
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.
(mimicking) Come on, Franklin.
It's gonna be a fun trip.
If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'm going to be able to take it.
Aah!
Ah!
(sobs)
(raspberries)
(laughing)
- Hey, Franklin.
- Hey, Franklin.
What's wrong?
You said there was a swimming hole around here?
Yeah.
Well, Pam and I would like to go swimming, man.
Uh, there used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
Come on, we'll find it.
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- (Kirk) No.
We'll see you in an hour or so.
Yeah.
We'll see you in about an hour or so.
(rattling sound)
Sally?
Sally!
Zero in the world.
Just shoot him and put us out of our misery.
- Snakes and spiders!
- Stop it!
And scorpions!
Man-eating lizards.
- Kirk, help.
Kirk!
- Ow.
Ow.
Oh.
Crap.
This must be it.
Oh, are you OK?
How the hell did Franklin ever get down here, anyway?
Somebody must've carried him when he was little.
Franklin never was little.
(motor sound)
Gasoline.
I can leave him my guitar, give him a couple bucks.
We're coming back anyway.
I can pick up my guitar, give him a couple more dollars and bring him some gas.
They don't want your guitar.
They won't want to sell us gas.
Let's just go back now.
Hey, come here.
Come here and look at this.
- A generator.
- What?
A generator!
For electricity.
Hey, hello in there!
Is anybody here?
(knocking on door)
Hello, is anybody home?
I got something for you.
Ah!
Ooh!
Let's go!
Hello?
- Hey, Pam, come look at this.
- What?
No!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Hello?
(knocking)
(sound of pig squealing)
Hey, Pam.
(sound of pig squealing)
Hello?
Kirk?
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk.
(rustling)
Kirk?
(rustling)
Kirk?
(chicken clucking)
(coughs and retches)
Oh!
Oh, God!
(cries)
Kirk!
Kirk!
(man screaming)
(Pam screaming)
(chainsaw motor whirs)
(screaming)
(Jerry) He's gonna get you, Franklin.
- You don't think it means anything?
- (Sally) We'll protect you.
- I'll bet it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
- It probably doesn't mean anything, huh?
- You worry too much.
He couldn't find us anyway.
I mean, he doesn't even know our names.
I gave him your name.
I told him where you live.
I even gave him your zip code.
He's gonna kill you.
Jerry.
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife.
When did you have it last?
Well, I didn't have it last.
You had it last.
I gave it to you.
Remember?
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?
No.
I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right, I'll look for it.
I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
How do I get there?
Well, there's a trail down there between them two old sheds.
- Can I go, too?
- I think you'd better stay here.
All right.
I can't find it.
Are you mad at me?
No, I'm not mad at you.
You really are mad, huh?
Oh, I don't blame you.
I'm...
Kirk!
You really didn't want me to come, did you?
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.
Sally, did you believe in all that stuff that Pam was telling about Saturn and retrograde and all that?
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.
Yeah.
You don't think that guy would try and follow us, do you?
Well, I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
He's probably afraid Kirk will kill him.
Sally?
What now?
Nothing.
Never mind.
Kirk!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Damn.
(chicken clucks)
Kirk?
- Are you guys in there?
- (person chuckles)
Hey, guys, quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.
(person laughing)
Pam, is that you?
(person laughing)
OK, you guys.
Come on out.
Come on!
(knocking)
Kirk?
(knocking)
- (man yells) - (Jerry screams)
(yelling)
(chicken clucking)
(honking)
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.
If they're not back in a minute, we've got to go look for them.
Well, what if we get lost, too?
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
(Sally) Jerry!
Jerry!
(Franklin) Jerry!
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
Hey!
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
Sally?
I think we ought to go.
(Sally sighs)
Are the keys in the van?
- Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
- What for?
Let me see the flashlight.
I'll go look for them.
You don't have to go.
Sally, don't go.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I don't think you ought to go.
I'm going to honk the horn one more time.
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No.
Now, I'm gonna honk the horn, and we're gonna wait a minute, and then if they don't come, we'll go.
All right?
Sally, they took the keys.
We don't have any keys.
- They took the keys with them.
- (honking)
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Franklin!
- Jerry took the keys with him!
- Give me that flashlight!
No, Sally, we can't go!
Look, what if they came back and we weren't here?
- Give me that flashlight!
- No, I've got to take the flashlight.
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right, all right, I'll go with you.
No, Sally.
Come on, I'll go with you, but I'm gonna keep the flashlight.
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.
I can't push you down that hill!
Sally, look, I know.
Oh!
- I'll go with you, but I'm going to hold...
- Never mind, I'll just go without it.
All right, all right.
Sally, wait!
Sally, wait a minute!
I'm coming with you.
Sally?
Hold up a minute now.
All right, let's go.
Let's go.
I'll go with you.
Sally, I can't keep up with you.
Sally?
Sally, wait a minute.
(Franklin whimpers)
Hold up.
(Franklin) Jerry!
(Sally) Jerry!
Jerry!
(both) Jerry!
(Franklin) Wait.
- I thought I heard something.
- There's a light.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
(Sally) Oh, it looks like a house.
Well, come on, push.
Come on, push.
Push down.
There. (grunts)
- (Sally) It's a house.
- Yeah?
I can't see it very well.
Oh, Franklin, this is impossible.
Come on, Sally.
Get back and push down.
This is impossible.
I hear something out there.
Look.
- (Franklin) Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!
(Franklin) Jerry!
Sally, I hear something.
Stop.
Stop.
(sound of chainsaw)
(screaming)
Somebody, please!
Help!
Help me, please!
Somebody, help me!
(screaming)
Help!
Please!
Please!
Please help me!
Please!
(screams)
(screaming)
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help me!
Help me!
Oh, God!
Help, help!
Close the door.
Help me.
Whoa, there, whoa, whoa.
- Come over here.
- Somebody's trying to kill me.
Help, help...
Calm down.
You're all right, you're OK.
- Oh, now, take it easy.
- Call the police.
- He might come.
- Now, what happened?
- He... he... he killed...
- Now, now, take it easy.
He killed Franklin.
I don't know.
Call the police!
- Take it easy.
- And Jerry.
I...
I don't-I don't know what happened to the others.
There's nobody out there now.
Come on.
Come on now, take it easy.
Come on, take it easy.
- Oh, please.
- What happened?
Please.
Call the police.
There's no phone here.
We... we have to drive over to Childress.
Yeah, yeah.
Now, you take it easy.
Take it easy now.
I'll get the truck.
- Now, now, take it easy.
Take it easy.
- Don't go.
Take it easy.
(radio announcer) Weather is expected to be warm to partly cloudy tomorrow with no chance of precipitation.
The high today will be in the upper 90s and a low tonight of 81 degrees.
Current temperature is 96 with winds out the southeast at three miles a hour.
Humidity 98, barometer is at 29.9 and rising.
Acting on a tip, the Muerto County sheriff's office began an investigation early this morning in the Muerto County Cemetery opening crypts where there was evidence of tampering.
The sheriff's deputies found a reported dozen coffins robbed of their contents.
According to the sheriff, there were cadavers in which the heads and extremities were removed, and others in which only a hand or foot had been removed.
Maldonado has information linking the robberies to a large and well-organized West Coast jewel theft ring but declined to suggest any reason for them to mutilate the cadavers.
(news report continues indistinct)
(Sally crying and gasping)
- What are you doing?
- You ain't got no need to worry.
No!
You just cooperate, young lady, and we'll have no trouble.
- Now, listen...
- What do you want?
Now, there's no need to do that.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
No!
(screaming)
(man laughs)
No!
No!
No!
(screams)
(stops screaming)
(Sally groans)
(starts engine)
(turns off engine)
(chuckles)
Had to lock up and get the lights.
Cost of electricity is enough to drive a man out of business.
(starts engine)
(Sally whimpers)
(muffled crying)
(muffled screaming)
Uh, I hope you're not too uncomfortable down there.
(muffled screaming)
You got nothing to worry about.
You just take it easy, and we'll be there soon.
(laughs)
(muffled crying)
Now, now, now, now.
There's no need to do that, no.
(Sally whimpering)
(laughing)
We'll be over this in a bit.
Hang on.
Halfwits.
Little coon shits.
- Come here, you nap-haired idiot!
- (grunts)
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.
You damn fool, you almost got caught over at Duke's.
No, no, they didn't see me.
They don't know nothing.
I told you to stay away from that graveyard!
(starts engine)
I told you and I told you,
I told you never to leave your brother alone, you...
Get in there and get that girl out of the car.
Come on, get her out of the car.
- Get her out of there.
- (Sally screaming)
Hopefully your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.
Get her in there.
We'll have the whole county out here.
Don't you got any self-respect?
Look what your brother did to the door!
He's got no pride in his home?
Get her in there.
You've been a fool, you!
You better get them other kids.
Where are they, huh?
(screaming)
You're a damn fool, you.
- (screaming) - (laughing)
Oh!
I thought you was in a hurry.
Where are the kids?
Where are they?
Show me!
(Leatherface explaining)
- None of 'em get away?
- Uh-uh-uh.
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.
You...
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!
(screaming)
Hey, you did good.
She's a nice girl.
You nitwit, get upstairs and get your grandpa.
Now, now, young lady, you just take it easy there now.
Look, we'll fix you some supper in a few minutes.
Huh?
Get back in there!
Get in there!
Now, you just take it easy.
Take it easy.
We'll have you something to eat right away.
Hey.
Hey, Leatherface.
Give me a hand with Grandpa.
Careful.
(muffled cries)
Look, Grandpa, look, look.
Here, here!
(screaming)
(flies buzzing)
(dishes and utensils clanking)
(screaming)
(howling)
Shut up!
Quiet!
You act like a pack of hounds.
We were just having fun.
You think this is a party?
Please.
You can make them stop.
No, he can't. (laughs)
Shut your mouths.
Can't be helped, young lady.
- Oh, please, you can't let them kill me.
- Shut up.
Don't pay him no mind.
(sobbing)
- You like this face?
- (screaming)
You're crazy!
You've got to make them stop!
Please!
He's nothing.
He's just the cook.
Shut up, you bitch hog.
Me and Leatherface do all the work.
He don't like it.
Ain't that right?
You're just the cook!
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand nothing.
I understand you ain't nothing.
Me and him do all the work!
I just can't take no pleasure in killing.
Well, there's just some things you got to do.
Don't mean you have to like it.
Oh, please.
Please.
What do you want?
I'll do anything.
Anything.
(laughs)
I'll do...
I'll do anything you want.
(Sally continues screaming)
Don't need to torture the poor girl.
You just shut up!
Remember you're just the cook, and me and him will handle this.
Then get on with it.
I won't have this.
We ain't in no hurry because you ain't going no place.
No.
You hear me?
It might hurt you, but it don't mean much.
No sense in waiting.
I got to open up the room.
I been...
I been thinking about letting Grandpa have some fun.
You always said he's the best.
He's the best, all right.
Let's let him have a whack.
Hey, Grandpa, we going to let you have this one.
Just let him have a whack.
Now, you just hush.
It won't hurt none.
Why, old Grandpa is the best killer there ever was.
Why, it never took more than one lick, they say.
Why, he did 60 in five minutes once.
They say he could've done more if the hook and pull gang could've gotten the beeves out of the way faster.
Now, now, don't you cry none.
Old Grandpa's the best.
It won't hurt a bit.
(screams)
No!
No!
(screams)
No!
No!
No!
Oh, please don't!
Please!
Please!
Please don't!
No, no!
No!
(screaming)
No!
Hit her, Grandpa!
(screaming)
Hit her, Grandpa!
Hit her!
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her!
Hit that bitch.
Hit her, Grandpa!
Come on!
Come on, Grandpa, hit that bitch.
Careful there.
Come on, Grandpa.
Get her Grandpa, get her.
Go ahead, go ahead!
Get her!
Come on.
- Give me the hammer.
I'll get her.
- Get her, get her, Grandpa.
- Give me that hammer.
- Hit her, hit her, Grandpa.
- I'll kill her.
Let me get her.
- Hit the bitch.
(chainsaw sound)
(screaming)
(truck horn)
(screams) Help!
(screaming)
(screams)
Help!
Go!
Go

The head, or in some cases... the extremities removed, and... the remainder of the corpse left intact.
Evidence indicates the... robberies have occurred over a period of time.
Sheriff Rhesus Maldonado refuses to give details... in this case and said only... that he did have a strong evidence linking the crime to... elements outside the state.
Area residents have reportedly... converged on the cemetery claiming the remains of relatives have been removed.
No suspects are in custody, as investigation at the scene... continues.
...mental hospital and released.

Franklin!
Are you ok?
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take...
- much more of this.
- The condition of retro gradation... is contrary or inharmonious to the regular direction of actual... movement in the zodiac, and is, in that respect, evil.
Hint:
When malefic planets are in retrograde, and Saturn is malefic... their maleficies are increased.
Have you been doing that Reader's Digest worth our...
Jerry, it just means Saturn's a bad influence.
It's just particularly... bad influence now, because it's in retrograde.
Hey, man, do you believe all that stuff your old lady is talking me?
My granddaddy is buried here.
Can we find out if anything happened?
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- See that big heavy fella... standing with that big flashlight, isn't that the sheriff?
You go tell him your granddaddy is buried in there.
He'll let you in.
Ok.
Thank you.
Hey, fella, I'm gonna run off to...
- meet him if you don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.
- Hey, folks.
Let us go see where... her granddaddy's buried.
Things happen here about they don't tell about.
I see things.
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
You laugh at an old man... this thing that laughs knows better.
Yes, they're sure.
The man said the Tallman's grave had been dug up.
Mama, don't worry.
I saw it myself!
It didn't look dug up to me.
What's that?
What smell?
What is that stench?
Hey.
That's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used... to sell his cattle!
We got an uncle that works in one of those places... outside of Fortworth.
See those buildings there?
That's where... they kill him.
They bash'em in the head with a big sledgehammer!
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill him.
It'd start squealing and freaking out, they'd have to... come up and bash'em 2 or 3 times.
They'd scatter them before they were even dead.
That's horrible!
People shouldn't kill animals for food.
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they get this big air gun... that shoots a bullet into the skull and then retracts it.
Franklin, I like me, please change the subject.
That smell's still going on.
Oh, man!
It's hot in here.
- Hitchhiker!
- Should we take him up?
Yeah man, pick him up.
He'll asphyxiate out there!
- What does he look like?
- The son of a bitch 's gonna...
- smell like the slaughterhouse.
- Give the guy a break.
He can...
- sit by Franklin.
- What do you wanna do?
- He's weird looking, no.
- I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where're you heading, man?
- You work at that place?
- Don't.
- How did you get stuck out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- I got an uncle that works...
- at a slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.
My grandfather, too.
My family's always been in beef.
The whole family are cracked.
Hey man, did you go into that... slaughter room or whatever they call it?
Where they shoot the cattle with that air gun thing?
- That gun is no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.
With the sledge!
That was better.
- They died better that way.
- How come?
I thought the gun...
- was better.
- Oh no.
With the new way...
- people were put out of jobs.
- You do that?
- Look!
- I was the killer!
- Let me see them.
- They don't seem to head your way.
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah!
- Franklin.
- Let me see.
- They make hitches...
They take the head and they boil, except for the tongue, and scrape... all the flesh away from the bone.
They use everything, they throw nothing away.
They use jaws, muscles, and the eyes, and the ligaments...
- and everything!
- Look at this.
- They boil the nose and the gums down to a big jelly of fat.
I don't know it was in that stuff.
It's really good.
Do you like it?
- Yeah, I like it.
It's good!
- It sounds horrible.
Can't we...
- talk about something else?
- You'd probably like it if you... didn't know what was in it.
I wouldn't and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
Take it before everybody's sick.
What are you doing?
Look.
I think that might hurt.
Oh, come on!
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh, what are you doing?
Nice, man!
I have this knife.
Put that away, too.
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.
Put it back.
You took my picture!
You can take me to my house.
I live right off this road.
I don't know, man.
We're in much of a hurry.
- How close is it?
- It's real close.
Couldn't you just walk?
I mean...
If it's so close.
You could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese.
My brother...
- makes it real good.
You'll like it.
- I think we'd better push on, man.
Don't we, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry...
- It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.
- You can pay me now.
- Huh?
- 2 dollars.
It's a good picture.
- No, man.
Franklin... give him back that picture.
I'm about to freak.
Call a cop.
That's the last damn hitchhiker I ever take.
- Listen to Franklin's horoscope:
- I'm sorry.
Travel in the countryside.
Long range plans, upsetting persons... around you, could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
The events in the world are not doing much, to cheer one up.
- That's just perfect!
- Franklin, I think you'll be alright.
Hey, Kat, read Alex's.
He's Capricorn.
Oh, no.
Capricorn is ruled by Saturn.
There are moments where we... cannot believe that what's happening is really true... pinch yourself and you may find out that it is.
Hurry up.
Here comes somebody.
How are you?
Would you fill her up, please?
I got no gas.
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.
Transport won't... be here until this afternoon.
Maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
Hey, you know where "The Old Franklin Place" is?
- "The Old Franklin Place"?
- It's an old 2-story house and... it's sitting up on the hill.
I think you have to turn on the road... back there, but I'm not real sure.
Maybe I've seen something like that up there.
But look, you boys... don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Those things are dangerous, you're bound to get hurt!
- We'll be careful.
- Don't wanna go fooling around... other folk's property.
Some folks don't like it.
They don't mind showing you.
- My father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?
- Yeah.
- Look...
I got barbecue here.
Why don't you stay a while?
The transport will be by in a little while...
I can go and get some barbecue.
Them girls, they don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Best you stick around here.
We should've asked him if there's another gas station around here.
Don't you think he would have told us if there was?
- It wouldn't hurt to ask.
- I'll go ask.
What the hell, we should have stopped back there for gas.
Go, damn it.
There.
You think this place has room service?
Franklin, you're cutting the van!
Yeah, I just started doing that.
I bet this is some of that guy's blood.
Look at that.
- Think it's his blood?
- I guess so.
That's blood, alright.
And I got cut the hell out of him, chef.
You think you could do that to yourself?
Crazy?
It takes something, though, I mean, do that to yourself, like he did.
You think I said something that made him mad?
- What?
- Franklin, you're crazy as he was.
Hey, I got us some barbecue.
Newt's the closest place to get gas.
We're going to that Granpa's place.
There's a creek, you can go swimming.
Come on, Sally, we're going to that Granpa's place!
- Let's go.
- Hey, that guy smeared blood...
- all over the van.
- Let's not waste time to wipe this up.
What?
What did you do?
You're in someone's van?
Let me see your knife.
Thank you.
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that service... station, you're towing us back in that chair.
Hey...
You think that guy was just trying to scare us by blowing out... my picture like that?
Oh, look, they let the place fall apart.
Put it over there.
- Wanna go over there?
- Let's go.
Oh, Kirk, come on!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I want to see the smear the guy made.
This is weird.
I wonder if that means something.
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's gonna get you.
- Why don't you wash it off, ok?
- I want to see inside.
- Jerry!
- Ok!
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- Get it.
You wash it up.
- You don't think that guy...
- is trying to follow us, do you?
- What for?
Where's my knife?
Kirk?
Looks like it must have been a nursery room.
This was my room.
I got to stay here until I was 8 years old.
- Until my grandmother died.
- What happened?
- To my grandmother?
- Yeah, she died.
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- I think it's seen better days...
These animals would to put me to sleep when I was a little girl.
Look at the zebra.
I had this fascination for the zebras...
Kate?
Sally!
Come on, Franklin!
It's gonna be a fun trip.
If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'll take it!
- Hey, Franklin!
- What's wrong?
Didn't you say there was a swimming well out here?
Pam and I would like to go swimming in there.
There used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
Come on.
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- We'll see them in an hour or so.
Yeah.
See them down in about an hour or so.
Sally!
Sally...
Seed growing in the world...
I don't want to miss it.
Man, a scorpion, there's a scorpion!
Crap!
This must be it!
Are you ok?
What the hell, Franklin would never get down here anyway.
I bet he must have when he was little.
Franklin never was little.
Gasoline.
I can leave my guitar, you know, I'd give him a couple of bucks...
We gotta come back by here anyway, I can pick up my guitar and... give him a couple more dollars and we get more gas...
He won't want your guitar, he's not gonna sell us some gas... let's just go back now.
Hey, come here!
Come here, look at this.
- A generator!
- What?
A generator!
For electricity!
Hey, hello!
Is there anybody in the house?
Hello!
Is anybody home?
I got something for you.
Let's go!
Hello?
Hello?
- Come look at this!
- Let's go!
Hello!
Anybody home?
Hello?
Hey, Pam!
Hello!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk?
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
He's coming to get you!
You don't think it means anything?
We'll protect you if he tries to get you.
- Maybe it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- You worry too much.
He couldn't find us, anyway.
He doesn't even know our names.
I gave him your name, Franklin.
And I told him where you lived.
I even gave him your ZIP code.
He's gonna kill you.
Jerry...
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife, remember?
When did you have it last?
I didn't have it last.
You had it last.
I gave it to you, remember?
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?
No, I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right.
I'll look for it.
Listen, I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
How do I get there, Frank?
Well, there's a trail down there.
Between the two old sheds.
- Can I go too?
- I think you'd better stay here.
All right.
I can't find it.
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.
You really are mad, huh?
I don't blame you.
Kirk!
You really didn't want me to come, did you?
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.
Did you believe all that stuff Pam was telling about?
Saturn, and retrograde, and all that?
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.
You don't think that guy is trying to follow us, do you?
I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
He'd probably find Kirk and kill him.
- Sally...
- What now?
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kirk!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Damn.
Kirk!
Are you guys in there?
Hey, guys!
Quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.
Pam, is that you?
Okay, you guys!
Come on out.
Come on!
Kirk?
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.
If they 're not back in a minute, we'd better go look for them
What if we get lost, too?
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Hey!
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
Sally...
I think we ought to go.
Are the keys in the van?
Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
What for?
Let me see the flashlight.
I'm gonna go look for them.
You don't have to go.
Sally, no, I don't think that's a good idea, Sally.
I don't think you ought to go.
Look, I'm gonna honk the horn one more time.
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No, I'm gonna honk the horn... and we will wait a minute, and they will come and we will go.
All right?
Sally, they took the keys!
We don't have any keys!
They took the keys!
Stop it!
Stop it!
- Now give me the flashlight!
- No, Sally!
You can't go!
What if they came back and we weren't here?
- Franklin, give me that flashlight!
- I'll keep the flashlight!
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right!
All right!
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you, all right?
I'll go with you, but I'll keep the flashlight.
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.
I can't push you down the hill!
Sally...
- Look, I'll go with you...
- Never mind, I'll go without it.
All right.
Sally, wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.
Sally!
Hold on a minute now.
All right, let's go.
Let's go, I'll go with you.
Sally, I can't keep up with you!
Sally!
Sally, wait a minute!
Hold on!
Jerry!
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
I thought I heard something.
There's a light!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- It looks like a house.
- Come on, push!
- It's a house!
- I can't see it very well.
- Franklin, this is impossible.
- Come on, Sally!
Get back and push, damn!
Impossible!
I heard something over there!
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!
Sally, I hear something.
Stop!
Stop!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help me, please!
- Help!
Help!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Help me!
Help me!
- Come over here!
You're all right, girl.
Okay?
Hold on, take it easy, all right?
He killed...
- Take it easy...
- He killed Franklin...
Call the police!
Jerry!
I don't know what happened to the others...
There's nobody out there now!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
What happened?
- Call the police...
- There's no phone here.
We have to drive to the sheriff's.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
I'll get the truck.
- Take it easy.
Take it easy.
- Don't go!
Don't go!
The weather is expected to continue warm and clear... and partially cloudy tomorrow... with no chance of precipitation.

Acting on a typical day with some news... the word is that the sheriff's office began an investigation... early this morning in the County Cemetery.
Opening crypts and muslins where there was evidence of... tampering, The Sheriff found a reported dozen coffins were... robbed a part of its contents.
According to the sheriff, Rhesus...
Maldonado, there are ones from which only the head and... extremities are removed, and others and others from which only a hand or foot removed, with the... remainder of the cadaver left intact.
Maldonado linked...
What are you doing?
- You will come with me...
- No!
- What do you want?
- There's no need to do that...
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I had to lock up and get the lights off.
Because electricity is enough to drive a man out of business.
I hope you're not too uncomfortable down there.
You got nothing to worry about.
Just take it easy.
We're gonna get there soon.
No, no, no.
There's no need to do that.
We always do our best.
Hang on.
No.
Half witch.
You little shit!
You knock-head idiot!
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.
You damn fool!
You almost got caught.
No!
They didn't see me.
They don't know nothing!
I told you to stay away from that graveyard.
I told you...
I told you never to leave your brother alone!
Get that girl out of the car!
Get her out!
I hope your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.
Look at what your brother did to that door!
You let her go!
You goddamn idiot!
I thought you were in a hurry.
Where are the kids?
Where are the children?
Did they get away?
Are you sure?
You...
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!
Hey, come here!
Look!
See how nice she looks!
Get upstairs and get your grandpa!
Take it easy there, huh?
You'll stay here for a few minutes.
Get back in there!
To the chamber!
You just take it easy.
We'll have something to eat right away.
Hey, you two!
Give me a hand with grandpa!
Look, grandpa!
Look!
Knock it off!
Quiet!
You act like a pack of hounds.
- We're just having fun!
- You think this is a party?
Please!
You can make them stop!
- No shit?
- Shut your mouth!
Can't be helped, young lady.
Please!
You can't let them kill me!
He likes this face.
He's crazy!
You gotta make him stop!
Please...
- He's just a cook!
- Shut up, you bitch hog!
He always does all the work.
He don't like it.
Is that right?
You're just a cook!
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand nothing.
I understand you ain't nothing!
We do all the work!
I just can take no pleasure in killing.
It's just something we gotta do.
It don't mean you have to like it.
Please...
Please...
I'll do anything you want.
You don't need to torture the girl.
Please, shut up.
Remember you're just a cook.
Let me and him handle this.
I won't have this.
You ain't in no hurry.
And you ain't going no place.
You don't hear me?
I heard you told me much.
No sense in waiting.
I gotta go to my room.
I'll take her to grandpa.
Grandpa'll have some fun.
You always said he was the best.
He's the best all right.
Let's let him half leg.
Grandpa, we're gonna let you... have this one!
Have this one!
He won't use you much.
He won't hurt none.
Our grandpa was the best killer there ever was.
I never took all the guts to see.
I did in 6 in 5 minutes once.
I could've done more if the hook pulled again could've gotten the... beaves out of the way faster.
Now don't you cry.
Grandpa is the best.
It won't hurt a bit.
No!
No!
Please!
Don't!
Hit her!
Hit the bitch!
Go ahead!
Give me the hammer!
Give me the hammer!
I'll kill her!
Go!
Go!
...this inditement is only one of a series to be handed down... as result of the respectful rangery investigation.
Ray Robbin, in Texas, is this hour top news story... and informant led officers at Marto County sheriff... department, to a cemetery, just outside the small rude Texas... community of Newt, early this morning.
Officers there... discovered what appeared to be a grizzly work of art...
The remains of a badly decomposed body, wired to a... large monument.
A second body was found in the ditch near... the perimeter of the cemetery, subsequent investigation has... revealed at least a dozen empty crypts, and it's clear more... will turn up as the probe continues deputies report... that in some instances, only parts of the corpses have been... removed.
The head, or in some cases... the extremities removed, and... the remainder of the corpse left intact.
Evidence indicates the... robberies have occurred over a period of time.
Sheriff Rhesus Maldonado refuses to give details... in this case and said only... that he did have a strong evidence linking the crime to... elements outside the state.
Area residents have reportedly... converged on the cemetery claiming the remains of relatives have been removed.
No suspects are in custody, as investigation at the scene... continues.
...mental hospital and released.
A 16-story-building downtown...
Atlanta, collapsed today, killing at least 29 persons.
The engineering firm responsible could offer no explanation for... the collapse although the construction firm say there's... no logical reason for the collapse is suspected sabotage.
Police in Gary, Indiana, have been unable to identify the... bodies of a young man... and four children who had... their features carved away, the man's dimples had been... removed.
Police first identified the victims as 2 women... continuing the program of the government to overwhelm reaches... beyond the Amazon today are ruptured into violence... forces of at least three South America governments already... have been involved.

...Police in Dallas arrested a young couple today... complaints by neighbors led them to discover a 18-month-old daughter the couple... chained in the attic of a dilapidated house...
Franklin!
Are you ok?
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take...
- much more of this.
- The condition of retro gradation... is contrary or inharmonious to the regular direction of actual... movement in the zodiac, and is, in that respect, evil.
Hint:
When malefic planets are in retrograde, and Saturn is malefic... their maleficies are increased.
Have you been doing that Reader's Digest worth our...
Jerry, it just means Saturn's a bad influence.
It's just particularly... bad influence now, because it's in retrograde.
Hey, man, do you believe all that stuff your old lady is talking me?
My granddaddy is buried here.
Can we find out if anything happened?
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- See that big heavy fella... standing with that big flashlight, isn't that the sheriff?
You go tell him your granddaddy is buried in there.
He'll let you in.
Ok.
Thank you.
Hey, fella, I'm gonna run off to...
- meet him if you don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.
- Hey, folks.
Let us go see where... her granddaddy's buried.
Things happen here about they don't tell about.
I see things.
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
You laugh at an old man... this thing that laughs knows better.
Yes, they're sure.
The man said the Tallman's grave had been dug up.
Mama, don't worry.
I saw it myself!
It didn't look dug up to me.
What's that?
What smell?
What is that stench?
Hey.
That's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used... to sell his cattle!
We got an uncle that works in one of those places... outside of Fortworth.
See those buildings there?
That's where... they kill him.
They bash'em in the head with a big sledgehammer!
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill him.
It'd start squealing and freaking out, they'd have to... come up and bash'em 2 or 3 times.
They'd scatter them before they were even dead.
That's horrible!
People shouldn't kill animals for food.
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they get this big air gun... that shoots a bullet into the skull and then retracts it.
Franklin, I like me, please change the subject.
That smell's still going on.
Oh, man!
It's hot in here.
- Hitchhiker!
- Should we take him up?
Yeah man, pick him up.
He'll asphyxiate out there!
- What does he look like?
- The son of a bitch 's gonna...
- smell like the slaughterhouse.
- Give the guy a break.
He can...
- sit by Franklin.
- What do you wanna do?
- He's weird looking, no.
- I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where're you heading, man?
- You work at that place?
- Don't.
- How did you get stuck out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- I got an uncle that works...
- at a slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.
My grandfather, too.
My family's always been in beef.
The whole family are cracked.
Hey man, did you go into that... slaughter room or whatever they call it?
Where they shoot the cattle with that air gun thing?
- That gun is no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.
With the sledge!
That was better.
- They died better that way.
- How come?
I thought the gun...
- was better.
- Oh no.
With the new way...
- people were put out of jobs.
- You do that?
- Look!
- I was the killer!
- Let me see them.
- They don't seem to head your way.
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah!
- Franklin.
- Let me see.
- They make hitches...
They take the head and they boil, except for the tongue, and scrape... all the flesh away from the bone.
They use everything, they throw nothing away.
They use jaws, muscles, and the eyes, and the ligaments...
- and everything!
- Look at this.
- They boil the nose and the gums down to a big jelly of fat.
I don't know it was in that stuff.
It's really good.
Do you like it?
- Yeah, I like it.
It's good!
- It sounds horrible.
Can't we...
- talk about something else?
- You'd probably like it if you... didn't know what was in it.
I wouldn't and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
Take it before everybody's sick.
What are you doing?
Look.
I think that might hurt.
Oh, come on!
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh, what are you doing?
Nice, man!
I have this knife.
Put that away, too.
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.
Put it back.
You took my picture!
You can take me to my house.
I live right off this road.
I don't know, man.
We're in much of a hurry.
- How close is it?
- It's real close.
Couldn't you just walk?
I mean...
If it's so close.
You could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese.
My brother...
- makes it real good.
You'll like it.
- I think we'd better push on, man.
Don't we, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry...
- It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.
- You can pay me now.
- Huh?
- 2 dollars.
It's a good picture.
- No, man.
Franklin... give him back that picture.
I'm about to freak.
Call a cop.
That's the last damn hitchhiker I ever take.
- Listen to Franklin's horoscope:
- I'm sorry.
Travel in the countryside.
Long range plans, upsetting persons... around you, could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
The events in the world are not doing much, to cheer one up.
- That's just perfect!
- Franklin, I think you'll be alright.
Hey, Kat, read Alex's.
He's Capricorn.
Oh, no.
Capricorn is ruled by Saturn.
There are moments where we... cannot believe that what's happening is really true... pinch yourself and you may find out that it is.
Hurry up.
Here comes somebody.
How are you?
Would you fill her up, please?
I got no gas.
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.
Transport won't... be here until this afternoon.
Maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
Hey, you know where "The Old Franklin Place" is?
- "The Old Franklin Place"?
- It's an old 2-story house and... it's sitting up on the hill.
I think you have to turn on the road... back there, but I'm not real sure.
Maybe I've seen something like that up there.
But look, you boys... don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Those things are dangerous, you're bound to get hurt!
- We'll be careful.
- Don't wanna go fooling around... other folk's property.
Some folks don't like it.
They don't mind showing you.
- My father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?
- Yeah.
- Look...
I got barbecue here.
Why don't you stay a while?
The transport will be by in a little while...
I can go and get some barbecue.
Them girls, they don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Best you stick around here.
We should've asked him if there's another gas station around here.
Don't you think he would have told us if there was?
- It wouldn't hurt to ask.
- I'll go ask.
What the hell, we should have stopped back there for gas.
Go, damn it.
There.
You think this place has room service?
Franklin, you're cutting the van!
Yeah, I just started doing that.
I bet this is some of that guy's blood.
Look at that.
- Think it's his blood?
- I guess so.
That's blood, alright.
And I got cut the hell out of him, chef.
You think you could do that to yourself?
Crazy?
It takes something, though, I mean, do that to yourself, like he did.
You think I said something that made him mad?
- What?
- Franklin, you're crazy as he was.
Hey, I got us some barbecue.
Newt's the closest place to get gas.
We're going to that Granpa's place.
There's a creek, you can go swimming.
Come on, Sally, we're going to that Granpa's place!
- Let's go.
- Hey, that guy smeared blood...
- all over the van.
- Let's not waste time to wipe this up.
What?
What did you do?
You're in someone's van?
Let me see your knife.
Thank you.
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that service... station, you're towing us back in that chair.
Hey...
You think that guy was just trying to scare us by blowing out... my picture like that?
Oh, look, they let the place fall apart.
Put it over there.
- Wanna go over there?
- Let's go.
Oh, Kirk, come on!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I want to see the smear the guy made.
This is weird.
I wonder if that means something.
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's gonna get you.
- Why don't you wash it off, ok?
- I want to see inside.
- Jerry!
- Ok!
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- Get it.
You wash it up.
- You don't think that guy...
- is trying to follow us, do you?
- What for?
Where's my knife?
Kirk?
Looks like it must have been a nursery room.
This was my room.
I got to stay here until I was 8 years old.
- Until my grandmother died.
- What happened?
- To my grandmother?
- Yeah, she died.
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- I think it's seen better days...
These animals would to put me to sleep when I was a little girl.
Look at the zebra.
I had this fascination for the zebras...
Kate?
Sally!
Come on, Franklin!
It's gonna be a fun trip.
If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'll take it!
- Hey, Franklin!
- What's wrong?
Didn't you say there was a swimming well out here?
Pam and I would like to go swimming in there.
There used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
Come on.
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- We'll see them in an hour or so.
Yeah.
See them down in about an hour or so.
Sally!
Sally...
Seed growing in the world...
I don't want to miss it.
Man, a scorpion, there's a scorpion!
Crap!
This must be it!
Are you ok?
What the hell, Franklin would never get down here anyway.
I bet he must have when he was little.
Franklin never was little.
Gasoline.
I can leave my guitar, you know, I'd give him a couple of bucks...
We gotta come back by here anyway, I can pick up my guitar and... give him a couple more dollars and we get more gas...
He won't want your guitar, he's not gonna sell us some gas... let's just go back now.
Hey, come here!
Come here, look at this.
- A generator!
- What?
A generator!
For electricity!
Hey, hello!
Is there anybody in the house?
Hello!
Is anybody home?
I got something for you.
Let's go!
Hello?
Hello?
- Come look at this!
- Let's go!
Hello!
Anybody home?
Hello?
Hey, Pam!
Hello!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk?
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
He's coming to get you!
You don't think it means anything?
We'll protect you if he tries to get you.
- Maybe it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- You worry too much.
He couldn't find us, anyway.
He doesn't even know our names.
I gave him your name, Franklin.
And I told him where you lived.
I even gave him your ZIP code.
He's gonna kill you.
Jerry...
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife, remember?
When did you have it last?
I didn't have it last.
You had it last.
I gave it to you, remember?
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?
No, I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right.
I'll look for it.
Listen, I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
How do I get there, Frank?
Well, there's a trail down there.
Between the two old sheds.
- Can I go too?
- I think you'd better stay here.
All right.
I can't find it.
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.
You really are mad, huh?
I don't blame you.
Kirk!
You really didn't want me to come, did you?
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.
Did you believe all that stuff Pam was telling about?
Saturn, and retrograde, and all that?
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.
You don't think that guy is trying to follow us, do you?
I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
He'd probably find Kirk and kill him.
- Sally...
- What now?
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kirk!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Damn.
Kirk!
Are you guys in there?
Hey, guys!
Quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.
Pam, is that you?
Okay, you guys!
Come on out.
Come on!
Kirk?
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.
If they 're not back in a minute, we'd better go look for them
What if we get lost, too?
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Hey!
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
Sally...
I think we ought to go.
Are the keys in the van?
Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
What for?
Let me see the flashlight.
I'm gonna go look for them.
You don't have to go.
Sally, no, I don't think that's a good idea, Sally.
I don't think you ought to go.
Look, I'm gonna honk the horn one more time.
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No, I'm gonna honk the horn... and we will wait a minute, and they will come and we will go.
All right?
Sally, they took the keys!
We don't have any keys!
They took the keys!
Stop it!
Stop it!
- Now give me the flashlight!
- No, Sally!
You can't go!
What if they came back and we weren't here?
- Franklin, give me that flashlight!
- I'll keep the flashlight!
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right!
All right!
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you, all right?
I'll go with you, but I'll keep the flashlight.
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.
I can't push you down the hill!
Sally...
- Look, I'll go with you...
- Never mind, I'll go without it.
All right.
Sally, wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.
Sally!
Hold on a minute now.
All right, let's go.
Let's go, I'll go with you.
Sally, I can't keep up with you!
Sally!
Sally, wait a minute!
Hold on!
Jerry!
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
I thought I heard something.
There's a light!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- It looks like a house.
- Come on, push!
- It's a house!
- I can't see it very well.
- Franklin, this is impossible.
- Come on, Sally!
Get back and push, damn!
Impossible!
I heard something over there!
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!
Sally, I hear something.
Stop!
Stop!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help me, please!
- Help!
Help!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Help me!
Help me!
- Come over here!
You're all right, girl.
Okay?
Hold on, take it easy, all right?
He killed...
- Take it easy...
- He killed Franklin...
Call the police!
Jerry!
I don't know what happened to the others...
There's nobody out there now!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
What happened?
- Call the police...
- There's no phone here.
We have to drive to the sheriff's.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
I'll get the truck.
- Take it easy.
Take it easy.
- Don't go!
Don't go!

Acting on a typical day with some news... the word is that the sheriff's office began an investigation... early this morning in the County Cemetery.
Opening crypts and muslins where there was evidence of... tampering, The Sheriff found a reported dozen coffins were... robbed a part of its contents.
According to the sheriff, Rhesus...
Maldonado, there are ones from which only the head and... extremities are removed, and others and others from which only a hand or foot removed, with the... remainder of the cadaver left intact.
Maldonado linked...
What are you doing?
- You will come with me...
- No!
- What do you want?
- There's no need to do that...
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I had to lock up and get the lights off.
Because electricity is enough to drive a man out of business.
I hope you're not too uncomfortable down there.
You got nothing to worry about.
Just take it easy.
We're gonna get there soon.
No, no, no.
There's no need to do that.
We always do our best.
Hang on.
No.
Half witch.
You little shit!
You knock-head idiot!
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.
You damn fool!
You almost got caught.
No!
They didn't see me.
They don't know nothing!
I told you to stay away from that graveyard.
I told you...
I told you never to leave your brother alone!
Get that girl out of the car!
Get her out!
I hope your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.
Look at what your brother did to that door!
You let her go!
You goddamn idiot!
I thought you were in a hurry.
Where are the kids?
Where are the children?
Did they get away?
Are you sure?
You...
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!
Hey, come here!
Look!
See how nice she looks!
Get upstairs and get your grandpa!
Take it easy there, huh?
You'll stay here for a few minutes.
Get back in there!
To the chamber!
You just take it easy.
We'll have something to eat right away.
Hey, you two!
Give me a hand with grandpa!
Look, grandpa!
Look!
Knock it off!
Quiet!
You act like a pack of hounds.
- We're just having fun!
- You think this is a party?
Please!
You can make them stop!
- No shit?
- Shut your mouth!
Can't be helped, young lady.
Please!
You can't let them kill me!
He likes this face.
He's crazy!
You gotta make him stop!
Please...
- He's just a cook!
- Shut up, you bitch hog!
He always does all the work.
He don't like it.
Is that right?
You're just a cook!
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand nothing.
I understand you ain't nothing!
We do all the work!
I just can take no pleasure in killing.
It's just something we gotta do.
It don't mean you have to like it.
Please...
Please...
I'll do anything you want.
You don't need to torture the girl.
Please, shut up.
Remember you're just a cook.
Let me and him handle this.
I won't have this.
You ain't in no hurry.
And you ain't going no place.
You don't hear me?
I heard you told me much.
No sense in waiting.
I gotta go to my room.
I'll take her to grandpa.
Grandpa'll have some fun.
You always said he was the best.
He's the best all right.
Let's let him half leg.
Grandpa, we're gonna let you... have this one!
Have this one!
He won't use you much.
He won't hurt none.
Our grandpa was the best killer there ever was.
I never took all the guts to see.
I did in 6 in 5 minutes once.
I could've done more if the hook pulled again could've gotten the... beaves out of the way faster.
Now don't you cry.
Grandpa is the best.
It won't hurt a bit.
No!
No!
Please!
Don't!
Hit her!
Hit the bitch!
Go ahead!
Give me the hammer!
Give me the hammer!
I'll kill her!
Go!
Go!
It is believed that the indictment is only one of a series to be handed down as the result of a special grand jury investigation.
Graverobbing in Texas is this hour's top news story.
An informant led officers of the Muerto County Sheriff's Department to a cemetery just outside the small rural Texas community of Newt early this morning.
Officers there discovered what appeared to be a grisly work of art, the remains of a badly decomposed body wired to a large monument.
A second body was found in a ditch near the perimeter of the cemetery.
Subsequent investigation has revealed at least a dozen empty crypts, and it's feared more will turn up as the probe continues.
Deputies report that in some instances, only parts of a corpse had been removed, the head or in some cases the extremities removed, the remainder of the corpse left intact.
Evidence indicates the robberies have occurred over a period of time.
Sheriff Jesus Maldonado refused to give details of the ghoulish case and said only that he did have strong evidence linking the crime to elements outside the state.
Area residents have reportedly converged on the cemetery, fearing the remains of relatives have been removed.
No suspects are in custody, as the investigation at the scene continues.
Oil storage units continue to burn out of control at the huge Texaco refinery near the Texas-Louisiana border.
Three storage units exploded into flames during the night, killing at least three workers and injuring a dozen more.
Fire-fighting units in three Texas cities continue to battle the holocaust, in an effort to confine 40-foot flames.
Smoke from the fire is visible to Houston residents some 60 miles to the south.
Health officials in San Francisco reluctantly admit they may have a cholera epidemic on their hands.
Some 40 cases of the highly infectious disease have been confirmed.

Houston police are puzzled over an outbreak of violence apparently touched off by a suicide.
A young man, reportedly angered by a local television blackout of a sports event, jumped from the tenth-story window of his apartment.

The lieutenant was treated for minor wounds at the hospital and released.
A 16-story building under construction in downtown Atlanta collapsed today, killing at least 29 persons.
The engineering firm responsible for the structural design of the building could offer no explanation for the collapse.
The construction firm says there's no logical reason for the collapse and suspects sabotage.
Police in Gary, Indiana, have been unable to identify the bodies of a young man and woman stab wounds and their features carved away.
The man's genitals had been removed, and police first identified the victims as two women.
OK?
Franklin!
Ah!
- Are you OK?
- I was...
Shit.
OK.
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take much more.
Listen, the condition of retrogradation is contrary or inharmonious to the regular direction of actual movement in the zodiac and is, in that respect, evil.
Hence, when malefic planets are in retrograde - and Saturn's malefic, OK?
- their maleficence is increased.
Have you been doing those word power columns?
It just means that Saturn's a bad influence.
It's just particularly a bad influence now because it's in retrograde.
- You believe that stuff she's hawking me?
- I don't know.
My granddaddy's buried here.
Did anything happen to him?
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- That big feller at the stand with that flashlight in his hand, that's the sheriff.
You tell him your granddaddy's buried in there.
- He'll let you in.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna run off with your girl a minute.
Honey, I'll get you the sheriff.
Let us through.
This girl's granddaddy's buried here.
Been in there the whole time, unbeknownst to Clyde.
Clyde didn't know, either.
They didn't know why...
Things happen hereabout they don't tell about.
I see things.
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
You laugh at an old man.
There's them that laughs and knows better.
They're sure.
The man said they could tell if the grave had been dug up.
Franklin, don't worry.
I saw it myself.
It didn't look dug up to me.
- Oh, what's that?
- What smells?
What is that stench?
Roll up the window.
Hey, that's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used to sell his cattle.
We got an uncle that works at one of those places outside of Ft.
Worth.
That's where they kill them.
They bash them in the head with a sledgehammer.
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill 'em on the first lick.
They'd start squealing and freaking out, and they'd have to bash 'em three times.
They'd skin them sometimes before they were even dead.
That's horrible.
People shouldn't kill animals for food.
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they got this big gun that shoots a bolt into their skull, then retracts it.
It's just boom!
It goes boom!
And boom!
Franklin, I like meat.
Please change the subject.
- Boom!
- That's terrible.
It's still going on.
Oh, man, it's hot in here.
- Hitchhiker.
- Should we pick him up?
- Yeah.
He'll asphyxiate out there.
- What does he look like?
Son of a bitch is gonna smell like a slaughterhouse.
Oh, give the guy a break.
He can sit by Franklin.
- What do you want to do?
- He's weird-looking.
- Pick him up, man.
- No!
Well, I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where you headed, man?
- South.
You work at that place?
Oh, no.
- How did you get stuck way out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- My uncle works for the slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.
My-my grandfather too.
My family's always been in meat.
A whole family of Draculas.
Hey, man, did you go in that slaughter room?
Where they shoot the cattle with that big air gun?
- Oh, that-that-that gun's no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.
The old way with a sledge.
See, that was better.
They died better that way.
How come?
I thought the gun was better.
Oh, no, no.
With the new way, the people are put out of jobs.
You do that?
Look.
- I was the killer.
- Damn.
- Let me see them.
- They don't send the heads away.
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah.
Franklin.
See, they make head cheese.
They... they take the head, and they boil it, except for the tongue, and they scrape all the flesh away from the bone.
They use everything.
They don't throw nothing way.
They use the jowls and the muscles and the eyes and ligaments and everything.
- Oh.
- Look at this.
The nose and the gums and all the flesh, and they boil it down into a big jelly of fat.
Wow.
I didn't know that's what was in that stuff.
It's really good.
You like it?
Oh, yeah, sure, I like it.
It's good.
It sounds horrible.
Could we talk about something else?
You'd like it if you didn't know what was in it.
I wouldn't, and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
Oh.
Come on, you're making everybody sick.
Oh, all right.
What are you doing?
Hey, man, put that knife up.
Oh!
Oh, come on.
Oh!
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh, my God!
Why are you doing that?
Put that away.
I have this knife.
Put that away, too.
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.
Fold it up.
Hey, you took my picture.
Hey, you-you could take me to my house.
I live right off this road.
Well, I don't know, man.
We're in pretty much of a hurry.
- How close is it?
- It's real close.
Well, couldn't you just walk?
I mean, if it's so close.
Yeah, you could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese?
My brother makes it real good.
You'll like it.
I think you better push on now.
Don't you, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.
You can pay me now.
- Huh?
Two dollars.
It's a good picture.
No, man.
Franklin, give him back the damn picture.
- He tried to sell him that picture.
- You're kidding?
No, I'm serious.
What are you doing?
Hey, Jerry, pull us over!
Hey, man, what's up?
What are you doing?
Get out.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm about half ready to call a cop.
That's the last goddamn hitchhiker I ever pick up.
Hey, listen to Franklin's horoscope.
Oh, Sally.
"Travel in the country, long-range plans
"and upsetting persons around you
"could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
The events in the world are not doing much either to cheer one up."
- That's just perfect.
- Franklin, I think that will be all right.
And now read Sally's.
She's a Capricorn.
Oh, no.
Capricorn's ruled by Saturn.
"There are moments when we cannot believe that what is happening is true.
Pinch yourself and you may find out that it is."
Everybody out.
Hurry up, so we can get home.
Here comes somebody.
How are you?
Would you fill her up, please?
I got no gas.
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.
The transport won't be here until late this afternoon, maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
Hey, do you know where the old Franklin place is?
- The old Franklin place?
- Yeah.
It's an old two-story rock house on a hill.
I think you have to turn on that road back there, but I'm not real sure.
Yeah, maybe I seen something like that up that way.
Well, now look, you boys don't want to go messing around no old house.
Those things is dangerous.
You're liable to get hurt.
We'll be careful.
You don't want to go fooling around with other folks' property.
Some folks don't like it, and they don't mind showing you.
- Oh, my father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?
Yeah.
Look, I got some good barbeque here.
Why don't you fellas stick around here a while?
That transport will be by in a little while.
Well, you want to get some barbeque?
Them girls, now, they don't want to go messing around an old house.
It's best you stick around here.
We should've asked if there's another gas station around.
Don't you think he would've told us if there was?
Man, it wouldn't hurt to ask, you know?
OK, I'll go ask.
I knew the hell we should've stopped back there for gas.
- Press it.
- I'm pulling it down.
- There.
- You think this place has room service?
Franklin, you maniac, you're tearing up the van.
Um, yeah, I just started doing that.
Hey, I bet that's some of that guy's blood.
Look at that.
Look at that.
- You think that's blood?
- Yeah, I guess so.
Oh, that's blood, all right.
And that guy cut the hell out of himself.
You think you could do that to yourself?
- I'm not crazy.
- Yeah, yeah.
It takes something, though, I mean just to do that to yourself like he did.
God!
Hey, you think I said something made him mad?
- Well, what?
- Franklin, you're crazier than he was.
Hey, I got us some barbeque.
- Newt's the closest place to get gas.
- Aw.
Aren't we going out to Grandpa's place?
There's a creek.
You could go swimming.
Let's go.
Come on, Sally.
We're going to Grandpa's place.
Let's go!
Hey, that guy smeared blood all over the van.
- Like he was trying to write something.
- What'd he do?
Did he write something on the van?
Let me see your knife.
Thank you.
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that station, you're towing us back in your chair.
Hey, you think that guy's just trying to scare us by, you know, blowing up my picture like that?
Oh, I wish they hadn't let the place fall apart.
It looks like the birth place of Bela Lugosi.
- I'm scared.
- I'll help you with that.
- See that window over there?
- That's strange.
Hey, watch my arms.
Watch out.
- Be straight.
Come on.
Hey.
- I'll get you from here.
I want to see that smear that guy made.
- Oh, man.
- Weird.
I wonder if that means something.
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's going to get you.
- Come on.
- Why don't you wash it off?
I want to show you the inside.
- Jerry!
- OK.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Come on, Kirk.
- Here, man, you wash it off.
You don't think that guy would try and follow us?
What for?
Where's my knife?
Kirk?
It looks like it must've been a nursery.
This is my room.
I got to stay here one time when I was eight years old.
- Right after my grandmother died.
- What happened?
- What happened to my grandmother?
- Yeah.
She died.
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- It's seen better days.
These animals used to talk me to sleep when I was little.
Look at the zebras.
I had these fascination for the zebras.
Sally!
Sally!
Hee-hee-hee-hee, hee-hee-hee-hee.
Hee-hee-hee-hee.
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.
Come on, Franklin.
It's gonna be a fun trip.
If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'm going to be able to take it.
Aah!
Ah!
- Hey, Franklin.
- Hey, Franklin.
What's wrong?
You said there was a swimming hole around here?
Yeah.
Well, Pam and I would like to go swimming, man.
Uh, there used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
Come on, we'll find it.
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- No.
We'll see you in an hour or so.
Yeah.
We'll see you in about an hour or so.
Sally?
Sally!
Zero in the world.
Just shoot him and put us out of our misery.
- Snakes and spiders!
- Stop it!
And scorpions!
Man-eating lizards.
- Kirk, help.
Kirk!
- Ow.
Ow.
Oh.
Crap.
This must be it.
Oh, are you OK?
How the hell did Franklin ever get down here, anyway?
Somebody must've carried him when he was little.
Franklin never was little.
Gasoline.
I can leave him my guitar, give him a couple bucks.
We're coming back anyway.
I can pick up my guitar, give him a couple more dollars and bring him some gas.
They don't want your guitar.
They won't want to sell us gas.
Let's just go back now.
Hey, come here.
Come here and look at this.
- A generator.
- What?
A generator!
For electricity.
Hey, hello in there!
Is anybody here?
Hello, is anybody home?
I got something for you.
Ah!
Ooh!
Let's go!
Hello?
- Hey, Pam, come look at this.
- What?
No!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Hello?
Hey, Pam.
Hello?
Kirk?
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk.
Kirk?
Kirk?
Oh!
Oh, God!
Kirk!
Kirk!
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
- You don't think it means anything?
- We'll protect you.
- I'll bet it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
- It probably doesn't mean anything, huh?
- You worry too much.
He couldn't find us anyway.
I mean, he doesn't even know our names.
I gave him your name.
I told him where you live.
I even gave him your zip code.
He's gonna kill you.
Jerry.
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife.
When did you have it last?
Well, I didn't have it last.
You had it last.
I gave it to you.
Remember?
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?
No.
I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right, I'll look for it.
I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
How do I get there?
Well, there's a trail down there between them two old sheds.
- Can I go, too?
- I think you'd better stay here.
All right.
I can't find it.
Are you mad at me?
No, I'm not mad at you.
You really are mad, huh?
Oh, I don't blame you.
I'm...
Kirk!
You really didn't want me to come, did you?
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.
Sally, did you believe in all that stuff that Pam was telling about Saturn and retrograde and all that?
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.
Yeah.
You don't think that guy would try and follow us, do you?
Well, I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
He's probably afraid Kirk will kill him.
Sally?
What now?
Nothing.
Never mind.
Kirk!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Damn.
Kirk?
Are you guys in there?
Hey, guys, quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.
Pam, is that you?
OK, you guys.
Come on out.
Come on!
Kirk?
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.
If they're not back in a minute, we've got to go look for them.
Well, what if we get lost, too?
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
Hey!
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
Sally?
I think we ought to go.
Are the keys in the van?
- Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
- What for?
Let me see the flashlight.
I'll go look for them.
You don't have to go.
Sally, don't go.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I don't think you ought to go.
I'm going to honk the horn one more time.
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No.
Now, I'm gonna honk the horn, and we're gonna wait a minute, and then if they don't come, we'll go.
All right?
Sally, they took the keys.
We don't have any keys.
They took the keys with them.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Franklin!
- Jerry took the keys with him!
- Give me that flashlight!
No, Sally, we can't go!
Look, what if they came back and we weren't here?
- Give me that flashlight!
- No, I've got to take the flashlight.
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right, all right, I'll go with you.
No, Sally.
Come on, I'll go with you, but I'm gonna keep the flashlight.
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.
I can't push you down that hill!
Sally, look, I know.
Oh!
- I'll go with you, but I'm going to hold...
- Never mind, I'll just go without it.
All right, all right.
Sally, wait!
Sally, wait a minute!
I'm coming with you.
Sally?
Hold up a minute now.
All right, let's go.
Let's go.
I'll go with you.
Sally, I can't keep up with you.
Sally?
Sally, wait a minute.
Hold up.
Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Wait.
- I thought I heard something.
- There's a light.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
Oh, it looks like a house.
Well, come on, push.
Come on, push.
Push down.
There.
- It's a house.
- Yeah?
I can't see it very well.
Oh, Franklin, this is impossible.
Come on, Sally.
Get back and push down.
This is impossible.
I hear something out there.
Look.
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!
Jerry!
Sally, I hear something.
Stop.
Stop.
Somebody, please!
Help!
Help me, please!
Somebody, help me!
Help!
Please!
Please!
Please help me!
Please!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help me!
Help me!
Oh, God!
Help, help!
Close the door.
Help me.
Whoa, there, whoa, whoa.
- Come over here.
- Somebody's trying to kill me.
Help, help...
Calm down.
You're all right, you're OK.
- Oh, now, take it easy.
- Call the police.
- He might come.
- Now, what happened?
- He... he... he killed...
- Now, now, take it easy.
He killed Franklin.
I don't know.
Call the police!
- Take it easy.
- And Jerry.
I...
I don't-I don't know what happened to the others.
There's nobody out there now.
Come on.
Come on now, take it easy.
Come on, take it easy.
- Oh, please.
- What happened?
Please.
Call the police.
There's no phone here.
We... we have to drive over to Childress.
Yeah, yeah.
Now, you take it easy.
Take it easy now.
I'll get the truck.
- Now, now, take it easy.
Take it easy.
- Don't go.
Take it easy.

Acting on a tip, the Muerto County sheriff's office began an investigation early this morning in the Muerto County Cemetery opening crypts where there was evidence of tampering.
The sheriff's deputies found a reported dozen coffins robbed of their contents.
According to the sheriff, there were cadavers in which the heads and extremities were removed, and others in which only a hand or foot had been removed.
Maldonado has information linking the robberies to a large and well-organized West Coast jewel theft ring but declined to suggest any reason for them to mutilate the cadavers.
- What are you doing?
- You ain't got no need to worry.
No!
You just cooperate, young lady, and we'll have no trouble.
- Now, listen...
- What do you want?
Now, there's no need to do that.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Had to lock up and get the lights.
Cost of electricity is enough to drive a man out of business.
Uh, I hope you're not too uncomfortable down there.
You got nothing to worry about.
You just take it easy, and we'll be there soon.
Now, now, now, now.
There's no need to do that, no.
We'll be over this in a bit.
Hang on.
Halfwits.
Little coon shits.
Come here, you nap-haired idiot!
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.
You damn fool, you almost got caught over at Duke's.
No, no, they didn't see me.
They don't know nothing.
I told you to stay away from that graveyard!
I told you and I told you,
I told you never to leave your brother alone, you...
Get in there and get that girl out of the car.
Come on, get her out of the car.
Get her out of there.
Hopefully your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.
Get her in there.
We'll have the whole county out here.
Don't you got any self-respect?
Look what your brother did to the door!
He's got no pride in his home?
Get her in there.
You've been a fool, you!
You better get them other kids.
Where are they, huh?
You're a damn fool, you.
Oh!
I thought you was in a hurry.
Where are the kids?
Where are they?
Show me!
- None of 'em get away?
- Uh-uh-uh.
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.
You...
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!
Hey, you did good.
She's a nice girl.
You nitwit, get upstairs and get your grandpa.
Now, now, young lady, you just take it easy there now.
Look, we'll fix you some supper in a few minutes.
Huh?
Get back in there!
Get in there!
Now, you just take it easy.
Take it easy.
We'll have you something to eat right away.
Hey.
Hey, Leatherface.
Give me a hand with Grandpa.
Careful.
Look, Grandpa, look, look.
Here, here!
Shut up!
Quiet!
You act like a pack of hounds.
We were just having fun.
You think this is a party?
Please.
You can make them stop.
No, he can't.
Shut your mouths.
Can't be helped, young lady.
- Oh, please, you can't let them kill me.
- Shut up.
Don't pay him no mind.
You like this face?
You're crazy!
You've got to make them stop!
Please!
He's nothing.
He's just the cook.
Shut up, you bitch hog.
Me and Leatherface do all the work.
He don't like it.
Ain't that right?
You're just the cook!
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand nothing.
I understand you ain't nothing.
Me and him do all the work!
I just can't take no pleasure in killing.
Well, there's just some things you got to do.
Don't mean you have to like it.
Oh, please.
Please.
What do you want?
I'll do anything.
Anything.
I'll do...
I'll do anything you want.
Don't need to torture the poor girl.
You just shut up!
Remember you're just the cook, and me and him will handle this.
Then get on with it.
I won't have this.
We ain't in no hurry because you ain't going no place.
No.
You hear me?
It might hurt you, but it don't mean much.
No sense in waiting.
I got to open up the room.
I been...
I been thinking about letting Grandpa have some fun.
You always said he's the best.
He's the best, all right.
Let's let him have a whack.
Hey, Grandpa, we going to let you have this one.
Just let him have a whack.
Now, you just hush.
It won't hurt none.
Why, old Grandpa is the best killer there ever was.
Why, it never took more than one lick, they say.
Why, he did 60 in five minutes once.
They say he could've done more if the hook and pull gang could've gotten the beeves out of the way faster.
Now, now, don't you cry none.
Old Grandpa's the best.
It won't hurt a bit.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Oh, please don't!
Please!
Please!
Please don't!
No, no!
No!
No!
Hit her, Grandpa!
Hit her, Grandpa!
Hit her!
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her!
Hit that bitch.
Hit her, Grandpa!
Come on!
Come on, Grandpa, hit that bitch.
Careful there.
Come on, Grandpa.
Get her Grandpa, get her.
Go ahead, go ahead!
Get her!
Come on.
- Give me the hammer.
I'll get her.
- Get her, get her, Grandpa.
- Give me that hammer.
- Hit her, hit her, Grandpa.
- I'll kill her.
Let me get her.
- Hit the bitch.
Help!
Help!
Go!
Go
It is believed that the indictment is only one of a series to be handed down as the result of a special grand jury investigation.
Graverobbing in Texas is this hour's top news story.
An informant led officers of the Muerto County Sheriff's Department to a cemetery just outside the small rural Texas community of Newt early this morning.
Officers there discovered what appeared to be a grisly work of art, the remains of a badly decomposed body wired to a large monument.
A second body was found in a ditch near the perimeter of the cemetery.
Subsequent investigation has revealed at least a dozen empty crypts, and it's feared more will turn up as the probe continues.
Deputies report that in some instances, only parts of a corpse had been removed, the head or in some cases the extremities removed, the remainder of the corpse left intact.
Evidence indicates the robberies have occurred over a period of time.
Sheriff Jesus Maldonado refused to give details of the ghoulish case and said only that he did have strong evidence linking the crime to elements outside the state.
Area residents have reportedly converged on the cemetery, fearing the remains of relatives have been removed.
No suspects are in custody, as the investigation at the scene continues.
Oil storage units continue to burn out of control at the huge Texaco refinery near the Texas-Louisiana border.

Police in Gary, Indiana, have been unable to identify the bodies of a young man and woman stab wounds and their features carved away.
The man's genitals had been removed, and police first identified the victims as two women.
OK?
Franklin!
Ah!
- Are you OK?
- I was...
Shit.
OK.
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take much more.
Listen, the condition of retrogradation is contrary or inharmonious to the regular direction of actual movement in the zodiac and is, in that respect, evil.
Hence, when malefic planets are in retrograde - and Saturn's malefic, OK?
Their maleficence is increased.
Have you been doing those word power columns?
It just means that Saturn's a bad influence.
It's just particularly a bad influence now because it's in retrograde.
- You believe that stuff she's hawking me?
- I don't know.
My granddaddy's buried here.
Did anything happen to him?
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- That big feller at the stand with that flashlight in his hand, that's the sheriff.
You tell him your granddaddy's buried in there.
- He'll let you in.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna run off with your girl a minute.
Honey, I'll get you the sheriff.
Let us through.
This girl's granddaddy's buried here.
Been in there the whole time, unbeknownst to Clyde.
Clyde didn't know, either.
They didn't know why...
Things happen hereabout they don't tell about.
I see things.
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
You laugh at an old man.
There's them that laughs and knows better.
They're sure.
The man said they could tell if the grave had been dug up.
Franklin, don't worry.
I saw it myself.
It didn't look dug up to me.
- Oh, what's that?
- What smells?
What is that stench?
Roll up the window.
Hey, that's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used to sell his cattle.
We got an uncle that works at one of those places outside of Ft.
Worth.
That's where they kill them.
They bash them in the head with a sledgehammer.
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill 'em on the first lick.
They'd start squealing and freaking out, and they'd have to bash 'em three times.
They'd skin them sometimes before they were even dead.
That's horrible.
People shouldn't kill animals for food.
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they got this big gun that shoots a bolt into their skull, then retracts it.
It's just boom!
It goes boom!
And boom!
Franklin, I like meat.
Please change the subject.
- Boom!
- That's terrible.
It's still going on.
Oh, man, it's hot in here.
- Hitchhiker.
- Should we pick him up?
- Yeah.
He'll asphyxiate out there.
- What does he look like?
Son of a bitch is gonna smell like a slaughterhouse.
Oh, give the guy a break.
He can sit by Franklin.
- What do you want to do?
- He's weird-looking.
- Pick him up, man.
- No!
Well, I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where you headed, man?
- South.
You work at that place?
Oh, no.
- How did you get stuck way out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- My uncle works for the slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.
My-my grandfather too.
My family's always been in meat.
A whole family of Draculas.
Hey, man, did you go in that slaughter room?
Where they shoot the cattle with that big air gun?
- Oh, that-that-that gun's no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.
The old way with a sledge.
See, that was better.
They died better that way.
How come?
I thought the gun was better.
Oh, no, no.
With the new way, the people are put out of jobs.
You do that?
Look.
- I was the killer.
- Damn.
- Let me see them.
- They don't send the heads away.
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah.
Franklin.
See, they make head cheese.
They... they take the head, and they boil it, except for the tongue, and they scrape all the flesh away from the bone.
They use everything.
They don't throw nothing way.
They use the jowls and the muscles and the eyes and ligaments and everything.
- Oh.
- Look at this.
The nose and the gums and all the flesh, and they boil it down into a big jelly of fat.
Wow.
I didn't know that's what was in that stuff.
It's really good.
You like it?
Oh, yeah, sure, I like it.
It's good.
It sounds horrible.
Could we talk about something else?
You'd like it if you didn't know what was in it.
I wouldn't, and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
Oh.
Come on, you're making everybody sick.
Oh, all right.
What are you doing?
Hey, man, put that knife up.
Oh!
Oh, come on.
Oh!
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh, my God!
Why are you doing that?
Put that away.
I have this knife.
Put that away, too.
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.
Fold it up.
Hey, you took my picture.
Hey, you-you could take me to my house.
I live right off this road.
Well, I don't know, man.
We're in pretty much of a hurry.
- How close is it?
- It's real close.
Well, couldn't you just walk?
I mean, if it's so close.
Yeah, you could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese?
My brother makes it real good.
You'll like it.
I think you better push on now.
Don't you, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.
You can pay me now.
- Huh?
Two dollars.
It's a good picture.
No, man.
Franklin, give him back the damn picture.
- He tried to sell him that picture.
- You're kidding?
No, I'm serious.
What are you doing?
Hey, Jerry, pull us over!
Hey, man, what's up?
What are you doing?
Get out.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm about half ready to call a cop.
That's the last goddamn hitchhiker I ever pick up.
Hey, listen to Franklin's horoscope.
Oh, Sally.
"Travel in the country, long-range plans
"and upsetting persons around you
"could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
The events in the world are not doing much either to cheer one up."
- That's just perfect.
- Franklin, I think that will be all right.
And now read Sally's.
She's a Capricorn.
Oh, no.
Capricorn's ruled by Saturn.
"There are moments when we cannot believe that what is happening is true.
Pinch yourself and you may find out that it is."
Everybody out.
Hurry up, so we can get home.
Here comes somebody.
How are you?
Would you fill her up, please?
I got no gas.
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.
The transport won't be here until late this afternoon, maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
Hey, do you know where the old Franklin place is?
- The old Franklin place?
- Yeah.
It's an old two-story rock house on a hill.
I think you have to turn on that road back there, but I'm not real sure.
Yeah, maybe I seen something like that up that way.
Well, now look, you boys don't want to go messing around no old house.
Those things is dangerous.
You're liable to get hurt.
We'll be careful.
You don't want to go fooling around with other folks' property.
Some folks don't like it, and they don't mind showing you.
- Oh, my father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?
Yeah.
Look, I got some good barbeque here.
Why don't you fellas stick around here a while?
That transport will be by in a little while.
Well, you want to get some barbeque?
Them girls, now, they don't want to go messing around an old house.
It's best you stick around here.
We should've asked if there's another gas station around.
Don't you think he would've told us if there was?
Man, it wouldn't hurt to ask, you know?
OK, I'll go ask.
I knew the hell we should've stopped back there for gas.
- Press it.
- I'm pulling it down.
- There.
- You think this place has room service?
Franklin, you maniac, you're tearing up the van.
Um, yeah, I just started doing that.
Hey, I bet that's some of that guy's blood.
Look at that.
Look at that.
- You think that's blood?
- Yeah, I guess so.
Oh, that's blood, all right.
And that guy cut the hell out of himself.
You think you could do that to yourself?
- I'm not crazy.
- Yeah, yeah.
It takes something, though, I mean just to do that to yourself like he did.
God!
Hey, you think I said something made him mad?
- Well, what?
- Franklin, you're crazier than he was.
Hey, I got us some barbeque.
- Newt's the closest place to get gas.
- Aw.
Aren't we going out to Grandpa's place?
There's a creek.
You could go swimming.
Let's go.
Come on, Sally.
We're going to Grandpa's place.
Let's go!
Hey, that guy smeared blood all over the van.
- Like he was trying to write something.
- What'd he do?
Did he write something on the van?
Let me see your knife.
Thank you.
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that station, you're towing us back in your chair.
Hey, you think that guy's just trying to scare us by, you know, blowing up my picture like that?
Oh, I wish they hadn't let the place fall apart.
It looks like the birth place of Bela Lugosi.
- I'm scared.
- I'll help you with that.
- See that window over there?
- That's strange.
Hey, watch my arms.
Watch out.
- Be straight.
Come on.
Hey.
- I'll get you from here.
I want to see that smear that guy made.
- Oh, man.
- Weird.
I wonder if that means something.
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's going to get you.
- Come on.
- Why don't you wash it off?
I want to show you the inside.
- Jerry!
- OK.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Come on, Kirk.
- Here, man, you wash it off.
You don't think that guy would try and follow us?
What for?
Where's my knife?
Kirk?
It looks like it must've been a nursery.
This is my room.
I got to stay here one time when I was eight years old.
- Right after my grandmother died.
- What happened?
- What happened to my grandmother?
- Yeah.
She died.
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- It's seen better days.
These animals used to talk me to sleep when I was little.
Look at the zebras.
I had these fascination for the zebras.
Sally!
Sally!
Hee-hee-hee-hee, hee-hee-hee-hee.
Hee-hee-hee-hee.
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.
Come on, Franklin.
It's gonna be a fun trip.
If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'm going to be able to take it.
Aah!
Ah!
- Hey, Franklin.
- Hey, Franklin.
What's wrong?
You said there was a swimming hole around here?
Yeah.
Well, Pam and I would like to go swimming, man.
Uh, there used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
Come on, we'll find it.
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- No.
We'll see you in an hour or so.
Yeah.
We'll see you in about an hour or so.
Sally?
Sally!
Zero in the world.
Just shoot him and put us out of our misery.
- Snakes and spiders!
- Stop it!
And scorpions!
Man-eating lizards.
- Kirk, help.
Kirk!
- Ow.
Ow.
Oh.
Crap.
This must be it.
Oh, are you OK?
How the hell did Franklin ever get down here, anyway?
Somebody must've carried him when he was little.
Franklin never was little.
Gasoline.
I can leave him my guitar, give him a couple bucks.
We're coming back anyway.
I can pick up my guitar, give him a couple more dollars and bring him some gas.
They don't want your guitar.
They won't want to sell us gas.
Let's just go back now.
Hey, come here.
Come here and look at this.
- A generator.
- What?
A generator!
For electricity.
Hey, hello in there!
Is anybody here?
Hello, is anybody home?
I got something for you.
Ah!
Ooh!
Let's go!
Hello?
- Hey, Pam, come look at this.
- What?
No!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Hello?
Hey, Pam.
Hello?
Kirk?
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk.
Kirk?
Kirk?
Oh!
Oh, God!
Kirk!
Kirk!
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
- You don't think it means anything?
- We'll protect you.
- I'll bet it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
- It probably doesn't mean anything, huh?
- You worry too much.
He couldn't find us anyway.
I mean, he doesn't even know our names.
I gave him your name.
I told him where you live.
I even gave him your zip code.
He's gonna kill you.
Jerry.
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife.
When did you have it last?
Well, I didn't have it last.
You had it last.
I gave it to you.
Remember?
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?
No.
I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right, I'll look for it.
I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
How do I get there?
Well, there's a trail down there between them two old sheds.
- Can I go, too?
- I think you'd better stay here.
All right.
I can't find it.
Are you mad at me?
No, I'm not mad at you.
You really are mad, huh?
Oh, I don't blame you.
I'm...
Kirk!
You really didn't want me to come, did you?
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.
Sally, did you believe in all that stuff that Pam was telling about Saturn and retrograde and all that?
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.
Yeah.
You don't think that guy would try and follow us, do you?
Well, I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
He's probably afraid Kirk will kill him.
Sally?
What now?
Nothing.
Never mind.
Kirk!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Damn.
Kirk?
Are you guys in there?
Hey, guys, quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.
Pam, is that you?
OK, you guys.
Come on out.
Come on!
Kirk?
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.
If they're not back in a minute, we've got to go look for them.
Well, what if we get lost, too?
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
Hey!
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
Sally?
I think we ought to go.
Are the keys in the van?
- Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
- What for?
Let me see the flashlight.
I'll go look for them.
You don't have to go.
Sally, don't go.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I don't think you ought to go.
I'm going to honk the horn one more time.
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No.
Now, I'm gonna honk the horn, and we're gonna wait a minute, and then if they don't come, we'll go.
All right?
Sally, they took the keys.
We don't have any keys.
They took the keys with them.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Franklin!
- Jerry took the keys with him!
- Give me that flashlight!
No, Sally, we can't go!
Look, what if they came back and we weren't here?
- Give me that flashlight!
- No, I've got to take the flashlight.
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right, all right, I'll go with you.
No, Sally.
Come on, I'll go with you, but I'm gonna keep the flashlight.
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.
I can't push you down that hill!
Sally, look, I know.
Oh!
- I'll go with you, but I'm going to hold...
- Never mind, I'll just go without it.
All right, all right.
Sally, wait!
Sally, wait a minute!
I'm coming with you.
Sally?
Hold up a minute now.
All right, let's go.
Let's go.
I'll go with you.
Sally, I can't keep up with you.
Sally?
Sally, wait a minute.
Hold up.
Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Wait.
- I thought I heard something.
- There's a light.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
Oh, it looks like a house.
Well, come on, push.
Come on, push.
Push down.
There.
- It's a house.
- Yeah?
I can't see it very well.
Oh, Franklin, this is impossible.
Come on, Sally.
Get back and push down.
This is impossible.
I hear something out there.
Look.
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!
Jerry!
Sally, I hear something.
Stop.
Stop.
Somebody, please!
Help!
Help me, please!
Somebody, help me!
Help!
Please!
Please!
Please help me!
Please!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help me!
Help me!
Oh, God!
Help, help!
Close the door.
Help me.
Whoa, there, whoa, whoa.
- Come over here.
- Somebody's trying to kill me.
Help, help...
Calm down.
You're all right, you're OK.
- Oh, now, take it easy.
- Call the police.
- He might come.
- Now, what happened?
- He... he... he killed...
- Now, now, take it easy.
He killed Franklin.
I don't know.
Call the police!
- Take it easy.
- And Jerry.
I...
I don't-I don't know what happened to the others.
There's nobody out there now.
Come on.
Come on now, take it easy.
Come on, take it easy.
- Oh, please.
- What happened?
Please.
Call the police.
There's no phone here.
We... we have to drive over to Childress.
Yeah, yeah.
Now, you take it easy.
Take it easy now.
I'll get the truck.
- Now, now, take it easy.
Take it easy.
- Don't go.
Take it easy.
Weather is expected to be warm to partly cloudy tomorrow with no chance of precipitation.

Current temperature is 96 with winds out the southeast at three miles a hour.
Humidity 98, barometer is at 29.9 and rising.
Acting on a tip, the Muerto County sheriff's office began an investigation early this morning in the Muerto County Cemetery opening crypts where there was evidence of tampering.
The sheriff's deputies found a reported dozen coffins robbed of their contents.
According to the sheriff, there were cadavers in which the heads and extremities were removed, and others in which only a hand or foot had been removed.
Maldonado has information linking the robberies to a large and well-organized West Coast jewel theft ring but declined to suggest any reason for them to mutilate the cadavers.
- What are you doing?
- You ain't got no need to worry.
No!
You just cooperate, young lady, and we'll have no trouble.
- Now, listen...
- What do you want?
Now, there's no need to do that.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Had to lock up and get the lights.
Cost of electricity is enough to drive a man out of business.
Uh, I hope you're not too uncomfortable down there.
You got nothing to worry about.
You just take it easy, and we'll be there soon.
Now, now, now, now.
There's no need to do that, no.
We'll be over this in a bit.
Hang on.
Halfwits.
Little coon shits.
Come here, you nap-haired idiot!
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.
You damn fool, you almost got caught over at Duke's.
No, no, they didn't see me.
They don't know nothing.
I told you to stay away from that graveyard!
I told you and I told you,
I told you never to leave your brother alone, you...
Get in there and get that girl out of the car.
Come on, get her out of the car.
Get her out of there.
Hopefully your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.
Get her in there.
We'll have the whole county out here.
Don't you got any self-respect?
Look what your brother did to the door!
He's got no pride in his home?
Get her in there.
You've been a fool, you!
You better get them other kids.
Where are they, huh?
You're a damn fool, you.
Oh!
I thought you was in a hurry.
Where are the kids?
Where are they?
Show me!
- None of 'em get away?
- Uh-uh-uh.
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.
You...
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!
Hey, you did good.
She's a nice girl.
You nitwit, get upstairs and get your grandpa.
Now, now, young lady, you just take it easy there now.
Look, we'll fix you some supper in a few minutes.
Huh?
Get back in there!
Get in there!
Now, you just take it easy.
Take it easy.
We'll have you something to eat right away.
Hey.
Hey, Leatherface.
Give me a hand with Grandpa.
Careful.
Look, Grandpa, look, look.
Here, here!
Shut up!
Quiet!
You act like a pack of hounds.
We were just having fun.
You think this is a party?
Please.
You can make them stop.
No, he can't.
Shut your mouths.
Can't be helped, young lady.
- Oh, please, you can't let them kill me.
- Shut up.
Don't pay him no mind.
You like this face?
You're crazy!
You've got to make them stop!
Please!
He's nothing.
He's just the cook.
Shut up, you bitch hog.
Me and Leatherface do all the work.
He don't like it.
Ain't that right?
You're just the cook!
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand nothing.
I understand you ain't nothing.
Me and him do all the work!
I just can't take no pleasure in killing.
Well, there's just some things you got to do.
Don't mean you have to like it.
Oh, please.
Please.
What do you want?
I'll do anything.
Anything.
I'll do...
I'll do anything you want.
Don't need to torture the poor girl.
You just shut up!
Remember you're just the cook, and me and him will handle this.
Then get on with it.
I won't have this.
We ain't in no hurry because you ain't going no place.
No.
You hear me?
It might hurt you, but it don't mean much.
No sense in waiting.
I got to open up the room.
I been...
I been thinking about letting Grandpa have some fun.
You always said he's the best.
He's the best, all right.
Let's let him have a whack.
Hey, Grandpa, we going to let you have this one.
Just let him have a whack.
Now, you just hush.
It won't hurt none.
Why, old Grandpa is the best killer there ever was.
Why, it never took more than one lick, they say.
Why, he did 60 in five minutes once.
They say he could've done more if the hook and pull gang could've gotten the beeves out of the way faster.
Now, now, don't you cry none.
Old Grandpa's the best.
It won't hurt a bit.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Oh, please don't!
Please!
Please!
Please don't!
No, no!
No!
No!
Hit her, Grandpa!
Hit her, Grandpa!
Hit her!
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her!
Hit that bitch.
Hit her, Grandpa!
Come on!
Come on, Grandpa, hit that bitch.
Careful there.
Come on, Grandpa.
Get her Grandpa, get her.
Go ahead, go ahead!
Get her!
Come on.
- Give me the hammer.
I'll get her.
- Get her, get her, Grandpa.
- Give me that hammer.
- Hit her, hit her, Grandpa.
- I'll kill her.
Let me get her.
- Hit the bitch.
Help!
Help!
Go!

The head, or in some cases... the extremities removed, and... the remainder of the corpse left intact.
Evidence indicates the... robberies have occurred over a period of time.
Sheriff Rhesus Maldonado refuses to give details... in this case and said only... that he did have a strong evidence linking the crime to... elements outside the state.
Area residents have reportedly... converged on the cemetery claiming the remains of relatives have been removed.
No suspects are in custody, as investigation at the scene... continues.

Franklin!
Are you ok?
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take...
- much more of this.
- The condition of retro gradation... is contrary or inharmonious to the regular direction of actual... movement in the zodiac, and is, in that respect, evil.
Hint:
When malefic planets are in retrograde, and Saturn is malefic... their maleficies are increased.
Have you been doing that Reader's Digest worth our...
Jerry, it just means Saturn's a bad influence.
It's just particularly... bad influence now, because it's in retrograde.
Hey, man, do you believe all that stuff your old lady is talking me?
My granddaddy is buried here.
Can we find out if anything happened?
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- See that big heavy fella... standing with that big flashlight, isn't that the sheriff?
You go tell him your granddaddy is buried in there.
He'll let you in.
Ok.
Thank you.
Hey, fella, I'm gonna run off to...
- meet him if you don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.
- Hey, folks.
Let us go see where... her granddaddy's buried.
Things happen here about they don't tell about.
I see things.
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
You laugh at an old man... this thing that laughs knows better.
Yes, they're sure.
The man said the Tallman's grave had been dug up.
Mama, don't worry.
I saw it myself!
It didn't look dug up to me.
What's that?
What smell?
What is that stench?
Hey.
That's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used... to sell his cattle!
We got an uncle that works in one of those places... outside of Fortworth.
See those buildings there?
That's where... they kill him.
They bash'em in the head with a big sledgehammer!
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill him.
It'd start squealing and freaking out, they'd have to... come up and bash'em 2 or 3 times.
They'd scatter them before they were even dead.
That's horrible!
People shouldn't kill animals for food.
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they get this big air gun... that shoots a bullet into the skull and then retracts it.
Franklin, I like me, please change the subject.
That smell's still going on.
Oh, man!
It's hot in here.
- Hitchhiker!
- Should we take him up?
Yeah man, pick him up.
He'll asphyxiate out there!
- What does he look like?
- The son of a bitch 's gonna...
- smell like the slaughterhouse.
- Give the guy a break.
He can...
- sit by Franklin.
- What do you wanna do?
- He's weird looking, no.
- I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where're you heading, man?
- You work at that place?
- Don't.
- How did you get stuck out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- I got an uncle that works...
- at a slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.
My grandfather, too.
My family's always been in beef.
The whole family are cracked.
Hey man, did you go into that... slaughter room or whatever they call it?
Where they shoot the cattle with that air gun thing?
- That gun is no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.
With the sledge!
That was better.
- They died better that way.
- How come?
I thought the gun...
- was better.
- Oh no.
With the new way...
- people were put out of jobs.
- You do that?
- Look!
- I was the killer!
- Let me see them.
- They don't seem to head your way.
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah!
- Franklin.
- Let me see.
- They make hitches...
They take the head and they boil, except for the tongue, and scrape... all the flesh away from the bone.
They use everything, they throw nothing away.
They use jaws, muscles, and the eyes, and the ligaments...
- and everything!
- Look at this.
- They boil the nose and the gums down to a big jelly of fat.
I don't know it was in that stuff.
It's really good.
Do you like it?
- Yeah, I like it.
It's good!
- It sounds horrible.
Can't we...
- talk about something else?
- You'd probably like it if you... didn't know what was in it.
I wouldn't and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
Take it before everybody's sick.
What are you doing?
Look.
I think that might hurt.
Oh, come on!
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh, what are you doing?
Nice, man!
I have this knife.
Put that away, too.
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.
Put it back.
You took my picture!
You can take me to my house.
I live right off this road.
I don't know, man.
We're in much of a hurry.
- How close is it?
- It's real close.
Couldn't you just walk?
I mean...
If it's so close.
You could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese.
My brother...
- makes it real good.
You'll like it.
- I think we'd better push on, man.
Don't we, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry...
- It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.
- You can pay me now.
- Huh?
- 2 dollars.
It's a good picture.
- No, man.
Franklin... give him back that picture.
I'm about to freak.
Call a cop.
That's the last damn hitchhiker I ever take.
- Listen to Franklin's horoscope:
- I'm sorry.
Travel in the countryside.
Long range plans, upsetting persons... around you, could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
The events in the world are not doing much, to cheer one up.
- That's just perfect!
- Franklin, I think you'll be alright.
Hey, Kat, read Alex's.
He's Capricorn.
Oh, no.
Capricorn is ruled by Saturn.
There are moments where we... cannot believe that what's happening is really true... pinch yourself and you may find out that it is.
Hurry up.
Here comes somebody.
How are you?
Would you fill her up, please?
I got no gas.
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.
Transport won't... be here until this afternoon.
Maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
Hey, you know where "The Old Franklin Place" is?
- "The Old Franklin Place"?
- It's an old 2-story house and... it's sitting up on the hill.
I think you have to turn on the road... back there, but I'm not real sure.
Maybe I've seen something like that up there.
But look, you boys... don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Those things are dangerous, you're bound to get hurt!
- We'll be careful.
- Don't wanna go fooling around... other folk's property.
Some folks don't like it.
They don't mind showing you.
- My father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?
- Yeah.
- Look...
I got barbecue here.
Why don't you stay a while?
The transport will be by in a little while...
I can go and get some barbecue.
Them girls, they don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Best you stick around here.
We should've asked him if there's another gas station around here.
Don't you think he would have told us if there was?
- It wouldn't hurt to ask.
- I'll go ask.
What the hell, we should have stopped back there for gas.
Go, damn it.
There.
You think this place has room service?
Franklin, you're cutting the van!
Yeah, I just started doing that.
I bet this is some of that guy's blood.
Look at that.
- Think it's his blood?
- I guess so.
That's blood, alright.
And I got cut the hell out of him, chef.
You think you could do that to yourself?
Crazy?
It takes something, though, I mean, do that to yourself, like he did.
You think I said something that made him mad?
- What?
- Franklin, you're crazy as he was.
Hey, I got us some barbecue.
Newt's the closest place to get gas.
We're going to that Granpa's place.
There's a creek, you can go swimming.
Come on, Sally, we're going to that Granpa's place!
- Let's go.
- Hey, that guy smeared blood...
- all over the van.
- Let's not waste time to wipe this up.
What?
What did you do?
You're in someone's van?
Let me see your knife.
Thank you.
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that service... station, you're towing us back in that chair.
Hey...
You think that guy was just trying to scare us by blowing out... my picture like that?
Oh, look, they let the place fall apart.
Put it over there.
- Wanna go over there?
- Let's go.
Oh, Kirk, come on!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I want to see the smear the guy made.
This is weird.
I wonder if that means something.
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's gonna get you.
- Why don't you wash it off, ok?
- I want to see inside.
- Jerry!
- Ok!
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- Get it.
You wash it up.
- You don't think that guy...
- is trying to follow us, do you?
- What for?
Where's my knife?
Kirk?
Looks like it must have been a nursery room.
This was my room.
I got to stay here until I was 8 years old.
- Until my grandmother died.
- What happened?
- To my grandmother?
- Yeah, she died.
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- I think it's seen better days...
These animals would to put me to sleep when I was a little girl.
Look at the zebra.
I had this fascination for the zebras...
Kate?
Sally!
Come on, Franklin!
It's gonna be a fun trip.
If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'll take it!
- Hey, Franklin!
- What's wrong?
Didn't you say there was a swimming well out here?
Pam and I would like to go swimming in there.
There used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
Come on.
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- We'll see them in an hour or so.
Yeah.
See them down in about an hour or so.
Sally!
Sally...
Seed growing in the world...
I don't want to miss it.
Man, a scorpion, there's a scorpion!
Crap!
This must be it!
Are you ok?
What the hell, Franklin would never get down here anyway.
I bet he must have when he was little.
Franklin never was little.
Gasoline.
I can leave my guitar, you know, I'd give him a couple of bucks...
We gotta come back by here anyway, I can pick up my guitar and... give him a couple more dollars and we get more gas...
He won't want your guitar, he's not gonna sell us some gas... let's just go back now.
Hey, come here!
Come here, look at this.
- A generator!
- What?
A generator!
For electricity!
Hey, hello!
Is there anybody in the house?
Hello!
Is anybody home?
I got something for you.
Let's go!
Hello?
Hello?
- Come look at this!
- Let's go!
Hello!
Anybody home?
Hello?
Hey, Pam!
Hello!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk?
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
He's coming to get you!
You don't think it means anything?
We'll protect you if he tries to get you.
- Maybe it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- You worry too much.
He couldn't find us, anyway.
He doesn't even know our names.
I gave him your name, Franklin.
And I told him where you lived.
I even gave him your ZIP code.
He's gonna kill you.
Jerry...
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife, remember?
When did you have it last?
I didn't have it last.
You had it last.
I gave it to you, remember?
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?
No, I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right.
I'll look for it.
Listen, I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
How do I get there, Frank?
Well, there's a trail down there.
Between the two old sheds.
- Can I go too?
- I think you'd better stay here.
All right.
I can't find it.
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.
You really are mad, huh?
I don't blame you.
Kirk!
You really didn't want me to come, did you?
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.
Did you believe all that stuff Pam was telling about?
Saturn, and retrograde, and all that?
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.
You don't think that guy is trying to follow us, do you?
I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
He'd probably find Kirk and kill him.
- Sally...
- What now?
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kirk!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Damn.
Kirk!
Are you guys in there?
Hey, guys!
Quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.
Pam, is that you?
Okay, you guys!
Come on out.
Come on!
Kirk?
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.
If they 're not back in a minute, we'd better go look for them
What if we get lost, too?
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Hey!
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
Sally...
I think we ought to go.
Are the keys in the van?
Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
What for?
Let me see the flashlight.
I'm gonna go look for them.
You don't have to go.
Sally, no, I don't think that's a good idea, Sally.
I don't think you ought to go.
Look, I'm gonna honk the horn one more time.
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No, I'm gonna honk the horn... and we will wait a minute, and they will come and we will go.
All right?
Sally, they took the keys!
We don't have any keys!
They took the keys!
Stop it!
Stop it!
- Now give me the flashlight!
- No, Sally!
You can't go!
What if they came back and we weren't here?
- Franklin, give me that flashlight!
- I'll keep the flashlight!
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right!
All right!
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you, all right?
I'll go with you, but I'll keep the flashlight.
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.
I can't push you down the hill!
Sally...
- Look, I'll go with you...
- Never mind, I'll go without it.
All right.
Sally, wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.
Sally!
Hold on a minute now.
All right, let's go.
Let's go, I'll go with you.
Sally, I can't keep up with you!
Sally!
Sally, wait a minute!
Hold on!
Jerry!
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
I thought I heard something.
There's a light!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- It looks like a house.
- Come on, push!
- It's a house!
- I can't see it very well.
- Franklin, this is impossible.
- Come on, Sally!
Get back and push, damn!
Impossible!
I heard something over there!
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!
Sally, I hear something.
Stop!
Stop!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help me, please!
- Help!
Help!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Help me!
Help me!
- Come over here!
You're all right, girl.
Okay?
Hold on, take it easy, all right?
He killed...
- Take it easy...
- He killed Franklin...
Call the police!
Jerry!
I don't know what happened to the others...
There's nobody out there now!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
What happened?
- Call the police...
- There's no phone here.
We have to drive to the sheriff's.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
I'll get the truck.
- Take it easy.
Take it easy.
- Don't go!
Don't go!

Acting on a typical day with some news... the word is that the sheriff's office began an investigation... early this morning in the County Cemetery.
Opening crypts and muslins where there was evidence of... tampering, The Sheriff found a reported dozen coffins were... robbed a part of its contents.
According to the sheriff, Rhesus...
Maldonado, there are ones from which only the head and... extremities are removed, and others and others from which only a hand or foot removed, with the... remainder of the cadaver left intact.
Maldonado linked...
What are you doing?
- You will come with me...
- No!
- What do you want?
- There's no need to do that...
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I had to lock up and get the lights off.
Because electricity is enough to drive a man out of business.
I hope you're not too uncomfortable down there.
You got nothing to worry about.
Just take it easy.
We're gonna get there soon.
No, no, no.
There's no need to do that.
We always do our best.
Hang on.
No.
Half witch.
You little shit!
You knock-head idiot!
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.
You damn fool!
You almost got caught.
No!
They didn't see me.
They don't know nothing!
I told you to stay away from that graveyard.
I told you...
I told you never to leave your brother alone!
Get that girl out of the car!
Get her out!
I hope your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.
Look at what your brother did to that door!
You let her go!
You goddamn idiot!
I thought you were in a hurry.
Where are the kids?
Where are the children?
Did they get away?
Are you sure?
You...
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!
Hey, come here!
Look!
See how nice she looks!
Get upstairs and get your grandpa!
Take it easy there, huh?
You'll stay here for a few minutes.
Get back in there!
To the chamber!
You just take it easy.
We'll have something to eat right away.
Hey, you two!
Give me a hand with grandpa!
Look, grandpa!
Look!
Knock it off!
Quiet!
You act like a pack of hounds.
- We're just having fun!
- You think this is a party?
Please!
You can make them stop!
- No shit?
- Shut your mouth!
Can't be helped, young lady.
Please!
You can't let them kill me!
He likes this face.
He's crazy!
You gotta make him stop!
Please...
- He's just a cook!
- Shut up, you bitch hog!
He always does all the work.
He don't like it.
Is that right?
You're just a cook!
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand nothing.
I understand you ain't nothing!
We do all the work!
I just can take no pleasure in killing.
It's just something we gotta do.
It don't mean you have to like it.
Please...
Please...
I'll do anything you want.
You don't need to torture the girl.
Please, shut up.
Remember you're just a cook.
Let me and him handle this.
I won't have this.
You ain't in no hurry.
And you ain't going no place.
You don't hear me?
I heard you told me much.
No sense in waiting.
I gotta go to my room.
I'll take her to grandpa.
Grandpa'll have some fun.
You always said he was the best.
He's the best all right.
Let's let him half leg.
Grandpa, we're gonna let you... have this one!
Have this one!
He won't use you much.
He won't hurt none.
Our grandpa was the best killer there ever was.
I never took all the guts to see.
I did in 6 in 5 minutes once.
I could've done more if the hook pulled again could've gotten the... beaves out of the way faster.
Now don't you cry.
Grandpa is the best.
It won't hurt a bit.
No!
No!
Please!
Don't!
Hit her!
Hit the bitch!
Go ahead!
Give me the hammer!
Give me the hammer!
I'll kill her!
Go!
Go!

Ray Robbin, in Texas, is this hour top news story... and informant led officers at Marto County sheriff... department, to a cemetery, just outside the small rude Texas... community of Newt, early this morning.
Officers there... discovered what appeared to be a grizzly work of art...
The remains of a badly decomposed body, wired to a... large monument.
A second body was found in the ditch near... the perimeter of the cemetery, subsequent investigation has... revealed at least a dozen empty crypts, and it's clear more... will turn up as the probe continues deputies report... that in some instances, only parts of the corpses have been... removed.
The head, or in some cases... the extremities removed, and... the remainder of the corpse left intact.
Evidence indicates the... robberies have occurred over a period of time.
Sheriff Rhesus Maldonado refuses to give details... in this case and said only... that he did have a strong evidence linking the crime to... elements outside the state.
Area residents have reportedly... converged on the cemetery claiming the remains of relatives have been removed.
No suspects are in custody, as investigation at the scene... continues.
...mental hospital and released.
A 16-story-building downtown...
Atlanta, collapsed today, killing at least 29 persons.
The engineering firm responsible could offer no explanation for... the collapse although the construction firm say there's... no logical reason for the collapse is suspected sabotage.
Police in Gary, Indiana, have been unable to identify the... bodies of a young man... and four children who had... their features carved away, the man's dimples had been... removed.
Police first identified the victims as 2 women... continuing the program of the government to overwhelm reaches... beyond the Amazon today are ruptured into violence... forces of at least three South America governments already... have been involved.

...Police in Dallas arrested a young couple today... complaints by neighbors led them to discover a 18-month-old daughter the couple... chained in the attic of a dilapidated house...
Franklin!
Are you ok?
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take...
- much more of this.
- The condition of retro gradation... is contrary or inharmonious to the regular direction of actual... movement in the zodiac, and is, in that respect, evil.
Hint:
When malefic planets are in retrograde, and Saturn is malefic... their maleficies are increased.
Have you been doing that Reader's Digest worth our...
Jerry, it just means Saturn's a bad influence.
It's just particularly... bad influence now, because it's in retrograde.
Hey, man, do you believe all that stuff your old lady is talking me?
My granddaddy is buried here.
Can we find out if anything happened?
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- See that big heavy fella... standing with that big flashlight, isn't that the sheriff?
You go tell him your granddaddy is buried in there.
He'll let you in.
Ok.
Thank you.
Hey, fella, I'm gonna run off to...
- meet him if you don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.
- Hey, folks.
Let us go see where... her granddaddy's buried.
Things happen here about they don't tell about.
I see things.
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
You laugh at an old man... this thing that laughs knows better.
Yes, they're sure.
The man said the Tallman's grave had been dug up.
Mama, don't worry.
I saw it myself!
It didn't look dug up to me.
What's that?
What smell?
What is that stench?
Hey.
That's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used... to sell his cattle!
We got an uncle that works in one of those places... outside of Fortworth.
See those buildings there?
That's where... they kill him.
They bash'em in the head with a big sledgehammer!
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill him.
It'd start squealing and freaking out, they'd have to... come up and bash'em 2 or 3 times.
They'd scatter them before they were even dead.
That's horrible!
People shouldn't kill animals for food.
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they get this big air gun... that shoots a bullet into the skull and then retracts it.
Franklin, I like me, please change the subject.
That smell's still going on.
Oh, man!
It's hot in here.
- Hitchhiker!
- Should we take him up?
Yeah man, pick him up.
He'll asphyxiate out there!
- What does he look like?
- The son of a bitch 's gonna...
- smell like the slaughterhouse.
- Give the guy a break.
He can...
- sit by Franklin.
- What do you wanna do?
- He's weird looking, no.
- I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where're you heading, man?
- You work at that place?
- Don't.
- How did you get stuck out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- I got an uncle that works...
- at a slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.
My grandfather, too.
My family's always been in beef.
The whole family are cracked.
Hey man, did you go into that... slaughter room or whatever they call it?
Where they shoot the cattle with that air gun thing?
- That gun is no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.
With the sledge!
That was better.
- They died better that way.
- How come?
I thought the gun...
- was better.
- Oh no.
With the new way...
- people were put out of jobs.
- You do that?
- Look!
- I was the killer!
- Let me see them.
- They don't seem to head your way.
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah!
- Franklin.
- Let me see.
- They make hitches...
They take the head and they boil, except for the tongue, and scrape... all the flesh away from the bone.
They use everything, they throw nothing away.
They use jaws, muscles, and the eyes, and the ligaments...
- and everything!
- Look at this.
- They boil the nose and the gums down to a big jelly of fat.
I don't know it was in that stuff.
It's really good.
Do you like it?
- Yeah, I like it.
It's good!
- It sounds horrible.
Can't we...
- talk about something else?
- You'd probably like it if you... didn't know what was in it.
I wouldn't and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
Take it before everybody's sick.
What are you doing?
Look.
I think that might hurt.
Oh, come on!
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh, what are you doing?
Nice, man!
I have this knife.
Put that away, too.
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.
Put it back.
You took my picture!
You can take me to my house.
I live right off this road.
I don't know, man.
We're in much of a hurry.
- How close is it?
- It's real close.
Couldn't you just walk?
I mean...
If it's so close.
You could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese.
My brother...
- makes it real good.
You'll like it.
- I think we'd better push on, man.
Don't we, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry...
- It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.
- You can pay me now.
- Huh?
- 2 dollars.
It's a good picture.
- No, man.
Franklin... give him back that picture.
I'm about to freak.
Call a cop.
That's the last damn hitchhiker I ever take.
- Listen to Franklin's horoscope:
- I'm sorry.
Travel in the countryside.
Long range plans, upsetting persons... around you, could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
The events in the world are not doing much, to cheer one up.
- That's just perfect!
- Franklin, I think you'll be alright.
Hey, Kat, read Alex's.
He's Capricorn.
Oh, no.
Capricorn is ruled by Saturn.
There are moments where we... cannot believe that what's happening is really true... pinch yourself and you may find out that it is.
Hurry up.
Here comes somebody.
How are you?
Would you fill her up, please?
I got no gas.
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.
Transport won't... be here until this afternoon.
Maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
Hey, you know where "The Old Franklin Place" is?
- "The Old Franklin Place"?
- It's an old 2-story house and... it's sitting up on the hill.
I think you have to turn on the road... back there, but I'm not real sure.
Maybe I've seen something like that up there.
But look, you boys... don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Those things are dangerous, you're bound to get hurt!
- We'll be careful.
- Don't wanna go fooling around... other folk's property.
Some folks don't like it.
They don't mind showing you.
- My father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?
- Yeah.
- Look...
I got barbecue here.
Why don't you stay a while?
The transport will be by in a little while...
I can go and get some barbecue.
Them girls, they don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Best you stick around here.
We should've asked him if there's another gas station around here.
Don't you think he would have told us if there was?
- It wouldn't hurt to ask.
- I'll go ask.
What the hell, we should have stopped back there for gas.
Go, damn it.
There.
You think this place has room service?
Franklin, you're cutting the van!
Yeah, I just started doing that.
I bet this is some of that guy's blood.
Look at that.
- Think it's his blood?
- I guess so.
That's blood, alright.
And I got cut the hell out of him, chef.
You think you could do that to yourself?
Crazy?
It takes something, though, I mean, do that to yourself, like he did.
You think I said something that made him mad?
- What?
- Franklin, you're crazy as he was.
Hey, I got us some barbecue.
Newt's the closest place to get gas.
We're going to that Granpa's place.
There's a creek, you can go swimming.
Come on, Sally, we're going to that Granpa's place!
- Let's go.
- Hey, that guy smeared blood...
- all over the van.
- Let's not waste time to wipe this up.
What?
What did you do?
You're in someone's van?
Let me see your knife.
Thank you.
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that service... station, you're towing us back in that chair.
Hey...
You think that guy was just trying to scare us by blowing out... my picture like that?
Oh, look, they let the place fall apart.
Put it over there.
- Wanna go over there?
- Let's go.
Oh, Kirk, come on!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I want to see the smear the guy made.
This is weird.
I wonder if that means something.
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's gonna get you.
- Why don't you wash it off, ok?
- I want to see inside.
- Jerry!
- Ok!
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- Get it.
You wash it up.
- You don't think that guy...
- is trying to follow us, do you?
- What for?
Where's my knife?
Kirk?
Looks like it must have been a nursery room.
This was my room.
I got to stay here until I was 8 years old.
- Until my grandmother died.
- What happened?
- To my grandmother?
- Yeah, she died.
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- I think it's seen better days...
These animals would to put me to sleep when I was a little girl.
Look at the zebra.
I had this fascination for the zebras...
Kate?
Sally!
Come on, Franklin!
It's gonna be a fun trip.
If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'll take it!
- Hey, Franklin!
- What's wrong?
Didn't you say there was a swimming well out here?
Pam and I would like to go swimming in there.
There used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
Come on.
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- We'll see them in an hour or so.
Yeah.
See them down in about an hour or so.
Sally!
Sally...
Seed growing in the world...
I don't want to miss it.
Man, a scorpion, there's a scorpion!
Crap!
This must be it!
Are you ok?
What the hell, Franklin would never get down here anyway.
I bet he must have when he was little.
Franklin never was little.
Gasoline.
I can leave my guitar, you know, I'd give him a couple of bucks...
We gotta come back by here anyway, I can pick up my guitar and... give him a couple more dollars and we get more gas...
He won't want your guitar, he's not gonna sell us some gas... let's just go back now.
Hey, come here!
Come here, look at this.
- A generator!
- What?
A generator!
For electricity!
Hey, hello!
Is there anybody in the house?
Hello!
Is anybody home?
I got something for you.
Let's go!
Hello?
Hello?
- Come look at this!
- Let's go!
Hello!
Anybody home?
Hello?
Hey, Pam!
Hello!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk?
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
He's coming to get you!
You don't think it means anything?
We'll protect you if he tries to get you.
- Maybe it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- You worry too much.
He couldn't find us, anyway.
He doesn't even know our names.
I gave him your name, Franklin.
And I told him where you lived.
I even gave him your ZIP code.
He's gonna kill you.
Jerry...
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife, remember?
When did you have it last?
I didn't have it last.
You had it last.
I gave it to you, remember?
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?
No, I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right.
I'll look for it.
Listen, I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
How do I get there, Frank?
Well, there's a trail down there.
Between the two old sheds.
- Can I go too?
- I think you'd better stay here.
All right.
I can't find it.
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.
You really are mad, huh?
I don't blame you.
Kirk!
You really didn't want me to come, did you?
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.
Did you believe all that stuff Pam was telling about?
Saturn, and retrograde, and all that?
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.
You don't think that guy is trying to follow us, do you?
I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
He'd probably find Kirk and kill him.
- Sally...
- What now?
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kirk!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Damn.
Kirk!
Are you guys in there?
Hey, guys!
Quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.
Pam, is that you?
Okay, you guys!
Come on out.
Come on!
Kirk?
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.
If they 're not back in a minute, we'd better go look for them
What if we get lost, too?
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Hey!
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
Sally...
I think we ought to go.
Are the keys in the van?
Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
What for?
Let me see the flashlight.
I'm gonna go look for them.
You don't have to go.
Sally, no, I don't think that's a good idea, Sally.
I don't think you ought to go.
Look, I'm gonna honk the horn one more time.
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No, I'm gonna honk the horn... and we will wait a minute, and they will come and we will go.
All right?
Sally, they took the keys!
We don't have any keys!
They took the keys!
Stop it!
Stop it!
- Now give me the flashlight!
- No, Sally!
You can't go!
What if they came back and we weren't here?
- Franklin, give me that flashlight!
- I'll keep the flashlight!
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right!
All right!
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you, all right?
I'll go with you, but I'll keep the flashlight.
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.
I can't push you down the hill!
Sally...
- Look, I'll go with you...
- Never mind, I'll go without it.
All right.
Sally, wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.
Sally!
Hold on a minute now.
All right, let's go.
Let's go, I'll go with you.
Sally, I can't keep up with you!
Sally!
Sally, wait a minute!
Hold on!
Jerry!
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
I thought I heard something.
There's a light!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- It looks like a house.
- Come on, push!
- It's a house!
- I can't see it very well.
- Franklin, this is impossible.
- Come on, Sally!
Get back and push, damn!
Impossible!
I heard something over there!
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!
Sally, I hear something.
Stop!
Stop!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help me, please!
- Help!
Help!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Help me!
Help me!
- Come over here!
You're all right, girl.
Okay?
Hold on, take it easy, all right?
He killed...
- Take it easy...
- He killed Franklin...
Call the police!
Jerry!
I don't know what happened to the others...
There's nobody out there now!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
What happened?
- Call the police...
- There's no phone here.
We have to drive to the sheriff's.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
I'll get the truck.
- Take it easy.
Take it easy.
- Don't go!
Don't go!

- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.
You damn fool!
You almost got caught.
No!
They didn't see me.
They don't know nothing!
I told you to stay away from that graveyard.
I told you...
I told you never to leave your brother alone!
Get that girl out of the car!
Get her out!
I hope your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.
Look at what your brother did to that door!
You let her go!
You goddamn idiot!
I thought you were in a hurry.
Where are the kids?
Where are the children?
Did they get away?
Are you sure?
You...
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!
Hey, come here!
Look!
See how nice she looks!
Get upstairs and get your grandpa!
Take it easy there, huh?
You'll stay here for a few minutes.
Get back in there!
To the chamber!
You just take it easy.

Look!
Knock it off!
Quiet!
You act like a pack of hounds.
- We're just having fun!
- You think this is a party?
Please!
You can make them stop!
- No shit?
- Shut your mouth!
Can't be helped, young lady.
Please!
You can't let them kill me!
He likes this face.
He's crazy!
You gotta make him stop!
Please...
- He's just a cook!
- Shut up, you bitch hog!
He always does all the work.
He don't like it.
Is that right?
You're just a cook!
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand nothing.
I understand you ain't nothing!
We do all the work!
I just can take no pleasure in killing.
It's just something we gotta do.
It don't mean you have to like it.
Please...
Please...
I'll do anything you want.
You don't need to torture the girl.
Please, shut up.
Remember you're just a cook.
Let me and him handle this.
I won't have this.
You ain't in no hurry.
And you ain't going no place.
You don't hear me?
I heard you told me much.
No sense in waiting.
I gotta go to my room.

A second body was found in the ditch near... the perimeter of the cemetery, subsequent investigation has... revealed at least a dozen empty crypts, and it's clear more... will turn up as the probe continues deputies report... that in some instances, only parts of the corpses have been... removed.
The head, or in some cases... the extremities removed, and... the remainder of the corpse left intact.
Evidence indicates the... robberies have occurred over a period of time.
Sheriff Rhesus Maldonado refuses to give details... in this case and said only... that he did have a strong evidence linking the crime to... elements outside the state.
Area residents have reportedly... converged on the cemetery claiming the remains of relatives have been removed.
No suspects are in custody, as investigation at the scene... continues.

Franklin!
Are you ok?
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take...
- much more of this.
- The condition of retro gradation... is contrary or inharmonious to the regular direction of actual... movement in the zodiac, and is, in that respect, evil.
Hint:
When malefic planets are in retrograde, and Saturn is malefic... their maleficies are increased.
Have you been doing that Reader's Digest worth our...
Jerry, it just means Saturn's a bad influence.
It's just particularly... bad influence now, because it's in retrograde.
Hey, man, do you believe all that stuff your old lady is talking me?
My granddaddy is buried here.
Can we find out if anything happened?
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- See that big heavy fella... standing with that big flashlight, isn't that the sheriff?
You go tell him your granddaddy is buried in there.
He'll let you in.
Ok.
Thank you.
Hey, fella, I'm gonna run off to...
- meet him if you don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.
- Hey, folks.
Let us go see where... her granddaddy's buried.
Things happen here about they don't tell about.
I see things.
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
You laugh at an old man... this thing that laughs knows better.
Yes, they're sure.
The man said the Tallman's grave had been dug up.
Mama, don't worry.
I saw it myself!
It didn't look dug up to me.
What's that?
What smell?
What is that stench?
Hey.
That's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used... to sell his cattle!
We got an uncle that works in one of those places... outside of Fortworth.
See those buildings there?
That's where... they kill him.
They bash'em in the head with a big sledgehammer!
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill him.
It'd start squealing and freaking out, they'd have to... come up and bash'em 2 or 3 times.
They'd scatter them before they were even dead.
That's horrible!
People shouldn't kill animals for food.
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they get this big air gun... that shoots a bullet into the skull and then retracts it.
Franklin, I like me, please change the subject.
That smell's still going on.
Oh, man!
It's hot in here.
- Hitchhiker!
- Should we take him up?
Yeah man, pick him up.
He'll asphyxiate out there!
- What does he look like?
- The son of a bitch 's gonna...
- smell like the slaughterhouse.
- Give the guy a break.
He can...
- sit by Franklin.
- What do you wanna do?
- He's weird looking, no.
- I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where're you heading, man?
- You work at that place?
- Don't.
- How did you get stuck out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- I got an uncle that works...
- at a slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.
My grandfather, too.
My family's always been in beef.
The whole family are cracked.
Hey man, did you go into that... slaughter room or whatever they call it?
Where they shoot the cattle with that air gun thing?
- That gun is no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.
With the sledge!
That was better.
- They died better that way.
- How come?
I thought the gun...
- was better.
- Oh no.
With the new way...
- people were put out of jobs.
- You do that?
- Look!
- I was the killer!
- Let me see them.
- They don't seem to head your way.
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah!
- Franklin.
- Let me see.
- They make hitches...
They take the head and they boil, except for the tongue, and scrape... all the flesh away from the bone.
They use everything, they throw nothing away.
They use jaws, muscles, and the eyes, and the ligaments...
- and everything!
- Look at this.
- They boil the nose and the gums down to a big jelly of fat.
I don't know it was in that stuff.
It's really good.
Do you like it?
- Yeah, I like it.
It's good!
- It sounds horrible.
Can't we...
- talk about something else?
- You'd probably like it if you... didn't know what was in it.
I wouldn't and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
Take it before everybody's sick.
What are you doing?
Look.
I think that might hurt.
Oh, come on!
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh, what are you doing?
Nice, man!
I have this knife.
Put that away, too.
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.
Put it back.
You took my picture!
You can take me to my house.
I live right off this road.
I don't know, man.
We're in much of a hurry.
- How close is it?
- It's real close.
Couldn't you just walk?
I mean...
If it's so close.
You could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese.
My brother...
- makes it real good.
You'll like it.
- I think we'd better push on, man.
Don't we, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry...
- It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.
- You can pay me now.
- Huh?
- 2 dollars.
It's a good picture.
- No, man.
Franklin... give him back that picture.
I'm about to freak.
Call a cop.
That's the last damn hitchhiker I ever take.
- Listen to Franklin's horoscope:
- I'm sorry.
Travel in the countryside.
Long range plans, upsetting persons... around you, could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
The events in the world are not doing much, to cheer one up.
- That's just perfect!
- Franklin, I think you'll be alright.
Hey, Kat, read Alex's.
He's Capricorn.
Oh, no.
Capricorn is ruled by Saturn.
There are moments where we... cannot believe that what's happening is really true... pinch yourself and you may find out that it is.
Hurry up.
Here comes somebody.
How are you?
Would you fill her up, please?
I got no gas.
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.
Transport won't... be here until this afternoon.
Maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
Hey, you know where "The Old Franklin Place" is?
- "The Old Franklin Place"?
- It's an old 2-story house and... it's sitting up on the hill.
I think you have to turn on the road... back there, but I'm not real sure.
Maybe I've seen something like that up there.
But look, you boys... don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Those things are dangerous, you're bound to get hurt!
- We'll be careful.
- Don't wanna go fooling around... other folk's property.
Some folks don't like it.
They don't mind showing you.
- My father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?
- Yeah.
- Look...
I got barbecue here.
Why don't you stay a while?
The transport will be by in a little while...
I can go and get some barbecue.
Them girls, they don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Best you stick around here.
We should've asked him if there's another gas station around here.
Don't you think he would have told us if there was?
- It wouldn't hurt to ask.
- I'll go ask.
What the hell, we should have stopped back there for gas.
Go, damn it.
There.
You think this place has room service?
Franklin, you're cutting the van!
Yeah, I just started doing that.
I bet this is some of that guy's blood.
Look at that.
- Think it's his blood?
- I guess so.
That's blood, alright.
And I got cut the hell out of him, chef.
You think you could do that to yourself?
Crazy?
It takes something, though, I mean, do that to yourself, like he did.
You think I said something that made him mad?
- What?
- Franklin, you're crazy as he was.
Hey, I got us some barbecue.
Newt's the closest place to get gas.
We're going to that Granpa's place.
There's a creek, you can go swimming.
Come on, Sally, we're going to that Granpa's place!
- Let's go.
- Hey, that guy smeared blood...
- all over the van.
- Let's not waste time to wipe this up.
What?
What did you do?
You're in someone's van?
Let me see your knife.
Thank you.
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that service... station, you're towing us back in that chair.
Hey...
You think that guy was just trying to scare us by blowing out... my picture like that?
Oh, look, they let the place fall apart.
Put it over there.
- Wanna go over there?
- Let's go.
Oh, Kirk, come on!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I want to see the smear the guy made.
This is weird.
I wonder if that means something.
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's gonna get you.
- Why don't you wash it off, ok?
- I want to see inside.
- Jerry!
- Ok!
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- Get it.
You wash it up.
- You don't think that guy...
- is trying to follow us, do you?
- What for?
Where's my knife?
Kirk?
Looks like it must have been a nursery room.
This was my room.
I got to stay here until I was 8 years old.
- Until my grandmother died.
- What happened?
- To my grandmother?
- Yeah, she died.
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- I think it's seen better days...
These animals would to put me to sleep when I was a little girl.
Look at the zebra.
I had this fascination for the zebras...
Kate?
Sally!
Come on, Franklin!
It's gonna be a fun trip.
If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'll take it!
- Hey, Franklin!
- What's wrong?
Didn't you say there was a swimming well out here?
Pam and I would like to go swimming in there.
There used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
Come on.
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- We'll see them in an hour or so.
Yeah.
See them down in about an hour or so.
Sally!
Sally...
Seed growing in the world...
I don't want to miss it.
Man, a scorpion, there's a scorpion!
Crap!
This must be it!
Are you ok?
What the hell, Franklin would never get down here anyway.
I bet he must have when he was little.
Franklin never was little.
Gasoline.
I can leave my guitar, you know, I'd give him a couple of bucks...
We gotta come back by here anyway, I can pick up my guitar and... give him a couple more dollars and we get more gas...
He won't want your guitar, he's not gonna sell us some gas... let's just go back now.
Hey, come here!
Come here, look at this.
- A generator!
- What?
A generator!
For electricity!
Hey, hello!
Is there anybody in the house?
Hello!
Is anybody home?
I got something for you.
Let's go!
Hello?
Hello?
- Come look at this!
- Let's go!
Hello!
Anybody home?
Hello?
Hey, Pam!
Hello!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk?
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
He's coming to get you!
You don't think it means anything?
We'll protect you if he tries to get you.
- Maybe it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- You worry too much.
He couldn't find us, anyway.
He doesn't even know our names.
I gave him your name, Franklin.
And I told him where you lived.
I even gave him your ZIP code.
He's gonna kill you.
Jerry...
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife, remember?
When did you have it last?
I didn't have it last.
You had it last.
I gave it to you, remember?
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?
No, I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right.
I'll look for it.
Listen, I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
How do I get there, Frank?
Well, there's a trail down there.
Between the two old sheds.
- Can I go too?
- I think you'd better stay here.
All right.
I can't find it.
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.
You really are mad, huh?
I don't blame you.
Kirk!
You really didn't want me to come, did you?
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.
Did you believe all that stuff Pam was telling about?
Saturn, and retrograde, and all that?
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.
You don't think that guy is trying to follow us, do you?
I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
He'd probably find Kirk and kill him.
- Sally...
- What now?
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kirk!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Damn.
Kirk!
Are you guys in there?
Hey, guys!
Quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.
Pam, is that you?
Okay, you guys!
Come on out.
Come on!
Kirk?
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.
If they 're not back in a minute, we'd better go look for them
What if we get lost, too?
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Hey!
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
Sally...
I think we ought to go.
Are the keys in the van?
Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
What for?
Let me see the flashlight.
I'm gonna go look for them.
You don't have to go.
Sally, no, I don't think that's a good idea, Sally.
I don't think you ought to go.
Look, I'm gonna honk the horn one more time.
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No, I'm gonna honk the horn... and we will wait a minute, and they will come and we will go.
All right?
Sally, they took the keys!
We don't have any keys!
They took the keys!
Stop it!
Stop it!
- Now give me the flashlight!
- No, Sally!
You can't go!
What if they came back and we weren't here?
- Franklin, give me that flashlight!
- I'll keep the flashlight!
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right!
All right!
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you, all right?
I'll go with you, but I'll keep the flashlight.
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.
I can't push you down the hill!
Sally...
- Look, I'll go with you...
- Never mind, I'll go without it.
All right.
Sally, wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.
Sally!
Hold on a minute now.
All right, let's go.
Let's go, I'll go with you.
Sally, I can't keep up with you!
Sally!
Sally, wait a minute!
Hold on!
Jerry!
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
I thought I heard something.
There's a light!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- It looks like a house.
- Come on, push!
- It's a house!
- I can't see it very well.
- Franklin, this is impossible.
- Come on, Sally!
Get back and push, damn!
Impossible!
I heard something over there!
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!
Sally, I hear something.
Stop!
Stop!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help me, please!
- Help!
Help!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Help me!
Help me!
- Come over here!
You're all right, girl.
Okay?
Hold on, take it easy, all right?
He killed...
- Take it easy...
- He killed Franklin...
Call the police!
Jerry!
I don't know what happened to the others...
There's nobody out there now!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
What happened?
- Call the police...
- There's no phone here.
We have to drive to the sheriff's.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
I'll get the truck.
- Take it easy.
Take it easy.
- Don't go!
Don't go!

Acting on a typical day with some news... the word is that the sheriff's office began an investigation... early this morning in the County Cemetery.
Opening crypts and muslins where there was evidence of... tampering, The Sheriff found a reported dozen coffins were... robbed a part of its contents.
According to the sheriff, Rhesus...
Maldonado, there are ones from which only the head and... extremities are removed, and others and others from which only a hand or foot removed, with the... remainder of the cadaver left intact.
Maldonado linked...
What are you doing?
- You will come with me...
- No!
- What do you want?
- There's no need to do that...
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I had to lock up and get the lights off.
Because electricity is enough to drive a man out of business.
I hope you're not too uncomfortable down there.
You got nothing to worry about.
Just take it easy.
We're gonna get there soon.
No, no, no.
There's no need to do that.
We always do our best.
Hang on.
No.
Half witch.
You little shit!
You knock-head idiot!
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.
You damn fool!
You almost got caught.
No!
They didn't see me.
They don't know nothing!
I told you to stay away from that graveyard.
I told you...
I told you never to leave your brother alone!
Get that girl out of the car!
Get her out!
I hope your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.
Look at what your brother did to that door!
You let her go!
You goddamn idiot!
I thought you were in a hurry.
Where are the kids?
Where are the children?
Did they get away?
Are you sure?
You...
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!
Hey, come here!
Look!
See how nice she looks!
Get upstairs and get your grandpa!
Take it easy there, huh?
You'll stay here for a few minutes.
Get back in there!
To the chamber!
You just take it easy.
We'll have something to eat right away.
Hey, you two!
Give me a hand with grandpa!
Look, grandpa!
Look!
Knock it off!
Quiet!
You act like a pack of hounds.
- We're just having fun!
- You think this is a party?
Please!
You can make them stop!
- No shit?
- Shut your mouth!
Can't be helped, young lady.
Please!
You can't let them kill me!
He likes this face.
He's crazy!
You gotta make him stop!
Please...
- He's just a cook!
- Shut up, you bitch hog!
He always does all the work.
He don't like it.
Is that right?
You're just a cook!
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand nothing.
I understand you ain't nothing!
We do all the work!
I just can take no pleasure in killing.
It's just something we gotta do.
It don't mean you have to like it.
Please...
Please...
I'll do anything you want.
You don't need to torture the girl.
Please, shut up.
Remember you're just a cook.
Let me and him handle this.
I won't have this.
You ain't in no hurry.
And you ain't going no place.
You don't hear me?
I heard you told me much.
No sense in waiting.
I gotta go to my room.
I'll take her to grandpa.
Grandpa'll have some fun.
You always said he was the best.
He's the best all right.
Let's let him half leg.
Grandpa, we're gonna let you... have this one!
Have this one!
He won't use you much.
He won't hurt none.
Our grandpa was the best killer there ever was.
I never took all the guts to see.
I did in 6 in 5 minutes once.
I could've done more if the hook pulled again could've gotten the... beaves out of the way faster.
Now don't you cry.
Grandpa is the best.
It won't hurt a bit.
No!
No!
Please!
Don't!
Hit her!
Hit the bitch!
Go ahead!
Give me the hammer!
Give me the hammer!
I'll kill her!
Go!
Go!
A new game starting, five draw.
Five and ten draw.
Get in the game starting with R.B., J.L., L.B., S. G...
R.M., R.P., G.C., G.W., B.F., and J.B.
Five and ten draw, get in, the game's starting.
Come right in.
Five draw.
L.B. five draw.
Five and ten draw.
L.B.
Feeling lucky?
All right, sir.
Double T.
Hello, Bill.
- Put you on at five?
- Put me on at ten.
On at ten.
Poker has been around for a long time.
It sure has.
But it isn't like this anymore.
The saloon has been replaced by this... with a game that can be played in comfort and with full confidence in the management.
And here is the man who is responsible for that confidence:
Mr. Murry Shepherd.
Welcome to the California Club, where your pleasure is our business.
It has been said that nearly everyone in America understands poker... or wants to.
It is one of America's most popular games.
And since you have shown an obvious interest by coming here... we have prepared a short film to teach you the fundamentals... of the game as we play it here.
Service is our only commodity.
This film is part of that service.
The object of the game is to win the pot.
- Hope I remember that.
- There are two variations of this game:
- High draw.
The highest ranking hand wins.
- Don't give me that.
- Low draw...
- There's my baby.
...where the winning hand holds the lowest possible ranking combination of cards.
As you enter the club, the reservation and game board is located in the card room.
You must stop here and tell the boardman of your game preference.
He will enter your initials on the board... and you will be called and directed to a table by a floorman.
The floorman puts the games together... interprets and applies the rules of poker.
His decisions are final.
C. W. ten blind.
C. W. in the coffee shop.
C.W., ten blind.
C.W., double his money.
The management of the club has no financial interest in any game.
There is no house deal.
Each player plays for himself.
And each in turn acts as a dealer.
When you are seated at the game, you'll be asked to pay a rental fee... which will be collected thereafter at the beginning of each half hour.
B.D. ten blind.
B.D., ten, twenty low.
You must have a full buy-in when you are seated to begin playing.
Chips must be purchased from the chip girl.
The buy-in is determined by the limit of the game you choose to play.
You must ante before you receive cards.
The ante is placed on the number directly in front of you.
The number is also your seat number at the table.
What do you do, Lew?
I'll call.
Acquiring the knowledge and skill to play card games such as poker... is a social asset.
To make the most of this asset... it is simply good judgment to be wanted at the card table.
Shit.
Don't be a spoilsport now.
- Who's the bettor?
- $20 to you.
Me.
You're so pretty I'm going to fold.
- Is everybody out?
- That's it.
You mean I've got a goddamn six and everybody's out?
This depends even more on good manners than upon the skill of the player.
The following principle should increase one's popularity as a card player.
I need one little, teensy...
Sit erect.
- Maintain a quiet bearing.
- Come on, get on with it.
Come on, sweetheart.
- Avoid nervous habits.
- $40.
I have a seat for you.
Now come on in.
During the game, avoid conversation regarding matters not relating to the game.
I'll just have to call you.
An appearance of awkwardness and clumsiness...
I didn't think you were that good.
...gives a bad impression of one's ability to play.
Wait a minute.
What do you think you're doing?
What do you mean, "wait a minute"?
You said it was good.
No, I said that I didn't think that you were that good.
I got a seven-four.
When a hand has gone very well for you, don't talk about it.
The film you've just been viewing cannot instantly make you a good poker player.
The more skilled you become, the more pleasurable you will find the game.
- I had a feeling...
- Next year.
Raise.
Pass.
- I call.
- Well, I'll raise the raise.
- Goodbye.
- I'm out.
Out.
And one more time to you.
What a pot.
- Another $20, huh?
- The table is so slow.
- You wanted one of these.
- Go ahead, I call.
- Cards?
- Pat.
Pat.
Very interesting.
Come on.
Do you mind picking the cards up and dealing them the regular way?
You did stay pat?
You are pat?
Come on.
Wait a second, lady.
I got a big decision to make here.
I'm gonna let you break me down.
I'll let you break me down.
Two cards.
- Two beauts.
- That's very nice.
- Oh, my!
- Great catch.
- Hey, pal, that card's dead.
- What are you talking about?
- The card went off the table.
It's a dead card.
- You're absolutely right, chief.
My gratitude for your knowledge of the rules... except the card never left the table.
The card went off the table, it's a dead card.
Did you see that card go off the table?
- I didn't see nothing at all.
- It's stupid of me to ask you.
- What about you?
Did you see it?
- All I see is the time passing.
- Pop, did you see it?
- Nothing.
How much you bet?
Somebody must have seen it.
- Kenny, this is ridiculous.
- I want to change my table.
- What's the problem?
- The problem is the card went off the table... and hit the floor and he won't give it up.
There's nothing to give up.
The card never hit the floor.
- I caught it before it did.
- All right, take it easy.
Who else saw it?
- Ma'am, did you see what happened?
- I didn't see it.
- How about you, sir?
- I saw a card bounce.
I don't know what happened back here.
You dealt the hand.
You ought to know what happened.
I dealt the second one a little hard.
It never hit the floor, not even close.
Not even close?
All right, that settles it, Lew.
The rule is if the card doesn't hit the floor it plays.
Continue the hand.
- I don't have another table...
- You got your ruling, play!
Just take it easy.
It's not even close. 20-20.
20-20.
The flying card didn't stop you from betting?
40-40.
I raise.
Raise.
What could be cozier than this?
I mean, this is perfection, isn't it?
- You and me in this hand...
- That's pretty.
Just do something!
How much money you got?
How much you got left?
$17.
Not enough for the maximum bet. $3 shy.
- I bet you $17.
- Call.
- Seven smooth.
- No good.
I got a six perfect.
Sorry about...
Damn it.
That last card that went off the table was a joker.
- That's why you wouldn't give it up.
- You're ridiculous.
- You said it wasn't even close.
- That's yesterday's news.
You two are working together.
You're partners.
You two motherfucking creeps are partners.
They should put a muzzle on him.
That's it?
- That man is absolutely ridiculous.
- What's going on here?
What's going on with you guys?
- These two are working partners together.
- I never saw that man before in my life.
I saw him nobble the joker out on the last deal.
The man is totally out of line.
They've been smiling at each other all night.
Come on, will you?
- Sit down and settle down.
- Get control.
Come on.
All right.
- All right, now who else saw this?
- I didn't see it.
- What about you?
- What do you want me to say?
The man calls you a cheater.
The man doesn't know how to play poker.
The man is bad.
He's a complete asshole.
We all know that, right?
The man goes broke, he can't handle it.
The man is on tilt.
You want to hear any more?
- Not me.
- Come on, now.
You'd better just take it easy, sport, 'cause the security's liable to let you go!
Put that guy in a horror show.
That's it!
Any more fighting, and you guys go out of here for good, all right?
All right!
Miriam, what do you say?
I say I can do without any more of that language.
- Right.
- You think there's any cheating going on?
I wouldn't like to say about that.
They've been consistent winners.
And I'm a big loser.
And you know I know how to play poker.
Sour grapes, honey.
All right, let's get it back to normal.
Lousy punk.
- You're not that good.
- Up yours.
Sir, would you like another beer?
...I bet it on Notre Dame 'cause I got a feeling Notre Dame would pull it off.
They beat UCLA when they had so many games going straight.
Yeah, it's kind of similar to the Miami Dolphins.
- This particular game is duck soup.
- They won 17 games straight last year.
Come on.
I can beat that goddamn miserable game.
Don't make me beg for a stinking $30.
I'm sorry.
You know, your attitude just pisses me off sometimes, Button-nose.
Don't call me that.
Now look.
There you go again.
I'm not doing anything.
I need about $80 to get to the track.
Not bad.
- Sir, can I help you?
- Cold beer.
Keg draft.
I'm buying that man sitting over there a beer.
Turned out to be a drinking man?
Nothing personal, but I already got a beer.
Thanks.
Great.
- So, you think the Knicks are gonna win?
- Yeah.
No, Knicks ain't going to win nothing.
Willis is hurting.
Knicks ain't winning.
Celtics, this year.
You follow pro basketball?
- Anything, right?
- Whatever's going.
Yeah, me too.
Action.
Are you gonna give me the $30 or not?
I have to buy this man a drink.
Will you have a beer?
I will definitely have a beer.
Give my friend here a beer.
$1 says you don't know who Glenn Riggs is.
- What's your name?
- Vince.
The name's Vince.
Glenn Riggs was the announcer for Hop Harrigan.
- What do you want $30 for?
- I need it for that girl I got in the bathroom.
I'm only the relief bartender.
I don't go in the cash register.
- Where's Jack?
What is this?
- Jack went to a funeral.
I've been working here for one year, right?
Just give me a piece of paper, a chit.
"$30, Renee. " Okay?
If I give you $30 and I come up short, it'll be your ass.
Baby, you were born short.
And it's always my ass.
Captain Midnight!
This guy giving you trouble?
He ain't the regular man.
- $30.
- I wouldn't sign anything.
Don't sign a thing.
Don't sign anything.
What did you get her to sign?
- Here, Mother.
- Thanks, baby.
You won't be sorry.
Don't worry now, I can beat it.
Goodbye.
$20 says you can't name the Seven Dwarfs.
- I know I can name three or four of them.
- Seven.
I got seven.
- Doc.
- That's one.
- Dopey.
- That's two.
- Snoopy.
- There is no Snoopy.
There ain't no Snoopy.
I know there's Doc... there's Dopey, there's Grumpy, there's...
- You don't have $20 here.
- Wait a second.
I got $20 right here.
- I need a little help here.
What about...
- Here comes seven like a Gatling gun.
- Seven Dwarfs, I'm ready.
- Sleepy, Grumpy, Doc.
- That's four.
- That's three.
- I'm with you.
- Wait a second.
Sleepy, Grumpy, Doc.
Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey.
- Dopey.
- We got Dumbo.
- There's no Dumbo.
- Dumbo wasn't in that cast?
- No Dumbo.
- Gotcha.
- Dumbo flew.
- Well, we both lose?
Remember when Dumbo flew?
They set that little house on fire.
I've seen an elephant walk, but I never seen an elephant fly.
- My God.
- I know.
Dumbo flew.
A lot of black folks said that was bad news... seeing a black crow sing about a big flying elephant.
What's that?
It's taboo.
No black crows.
Judgment day, you know, I know
Aristis, Arastis, Johnson Brown
What you gonna do when the rent come round?
You in the park?
No, I haven't got a car.
I just live...
Not far.
I like to live close to the action, you know, William?
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
You're going to give me a lift?
That's a good idea.
You know, I know the rent means dough
Landlord gonna throw us in the co-co snow
Aroostis, Arastis, Johnson Brown
What you gonna do when the rent comes round?
What you gonna say?
How you gonna pay?
William, you're a minstrel?
Man, I hate key stuff.
Look in his side pocket.
He's got my goddamn money somewhere.
Right here.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
I hope you loved that, Funny Man.
Okay, folks, will you just relax and follow me, please?
What is this, a hospital or a jail?
What's going on?
This is William.
This is Barbara.
She's getting us out of here.
Thanks a lot.
You ever been in jail in New York?
They give you powdered eggs.
Powdered, shitty...
The shittiest food in the world.
I can't believe you haven't been in jail.
What are you doing?
Just trying some of the hot one.
It really works.
Here, you want to try some?
Come on, the heat makes it feel good.
Listen to me, I got experience.
Yeah, easy.
Just don't touch it with the can.
Easy now.
- Not bad?
- That's nice.
That's okay.
Last year, year and a half, I must have hit... about 30 different racetracks in every little town and city I've been to.
- Yeah, how'd you do?
- Tapioca time.
El Busto.
I'll give you a great ace in the hole.
If you find yourself busted in a small town...
Say, is there anything I should know about this?
Listen, fellows, it's breakfast time.
We got Lucky Charms and...
- What's with this?
- Froot Loops.
- Froot Loops?
Have some waffles...
- I'll take some coffee.
Blueberry pancakes.
You'd still be in jail if that guy hadn't given me that $50.
But... chicken.
...a strange town you head straight to the ice cream people... and pick yourself up an ice cream cart.
They got lots of them.
They don't care who you are or what you look like.
- Something to eat.
It's roughage.
- Believe me, nothing.
Desperate people.
They give you a funny little white jacket and you're on your way.
How much do you make in a thing like that?
You could pick up a snappy $25 in less than an hour.
- How do you do that?
- You keep it all.
You don't think I'm talking about working this job legit?
- Your favorite:
Lucky Charms.
- Can I have a beer, honey?
- You want a cold beer?
- No, thanks.
It goes good with your Froot Loops.
- Get some milk, honey.
- Got it.
That shaving cream's not going to stain your white sweater.
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to tell your mother.
Just put it down and it'll all wash out.
Let me taste it for you.
- What is this?
- That crap.
- Come on, we got company.
- I tried to make it look nice.
That looks better.
Here, baby.
One time, right, I had this job selling ad space in a labor union magazine.
Non-existent.
Just get on the telephone, call people and say:
"Do you want to buy some space?"
- Help yourself.
Ain't bad.
Just last night's.
- I just need the spoon.
A little pâté de foie garbage.
Then you get to keep 45% of what you pick up.
How come you don't get to keep all of it if it's non-existent?
I'm not picking it up, I'm just talking on the telephone.
- Yeah, right.
- What do you do?
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm with a magazine.
- You a writer?
- Yeah.
Say!
Do you remember the first bet you ever made on a sport event?
- Do you?
- I bet a nickel... in the 1945 World Series.
The Cubs and Tigers.
Don't laugh.
I lost.
Susan's home.
Five-cent bet and I lost.
- I didn't expect to lose.
- Susan, honey.
I didn't have the nickel, right?
So this guy Mikey asked my mother.
I've been trying to beat it ever since.
What is it?
- Did he hurt your feelings?
- No.
- You can scratch him off the book, honey.
- I don't want to scratch him off my book.
Here's the baby of the house now.
Sweetheart, would you like some Froot Loops?
- Come on.
Therapy.
- No therapy.
What's shaking, baby?
I just want to go to bed.
Take your coat off, sweetheart.
Come on, now, you're starting to get that Halloween look on your face.
It was just...
He was really different.
- Guy wasn't out of line with you, was he?
- No.
- We had such a good time.
- Yeah?
Guy was fresh, was he?
You know what he did?
He gave me $50.
- That was the deal, wasn't it?
- No, the deal was for $30.
He liked you a lot, too, sweetheart.
- How come you were picked up?
- Drunk and disorderly.
- Well, Charlie's not too good with cops.
- He certainly lets them know it.
This is the truth.
You're an animal lover, right?
The great blue whale, right?
You know about a great blue whale?
- That wrestling guy?
- No, it's a big fish.
There's only about two or three left in the world.
And the truth, the tongue of the great blue whale... weighs more than a full-grown African elephant.
- No, it's not true.
- You don't believe it?
You're just making it up to make me feel better.
'Cause you don't like to see me cry.
You feel a little better?
- Yeah, I do.
- Good.
- Who's that guy out there?
- Billy?
He's a poker friend.
- You want to meet him?
- No.
He'd spent his rent money on us.
Yeah, so we brought him home.
The girl's fine.
She just fell in love again.
She'll be okay in the morning.
Listen, William, I'm going to crash.
You can use the sofa if you want.
Thank you.
- I got to crash, too.
- Okay.
- Good night, baby.
- Good night.
I got to get my car.
I can't get my car.
There's nobody up there.
I was just looking for the Guide.
Go back to sleep.
It's Happy, Bashful, Dopey, Doc, Grumpy...
Fuck them.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Denny.
- Hello, Barbara.
This information came in for you from Chino this morning.
- Thank you, Barbara.
The dauphin in yet?
- Since 9:00 a. m.
He wanted to see you.
- What's the matter with your body?
- I had a little automobile trouble, Barbara.
- Is that him?
- It was, sir.
- Did you tell him I wanted to see him?
- I did, sir.
- What'd he say?
- He said, "Thank you. "
- He did?
- He did.
Thank you.
You're most welcome.
- These are the colors on the antique article.
- Oh, right.
I didn't know what time you'd be in, so I just picked out a few.
- I think they're your best bet.
- Thanks, Barbara.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
- Good.
How about some coffee?
- Love some.
Everybody's named Barbara.
- Hello?
- Barbara?
- Yes.
- This is Bill Denny.
Bill!
Hi.
- Is the Ice Cream Man around?
- He sure is.
Charlie, it's Bill.
- William, what's shaking?
- Hey, Charlie.
I'm at the office.
I'm reviewing things.
It sounds like a bore.
You want to track it with me?
Believe me, I'd like to... only I cannot get out.
I'm really all jammed up here.
You let a man rub some hot shaving cream on your ribs... you can take a shot with him at the track.
Listen, I know you're right, but you know, I cannot steal any more time from here.
We'll play it your way, but if you should change your mind...
I'll be at the bar in the grandstand... right above the finish line, near the $100 window, all right?
Yeah, I know the spot.
Okay, listen.
If I can, I can.
I hope you do.
Listen Charlie, thanks for an interesting evening.
Knock them dead.
Okay, I will.
Okay, so long.
It's different.
It's not my favorite, but it is different.
Who in their right mind would put a graveyard...
- on the front of the California...
- Our boss.
I mean, that's not going to sell any magazines.
Well, it's not doing so badly.
Excuse me.
Could we change seats?
No way, lady.
I'm sorry.
The last time I sat facing the rear, I never won a race.
I get sick if I ride that way.
It gets me dizzy.
Hey, miss, this lady here is going to throw up if she sits in this chair.
- Would you mind changing with her?
- I never change seats.
It's bad luck.
- She'll never change seats.
- Lady, I don't mind changing.
This lady here will change with you.
Thank you.
Great.
This lady will change with that lady, but she needs a window seat.
You change there, and I could...
- Everything okay?
Wonderful.
- Great.
Super day for the track.
- Do me a favor?
- Do you want to change seats again?
Would you see what Egyptian Femme looks like?
She's in the fourth.
- Egyptian Femme?
- Femme.
Jerry Weintraub is their manager, and he's got to have something.
Just stock, publicity stills, on, you know...
- What do you want, some 8x10s?
- Yeah.
Egyptian Femme.
The horse has run twice in two years, right?
Each time she stiffed out.
Now she steps up in class... goes up against colts, draws an inside post position in a sprint... and ain't got no speed of her own to get out there.
Is all that in there?
If you know how to read these things.
It says a lot more.
I thought I'd spare you all the gory stuff.
Egyptian Femme?
The lady's going to cap out on Egyptian Femme?
Pretty funny.
Forget that horse, lady.
I hate to see her get away.
She owes me money from last year.
Then you make a bet on her and she'll owe you money from this year.
How far is it to Chino?
- An hour and a half.
- I'm going up there.
They got it all wrong.
If you hear from the dauphin... tell him, "Much luck. "
Well, I'm holding my own.
Just don't bet the chalk.
No chalk betting here.
- Later, Ben.
- All right.
The weight factor, see?
It's the weight factor.
Excuse me.
- Hey, babe, what's happening?
- How's it going?
- How'd you do the first race?
- Not too good.
I like to stay away from the daily doubles, too.
Any info?
- Not as yet.
- If you get any information, I'll be at the bar.
- Andrew, que pasa?
- Hey, Big Charlie, what's going on?
You got a winner today?
Not yet?
Me neither.
Are you sure Egyptian Femme is not going to win?
- You want a beer?
- I don't.
I think you ought to bet on Egyptian Femme.
You're right.
Yeah?
Then why do you have four underlined?
I don't know.
I used to like Banks, the jockey, but I changed my mind.
- You're putting me on.
- Who will you bet?
- Not Egyptian Femme, I'll tell you that much.
- I'm glad you're definite.
Who do you like in the fourth, pal?
William, you made it.
Glad to see you, William.
How you feeling?
Not bad.
I got a little pain here and here, otherwise I couldn't be better.
- Give my friend a beer.
- Want to give my friend here a beer?
I asked first.
I'm telling you another half inch to the left of center...
- That's no good here, Charlie.
- No, this is on me.
- It's on me.
You just keep it all.
- Any time.
You keep it all.
Your money's no good here, pal.
Don't you appreciate a man who gets you in the goodies?
He gave me a kick where I'm breathing and I'm pretty lucky to be here.
Now, how did you manage it?
How'd you get away from work?
I wish I was as good at this as I am at getting away from work.
Razzle-dazzle.
The minstrel man strikes again.
I know.
After today you're gonna have enough money to open up a string of parking lots.
- It looks that good?
- 20-to-1 in the morning line ain't tin.
- You really like it?
- Fucking gold, babe.
- Who's the horse?
- Número uno.
Egyptian Femme.
Tough to figure, right?
He doesn't seem to like to run a lot.
- She, it's a lady.
- Right.
It's beautiful.
Just right.
They've been shopping for a big price... today we're going to nail them.
- Not much to recommend.
- The rest are a bunch of dogs, too, right?
Believe me, she'll pay.
$4 million and change.
If you think the inside post position is bad, she's got a lot of speed, wire to wire.
You're really not worried, are you?
This horse owes me and owes my friend, owes everybody around here.
- We're taking down today, my friend.
- I'd like to toast that, pal.
- Let's go see a man about a horse.
- A man about a horse.
Excuse me.
Where is she?
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Come on.
Don't stop!
Go!
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Stay up there!
- Come on, Valdez!
- Who's Valdez?
Valdez is the jockey!
Come on, Valdez.
Come on, Valdez.
Keep it up there.
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
He'll make a move now.
- Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Stay up there!
- Come on, Valdez!
And he wins!
Take it down.
Come on, we win this race.
We won that race going away.
That was a race.
Did you see that race?
- I mean, Valdez...
That race was fantastic.
- We didn't see the tote board.
- Did you see the other horse?
- We win this race.
I've never done this.
I've never come out...
- Will you trust me?
We won.
- Let's see the photo, man.
Photo finish?
We won going away.
- What were you watching?
- I was watching this race.
Just a little razzle-dazzle.
Can you be happy now?
- I've never done this before.
- The horse wins.
- We're a winner.
- The horse did not win!
Nobody says that.
This is called counting your chickens.
- Chickens and counting chickens?
- Before they're hatched.
You spend a whole life out here and you have a 20-to-1 shot...
Come on, fellows.
Will you get it up here?
I'm telling you, we win the race.
- What is it?
- Goddamn one horse.
Egyptian Femme!
Egyptian Femme won!
Where've you been?
That's what I said.
I can't believe this!
I had that horse!
You rotten creep!
Hey, you!
You said Egyptian Femme had no chance!
The horse won!
Whose money is that?
Had no chance?
- Lady, don't throw oranges.
- The horse had no chance?
The horse had no chance?
You knew it all along!
Are you crazy?
God damn it, lady, you don't throw oranges on an escalator!
Come on, lady, get back!
How's that, lady?
- That's my hat!
- Now, you stop throwing oranges.
Stop it!
- Give me my goddamn hat!
- Stop it!
- You thief!
- You want your purse?
That horse owes me more money!
Here, you want your money?
Take your goddamn...
You asshole, you can't even throw!
Wonder where he's going to take us for dinner tonight?
Who knows?
But wherever it is, it'll be delicious.
- I hope it's the Scala.
- That'd be great.
We can have all that Italian food we love.
We can have mozzarella marinara... and eggplant parmigiana...
- Honey, there he is.
- Zabaglione for dessert.
Now sit down, act natural.
Say, what is this?
Surprise!
No, it's not.
- Hey, baby.
- We're going to make it.
Here you are, Mr. Tenor, and thank you.
- That was delightful.
- Birthday greetings!
Go on.
- Who's that wonderful guy out there?
- That man's a tenor.
- We want you to have the big evening...
- We can't have the big evening tonight.
- She and I got a date.
- What are you talking about?
- You're not working tonight?
- Yes, we are.
I saw you eating your breakfast.
Now I think I'm going to play the piano.
Which way is it?
Honey, sweetheart, it's a very important party.
It's very, very important...
Okay, that's it.
That's it now.
All right, stop it now.
All right.
Stop the music.
Stop.
We're expecting Mr. Kramer.
We loved all the gifts.
We love everything.
- Are we out of here?
- Yeah.
...should've been there when you came to the door.
But it's $150 apiece for the evening for dinner.
- What?
- This evening at $150 each.
- Are we out of here?
- $150.
All we have to do is go to dinner.
Maybe Mr. Kramer wants to give Bill and me $75 apiece.
- Bill's awful pretty to show off.
- I don't know how to take that.
Not at all.
We can tell him we're sick.
Now I get the feeling I'm being mugged by my friend.
- No, this is not right.
- All right, Bill, out the door.
I'm waiting to say goodbye.
You ladies, now, I mean, we're gonna...
- It sure was nice.
- Go in there.
- Sit down and act natural.
- I think you're unfair.
Susan and Barbara must not be deprived of our companionship tonight.
Certainly not.
- They were looking super.
- Should we look inside?
Absolutely.
Mr. Kramer must be some funny dude.
- Hi.
- It's me.
Do you remember me?
- Of course I remember you.
- Is there anyone else?
- No, there's just us.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
- Okay.
- Sweetheart, you look terrific.
- Do you like it?
Yeah.
- You smell wonderful.
- Thank you.
I'm so glad you like it.
- What are you wearing?
- Thank you.
What are you...
- It's Joy, isn't it?
- No, it's Shalimar.
- Shalimar.
- Do you like it?
- Oh, God.
- Mr. Chan!
- Shalimar is my favorite perfume.
- It's mine, too.
Do you like the dress?
I had it...
Yes, I had it made in Omaha.
Yeah, but I just...
I just never had the balls to wear it, you know, outside.
- Well, honey, it's sexy...
- I love the dress.
- Listen to me.
- Dignified.
- Elegant.
- It is.
It's elegant.
Listen, tonight we're gonna go to Chasen's.
Chasen's tonight.
- And then I've got a great big surprise.
- What is it?
After Chasen's, what?
- I don't know if I should tell you.
- Tell us.
A little hint.
- Tell, please.
- Go ahead.
- It has something to do with music.
- Music.
You know?
Listen, before we go, let's have a cocktail.
I made us some daiquiris.
- How about it?
- Thank you.
- I'll get yours.
- Thanks.
You're my best friends.
- Really?
- Thank you, Helen.
Yeah, now you want to give this to Helen.
Honey, don't drink it.
Give it to Helen.
It's just taking forever.
What is that?
I might have to take the top off.
Okay, give this one to Helen.
Shake it up a bit.
That's for Helen now.
That's good.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Hurry, Barbara, I want to make a toast.
- Okay.
Great.
To Helen and her new look.
- Yes, you look great.
- Elegant.
- Yes, elegant.
- Thank you.
- Wonderful.
- Who's that?
- Wait a minute.
Are you expecting anyone?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.
Don't worry, honey, I can take care of it.
Don't worry.
- She can take care of it.
- I hope so.
She can take care of it.
She takes care of everything.
She does, really.
I'll take care of you.
- Okay, ladies, Vice.
We're Vice.
- Vice?
Detective Waters and this is Detective Denny.
Which one of you girls is Barbara Miller?
- Barbara, you didn't say...
- The young one must be Susan Peters.
You damn cops just can't come in here...
Be quiet, and don't call us damn cops.
- What's your name, honey?
- Brown.
- Brown, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- First name?
- Helen.
- Helen Gurley Brown?
- No, sir.
What's going...
Hey, come on now.
- It's not a laughing matter, girls.
- Close the door, will you?
- The door.
- Close the door.
And check the premises for any marijuana or pot or firearms.
- I'm gonna check.
- I do not like the feel of this.
- You can't search this house without...
- You just be quiet, lady.
We'll run you downtown.
You feel like being frisked?
- No.
- You can't frisk a sweet old woman...
Yeah, well.
- Shalimar?
- Yes, sir.
- Smells good.
- Thank you.
- You got a cold?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, yeah.
- Here's a sourball.
- No, thank you.
- It's good for your throat.
- I don't even want this drink.
- Take a sourball.
- Got one for me?
Yeah, I got one for you.
You're like a more responsible older woman than these girls.
- Are you misleading these young girls?
- No, I'm not.
- She's just a friend.
- They're not friends.
They're not?
Why are you here?
- I'm a friend of their aunt's.
- Don't talk like that.
Shut up.
We'll take them downtown and book them.
- Run them right downtown.
- Let's take them in.
- Charlie, let me have a word with you.
- You stay right there.
Be quiet.
They're not friends of mine.
I'm a friend of their aunt's.
- What do you think, pal?
- The one in the middle looks dangerous.
- Her mouth turns down...
- I know.
I don't trust her.
I think we ought to take her down and book her.
How about we book the two on the end and let the one in the middle go?
- You're feeling sorry for her, huh?
- I think so.
I'll make an exception.
You're sure?
Helen, stand back and look at me when I talk to you.
Sorry.
- You look like a very well-dressed woman.
- I am.
- Good background.
Well-educated.
- That's right.
Religious.
My partner and I are gonna believe that you had nothing to do with...
- what's going on on the premises and that...
- I'm just a friend.
Believe me.
But we do feel that you should vacate the premises immediately.
- Bless you.
- Bye, Helen.
Take care of your cold, sweetheart.
Shut the door, Helen.
Bye.
- You people ought to be arrested.
- Jesus Christ!
- I can't believe you did that.
- What was that?
I love your brown shawl.
- Now, let's get...
- You're not really a policeman, are you?
No.
Do you think if I was a cop I would arrest you?
People, now how does Mexican food sound to you?
- Mexican food.
- That sounds delicious.
Do we have time to change our clothes?
Get out of your work clothes and into something comfortable.
Don't take too much time or we'll take Helen.
Excuse me.
And here we go.
You're crazy.
It's a bet.
The black guy over there.
What's his name?
The black guy?
- Take him out with a good punch.
- Come on, baby.
Boy, do we got Morgan.
Place your bet.
What do you want to bet?
$40 and $60.
I bet you even your man don't stop my man.
- You got it.
- Even money.
Come on, sit down, lady, sit down.
Come on, Roy.
We got the first round now.
You got the money they're floating you, right?
$15 on Collins.
Yeah.
Okay.
Collins is a wonderful guy.
Got good marks in school.
I know him.
He just don't fight too good, though.
He ought to be playing baseball or something.
Want another $15 on this?
No, I got one bet left.
I'm gonna bet for your hat, man.
I wanna win your hat.
My man's gonna win this fight, yeah.
- You want my hat?
My Bell Helmet hat?
- Yeah, right.
- Give it to him.
- Here, you got it.
- $10.
Right.
- For your shirt.
- Get in there!
- Keep working!
Get in there!
I think that we won all three rounds.
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.
I'll take the hat now.
You've seen Sugar Ray knock out Foreman.
Come on, people.
Thank you very much.
Come on, let's get out of here now.
Okay, you lay me 10-to-5.
I got suit and you got the lumberjack.
You gotta be nuts.
Why, lumberjack has got to be 2- to-1 over a suit, anytime.
- Okay.
They both can't fight.
- Come on.
- $1,580.
- We're all winning.
Winning all over the place now.
The moon is shining high
Definitely, we'll have to take care of you girls to make up for that silly old man.
But we're gonna make up for Mr. Helen Gurley.
- What's the agenda?
- Right now we're off to the Latin Quarter.
Now, Latin Quarter.
We'll go dancing.
We'll go anywhere you say now.
I mean, you and me are knocking them dead with this $1,580.
Stick 'em up.
I'm sorry I hit your...
- Put her in the car, man.
- Stick 'em up, man.
I don't believe it.
It's hard to believe.
Wait a second.
Put the money on the table.
I can hardly believe this right now.
I'll blow your fucking face off.
- Don't you believe it?
- Will you do what he tells you?
- I don't believe this.
Relax.
- I'll blow your fucking head off.
Wait.
You're not blowing nothing off.
I don't believe it.
We're getting robbed two nights in a row.
- Put the money on the table.
- Do what he tells you.
Please, Charlie.
Wait a second now.
Okay, here's $780, man.
That's it.
You got half and we're taking half.
Take the money and run.
Go ahead, $780, man.
Don't think about it.
Take the money and go.
Get out of here, you fucking bum!
Get out of here, man!
Cut our winnings in half.
- I call.
- I call.
- Take your hand off my knee, will you?
- I dropped a card.
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Your hand is dead.
- I can't help it, I dropped it.
- Then your hand is dead.
Hand's dead.
- Come on, let's go.
- What do you want?
She was aces full.
And what did you have, four what?
Hey, let her play her own cards.
Come on, girls.
This ain't Santa Anita.
You're playing poker.
You girls are sure getting good cards, huh?
You girls friends from way back?
You two?
- No, we don't even know each other.
- I've never seen her before.
I don't care how old you are.
Right in the choppers, lady.
- Come on, be nice, will you?
- The lowest you can get.
- I fold.
- I will raise you.
I call.
I don't want you to see it.
- All right, let's ante up.
- All right.
- All right, everybody in.
- That's right.
Why don't you go home...
You're burying me here.
Get a Chinaman in this game.
- We're falling apart.
- I fold.
Man, I don't even understand what you were trying to tell me.
You figure you're entitled to a free shot...
- I never said I was entitled to a free...
- Then what are we talking about?
When have I never paid you your money, Spark?
- Laying the thug routine on you?
- It's not the question of paying.
You do not pay me on time and time is the thing.
- You know, week to week I pay you...
- I understand that, Spark.
Why do you think you can do that stuff?
You've owed me for nine months.
All right, I did.
Let's make a deal.
Tell him you're sending him some Green Stamps.
How many times have I told you I do not wish to be interrupted... when I'm in conference with Mr. Waters?
- Listen.
You told me four times.
- Get out of here, will you?
- He wants to see you now.
- Tell him he's talking to a thug.
Tell him he'll get his legs broke.
I'll tell him his legs are broken, that's why he can't see him.
Here is the deal:
Ten days.
You don't cut me off for 10 days... and you got your money in your hands.
That's it.
That's my word.
Okay, let me tell you my situation.
All right?
- You wanna hear that?
You care?
- Okay, Spark.
I am getting buried at this point.
I mean, it's been a very bad day.
I understand that, Spark.
I cannot carry you for more than 10 days.
Ten days, that's it.
- I mean, if it's 11 days...
- No 11 days.
- It cannot be.
- Right.
No stories, nothing.
Ten days.
- What if you lose more money?
- Even if I should lose more money.
- You're gonna be able to handle that?
- Right.
Tell him to get Preparation H. Do him good.
Will you give me a break?
- You're going to get it?
No stories?
- I've got it.
I just didn't wanna tap the source...
I didn't want to do it that way, but I'm gonna.
- What do you want?
- What are the Lakers?
Five and a half.
Okay, Spark, I'll call you back.
Five and a half will make you laugh.
Bet your house on this game... lay the five and a half, you get out tonight.
- I don't know, Charlie.
- I know.
If I had an estate in the country I would lay it and tap out on the Lakers.
They're covering tonight.
- This game scares me, Charlie.
- No, don't be frightened.
Now Mr. West, Mr. Goodrich, Mr. Cook's Forum, tonight... they blow the Suns out.
Where do you get your confidence?
The Lakers have been playing crappy... and the Suns are hot.
- Come on, so the Lakers lose two in a row.
- Four in a row.
Right.
And, believe me, it doesn't matter.
- Phoenix wins two or three in a row.
- Five.
Five in a row?
Playing pretty good.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
- Don't matter.
This is the double reverse.
You lay the five and a half... and you bet your house on it.
You've been saying this for weeks.
I'm lucky I don't own much property.
Barbara, I really like these red Christmas bulbs.
You think next year we should do the whole Christmas tree in them?
Don't you think that's a bit on the nose?
- Hi.
How are you?
- How you been?
Fine.
- I was just driving by, thought I'd say hello.
- Good.
- What are you all doing?
- I'm cleaning out the car.
I'm putting up the Christmas tree lights.
- Charlie up yet?
- No.
- Yeah.
Up and gone.
- Yeah?
Where'd he go?
I don't know.
He got up so early I couldn't believe it.
- Listen, come on in for some coffee.
- No, I can't.
Thanks.
Just one cup of coffee.
I'll take a rain check.
- All right.
Bye, Bill.
- Nice seeing you.
- How are you?
- Bill Denny.
What are you doing here?
I checked at the other store and they said you might be over here.
Wait a minute.
Don't tell me why you came.
I'm getting a flash.
You see, I have a good amount of ESP.
I'm blessed with it.
My wife kids me about it, but she respects it when I get these flashes.
Let me see how close I can get to what's going on here.
I get that you're probably back with your old lady... and you want to paint your garage door, perhaps even the whole front of your house.
Yes, I'm getting the color.
It's a greenish color.
Right?
How close did I get?
I need a loan, Harvey.
- A loan?
- Yeah.
- How are you?
- Terrific.
- What's your name?
- Larry.
Larry, I know you're going in here to win a bundle.
Why don't you come and see me when you come out?
- He would like to see Nugie, please.
- Okay, come on in.
Just go on in through the kitchen.
They're in the other room.
- Nugie, there's a guy here.
- Yeah.
- Howdy.
- Howdy, Nugie.
- Trouble finding this place?
- No, it's fine.
There's some crap in the kitchen if you want...
- No.
I'm fine.
- Grab a chair.
- Three, six, nine.
- What've you got?
Jack, five, seven.
I don't know who you know here.
This is Bill.
Four, five, six.
What're you doing?
You're gonna play chess.
I call.
Six card low ball.
Forced to bet the first high card.
$3 the third and fourth card. $6...
Let's keep the game moving.
Three.
Bet him, Nugie.
Terrific.
True love never runs smooth.
- I bet $3.
- Force the bet to $30.
I raise it $3.
First high card. $3 the third and fourth card.
Fifth card six. $12.
- No check and raise.
- Check and raise.
- Three dollars to you, he raised you.
- What's the buy-in?
$200 buy-in.
Help the man.
$3.
I don't know.
How about this?
- Very nice.
- Feel free, man.
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, anytime.
They get me, man.
Don't worry.
Next week you'll beat their brains in.
There you go.
Would you like to see a menu?
No.
- Hi, Sparkie.
- How are you, honey?
Right over here.
- Hiya, baby.
- What happened to your leg?
Dumbness.
Don't play ball after 15 years, I can tell you that.
I didn't know you played ball.
- Actually, I did, you know.
With the Pirates.
- You're kidding.
No, nothing important.
No, I don't want the menu.
- Give me the real hot chili.
All right?
- Sure.
- Sangria?
- All right.
- You want some chili?
- No, I'm fine.
They got great zucchini in here.
You want that?
- Class-A boy?
- No.
I had a shot for...
Well, it wasn't a shot, it was just...
What do you make my figure to be?
As your carry-over I got you down for $2,200.
It's a tough week, baby.
No, that's okay.
I'll tell you... this guy, Lloyd Harris, who's the honcho where I work... he had a very good Christmas season.
What he's created is a slush fund...
You're not telling me a story now, are you?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Come on...
I mean, I carried you one year.
Am I right?
- Was there any pressure put on you?
- No, you were very nice.
Forget nice.
I don't give a fuck about nice.
You know that that year...
Please just forget about this.
Now the point is, this is totally different.
- It's strictly on a cash basis.
I told you that.
- Right.
Did I tell you that I got hurt in two busts, that my parents were here... that I'm getting killed all over the fucking place?
I mean, I told you this up front.
Did I not tell you that?
I'm asking you a question.
Did I not tell you that?
Okay, I beat you.
Ten days later you come to me... and you don't have any money.
You're out of line already... but I extend that.
I mean, I extended it to you.
You said you'd have the cash.
You got things going.
I don't know what you're saying.
But you're gonna have the money, you have a way to get it.
I mean, did you not say that?
What you're trying to tell me is, come payoff day... you don't have dollar one, plus you owe me more.
Man, I've heard it before.
You don't have dollar one, do you?
You think I'm some stupid schmuck you're dealing with.
I got to tell you something, pal.
In my line of thinking, you took a total, out and out shot at me...
- Look, Spark, that's not it at all.
- What is it then?
Listen to me.
I got $700 for you tomorrow.
Why didn't you say that in the beginning?
Why didn't you say it?
Because you didn't give me a chance.
- What about the other $1,500?
- One week.
I'll tell you, boy...
What's wrong, Sparkie?
Don't you want your chili?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.
- What?
- Want some chili?
Sport, you wanna fill this up?
Give Sergio something?
You gonna fill this up or not?
Thanks.
- Righto.
- You know Jenny Carr?
Coming.
She's shacking up with my old man.
He gave me this watch for Christmas.
I don't ever take it off.
Ain't it pretty?
You can even wear it in the tub with you.
What are you having?
Cognac?
I don't believe these guys fucking around the way they do.
Jesus, I'd never do anything like that.
Nobody's even going today.
- You, where'd you get that tee-shirt?
- Playing softball.
- What position do you play?
- Any position.
Yeah?
I like shortstop myself.
I got this neat dog.
It's all fluffy and darling.
Did you hear me?
I hear you.
You got a dog.
What the fuck am I doing in this dump anyway?
You should've seen the place where I was last night.
It was really classy.
- Any chance you could go back there?
- No, classy places don't open this early.
The only trouble with my dog is, he shits on the floor... and I don't know what to do about it.
What do you do about it?
You know?
- You try cleaning it up?
- Yeah, I tried that.
It didn't do any good.
He just sits there and looks at me.
Just some dumb fuck like all the men around here.
Bunch of faggots.
I bet they can't even get it up.
Shit.
What am I doing here?
Fuck you, faggot!
You want some more nuts?
Is that you, Barbara?
- It's Bill.
- Come in.
- Come in?
- Yeah, the door's unlocked.
Come in.
Right.
- Is Barbara not here?
- She's out on a date.
- What are you doing?
- Reading my book.
I don't like to stay in my room at night when no one's here.
We're going to Hawaii tomorrow for two weeks.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we're really excited about it, too.
I'll bet.
Charlie never did come back.
Do you know what happened to him?
Do you want to come in and sit down?
Yeah, okay.
You're married, aren't you?
What difference does it make?
It doesn't make any difference.
- We're separated.
- Yeah?
Who are you going to Hawaii with?
Just a couple of guys.
These friends of Barbara's.
- I don't even know them.
- You don't even know them?
Suppose you don't like them?
Those are the chances you have to take.
You wanna make love to me?
Right now?
- It has crossed my mind.
- It has?
This sounds silly, but I don't have any money.
That's okay.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I mean, I really like you.
I mean...
- it's different.
- It's different?
Why is it different?
I mean, I really like you.
I really like you a lot.
You brought me that dog.
Took me to the fights.
It was like a real date.
I think I'm gonna kiss you.
- Isn't this Barbara's room?
- She doesn't care.
- Having trouble?
- Not anymore.
- It's okay, I'll do it.
- I got it.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
You're taking so long.
You didn't unzip it all the way.
You can't take my foot off with the boot.
No.
You gotta unzip it first.
You're kind of clumsy.
I can get it.
Do you want me to do it?
- I can do it.
- I'll do it.
- It's all right.
- I'll do it.
- What you doing?
- We're going to use your bed, okay?
Great.
I just have to find my TV Guide.
I think it's under the bed.
I think it's under here.
Shit, I can't tell you what a crappy evening I had.
Son of a bitch almost threw up all over me.
Damn guy.
Well, he already paid me, so I guess it's...
- How was your evening?
- Great.
I'm having a good time.
Good.
One of us is lucking out.
There it is.
Got it.
Here, I got it.
Got it.
- Where did he go?
- He's gone.
Darling, come on.
Come on, sweetheart.
That's a girl.
That's a girl.
There.
- He didn't really like me.
- Of course he did.
No, he didn't.
Not really.
Honey, think about tomorrow.
I met the guy you're going with tonight.
What's he look like?
He's dark, he has a five o' clock shadow.
- Is he young?
- Yes.
- And good-looking?
- Yes, he is.
- Do you really think I'm going to like him?
- I think you'll love him.
Really?
...over here at high post, to Meyers, open at 15, hits.
...over here at high post, to Meyers, open at 15, hits.
David Meyers, 92-65.
Clay up the middle Shumate getting it out of backcourt himself... dribbles all the way, blocked by Drollinger...
- Who is it?
- Does a William Denny live here?
Who is it?
- You William Denny?
- Who wants to know?
Well, open the door, we'll talk.
- Who are you?
- Friend of Spark.
Listen, I checked with Spark, and we're straight.
So what's the problem?
I'm straight with Spark.
Why don't you check with Spark and then check back?
Where the hell have you been?
Three guesses.
I'll give you this much, my hat is a clue.
Son of a bitch!
Why didn't you tell me you were going?
It was a spur of the minute thing, William.
I had this incredible dream, right?
I'm in Tijuana, at the dog track.
And I sweep the card.
Every dog I bet on, William... wins like a champ.
What do you know about dogs?
But whatever I'm feeling, William, winner.
Fantastic.
Taking down the cash.
Why didn't you tell me?
Maybe I would've liked to go with you!
You don't know what it's been like.
You want to get to Tijuana, right?
El Sweepo.
I don't win one fucking race.
Maybe if I'd been there you would have.
You weren't in the dream, William.
My parrot was in the dream.
It was a hell of a handicap.
He said, "Bet number four.
Polly want a four. "
He doesn't eat nothing, doesn't dirty nothing.
It's going to be all right.
I just need the typewriter.
What have I got?
Packing it all up and moving to Europe to paint?
Yeah.
I'm going to Reno.
I think they've changed the rule, you can't bet your typewriter.
Cash, you know.
Well, a guy told me they got 40-80 low-ball stud game... and a man can win a lot of money.
Sounds interesting.
But why Reno?
Vegas figures to have the same kind of game and it's closer.
Fine.
You go to Vegas, I'll go to Reno.
Reno.
Sounds like you might have a nice shot in a game like that...
- if you have enough money behind you.
- I'm going to win.
- I don't know, William.
- I do.
Reno, that game.
Sounds like a tough game, tough action, William... with a lot of these lumberjacks going up there.
Cowboys, rich guys.
- Tough action, William.
It's a tough game.
- Nobody's asking you to play, pal.
What's with you?
I don't like you coming in here with all your pessimistic shit.
- I don't know what's bugging you...
- I know how I feel.
Let's see...
Yeah, how do you feel?
- Pal, I'm going to win!
- Yeah?
So win!
Who the fuck is stopping you?
Go ahead and win.
- Stop interfering.
I don't interfere with you.
- Who's interfering with you?
I ain't interfering with you.
Look, I know how I feel.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Is that clear?
Because I know how I feel.
Baby, I'm gonna win.
I believe you.
William, did I ever show you my one-armed piccolo player?
The man is a classic.
The man is world-renowned.
William, you got to check this out.
William, for me.
You got to check this out, William.
The man is known all over the world.
Now listen.
Just watch me.
When I reach my crescendo, for me, you got to give me a little hand.
A little applause, William.
Okay?
Right?
Ladies and gentlemen, your beloved, world-renowned, one-armed piccolo player.
The hand, now.
A little applause.
Come on.
Thank you very much.
- You need a partner?
- What?
- A partner?
- Yeah.
I think so.
- You going to take it away now?
- I'm going to stab myself, William.
Get on him.
Good shot.
Fourteen all.
Come on, they're killing us.
- Too quick for the old people.
- I got him.
- Fourteen all.
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
- Way off.
- Free throws.
Free throws.
Get it up.
Shit.
Rebound.
Yours, yours.
- You got a lot of merchandise.
- Yeah, and I want a lot of money.
Here you go.
Are you selling it or making a loan?
- Which is going to give me more money?
- If you sell it.
I'm selling it.
Move faster.
Here we go.
- That's game.
- Nice shot.
You jerk.
- Way to work on the old man.
- Come on, careful, old man.
The man beat you by 20 points.
I'll tell you what.
Do I need a handicap?
I'll play one on one for whatever you got in your pockets.
- For real money?
- Real money, right.
- For real dollars.
- For real dollars?
I don't see no Walt Frazier or Jerry West here.
You're going to lose your money.
That's what I'm here to do is to lose.
You choose.
Get your money together.
Don't go anywhere, man.
Stay right there.
- I'm standing right under the hoop.
- Fine.
You got some money?
- I got $10.
- I got it.
What have you got?
- You got the money?
- I got it.
You know, this is stupid.
I can't believe this sucker.
I got $10.
- What've you got?
- Got $30.
- I got $10.
- That's $40.
- I've got $5.
- $49.
- That's $49.
- Look at him pulling up his socks.
You got some money, old man?
- What you guys get together?
- We got $49.
- You been returning your deposits?
- That's right.
$49?
You got $1?
I got $50 here.
Okay, here's the game.
You're holding, right?
- Who am I playing?
- You got me, buddy.
- I got the shooter?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Hit or miss for the ball.
- I got the ball.
What is it, 11 hoops?
- That's all right.
Eleven hoops?
- Don't worry about it.
- Come on.
Come on, Russ.
- Now beat him.
- Good.
What's that?
Five?
Come on, man.
What do you think you are doing?
The Blue Book gives $2,400.
- But I can't give you $2,400.
- What do you mean?
With this gas shortage, more people are buying little motorcycles... and bicycles than they are cars.
I'm afraid I just can't find a buyer.
The result is official.
No, man, I got to sell it today.
I tell you, I just can't do it today.
I'll give you $2,200.
- $2,200?
That's the best you can do?
- Final offer.
- Let's go.
- Follow me.
My man!
What's happening?
Any big winners?
You like anything in the sixth?
I'm getting buried here.
How you doing?
Nothing?
Yeah, okay.
You just save your winnings.
I'll see you later.
Let me see your driver's license, kid.
Sports Tie, next time put some booze in it.
Trainer Ralph Cripes, please report to the jockey's room.
You know that guy with the mustache?
The big guy who was just standing here?
- The guy talking about watery drinks?
- Yeah, you know him?
- He's a creep.
- Yeah?
Get me a beer, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen, in the ninth race, a jockey change.
Number Three, Fearless Fred, will be ridden by jockey Rick Carey.
Light Touch, where's my drink?
I left a drink here.
Where is it?
All right, forget it.
Give me straight Scotch.
Straight.
You can't fool around with that.
Take them home again, mama.
Thank you, sir.
That'll be $1, sir.
And you got it.
There's $1 for you, my man.
Thank you.
- A friend of yours?
- My cousin.
Watch where you're going, you little bastard.
Stupid little bum.
Handsome, I must talk to you.
Oh, my God!
What a punch.
Stupid clown.
It's the greatest punch I've ever been hit with.
You busted it clean, right?
Oh, beautiful, man.
You blow my mind.
Kick me in the nuts... you break my nose, rob my money.
You gotta be kidding.
Get out of my way or I'm gonna kill you.
Where're you going?
I mean, I wouldn't lie to you, that is...
Get the hell out of here!
It wasn't as good as yours, but I'll live with it.
Enough, man.
That's enough.
No.
You're a man who knows that ain't enough.
Do you wanna level your own goods?
Nose, ribs, cash.
I ain't such a funny man.
Looks like I hit me a round robin.
You creep... you stick a little toilet paper in your nose, it stops the bleeding.
You better call an ambulance.
The man lost the last race.
He tried to kill himself.
Lunatic.
$1,800.
$1,123.
You have $1,800.
Okay, here's $1,100, you put in $1,100 and then we're partners.
We're definitely partners.
I mean, we're total partners.
I'm putting in $1,800, you're putting in 1,100 'cause I'm not going to lose.
I'm gonna win.
That's the last time you've heard the word "lose. "
Exactly.
The door opened the other way and hit me right on the nose.
It's an omen.
The snow is an omen and the toilet door is an omen.
Absolutely.
Hello, Reno.
Sun's coming out.
This rain could have been snow, William.
Very good vibes.
- Good sign.
- Yeah.
Feels good.
Red carpets on the street, right?
Men in orange suits.
Where else but in the USA, right?
But we got to stop off here and play a little slot machines.
Just a little bit, right?
No, you want to get straight to the game?
Gotcha.
Boy, you're walking fast, man.
Good.
Keeping going.
Gotta give you a little smile every now and then.
- I won't break your concentration.
- Concentration?
This must be the place, William.
You ask the guy over here.
- Which way to the poker room?
- To your left.
Charlie, please come here a minute.
Stop wasting time.
Look, I'm not superstitious... but touch Dumbo's trunk before we start to play.
For me, right?
Ever seen an elephant fly?
A little rub.
Okay.
Oh, yes.
We're all together.
Keno?
Keno.
We got to touch a little keno, too.
Who knows, we might get the $25,000 jackpot.
- This is it?
- I think this must be the place.
I don't know if these are past winners or losers.
- Deuce and pair.
- Ten?
William, I think it's heaven.
Hi, fellows.
What can I do you for?
I'll have some JB Scotch straight, with some soda water on the side.
William, have a drink.
It'll loosen you up.
No, I'll have some coffee.
- The coffee's right over there, honey.
- William, you are a straight dude.
Coffee.
Just keep it together.
Don't get in the way of the concentration.
Ace, you're the boss.
It's a sweet game, it is. $2,000 buy-in, right?
You fellows here to drink or play?
My partner here is the player and I guess I'm the drinker.
Hughie?
Player.
Next up.
You're low.
Let's run them down.
Let's start with the bald guy with the moustache.
- The tightest player there.
- Absolutely right.
Percentage player, doesn't take many chances, right?
No flair.
The guy I say is part of a two- or three-man combination.
No sweat, but if you find him after the fourth card, you're not in the hand... unless you've got the nuts.
Right.
Cowboy.
Lyndon Johnson is definitely his hero.
I figure he owns a piece of the town.
Haberdashery, looks like he sells cowboy hats.
He's got the rhythm of the game.
It's his rhythm, but with your natural ability and your strength... you don't have to let him have much.
Keep talking.
The kid?
He's seen The Cincinnati Kid too many times.
He's been trying to beat this game from before he was born, right?
I got him.
On to Specs.
He's a doctor and he's been here playing this game forever, right?
- He'd rather lose a patient than a hand.
- Very good.
Not much of a problem, he don't want to get involved too much.
Red Coat.
Red Coat.
My call is small-time, right?
That's your chair, right?
One-time buy-in and he used to be a cha-cha dancer.
I don't know, but that guy's falling out and that's where you're gonna sit.
Empty chair.
Who could tell?
Bit of luck.
Very tall stack of chips.
A little impressive, but unless it's Claude Rains in The Invisible Man... and you see your chips floating up away from you... you know the game is too tough for us and we go on till we hit something else.
How about Bright Eyes?
Man sitting there?
Deep drawl, Mississippi, best in the game.
I figure he learned to play in the Ku Klux Klan... with a big sheet over his head.
Tough man.
What's the Chinaman's story?
The Chinaman.
What can I say?
Looks like he's a royal prince.
His father probably made a fortune selling frozen egg rolls, right?
When he starts talking, when he starts yapping... you know he's cracking.
I got to have a drink.
Give me a double Scotch, will you?
I'm beginning to feel the pressure.
- You did very well.
- You want cognac in your coffee?
Keep passing.
Okay, he goes once more.
- I'm all in.
- He's all in for $70.
There goes the chair.
It's the one we picked.
Goodbye, Mr. Cha-cha.
I got a straight flush going to the deuce.
- Eight and seven.
- Six high.
- Doc is the winner.
You win it all, Doc.
- Too tough for me, gentlemen.
Sorry to see you go.
So long.
Seat open.
You're on, baby.
And a new player.
$2,000 buy-in.
Purples are $100, reds are $20 and the yellows are $5.
He's supposed to be playing, right?
- He's a dynamite poker player.
- Is he?
He needs to be dynamite in that company.
- I'm Bob Hood.
- How are you?
Bill Denny.
Good to see you, Bill.
Any major moves in the game?
Any big winners or losers?
Nothing much yet.
They only just got started yesterday.
Slim.
What can I do for you?
- When do you get a break?
- Couple of hours.
- You got time, do something for me.
- Sure.
Anything for you, Slim.
In the second race at Santa Anita, there's a horse running... and I need to make a little bet on it.
Right.
- What's the horse's name, Slim?
- Ole Blue out of chute Number Two.
- Ole Blue?
- Ole Blue out of chute Number Two.
No.
Second horse in the second race at Santa Anita.
- That's reliable information?
- Yes, sir.
- The second at Santa Anita?
- Yes, sir.
Great, thanks.
I'll put a little taste on that myself.
Good.
- You don't wanna risk it in that poker game?
- I'm playing right now.
- You're playing right now?
- That's me... that good-looking fellow in the brown coat.
Good luck to you.
I won't play hard at you.
- Let me know about the horse.
- Will do, Slim.
Is that guy for real?
Somebody told me a funny story about him.
That guy usually have that much money on him?
Yeah, he's got a roll.
- That's the most money I ever saw.
- Mellow roll.
I hope William takes it away from him.
Oh, look down look down
That lonesome road
Okay.
Before you travel on
Yeah, look up look up
And seek your maker
Before Gabriel blows his horn
I got a good one.
You're gonna like this.
Oh, look down look down Look down, your fly is open
No, that's not right.
Well, whatever.
You didn't like that?
I'm out.
Excuse me.
And suddenly I banged into this...
- You got a glass of ice water?
- Too hot for you in there?
William, you make a little...
Up a bit.
I can't settle down with you here.
- What are you saying?
- You got to go.
No.
I mean, I got to sit here.
I'm not in the action.
I got to watch.
Let me watch.
Right?
I gotta watch.
You're not telling me that I'm getting in the way of your concentration, are you?
You telling me I'm interfering with your game, right?
Oh, God.
Okay, then you got to lay $200 on me.
Give me $100, $50.
Give me $25 so I can play, get into some...
Ice.
Do you want in?
Yeah.
I want in.
Okay, he comes back.
We're not going to fight.
Put your coat back on.
- Now you mean business.
- I feel like playing awhile.
- Let's accelerate it a little.
- Come on, what are we here for?
- How do you do?
- Fine.
How are you?
I'm very well.
I'd like...
I'd like $1,000 worth of credit.
I have no account, what do I have to do?
You gotta loan on the house?
Well, I don't...
What do you have to do?
I'll tell you.
Then you just give me a roll of nickels... and I'll just kibbitz for awhile 'cause I ain't getting no credit here.
Doctor just calls.
Forty to you.
Are you raising?
I got a cherry.
I got two cherries.
Excuse me.
I got two cherries and nothing happened.
Pit boss?
Let me have a pit boss.
Is there a pit boss?
You know, I wouldn't do that.
- I'm here to win, Doctor.
- Okay.
No hard feelings.
No hard feelings at all.
A pleasure to do business with you.
Pleasure doing business with people who like to do business.
Not many do.
You don't think there'll be five?
I'll say that there will be five, okay, Steve?
- Coca-Cola, please.
- Yes, sir.
I feel like a winner, but I know I look like a loser.
We busted?
We got anything left?
What's up in that game?
- We're up $11,000.
- $11,000.
We are up $11,000.
Well, let us pack this place in.
Let's go back to LA now.
You're my hero.
My new hero.
$11,000.
We're rich. $5,500 each.
Let's go.
Know how long we can live at the track for that?
- I can beat the game for 15...
- Famous last words. 15, 20.
You're here now, right?
You won $11,000.
We could be at the track for 50 years with that kind of money, right?
Charlie, I got the heat.
You gotta give me $200 so I can play some roulette... or do something while you're in there.
Don't look at me like that.
You're not going... $50?
The man's having a good time.
I'm sitting here going...
Wait a second now.
Okay, knock 'em dead, William.
What are you doing?
- Sixty cents for the Coke.
- Wait a second.
He hardly even drank the Coke.
That's my keno money.
One time I made 14 parlays and let it ride.
And every time I'd do it in the bootleg days, I'd take a drink.
And I finally ended up with an old dealer around here who said:
"Doctor, you don't know what you had.
You had that house, had the whole point...
"from old Felix Terwiller and you just don't know what you had. "
- And it ended up by me owing him $2,600.
- Ante up, gentlemen.
And that was back in 1926, and that was a lot of dough...
- and it took me six months to pay it off.
- Doc, ante, please.
You can win that much in this game if you hold the best hand.
We've been playing fine.
This game's getting good.
You just keep on playing, everything's going to be okay.
You talk with your cards and start breaking.
She owes me a blackjack.
I won $7,000 more.
I lost the rhythm of the game.
- I'm going to play some blackjack.
- $7,000 more?
- $18,000.
- Lucky man.
- I'm a rich man.
- I should say you are.
You're being kibbitzed by a very wealthy man.
- Good luck.
- I'm going to tell you, Chester...
- you just hang on to your cards.
- $18,000.
Boy!
- Money, please.
- $18,000.
William, you're...
What a streak.
You put me in the game, okay?
Put me in, I'll go play poker...
- and you can knock this table...
- What'll you play with?
You're going to give me some of my money.
William, I got no nails.
I'm going to throw...
A 10!
How could you do a 10 like that?
Never bust nothing.
I guess you think I did that?
I come over here and sit and you're gonna lose.
I'm having a nervous breakdown.
The money can't do me nothing... 'cause I ain't got none.
Just keep on winning, okay?
Jimmy, can I get a little credit here?
- What do I gotta do to have credit?
- Go to the cashier.
He said I couldn't do it anymore.
What's happening?
Why did you disappear from the blackjack?
Is that all that's left of our money?
All that cash?
- How're you doing?
- Very good.
What's very good?
How much did you win?
- What do you have...
- I did very good.
Very good could be something or nothing.
- What is happening?
- It bounced out of 22!
What the hell is that?
What do you want to know?
Ask me what you want to know.
You're over here, ask me!
What do you want to know?
- Bounced out of 22.
- That's right.
Will you get out of here?
You're gonna kill the streak!
Nobody's drinking this.
I'll bet a Milky Way.
Sorry, sir.
The limit's $1.
You just finish this hand and then you see.
You want to bet a Milky Way.
You're liable to get hungry.
Twenty-nine is not mine!
How much money is in there if he wins?
I'll take $1 million on the field and I'm coming.
Twenty-six.
How much are those chips worth?
- Do you mind?
- How's my field coming... with my lucky Milky Way on the field?
Give me a field on the hard way.
$100 a number.
Where's my lucky...
Twenty-six!
We gotta shoot craps.
William, I'm not going to get in your way no more.
- You come with me.
- No.
- No, I'm shooting, you're betting.
- I'll bet $100 on 11.
Okay, that stuff will just wash the dice off.
Number 11.
- Twelve, your line away.
- Look, maybe I ought to go.
No, you stay right here.
Charlie, now you stay right here.
And we start now.
Okay, we start now.
Okay, table, we're starting now.
I got it, Charlie.
Let me see it.
Nine the winner.
He's got us out there, William.
I never saw so many bumble-bee chips in my life.
$100 chips.
They give us real money for this?
Numbers!
Easy eight, okay.
Eight!
It is eight!
Okay, that's number two.
Come on.
Let's have the dice.
Come on, we're all with you, everyone.
Don't worry now.
Numbers.
Eight!
Give me a pair of fours.
A pair of fours and I'll shit in my drawers.
Put your money on double four, lady.
This man's going all the way.
$500 chips!
I never saw $500 chips.
Seventy-five!
Three 11s in a row.
I wanna bet a million dollars. 14-to-1.
- You making that kind of money?
- You bet I am.
Don't distract the man.
Just stay right on the table, William.
Eleven.
Four 11s in a row.
The man throws four 11s in a row.
Where's my $14 million?
I meant what I said.
$1 million on the line for an 11.
Nine!
Nine!
The man throws nines, eights, sixes.
Wake up the world, William.
Roll these numbers till it comes down.
Aren't you going to change the pit guys now?
You guys aren't getting tired, are you?
Hard six.
You get a hard six, they'll put your picture up here.
- Try it.
- Hard six.
Hard eight.
Come on.
Hard six.
Have you ever seen a greater roll than this?
I think you're not gonna believe what I've seen.
This the biggest one you ever see?
- Almost.
- Almost?
We gotta make it the biggest one.
Excuse me.
Can I put $1 on number seven?
What is that?
$1 on seven.
Here, lady, you got $100 to get out of town.
Give that lady $100, tell her to go play that, all right?
Come on, shoot.
Nine.
Come on, 66.
I don't believe it.
- You won't be here next game.
- That's right.
That's your comeback.
- You are the shooter.
- Well, man, okay.
- All right, I'll pass the dice to the lady.
- Okay.
- You are the shooter, ma'am.
- Let's go check out.
Is that the longest roll you've ever been here for?
That man is unconscious.
That's what they said.
- Don't you go grabbing none of these.
- How many points?
Could you buy us a drink?
Here.
Give this to the sweeper.
- Thank you very much.
- Excuse me.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.
- There he is.
- No, we's about even now.
He's in there.
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
These chips, they're just falling out.
William, you okay?
I suddenly got very tired.
I know, I could see that.
I was amazed.
You walked away from the table and you left all your chips.
But I scooped them up.
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We'll get a suite, a couple of outfits, some new clothes.
Maybe we'll hit the old Mustang Ranch, right?
We'll get a couple of little ladies.
Have a ball, right?
Then maybe we'll come down, go to Vegas... hire a limousine, get a driver, hit every track in the world.
Right?
We haven't even started yet, Mr. Denny.
I haven't even picked up the dice.
You just showed me how to win, right?
Conviction, right?
Conviction and control.
I'm going to take a rest.
You and me are going to rest up... then we're back to the tables and I'll be hitting it this time, too.
First, I gotta empty my pockets.
Just chock-full, all these here chips.
I'll go to the cashier now and pick up a little cash.
You just sit right there and take it easy.
La cucaracha, la cucaracha
Just Billy and me
I've got a fortune right here, fellows.
You'd better call for some money.
We got a lot of money here.
Keep everybody back.
Everybody back.
Have a pretzel.
We have pretzels all over the place.
Rack them up.
Call Howard Hughes and tell him we're gonna break his bank, too.
You can do me a favor.
I got a hole in my shoe.
You know where I can get this fixed?
No, I'll cash my shoe in, too.
You give me something for that?
No, we don't give nothing for old shoes.
Don't drop no chips down on the floor, now.
What do you think we got here?
How much money we got?
I think we got quite a few here.
- I just need a...
... any help with the money.
Well, I got a lot of pockets.
Now I want a very good smile.
I want a smile from you.
$82,000 on the button.
New shoes.
Cheese and crackers!
$40,000.
You see, I've been shooting crap games.
Smile, now.
You ain't smiling.
That's right.
Well, then you tell Mr. Hughes that we're gonna break the rest of his things, too.
Look, how much is that now?
- That's $60,000, sir.
- $60,000, sir.
I've been shooting.
I have a knack with numbers.
I just, you know...
Craps happens to be one of my games.
Don't want to take advantage of the house and win too much.
- $70,000.
- $70,000?
Four, six...
- It is unreal, but it's $80,000.
- $82,000.
$82,000.
Thank you very much.
We'll probably see you again.
Excuse us.
Pathway, please.
No, I don't need any police.
No, ain't nobody taking this money from me.
William, $82,000.
William, $41,000 apiece.
Gonna split it up right now, all right?
Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, for you.
Those people there, they want autographs, they want to take pictures.
The Reno Gazette, they want to do a whole feature story... but I said, "No, we're going to be resting until we come back. " Right?
Okay, $40,000.
$41,000.
Make sure of this.
Even split.
Eight, nine, and 10.
$41,000.
You always take a big win this hard?
Charlie, there was no special feeling in it.
I just said there was.
Yeah, I know that.
Everybody knows that.
Check this out.
We're heroes here, right?
This lady, Norma Walker, works near the cashier, gave me this:
"If it takes a watermelon five minutes to water...
"how long will it take a sweet pea to pee?
"As long as it takes a pair of dice to crap. "
Don't mean a fucking thing, does it?
Charlie, I have to go home.
Oh, yeah?
Where do you live?
I'll see you.

I got a big decision to make here.
I'm gonna let you break me down.
I'll let you break me down. 2 cards.
Two beauts.
That's very nice.
Oh, my!
MAN:
Oh, great catch.
Great catch!
Hey, hey, pal, that card's dead.
What are you talking about?
The card went off the table.
It's a dead card.
You're absolutely right, chief.
My gratitude for your knowledge of the rules, except the card never left the table.
LEW:
The card went off the table, it's a dead card.
MIRIAM:
Oh, come on.
Did you see that card go off the table?
I didn't see nothing at all.
It's stupid of me to ask you.
What about you?
Did you see it?
All I see is the time passing.
Pop, did you see it?
Nothing.
How much you bet?
Somebody must have seen it.
Kenny, this is ridiculous.
I want to change my table.
Whoa!
What's the problem?
The problem is the card went off the table and hit the floor, and he won't give it up.
There's nothing to give up.
The card never hit the floor.
I caught it before it did.
All right, take it easy.
Who else saw it?
Ma'am, did you see what happened?
I didn't see it.
How about you, sir?
I saw a card bounce.
I don't know what happened back here.
You dealt the hand.
You ought to know what happened.
I dealt the second one a little hard.
It never hit the floor, not even close.
Not even close?
All right, that settles it, Lew.
The rule is if the card doesn't hit the floor, it plays.
Continue the hand.
Come on.
Miriam, I don't have another table.
You got your ruling.
Play!
Just take it easy.
Take it easy.
It's not even close.
20-20.
Twenty-twenty.
The flying card didn't stop you from betting, huh?
20-20.
How about 40?
I raise.
Raise.
What could be cozier than this?
I mean, this is perfection, isn't it?
You and me in this hand...
Oh, that's pretty.
Just do something!
How much money you got?
How much you got left?
Seventeen.
Oh, not enough for the maximum bet.
Three shy.
I bet you $17.
Call.
Seven smooth.
No good.
I got a six perfect.
Sorry about...
Damn it.
That last card that went off the table was a joker.
That's why you wouldn't give it up.
You are ridiculous.
You said it wasn't even close.
That's yesterday's news.
You two are working together.
You're partners.
You two motherfucking creeps are partners.
MIRIAM:
All right!
Stop with the language.
(PEOPLE SHOUTING)
They should put a muzzle on him.
That's it, huh?
That man is absolutely ridiculous.
KENNY:
What's going on here?
What's going on with you guys?
These two are working partners together.
I never saw that man before in my life.
LEW:
I saw him throw the joker out on the last deal.
The man is totally out of line.
They've been smiling at each other all night.

All right, now who else saw this?
WOMAN:
I didn't see it.
I didn't see it.
What about you?
What do you want me to say?
KENNY:
The man calls you a cheater.
The man doesn't know how to play poker.
The man is bad.
He's a complete asshole.
We all know that, right?
The man goes broke, he can't handle it.
The man is on tilt.
You want to hear anymore?
Not me.
Come on, now.
You'd better just take it easy, sport, 'cause the security's liable to let you go!
(ALL ARGUING)
Put that guy in a horror show, huh?
KENNY:
That's it!
Any more fighting, and you guys go out of here for good, all right?
LEW:
All right!
Miriam, what do you say?
I say I can do without any more of that language.
Right.
KENNY:
You think there's any cheating going on?
MIRIAM:
I wouldn't like to say about that.
They've been consistent winners, and I'm a big loser.
And you know I know how to play poker.
Oh, sour grapes, honey.
Sour grapes.

Leave everyone here just the way they are.

Glenn Riggs was the announcer for Hop Harrigan.
What do you want $30 for?
I don't need $30.
I need it for that girl I got in the bathroom.
I'm only the relief bartender.
I don't go in the cash register.
Where's jack?
What is this?
Jack went to a funeral.
Look, I've been working here for one year, right?
Just give me a piece of paper, a chit.
"Thirty dollars, Renee." okay?
If I give you $30, and I come up short, it'll be your ass.
Baby, you were born short.
And it's always my ass.
BOTH:
Captain midnight!
Yeah, bong, bong!
This guy giving you trouble?
Bong!
He ain't who he's supposed to be.
It's not the regular man.
Thirty dollars.
I wouldn't sign anything.
Don't sign a thing.
Don't sign anything.
What did you get her to sign?
Here, mother.
Thanks, baby.
You won't be sorry.
Don't worry now.
I can beat it.

No Dumbo.
Gotcha.

Well, we both lose, huh?
Dumbo flew.
Remember when Dumbo flew?
They set that little house on fire.
I've seen an elephant walk,
BOTH:
But I never seen an elephant fly.
My god.
I know.
That Dumbo flew.
I know.
A lot of black folks said that was bad news, you know, seeing a black crow sing about a big flying elephant.
What's that?
It's taboo.
No black crows.

Believe me, nothing.
Desperate people.
They give you a funny little white jacket, and you're on your way.
How much do you make in a thing like that?
Well, you could pick up a snappy $25 in less than an hour.
Yeah, how do you do that?
Well, you keep it all.
You don't think I'm talkin' about workin' this job legit, do you, William?

No, no, I just need the spoon.

Then you get to keep 45 percent of, uh, what you pick up.

How come you don't get to keep all of it if it's non-existent?
I'm not pickin' nothin' up.

He gave me $50.
That was the deal, wasn't it?
No, the deal was for $30.
Well, he liked you a lot, too, sweetheart.
How come you were picked up?
Drunk and disorderly.
Yeah, well, you know, Charlie's not too good with cops.
Well, he certainly lets them know it.
This is the truth.
You're an animal lover, right?
Yeah.
Okay, well, the great blue whale, right?
You know about a great blue whale?

No, it's a big fish.

There's only about 2 or 3 left in the world.

Could we change seats?
No way, lady.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about that, but the last time I sat facing the rear, I never won a race.
I get sick if I ride that way.
It gets me dizzy.
Hey, Miss, this lady here is going to throw up if she sits in this chair.
Would you mind changing with her?
I never change seats.
It's bad luck.
She'll never change seats.
Lady, I don't mind changing.

Jerry Weintraub is their manager, and he's got to have something.
Just stock, publicity stills, you know...
BARBARA:
What do you want, some 8 x 10s?
Yeah.
Uh...
Egyptian femme.
The horse has run twice in two years, right?
And each time she stiffed out.
Now, she steps up in class, goes up against colts, draws an inside post position in a sprint and ain't got no speed of her own to get out there.
Is all that in there?
If you know how to read these things.
It says a lot more.
I thought I'd spare you all the gory stuff.
Egyptian femme.
The lady's going to cap out on Egyptian femme, huh?
Pretty funny.
Forget that horse, lady.
I hate to see her get away.
She owes me money from last year.
Oh, yeah.
Well, then you make a bet on her, and she'll owe you money from this year.

Hey, Andy, want to give my friend here a beer?

I asked first.
I'm telling you another half inch to the left of center...

You just keep it all.
Really?

That is beautiful.
Right.
Been shopping for a big price.
The horse's been getting stiff.
Today, we're gonna nail them.
Not much to recommend, Charlie.
The rest are a bunch of dogs, too, right?
Believe me, she's gonna pay you $4 million and change.
If you think the post, the inside post position is bad, she's got a lot of speed, wire to wire.
You're really not worried, are you?
This horse owes me and owes my friend, owes everybody around here.

I think the one in the middle looks dangerous.

I don't trust her.
I think we ought to take her down and book her.
Well, how about we book the two on the end and let the one in the middle go?
Oh, yeah, you're feeling sorry for her, huh?
I think so.
I'll make an exception.
You're sure?
Helen, Helen, stand back and look at me when I talk to you.
Sorry.
You look like a very well-dressed woman.
I am.
Good background.
Well-educated.
That's right.

My partner here and I think we are gonna believe that you had nothing to do with what's goin' on, on the premises and that...
I'm just a friend.

But we do feel that you should vacate the premises immediately.

No.
(WAITRESS CHATTERING)
WAITRESS:
Hi, Sparkie.
How are you, honey?
Right over here.
Whoa, hiya, baby.
What happened to your leg?
Numbness.
Don't play ball after 15 years, lemme tell you that.
I didn't know you played ball.
Actually, I did, you know.
With the pirates.
You're kidding.
No, nothing important.
No, I don't want the menu.
Give me the real hot chili.
All right?
Sure.
Sangria?
All right.
You want some chili?
No, I'm fine.
They got great zucchini in here.
You want that?
Class-a boy?
No.
I had a shot for, uh...
Well, it wasn't a shot, it was just, you know...
What do you make my figure?
As your carry-over I got you down for $2,200.
It's a tough week, babe.
No, that's okay.
I'll tell you, uh, this guy, Lloyd Harris, who's the honcho where I work, he had a very good Christmas season.
What he's created is a slush fund...
You're not telling me a story now, are you?
I don't know what you mean.
Come on, man,
I mean, I carried you one year.
Am I right?
Yeah.
Was there any pressure put on you at all?
No, you were very nice.
Forget nice.
I don't give a fuck about nice.
You know that that year...
Please, just forget about this.
Now, the point is, this is totally different.
It's strictly on a cash basis.
I told you that.
Right, right.
Did I tell you that I got hurt in two busts, that my parents were out here, that I'm getting killed all over the fucking place?
I mean, I told you this up front.
Did I not tell you that?
I'm asking you a question.
Did I not tell you that?
Okay, I beat you.
Ten days later you come to me, and you don't have any money.
You're out of line already, babe, but I extend that.
I mean, I extended it to you.
You told me you gonna have the cash.
You got things going.
I don't know what you're saying to me.
But you're gonna have the money, you have a way to get the money.
I mean, did you not say that?
What you're trying to tell me is, come payoff day, you don't have dollar one, plus you owe me more.
Man, I've heard it before.
You don't have dollar one, do you?
Spark...
You gotta think I'm some stupid schmuck you're dealing with.
I got to tell you something, pal.
In my line of thinking, you took a total, out-and-out shot at me...
Look, spark, that's not it at all.
Well, what is it then?
Listen to me.
I got $700 for you tomorrow.
Why didn't you say that in the beginning?
Why didn't you say it?
Because you didn't give me a chance.
What about the other $1,500?
One week.
(SIGHING)
I'll tell you, boy...
WAITRESS:
What's wrong, Sparkie?
Don't you want your chili?
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
What?
Want some chili?
No.

Cognac?

Nobody's eating gum today.
Hey, you, where'd you get that t-shirt?
Playing softball.
What position do you play?
Any position.
Oh, yeah?
I like shortstop myself.
I got this neat dog.
It's all fluffy and darling.
Did you hear me?
I hear you.
You got a dog.
What the fuck am I doing in this dump, anyway?
You should've seen the place where I was last night.
It was really classy.
Any chance you could go back there?
No, classy places don't open this early.
The only trouble with my dog is he shits on the floor and I don't know what to do about it.
What do you do about it?
You know?
You try cleaning it up?
Yeah, I tried that.
It didn't do any good.
He just sits there and looks at me.
Just some dumb fuck like all the men around here.
Bunch of faggots.
I bet they can't even get it up.
Oh, shit.
What am I doing here?
Fuck you, faggot!

Come in.

Yeah, the door's unlocked.

Right.
Hi.
Hi.
Barbara not here?
She's out on a date.
What are you doing?
Reading my book.
I don't like to stay in my room at night when no one's here.
We're going to Hawaii tomorrow for two weeks.
Yeah?
Yeah, we're really excited about it, too.
I'll bet.
Charlie never did come back.
Do you know what happened to him?
No.
Do you want to come in and sit down?
Yeah, okay.
You're married, aren't you?
Well, what, what difference does it make?
It doesn't make any difference.
We're separated.
Yeah?
Who are you going to Hawaii with?
Who's taking you to Hawaii?
Just a couple of guys.
These friends of Barbara's.
I don't even know them.
You don't even know them?
Uh-uh.
Suppose you don't like them?
Those are the chances you have to take.
You wanna make love to me?
Right now?
That has crossed my mind.
It has?
Yeah.
This sounds silly, but I don't have any money.
That's okay.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, I really like you.
I mean, it's...
It's different.
It's different?
Mmm-hmm.
Why is it different?
Well, I mean, I, I really like you.
I really, really like you a lot.
You brought me that dog.
Took me to the fights.
It was like a real date.
I think I'm gonna kiss you.
Yeah.
Hey, isn't this Barbara's room?
She doesn't care.
Having trouble?
Mmm, not anymore.
It's okay, I'll do it.
I got it.
I got it.

What's the matter?
Nothing.
You're taking so long.

You can't take my foot off with the boot.

Hi, Barbara.

We're going to use your bed, okay?
Great.
I just have to find my T.V. Guide.
I think it's under the bed.
I think it's under here.
Shit, I can't tell you what a crappy evening I had.
Son of a bitch almost threw up all over me.
Damn guy.
Well, he already paid me, so I guess it's, you know...
How was your evening?
Great.

No, he didn't.
Not really.
Honey, think about tomorrow.
I met the guy you're going with tonight.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What's he look like?
Well, he's dark, he has a...
He has a five o' clock shadow.
Yeah?
Yeah.

Yes.

(YELLS)
Where the hell have you been?
Three guesses.
I'll give you this much, my hat is a very big clue.
You son of a bitch!
Why didn't you tell me you were going?
It was a spur of the minute thing, William.
I had this incredible dream, right?
I'm in Tijuana at the dog track.
And I sweep the card.
Every dog I bet on, William, wins like a champ.
What do you know about dogs?
But whatever I'm feeling, William, winner, winner.
Fantastic.
Taking down the cash.
Why didn't you tell me?
Maybe I would've liked to go with you!
You don't know what it's been like.
So I get to Tijuana, right?
El sweepo.
I don't win one fucking race.
Maybe, if I'd been there, you would have.
You weren't in the dream, William.
My parrot was in the dream.
It was a hell of a handicap.
He said, "bet number four.
Polly want a four."
He doesn't eat nothing, doesn't dirty nothing.
(MUTTERING)
It's going to be all right.
I just need the typewriter.
What have I got?
What have I got?
Packing it all up and moving to Europe to paint, huh?
Yeah.
I'm going to Reno.
William, I think they've changed the rules.
You can't bet your typewriter.
Cash.
You know, cash.
Well, a guy told me they got 40-80 low-ball stud game, and a man can win a lot of money.
Sounds interesting.
But why Reno?
Vegas figures to have the same kind of game, and it's closer.
Fine, fine.
You go to Vegas, I'll go to Reno.
Reno.
Sounds like you might have a nice shot in a game like that if you have enough money behind you.
No shot, I'm going to win.
Oh, I don't know, William.
I don't know.
I do.
Reno, that game.
Sounds like a tough game, tough action, William, with a lot of these lumberjacks going up there.
Cowboys, rich guys.
Tough action, William.
It's a tough game.
Nobody's asking you to play, pal.
What's with you?
I don't like you coming in here with all your pessimistic shit.
Pessimistic shit.
Yeah, pessimistic shit.
I don't know what's bugging you...
I know how I feel.
Let's see...
Yeah, how do you feel?
Pal, I'm going to win!
Yeah?
So win!

Go ahead and win.

I don't interfere with you.

I ain't interfering with you.
Look, I know how I feel.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

I, I won't play hard at you.
Let me know about the horse.
Will do, Slim.
Is that guy for real?
BARTENDER:
Somebody told me a funny story about him.
That guy usually have that much money on him?
Oh, yeah, he's got a roll.
That's the most money I ever saw.
Mellow roll.
Oh, I hope William takes it away from him.

I'm out.
Excuse me.
BARTENDER:
And suddenly I banged into this...
You got a glass of ice water?
Too hot for you in there, huh?
William, you make a little...
Up a bit.
I can't settle down with you here.
What are you saying?
You gotta go.
No.
No, I can't, I'm sittin' here.
I'm not in the action.
I got to watch.
You'll let me watch, right?
I gotta watch.
You're not telling me that I'm getting in the way of your concentration, are you?
You telling me I'm interfering with your game, right?
Oh, god.
Okay, well, then you got to lay $200 on me.

How do you do?

Fine.
How are you?
Oh, I'm very well.
I'd like, um...
I'd like $1,000 worth of credit.
I have no account, what do I have to do?
You gotta loan on the house?

What do you have to do?
I'll tell you.
Then you just give me a roll of nickels, and I'll just kibbitz for awhile 'cause I ain't getting no credit here.

We busted?
We got anything left?
What's happened in that game?
We're up $11,000.
$11,000.
We are up $11,000.

Let's go.
Know how long we can live at the track for that?
I can beat the game for 15...
Famous last words.
15, 20.
You're here now, right?
You won $11,000.
We could be at the track for 50 years with that kind of money, right?
Charlie, I got the heat.
Okay, then you gotta give me a couple hundred, so I can play some roulette or do something while you're in there.
Don't look at me like that.
You're not going...
$50?
The man's having a good time.
I'm sitting here going...
Wait a second now.
Okay, knock 'em dead, William.
What are you doing?
60 cents for the coke.
Wait a second.
He hardly even drank the coke.
That's my keno money.
One time I made 14 parlays and let it ride.
And every time I'd do it in the bootleg days, I'd take a drink.
And I finally ended up with an old dealer around here who said,
"doctor, you don't know what you had.
"You had that house, had the whole point
"from old Felix Twiller, and you just don't know what you had."
And it ended up by me owing him $2,600.
Ante up, gentlemen.
And that was back in 1926, and that was a lot of dough and it took me about 6 months to pay it off.
Doc, ante, please.
You can win that much in this game if you hold the best hand.
We've been playing fine.
This game's getting good.
CHARLIE:
You just keep on playing, everything's going to be okay.
You talk with your cards and start breaking.
She owes me a blackjack.
I won $7,000 more.
I lost the rhythm of the game.
I'm going to play some blackjack.
Seven thousand dollars, more?
$18,000.
Ooh, lucky man.
I'm a rich man.
I should say you are.
You're being kibitzed by a very wealthy man.
Good luck.
CHARLIE:
I'm going to tell you, Chester, you just hang on to your cards.
$18,000.
Boy!
Money plays.
$18,000.
Oh, William, you're...
What a streak.
You put me in the game, okay?
Put me in, I'll go play poker and you can knock this table...
What are you gonna play with?
Well, you're going to give me some of my money.
Now you're going to give me some money.
William, I'm just...
I got no nails.
I'm going to throw...
A 10!
How could you do a 10 like that?
Oh, please, never bust nothing.
I guess you think I did that?
I come over here and sit, and you're gonna lose.
I'm having a nervous breakdown.
The money can't do me nothing 'cause I ain't got none.
Just, just keep on winning, okay?
CHARLIE:
Jimmy, can I get a little credit here?
A little credit here?
What do I gotta do to have credit?

Go to the cashier.
Oh, yeah, he said I couldn't go there anymore.

Double T.
Hello, Bill.
- Put you on at five?
- Put me on at ten.
On at ten.
Poker has been around for a long time.
It sure has.
But it isn't like this anymore.
The saloon has been replaced by this... with a game that can be played in comfort and with full confidence in the management.
And here is the man who is responsible for that confidence:
Mr. Murry Shepherd.
Welcome to the California Club, where your pleasure is our business.
It has been said that nearly everyone in America understands poker... or wants to.
It is one of America's most popular games.
And since you have shown an obvious interest by coming here... we have prepared a short film to teach you the fundamentals... of the game as we play it here.
Service is our only commodity.
This film is part of that service.
The object of the game is to win the pot.
- Hope I remember that.
- There are two variations of this game:
- High draw.
The highest ranking hand wins.
- Don't give me that.
- Low draw...
- There's my baby.
... where the winning hand holds the lowest possible ranking combination of cards.
As you enter the club, the reservation and game board is located in the card room.
You must stop here and tell the boardman of your game preference.
He will enter your initials on the board... and you will be called and directed to a table by a floorman.
The floorman puts the games together... interprets and applies the rules of poker.
His decisions are final.
C. W. ten blind.
C. W. in the coffee shop.
C.W., ten blind.
C.W., double his money.
The management of the club has no financial interest in any game.
There is no house deal.
Each player plays for himself.
And each in turn acts as a dealer.
When you are seated at the game, you'll be asked to pay a rental fee... which will be collected thereafter at the beginning of each half hour.
B.D. ten blind.
B.D., ten, twenty low.
You must have a full buy-in when you are seated to begin playing.
Chips must be purchased from the chip girl.
The buy-in is determined by the limit of the game you choose to play.
You must ante before you receive cards.
The ante is placed on the number directly in front of you.
The number is also your seat number at the table.
What do you do, Lew?
I'll call.
Acquiring the knowledge and skill to play card games such as poker... is a social asset.
To make the most of this asset... it is simply good judgment to be wanted at the card table.
Shit.
Don't be a spoilsport now.
- Who's the bettor?
- $20 to you.
Me.
You're so pretty I'm going to fold.
- Is everybody out?
- That's it.
You mean I've got a goddamn six and everybody's out?
This depends even more on good manners than upon the skill of the player.
The following principle should increase one's popularity as a card player.
I need one little, teensy...
Sit erect.
- Maintain a quiet bearing.
- Come on, get on with it.
Come on, sweetheart.
- Avoid nervous habits.
- $40.
I have a seat for you.
Now come on in.
During the game, avoid conversation regarding matters not relating to the game.
I'll just have to call you.
An appearance of awkwardness and clumsiness...
I didn't think you were that good.
... gives a bad impression of one's ability to play.
Wait a minute.
What do you think you're doing?
What do you mean, "wait a minute"?
You said it was good.
No, I said that I didn't think that you were that good.
I got a seven-four.
When a hand has gone very well for you, don't talk about it.
The film you've just been viewing cannot instantly make you a good poker player.
The more skilled you become, the more pleasurable you will find the game.
- I had a feeling...
- Next year.
Raise.
Pass.
- I call.
- Well, I'll raise the raise.
- Goodbye.
- I'm out.
Out.
And one more time to you.
What a pot.
- Another $20, huh?
- The table is so slow.
- You wanted one of these.
- Go ahead, I call.
- Cards?
- Pat.
Pat.
Very interesting.
Come on.
Do you mind picking the cards up and dealing them the regular way?
You did stay pat?
You are pat?
Come on.
Wait a second, lady.
I got a big decision to make here.
I'm gonna let you break me down.
I'll let you break me down.
Two cards.
- Two beauts.
- That's very nice.
- Oh, my!
- Great catch.
- Hey, pal, that card's dead.
- What are you talking about?
- The card went off the table.
It's a dead card.
- You're absolutely right, chief.
My gratitude for your knowledge of the rules... except the card never left the table.
The card went off the table, it's a dead card.
Did you see that card go off the table?
- I didn't see nothing at all.
- It's stupid of me to ask you.
- What about you?
Did you see it?
- All I see is the time passing.
- Pop, did you see it?
- Nothing.
How much you bet?
Somebody must have seen it.
- Kenny, this is ridiculous.
- I want to change my table.
- What's the problem?
- The problem is the card went off the table... and hit the floor and he won't give it up.
There's nothing to give up.
The card never hit the floor.
- I caught it before it did.
- All right, take it easy.
Who else saw it?
- Ma'am, did you see what happened?
- I didn't see it.
- How about you, sir?
- I saw a card bounce.
I don't know what happened back here.
You dealt the hand.
You ought to know what happened.
I dealt the second one a little hard.
It never hit the floor, not even close.
Not even close?
All right, that settles it, Lew.
The rule is if the card doesn't hit the floor it plays.
Continue the hand.
- I don't have another table...
- You got your ruling, play!
Just take it easy.
It's not even close. 20-20.
20-20.
The flying card didn't stop you from betting?
40-40.
I raise.
Raise.
What could be cozier than this?
I mean, this is perfection, isn't it?
- You and me in this hand...
- That's pretty.
Just do something!
How much money you got?
How much you got left?
$17.
Not enough for the maximum bet. $3 shy.
- I bet you $17.
- Call.
- Seven smooth.
- No good.
I got a six perfect.
Sorry about...
Damn it.
That last card that went off the table was a joker.
- That's why you wouldn't give it up.
- You're ridiculous.
- You said it wasn't even close.
- That's yesterday's news.
You two are working together.
You're partners.
You two motherfucking creeps are partners.
They should put a muzzle on him.
That's it?
- That man is absolutely ridiculous.
- What's going on here?
What's going on with you guys?
- These two are working partners together.
- I never saw that man before in my life.
I saw him nobble the joker out on the last deal.
The man is totally out of line.
They've been smiling at each other all night.
Come on, will you?
- Sit down and settle down.
- Get control.
Come on.
All right.
- All right, now who else saw this?
- I didn't see it.
- What about you?
- What do you want me to say?
The man calls you a cheater.
The man doesn't know how to play poker.
The man is bad.
He's a complete asshole.
We all know that, right?
The man goes broke, he can't handle it.
The man is on tilt.
You want to hear any more?
- Not me.
- Come on, now.
You'd better just take it easy, sport, 'cause the security's liable to let you go!
Put that guy in a horror show.
That's it!
Any more fighting, and you guys go out of here for good, all right?
All right!
Miriam, what do you say?
I say I can do without any more of that language.
- Right.
- You think there's any cheating going on?
I wouldn't like to say about that.
They've been consistent winners.
And I'm a big loser.
And you know I know how to play poker.
Sour grapes, honey.
All right, let's get it back to normal.
Lousy punk.
- You're not that good.
- Up yours.
Sir, would you like another beer?
...I bet it on Notre Dame 'cause I got a feeling Notre Dame would pull it off.
They beat UCLA when they had so many games going straight.
Yeah, it's kind of similar to the Miami Dolphins.
- This particular game is duck soup.
- They won 17 games straight last year.
Come on.
I can beat that goddamn miserable game.
Don't make me beg for a stinking $30.
I'm sorry.
You know, your attitude just pisses me off sometimes, Button-nose.
Don't call me that.
Now look.
There you go again.
I'm not doing anything.
I need about $80 to get to the track.
Not bad.
- Sir, can I help you?
- Cold beer.
Keg draft.
I'm buying that man sitting over there a beer.
Turned out to be a drinking man?
Nothing personal, but I already got a beer.
Thanks.
Great.
- So, you think the Knicks are gonna win?
- Yeah.
No, Knicks ain't going to win nothing.
Willis is hurting.
Knicks ain't winning.
Celtics, this year.
You follow pro basketball?
- Anything, right?
- Whatever's going.
Yeah, me too.
Action.
Are you gonna give me the $30 or not?
I have to buy this man a drink.
Will you have a beer?
I will definitely have a beer.
Give my friend here a beer.
$1 says you don't know who Glenn Riggs is.
- What's your name?
- Vince.
The name's Vince.
Glenn Riggs was the announcer for Hop Harrigan.
- What do you want $30 for?
- I need it for that girl I got in the bathroom.
I'm only the relief bartender.
I don't go in the cash register.
- Where's Jack?
What is this?
- Jack went to a funeral.
I've been working here for one year, right?
Just give me a piece of paper, a chit.
"$30, Renee." Okay?
If I give you $30 and I come up short, it'll be your ass.
Baby, you were born short.
And it's always my ass.
Captain Midnight!
This guy giving you trouble?
He ain't the regular man.
- $30.
- I wouldn't sign anything.
Don't sign a thing.
Don't sign anything.
What did you get her to sign?
- Here, Mother.
- Thanks, baby.
You won't be sorry.
Don't worry now, I can beat it.
Goodbye.
$20 says you can't name the Seven Dwarfs.
- I know I can name three or four of them.
- Seven.
I got seven.
- Doc.
- That's one.
- Dopey.
- That's two.
- Snoopy.
- There is no Snoopy.
There ain't no Snoopy.
I know there's Doc... there's Dopey, there's Grumpy, there's...
- You don't have $20 here.
- Wait a second.
I got $20 right here.
- I need a little help here.
What about...
- Here comes seven like a Gatling gun.
- Seven Dwarfs, I'm ready.
- Sleepy, Grumpy, Doc.
- That's four.
- That's three.
- I'm with you.
- Wait a second.
Sleepy, Grumpy, Doc.
Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey.
- Dopey.
- We got Dumbo.
- There's no Dumbo.
- Dumbo wasn't in that cast?
- No Dumbo.
- Gotcha.
- Dumbo flew.
- Well, we both lose?
Remember when Dumbo flew?
They set that little house on fire.
I've seen an elephant walk, but I never seen an elephant fly.
- My God.
- I know.
Dumbo flew.
A lot of black folks said that was bad news... seeing a black crow sing about a big flying elephant.
What's that?
It's taboo.
No black crows.
Judgment day, you know, I know
Aristis, Arastis, Johnson Brown
What you gonna do when the rent come round?
You in the park?
No, I haven't got a car.
I just live...
Not far.
I like to live close to the action, you know, William?
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
You're going to give me a lift?
That's a good idea.
You know, I know the rent means dough
Landlord gonna throw us in the co-co snow
Aroostis, Arastis, Johnson Brown
What you gonna do when the rent comes round?
What you gonna say?
How you gonna pay?
William, you're a minstrel?
Man, I hate key stuff.
Look in his side pocket.
He's got my goddamn money somewhere.
Right here.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
I hope you loved that, Funny Man.
Okay, folks, will you just relax and follow me, please?
What is this, a hospital or a jail?
What's going on?
This is William.
This is Barbara.
She's getting us out of here.
Thanks a lot.
You ever been in jail in New York?
They give you powdered eggs.
Powdered, shitty...
The shittiest food in the world.
I can't believe you haven't been in jail.
What are you doing?
Just trying some of the hot one.
It really works.
Here, you want to try some?
Come on, the heat makes it feel good.
Listen to me, I got experience.
Yeah, easy.
Just don't touch it with the can.
Easy now.
- Not bad?
- That's nice.
That's okay.
Last year, year and a half, I must have hit... about 30 different racetracks in every little town and city I've been to.
- Yeah, how'd you do?
- Tapioca time.
El Busto.
I'll give you a great ace in the hole.
If you find yourself busted in a small town...
Say, is there anything I should know about this?
Listen, fellows, it's breakfast time.
We got Lucky Charms and...
- What's with this?
- Froot Loops.
- Froot Loops?
Have some waffles...
- I'll take some coffee.
Blueberry pancakes.
You'd still be in jail if that guy hadn't given me that $50.
But... chicken.
...a strange town you head straight to the ice cream people... and pick yourself up an ice cream cart.
They got lots of them.
They don't care who you are or what you look like.
- Something to eat.
It's roughage.
- Believe me, nothing.
Desperate people.
They give you a funny little white jacket and you're on your way.
How much do you make in a thing like that?
You could pick up a snappy $25 in less than an hour.
- How do you do that?
- You keep it all.
You don't think I'm talking about working this job legit?
- Your favorite:
Lucky Charms.
- Can I have a beer, honey?
- You want a cold beer?
- No, thanks.
It goes good with your Froot Loops.
- Get some milk, honey.
- Got it.
That shaving cream's not going to stain your white sweater.
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to tell your mother.
Just put it down and it'll all wash out.
Let me taste it for you.
- What is this?
- That crap.
- Come on, we got company.
- I tried to make it look nice.
That looks better.
Here, baby.
One time, right, I had this job selling ad space in a labor union magazine.
Non-existent.
Just get on the telephone, call people and say:
"Do you want to buy some space?"
- Help yourself.
Ain't bad.
Just last night's.
- I just need the spoon.
A little pâté de foie garbage.
Then you get to keep 45% of what you pick up.
How come you don't get to keep all of it if it's non-existent?
I'm not picking it up, I'm just talking on the telephone.
- Yeah, right.
- What do you do?
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm with a magazine.
- You a writer?
- Yeah.
Say!
Do you remember the first bet you ever made on a sport event?
- Do you?
- I bet a nickel... in the 1945 World Series.
The Cubs and Tigers.
Don't laugh.
I lost.
Susan's home.
Five-cent bet and I lost.
- I didn't expect to lose.
- Susan, honey.
I didn't have the nickel, right?
So this guy Mikey asked my mother.
I've been trying to beat it ever since.
What is it?
- Did he hurt your feelings?
- No.
- You can scratch him off the book, honey.
- I don't want to scratch him off my book.
Here's the baby of the house now.
Sweetheart, would you like some Froot Loops?
- Come on.
Therapy.
- No therapy.
What's shaking, baby?
I just want to go to bed.
Take your coat off, sweetheart.
Come on, now, you're starting to get that Halloween look on your face.
It was just...
He was really different.
- Guy wasn't out of line with you, was he?
- No.
- We had such a good time.
- Yeah?
Guy was fresh, was he?
You know what he did?
He gave me $50.
- That was the deal, wasn't it?
- No, the deal was for $30.
He liked you a lot, too, sweetheart.
- How come you were picked up?
- Drunk and disorderly.
- Well, Charlie's not too good with cops.
- He certainly lets them know it.
This is the truth.
You're an animal lover, right?
The great blue whale, right?
You know about a great blue whale?
- That wrestling guy?
- No, it's a big fish.
There's only about two or three left in the world.
And the truth, the tongue of the great blue whale... weighs more than a full-grown African elephant.
- No, it's not true.
- You don't believe it?
You're just making it up to make me feel better.
'Cause you don't like to see me cry.
You feel a little better?
- Yeah, I do.
- Good.
- Who's that guy out there?
- Billy?
He's a poker friend.
- You want to meet him?
- No.
He'd spent his rent money on us.
Yeah, so we brought him home.
The girl's fine.
She just fell in love again.
She'll be okay in the morning.
Listen, William, I'm going to crash.
You can use the sofa if you want.
Thank you.
- I got to crash, too.
- Okay.
- Good night, baby.
- Good night.
I got to get my car.
I can't get my car.
There's nobody up there.
I was just looking for the Guide.
Go back to sleep.
It's Happy, Bashful, Dopey, Doc, Grumpy...
Fuck them.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Denny.
- Hello, Barbara.
This information came in for you from Chino this morning.
- Thank you, Barbara.
The dauphin in yet?
- Since 9:00 a.m. He wanted to see you.
- What's the matter with your body?
- I had a little automobile trouble, Barbara.
- Is that him?
- It was, sir.
- Did you tell him I wanted to see him?
- I did, sir.
- What'd he say?
- He said, "Thank you."
- He did?
- He did.
Thank you.
You're most welcome.
- These are the colors on the antique article.
- Oh, right.
I didn't know what time you'd be in, so I just picked out a few.
- I think they're your best bet.
- Thanks, Barbara.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
- Good.
How about some coffee?
- Love some.
Everybody's named Barbara.
- Hello?
- Barbara?
- Yes.
- This is Bill Denny.
Bill!
Hi.
- Is the Ice Cream Man around?
- He sure is.
Charlie, it's Bill.
- William, what's shaking?
- Hey, Charlie.
I'm at the office.
I'm reviewing things.
It sounds like a bore.
You want to track it with me?
Believe me, I'd like to... only I cannot get out.
I'm really all jammed up here.
You let a man rub some hot shaving cream on your ribs... you can take a shot with him at the track.
Listen, I know you're right, but you know, I cannot steal any more time from here.
We'll play it your way, but if you should change your mind...
I'll be at the bar in the grandstand... right above the finish line, near the $100 window, all right?
Yeah, I know the spot.
Okay, listen.
If I can, I can.
I hope you do.
Listen Charlie, thanks for an interesting evening.
Knock them dead.
Okay, I will.
Okay, so long.
It's different.
It's not my favorite, but it is different.
Who in their right mind would put a graveyard...
- on the front of the California...
- Our boss.
I mean, that's not going to sell any magazines.
Well, it's not doing so badly.
Excuse me.
Could we change seats?
No way, lady.
I'm sorry.
The last time I sat facing the rear, I never won a race.
I get sick if I ride that way.
It gets me dizzy.
Hey, miss, this lady here is going to throw up if she sits in this chair.
- Would you mind changing with her?
- I never change seats.
It's bad luck.
- She'll never change seats.
- Lady, I don't mind changing.
This lady here will change with you.
Thank you.
Great.
This lady will change with that lady, but she needs a window seat.
You change there, and I could...
- Everything okay?
Wonderful.
- Great.
Super day for the track.
- Do me a favor?
- Do you want to change seats again?
Would you see what Egyptian Femme looks like?
She's in the fourth.
- Egyptian Femme?
- Femme.
Jerry Weintraub is their manager, and he's got to have something.
Just stock, publicity stills, on, you know...
- What do you want, some 8x10s?
- Yeah.
Egyptian Femme.
The horse has run twice in two years, right?
Each time she stiffed out.
Now she steps up in class... goes up against colts, draws an inside post position in a sprint... and ain't got no speed of her own to get out there.
Is all that in there?
If you know how to read these things.
It says a lot more.
I thought I'd spare you all the gory stuff.
Egyptian Femme?
The lady's going to cap out on Egyptian Femme?
Pretty funny.
Forget that horse, lady.
I hate to see her get away.
She owes me money from last year.
Then you make a bet on her and she'll owe you money from this year.
How far is it to Chino?
- An hour and a half.
- I'm going up there.
They got it all wrong.
If you hear from the dauphin... tell him, "Much luck."
Well, I'm holding my own.
Just don't bet the chalk.
No chalk betting here.
- Later, Ben.
- All right.
The weight factor, see?
It's the weight factor.
Excuse me.
- Hey, babe, what's happening?
- How's it going?
- How'd you do the first race?
- Not too good.
I like to stay away from the daily doubles, too.
Any info?
- Not as yet.
- lf you get any information, I'll be at the bar.
- Andrew, que pasa?
- Hey, Big Charlie, what's going on?
You got a winner today?
Not yet?
Me neither.
Are you sure Egyptian Femme is not going to win?
- You want a beer?
- I don't.
I think you ought to bet on Egyptian Femme.
You're right.
Yeah?
Then why do you have four underlined?
I don't know.
I used to like Banks, the jockey, but I changed my mind.
- You're putting me on.
- Who will you bet?
- Not Egyptian Femme, I'll tell you that much.
- I'm glad you're definite.
Who do you like in the fourth, pal?
William, you made it.
Glad to see you, William.
How you feeling?
Not bad.
I got a little pain here and here, otherwise I couldn't be better.
- Give my friend a beer.
- Want to give my friend here a beer?
I asked first.
I'm telling you another half inch to the left of center...
- That's no good here, Charlie.
- No, this is on me.
- It's on me.
You just keep it all.
- Any time.
You keep it all.
Your money's no good here, pal.
Don't you appreciate a man who gets you in the goodies?
He gave me a kick where I'm breathing and I'm pretty lucky to be here.
Now, how did you manage it?
How'd you get away from work?
I wish I was as good at this as I am at getting away from work.
Razzle-dazzle.
The minstrel man strikes again.
I know.
After today you're gonna have enough money to open up a string of parking lots.
- It looks that good?
- 20-to-1 in the morning line ain't tin.
- You really like it?
- Fucking gold, babe.
- Who's the horse?
- Número uno.
Egyptian Femme.
Tough to figure, right?
He doesn't seem to like to run a lot.
- She, it's a lady.
- Right.
It's beautiful.
Just right.
They've been shopping for a big price... today we're going to nail them.
- Not much to recommend.
- The rest are a bunch of dogs, too, right?
Believe me, she'll pay.
$4 million and change.
If you think the inside post position is bad, she's got a lot of speed, wire to wire.
You're really not worried, are you?
This horse owes me and owes my friend, owes everybody around here.
- We're taking down today, my friend.
- I'd like to toast that, pal.
- Let's go see a man about a horse.
- A man about a horse.
Excuse me.
Where is she?
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Come on.
Don't stop!
Go!
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Stay up there!
- Come on, Valdez!
- Who's Valdez?
Valdez is the jockey!
Come on, Valdez.
Come on, Valdez.
Keep it up there.
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
He'll make a move now.
- Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Stay up there!
- Come on, Valdez!
And he wins!
Take it down.
Come on, we win this race.
We won that race going away.
That was a race.
Did you see that race?
- I mean, Valdez...
That race was fantastic.
- We didn't see the tote board.
- Did you see the other horse?
- We win this race.
I've never done this.
I've never come out...
- Will you trust me?
We won.
- Let's see the photo, man.
Photo finish?
We won going away.
- What were you watching?
- I was watching this race.
Just a little razzle-dazzle.
Can you be happy now?
- I've never done this before.
- The horse wins.
- We're a winner.
- The horse did not win!
Nobody says that.
This is called counting your chickens.
- Chickens and counting chickens?
- Before they're hatched.
You spend a whole life out here and you have a 20-to-1 shot...
Come on, fellows.
Will you get it up here?
I'm telling you, we win the race.
- What is it?
- Goddamn one horse.
Egyptian Femme!
Egyptian Femme won!
Where've you been?
That's what I said.
I can't believe this!
I had that horse!
You rotten creep!
Hey, you!
You said Egyptian Femme had no chance!
The horse won!
Whose money is that?
Had no chance?
- Lady, don't throw oranges.
- The horse had no chance?
The horse had no chance?
You knew it all along!
Are you crazy?
God damn it, lady, you don't throw oranges on an escalator!
Come on, lady, get back!
How's that, lady?
- That's my hat!
- Now, you stop throwing oranges.
Stop it!
- Give me my goddamn hat!
- Stop it!
- You thief!
- You want your purse?
That horse owes me more money!
Here, you want your money?
Take your goddamn...
You asshole, you can't even throw!
Wonder where he's going to take us for dinner tonight?
Who knows?
But wherever it is, it'll be delicious.
- I hope it's the Scala.
- That'd be great.
We can have all that Italian food we love.
We can have mozzarella marinara... and eggplant parmigiana...
- Honey, there he is.
- Zabaglione for dessert.
Now sit down, act natural.
Say, what is this?
Surprise!
No, it's not.
- Hey, baby.
- We're going to make it.
Here you are, Mr. Tenor, and thank you.
- That was delightful.
- Birthday greetings!
Go on.
- Who's that wonderful guy out there?
- That man's a tenor.
- We want you to have the big evening...
- We can't have the big evening tonight.
- She and I got a date.
- What are you talking about?
- You're not working tonight?
- Yes, we are.
I saw you eating your breakfast.
Now I think I'm going to play the piano.
Which way is it?
Honey, sweetheart, it's a very important party.
It's very, very important...
Okay, that's it.
That's it now.
All right, stop it now.
All right.
Stop the music.
Stop.
We're expecting Mr. Kramer.
We loved all the gifts.
We love everything.
- Are we out of here?
- Yeah.
...should've been there when you came to the door.
But it's $150 apiece for the evening for dinner.
- What?
- This evening at $150 each.
- Are we out of here?
- $150.
All we have to do is go to dinner.
Maybe Mr. Kramer wants to give Bill and me $75 apiece.
- Bill's awful pretty to show off.
- I don't know how to take that.
Not at all.
We can tell him we're sick.
Now I get the feeling I'm being mugged by my friend.
- No, this is not right.
- All right, Bill, out the door.
I'm waiting to say goodbye.
You ladies, now, I mean, we're gonna...
- It sure was nice.
- Go in there.
- Sit down and act natural.
- I think you're unfair.
Susan and Barbara must not be deprived of our companionship tonight.
Certainly not.
- They were looking super.
- Should we look inside?
Absolutely.
Mr. Kramer must be some funny dude.
- Hi.
- It's me.
Do you remember me?
- Of course I remember you.
- Is there anyone else?
- No, there's just us.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
- Okay.
- Sweetheart, you look terrific.
- Do you like it?
Yeah.
- You smell wonderful.
- Thank you.
I'm so glad you like it.
- What are you wearing?
- Thank you.
What are you...
- It's Joy, isn't it?
- No, it's Shalimar.
- Shalimar.
- Do you like it?
- Oh, God.
- Mr. Chan!
- Shalimar is my favorite perfume.
- It's mine, too.
Do you like the dress?
I had it...
Yes, I had it made in Omaha.
Yeah, but I just...
I just never had the balls to wear it, you know, outside.
- Well, honey, it's sexy...
- I love the dress.
- Listen to me.
- Dignified.
- Elegant.
- It is.
It's elegant.
Listen, tonight we're gonna go to Chasen's.
Chasen's tonight.
- And then I've got a great big surprise.
- What is it?
After Chasen's, what?
- I don't know if I should tell you.
- Tell us.
A little hint.
- Tell, please.
- Go ahead.
- It has something to do with music.
- Music.
You know?
Listen, before we go, let's have a cocktail.
I made us some daiquiris.
- How about it?
- Thank you.
- I'll get yours.
- Thanks.
You're my best friends.
- Really?
- Thank you, Helen.
Yeah, now you want to give this to Helen.
Honey, don't drink it.
Give it to Helen.
It's just taking forever.
What is that?
I might have to take the top off.
Okay, give this one to Helen.
Shake it up a bit.
That's for Helen now.
That's good.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Hurry, Barbara, I want to make a toast.
- Okay.
Great.
To Helen and her new look.
- Yes, you look great.
- Elegant.
- Yes, elegant.
- Thank you.
- Wonderful.
- Who's that?
- Wait a minute.
Are you expecting anyone?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.
Don't worry, honey, I can take care of it.
Don't worry.
- She can take care of it.
- I hope so.
She can take care of it.
She takes care of everything.
She does, really.
I'll take care of you.
- Okay, ladies, Vice.
We're Vice.
- Vice?
Detective Waters and this is Detective Denny.
Which one of you girls is Barbara Miller?
- Barbara, you didn't say...
- The young one must be Susan Peters.
You damn cops just can't come in here...
Be quiet, and don't call us damn cops.
- What's your name, honey?
- Brown.
- Brown, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- First name?
- Helen.
- Helen Gurley Brown?
- No, sir.
What's going...
Hey, come on now.
- It's not a laughing matter, girls.
- Close the door, will you?
- The door.
- Close the door.
And check the premises for any marijuana or pot or firearms.
- I'm gonna check.
- I do not like the feel of this.
- You can't search this house without...
- You just be quiet, lady.
We'll run you downtown.
You feel like being frisked?
- No.
- You can't frisk a sweet old woman...
Yeah, well.
- Shalimar?
- Yes, sir.
- Smells good.
- Thank you.
- You got a cold?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, yeah.
- Here's a sourball.
- No, thank you.
- It's good for your throat.
- I don't even want this drink.
- Take a sourball.
- Got one for me?
Yeah, I got one for you.
You're like a more responsible older woman than these girls.
- Are you misleading these young girls?
- No, I'm not.
- She's just a friend.
- They're not friends.
They're not?
Why are you here?
- I'm a friend of their aunt's.
- Don't talk like that.
Shut up.
We'll take them downtown and book them.
- Run them right downtown.
- Let's take them in.
- Charlie, let me have a word with you.
- You stay right there.
Be quiet.
They're not friends of mine.
I'm a friend of their aunt's.
- What do you think, pal?
- The one in the middle looks dangerous.
- Her mouth turns down...
- I know.
I don't trust her.
I think we ought to take her down and book her.
How about we book the two on the end and let the one in the middle go?
- You're feeling sorry for her, huh?
- I think so.
I'll make an exception.
You're sure?
Helen, stand back and look at me when I talk to you.
Sorry.
- You look like a very well-dressed woman.
- I am.
- Good background.
Well-educated.
- That's right.
Religious.
My partner and I are gonna believe that you had nothing to do with...
- what's going on on the premises and that...
- I'm just a friend.
Believe me.
But we do feel that you should vacate the premises immediately.
- Bless you.
- Bye, Helen.
Take care of your cold, sweetheart.
Shut the door, Helen.
Bye.
- You people ought to be arrested.
- Jesus Christ!
- I can't believe you did that.
- What was that?
I love your brown shawl.
- Now, let's get...
- You're not really a policeman, are you?
No.
Do you think if I was a cop I would arrest you?
People, now how does Mexican food sound to you?
- Mexican food.
- That sounds delicious.
Do we have time to change our clothes?
Get out of your work clothes and into something comfortable.
Don't take too much time or we'll take Helen.
Excuse me.
And here we go.
You're crazy.
It's a bet.
The black guy over there.
What's his name?
The black guy?
- Take him out with a good punch.
- Come on, baby.
Boy, do we got Morgan.
Place your bet.
What do you want to bet?
$40 and $60.
I bet you even your man don't stop my man.
- You got it.
- Even money.
Come on, sit down, lady, sit down.
Come on, Roy.
We got the first round now.
You got the money they're floating you, right?
$15 on Collins.
Yeah.
Okay.
Collins is a wonderful guy.
Got good marks in school.
I know him.
He just don't fight too good, though.
He ought to be playing baseball or something.
Want another $15 on this?
No, I got one bet left.
I'm gonna bet for your hat, man.
I wanna win your hat.
My man's gonna win this fight, yeah.
- You want my hat?
My Bell Helmet hat?
- Yeah, right.
- Give it to him.
- Here, you got it.
- $10.
Right.
- For your shirt.
- Get in there!
- Keep working!
Get in there!
I think that we won all three rounds.
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.
I'll take the hat now.
You've seen Sugar Ray knock out Foreman.
Come on, people.
Thank you very much.
Come on, let's get out of here now.
Okay, you lay me 10-to-5.
I got suit and you got the lumberjack.
You gotta be nuts.
Why, lumberjack has got to be 2-to-1 over a suit, anytime.
- Okay.
They both can't fight.
- Come on.
- $1,580.
- We're all winning.
Winning all over the place now.
The moon is shining high
Definitely, we'll have to take care of you girls to make up for that silly old man.
But we're gonna make up for Mr. Helen Gurley.
- What's the agenda?
- Right now we're off to the Latin Quarter.
Now, Latin Quarter.
We'll go dancing.
We'll go anywhere you say now.
I mean, you and me are knocking them dead with this $1,580.
Stick 'em up.
I'm sorry I hit your...
- Put her in the car, man.
- Stick 'em up, man.
I don't believe it.
It's hard to believe.
Wait a second.
Put the money on the table.
I can hardly believe this right now.
I'll blow your fucking face off.
- Don't you believe it?
- Will you do what he tells you?
- I don't believe this.
Relax.
- I'll blow your fucking head off.
Wait.
You're not blowing nothing off.
I don't believe it.
We're getting robbed two nights in a row.
- Put the money on the table.
- Do what he tells you.
Please, Charlie.
Wait a second now.
Okay, here's $780, man.
That's it.
You got half and we're taking half.
Take the money and run.
Go ahead, $780, man.
Don't think about it.
Take the money and go.
Get out of here, you fucking bum!
Get out of here, man!
Cut our winnings in half.
- I call.
- I call.
- Take your hand off my knee, will you?
- I dropped a card.
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Your hand is dead.
- I can't help it, I dropped it.
- Then your hand is dead.
Hand's dead.
- Come on, let's go.
- What do you want?
She was aces full.
And what did you have, four what?
Hey, let her play her own cards.
Come on, girls.
This ain't Santa Anita.
You're playing poker.
You girls are sure getting good cards, huh?
You girls friends from way back?
You two?
- No, we don't even know each other.
- I've never seen her before.
I don't care how old you are.
Right in the choppers, lady.
- Come on, be nice, will you?
- The lowest you can get.
- I fold.
- I will raise you.
I call.
I don't want you to see it.
- All right, let's ante up.
- All right.
- All right, everybody in.
- That's right.
Why don't you go home...
You're burying me here.
Get a Chinaman in this game.
- We're falling apart.
- I fold.
Man, I don't even understand what you were trying to tell me.
You figure you're entitled to a free shot...
- I never said I was entitled to a free...
- Then what are we talking about?
When have I never paid you your money, Spark?
- Laying the thug routine on you?
- It's not the question of paying.
You do not pay me on time and time is the thing.
- You know, week to week I pay you...
- I understand that, Spark.
Why do you think you can do that stuff?
You've owed me for nine months.
All right, I did.
Let's make a deal.
Tell him you're sending him some Green Stamps.
How many times have I told you I do not wish to be interrupted... when I'm in conference with Mr. Waters?
- Listen.
You told me four times.
- Get out of here, will you?
- He wants to see you now.
- Tell him he's talking to a thug.
Tell him he'll get his legs broke.
I'll tell him his legs are broken, that's why he can't see him.
Here is the deal:
Ten days.
You don't cut me off for 10 days... and you got your money in your hands.
That's it.
That's my word.
Okay, let me tell you my situation.
All right?
- You wanna hear that?
You care?
- Okay, Spark.
I am getting buried at this point.
I mean, it's been a very bad day.
I understand that, Spark.
I cannot carry you for more than 10 days.
Ten days, that's it.
- I mean, if it's 11 days...
- No 11 days.
- It cannot be.
- Right.
No stories, nothing.
Ten days.
- What if you lose more money?
- Even if I should lose more money.
- You're gonna be able to handle that?
- Right.
Tell him to get Preparation H. Do him good.
Will you give me a break?
- You're going to get it?
No stories?
- I've got it.
I just didn't wanna tap the source...
I didn't want to do it that way, but I'm gonna.
- What do you want?
- What are the Lakers?
Five and a half.
Okay, Spark, I'll call you back.
Five and a half will make you laugh.
Bet your house on this game... lay the five and a half, you get out tonight.
- I don't know, Charlie.
- I know.
If I had an estate in the country I would lay it and tap out on the Lakers.
They're covering tonight.
- This game scares me, Charlie.
- No, don't be frightened.
Now Mr. West, Mr. Goodrich, Mr. Cook's Forum, tonight... they blow the Suns out.
Where do you get your confidence?
The Lakers have been playing crappy... and the Suns are hot.
- Come on, so the Lakers lose two in a row.
- Four in a row.
Right.
And, believe me, it doesn't matter.
- Phoenix wins two or three in a row.
- Five.
Five in a row?
Playing pretty good.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
- Don't matter.
This is the double reverse.
You lay the five and a half... and you bet your house on it.
You've been saying this for weeks.
I'm lucky I don't own much property.
Barbara, I really like these red Christmas bulbs.
You think next year we should do the whole Christmas tree in them?
Don't you think that's a bit on the nose?
- Hi.
How are you?
- How you been?
Fine.
- I was just driving by, thought I'd say hello.
- Good.
- What are you all doing?
- I'm cleaning out the car.
I'm putting up the Christmas tree lights.
- Charlie up yet?
- No.
- Yeah.
Up and gone.
- Yeah?
Where'd he go?
I don't know.
He got up so early I couldn't believe it.
- Listen, come on in for some coffee.
- No, I can't.
Thanks.
Just one cup of coffee.
I'll take a rain check.
- All right.
Bye, Bill.
- Nice seeing you.
- How are you?
- Bill Denny.
What are you doing here?
I checked at the other store and they said you might be over here.
Wait a minute.
Don't tell me why you came.
I'm getting a flash.
You see, I have a good amount of ESP.
I'm blessed with it.
My wife kids me about it, but she respects it when I get these flashes.
Let me see how close I can get to what's going on here.
I get that you're probably back with your old lady... and you want to paint your garage door, perhaps even the whole front of your house.
Yes, I'm getting the color.
It's a greenish color.
Right?
How close did I get?
I need a loan, Harvey.
- A loan?
- Yeah.
- How are you?
- Terrific.
- What's your name?
- Larry.
Larry, I know you're going in here to win a bundle.
Why don't you come and see me when you come out?
- He would like to see Nugie, please.
- Okay, come on in.
Just go on in through the kitchen.
They're in the other room.
- Nugie, there's a guy here.
- Yeah.
- Howdy.
- Howdy, Nugie.
- Trouble finding this place?
- No, it's fine.
There's some crap in the kitchen if you want...
- No.
I'm fine.
- Grab a chair.
- Three, six, nine.
- What've you got?
Jack, five, seven.
I don't know who you know here.
This is Bill.
Four, five, six.
What're you doing?
You're gonna play chess.
I call.
Six card low ball.
Forced to bet the first high card.
$3 the third and fourth card. $6...
Let's keep the game moving.
Three.
Bet him, Nugie.
Terrific.
True love never runs smooth.
- I bet $3.
- Force the bet to $30.
I raise it $3.
First high card. $3 the third and fourth card.
Fifth card six. $12.
- No check and raise.
- Check and raise.
- Three dollars to you, he raised you.
- What's the buy-in?
$200 buy-in.
Help the man.
$3.
I don't know.
How about this?
- Very nice.
- Feel free, man.
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, anytime.
They get me, man.
Don't worry.
Next week you'll beat their brains in.
There you go.
Would you like to see a menu?
No.
- Hi, Sparkie.
- How are you, honey?
Right over here.
- Hiya, baby.
- What happened to your leg?
Dumbness.
Don't play ball after 15 years, I can tell you that.
I didn't know you played ball.
- Actually, I did, you know.
With the Pirates.
- You're kidding.
No, nothing important.
No, I don't want the menu.
- Give me the real hot chili.
All right?
- Sure.
- Sangria?
- All right.
- You want some chili?
- No, I'm fine.
They got great zucchini in here.
You want that?
- Class-A boy?
- No.
I had a shot for...
Well, it wasn't a shot, it was just...
What do you make my figure to be?
As your carry-over I got you down for $2,200.
It's a tough week, baby.
No, that's okay.
I'll tell you... this guy, Lloyd Harris, who's the honcho where I work... he had a very good Christmas season.
What he's created is a slush fund...
You're not telling me a story now, are you?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Come on...
I mean, I carried you one year.
Am I right?
- Was there any pressure put on you?
- No, you were very nice.
Forget nice.
I don't give a fuck about nice.
You know that that year...
Please just forget about this.
Now the point is, this is totally different.
- It's strictly on a cash basis.
I told you that.
- Right.
Did I tell you that I got hurt in two busts, that my parents were here... that I'm getting killed all over the fucking place?
I mean, I told you this up front.
Did I not tell you that?
I'm asking you a question.
Did I not tell you that?
Okay, I beat you.
Ten days later you come to me... and you don't have any money.
You're out of line already... but I extend that.
I mean, I extended it to you.
You said you'd have the cash.
You got things going.
I don't know what you're saying.
But you're gonna have the money, you have a way to get it.
I mean, did you not say that?
What you're trying to tell me is, come payoff day... you don't have dollar one, plus you owe me more.
Man, I've heard it before.
You don't have dollar one, do you?
You think I'm some stupid schmuck you're dealing with.
I got to tell you something, pal.
In my line of thinking, you took a total, out and out shot at me...
- Look, Spark, that's not it at all.
- What is it then?
Listen to me.
I got $700 for you tomorrow.
Why didn't you say that in the beginning?
Why didn't you say it?
Because you didn't give me a chance.
- What about the other $1,500?
- One week.
I'll tell you, boy...
What's wrong, Sparkie?
Don't you want your chili?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.
- What?
- Want some chili?
Sport, you wanna fill this up?
Give Sergio something?
You gonna fill this up or not?
Thanks.
- Righto.
- You know Jenny Carr?
Coming.
She's shacking up with my old man.
He gave me this watch for Christmas.
I don't ever take it off.
Ain't it pretty?
You can even wear it in the tub with you.
What are you having?
Cognac?
I don't believe these guys fucking around the way they do.
Jesus, I'd never do anything like that.
Nobody's even going today.
- You, where'd you get that tee-shirt?
- Playing softball.
- What position do you play?
- Any position.
Yeah?
I like shortstop myself.
I got this neat dog.
It's all fluffy and darling.
Did you hear me?
I hear you.
You got a dog.
What the fuck am I doing in this dump anyway?
You should've seen the place where I was last night.
It was really classy.
- Any chance you could go back there?
- No, classy places don't open this early.
The only trouble with my dog is, he shits on the floor... and I don't know what to do about it.
What do you do about it?
You know?
- You try cleaning it up?
- Yeah, I tried that.
It didn't do any good.
He just sits there and looks at me.
Just some dumb fuck like all the men around here.
Bunch of faggots.
I bet they can't even get it up.
Shit.
What am I doing here?
Fuck you, faggot!
You want some more nuts?
Is that you, Barbara?
- It's Bill.
- Come in.
- Come in?
- Yeah, the door's unlocked.
Come in.
Right.
- Is Barbara not here?
- She's out on a date.
- What are you doing?
- Reading my book.
I don't like to stay in my room at night when no one's here.
We're going to Hawaii tomorrow for two weeks.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we're really excited about it, too.
I'll bet.
Charlie never did come back.
Do you know what happened to him?
Do you want to come in and sit down?
Yeah, okay.
You're married, aren't you?
What difference does it make?
It doesn't make any difference.
- We're separated.
- Yeah?
Who are you going to Hawaii with?
Just a couple of guys.
These friends of Barbara's.
- I don't even know them.
- You don't even know them?
Suppose you don't like them?
Those are the chances you have to take.
You wanna make love to me?
Right now?
- It has crossed my mind.
- It has?
This sounds silly, but I don't have any money.
That's okay.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I mean, I really like you.
I mean...
- it's different.
- It's different?
Why is it different?
I mean, I really like you.
I really like you a lot.
You brought me that dog.
Took me to the fights.
It was like a real date.
I think I'm gonna kiss you.
- Isn't this Barbara's room?
- She doesn't care.
- Having trouble?
- Not anymore.
- It's okay, I'll do it.
- I got it.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
You're taking so long.
You didn't unzip it all the way.
You can't take my foot off with the boot.
No.
You gotta unzip it first.
You're kind of clumsy.
I can get it.
Do you want me to do it?
- I can do it.
- I'll do it.
- It's all right.
- I'll do it.
- What you doing?
- We're going to use your bed, okay?
Great.
I just have to find my TV Guide.
I think it's under the bed.
I think it's under here.
Shit, I can't tell you what a crappy evening I had.
Son of a bitch almost threw up all over me.
Damn guy.
Well, he already paid me, so I guess it's...
- How was your evening?
- Great.
I'm having a good time.
Good.
One of us is lucking out.
There it is.
Got it.
Here, I got it.
Got it.
- Where did he go?
- He's gone.
Darling, come on.
Come on, sweetheart.
That's a girl.
That's a girl.
There.
- He didn't really like me.
- Of course he did.
No, he didn't.
Not really.
Honey, think about tomorrow.
I met the guy you're going with tonight.
What's he look like?
He's dark, he has a five o' clock shadow.
- Is he young?
- Yes.
- And good-looking?
- Yes, he is.
- Do you really think I'm going to like him?
- I think you'll love him.
Really?

Clay up the middle Shumate getting it out of backcourt himself... dribbles all the way, blocked by Drollinger...
- Who is it?
- Does a William Denny live here?
Who is it?
- You William Denny?
- Who wants to know?
Well, open the door, we'll talk.
- Who are you?
- Friend of Spark.
Listen, I checked with Spark, and we're straight.
So what's the problem?
I'm straight with Spark.
Why don't you check with Spark and then check back?
Where the hell have you been?
Three guesses.
I'll give you this much, my hat is a clue.
Son of a bitch!
Why didn't you tell me you were going?
It was a spur of the minute thing, William.
I had this incredible dream, right?
I'm in Tijuana, at the dog track.
And I sweep the card.
Every dog I bet on, William... wins like a champ.
What do you know about dogs?
But whatever I'm feeling, William, winner.
Fantastic.
Taking down the cash.
Why didn't you tell me?
Maybe I would've liked to go with you!
You don't know what it's been like.
You want to get to Tijuana, right?
El Sweepo.
I don't win one fucking race.
Maybe if I'd been there you would have.
You weren't in the dream, William.
My parrot was in the dream.
It was a hell of a handicap.
He said, "Bet number four.
Polly want a four."
He doesn't eat nothing, doesn't dirty nothing.
It's going to be all right.
I just need the typewriter.
What have I got?
Packing it all up and moving to Europe to paint?
Yeah.
I'm going to Reno.
I think they've changed the rule, you can't bet your typewriter.
Cash, you know.
Well, a guy told me they got 40-80 low-ball stud game... and a man can win a lot of money.
Sounds interesting.
But why Reno?
Vegas figures to have the same kind of game and it's closer.
Fine.
You go to Vegas, I'll go to Reno.
Reno.
Sounds like you might have a nice shot in a game like that...
- if you have enough money behind you.
- I'm going to win.
- I don't know, William.
- I do.
Reno, that game.
Sounds like a tough game, tough action, William... with a lot of these lumberjacks going up there.
Cowboys, rich guys.
- Tough action, William.
It's a tough game.
- Nobody's asking you to play, pal.
What's with you?
I don't like you coming in here with all your pessimistic shit.
- I don't know what's bugging you...
- I know how I feel.
Let's see...
Yeah, how do you feel?
- Pal, I'm going to win!
- Yeah?
So win!
Who the fuck is stopping you?
Go ahead and win.
- Stop interfering.
I don't interfere with you.
- Who's interfering with you?
I ain't interfering with you.
Look, I know how I feel.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Is that clear?
Because I know how I feel.
Baby, I'm gonna win.
I believe you.
William, did I ever show you my one-armed piccolo player?
The man is a classic.
The man is world-renowned.
William, you got to check this out.
William, for me.
You got to check this out, William.
The man is known all over the world.
Now listen.
Just watch me.
When I reach my crescendo, for me, you got to give me a little hand.
A little applause, William.
Okay?
Right?
Ladies and gentlemen, your beloved, world-renowned, one-armed piccolo player.
The hand, now.
A little applause.
Come on.
Thank you very much.
- You need a partner?
- What?
- A partner?
- Yeah.
I think so.
- You going to take it away now?
- I'm going to stab myself, William.
Get on him.
Good shot.
Fourteen all.
Come on, they're killing us.
- Too quick for the old people.
- I got him.
- Fourteen all.
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
- Way off.
- Free throws.
Free throws.
Get it up.
Shit.
Rebound.
Yours, yours.
- You got a lot of merchandise.
- Yeah, and I want a lot of money.
Here you go.
Are you selling it or making a loan?
- Which is going to give me more money?
- lf you sell it.
I'm selling it.
Move faster.
Here we go.
- That's game.
- Nice shot.
You jerk.
- Way to work on the old man.
- Come on, careful, old man.
The man beat you by 20 points.
I'll tell you what.
Do I need a handicap?
I'll play one on one for whatever you got in your pockets.
- For real money?
- Real money, right.
- For real dollars.
- For real dollars?
I don't see no Walt Frazier or Jerry West here.
You're going to lose your money.
That's what I'm here to do is to lose.
You choose.
Get your money together.
Don't go anywhere, man.
Stay right there.
- I'm standing right under the hoop.
- Fine.
You got some money?
- I got $10.
- I got it.
What have you got?
- You got the money?
- I got it.
You know, this is stupid.
I can't believe this sucker.
I got $10.
- What've you got?
- Got $30.
- I got $10.
- That's $40.
- I've got $5.
- $49.
- That's $49.
- Look at him pulling up his socks.
You got some money, old man?
- What you guys get together?
- We got $49.
- You been returning your deposits?
- That's right.
$49?
You got $1?
I got $50 here.
Okay, here's the game.
You're holding, right?
- Who am I playing?
- You got me, buddy.
- I got the shooter?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Hit or miss for the ball.
- I got the ball.
What is it, 11 hoops?
- That's all right.
Eleven hoops?
- Don't worry about it.
- Come on.
Come on, Russ.
- Now beat him.
- Good.
What's that?
Five?
Come on, man.
What do you think you are doing?
The Blue Book gives $2,400.
- But I can't give you $2,400.
- What do you mean?
With this gas shortage, more people are buying little motorcycles... and bicycles than they are cars.
I'm afraid I just can't find a buyer.
The result is official.
No, man, I got to sell it today.
I tell you, I just can't do it today.
I'll give you $2,200.
- $2,200?
That's the best you can do?
- Final offer.
- Let's go.
- Follow me.
My man!
What's happening?
Any big winners?
You like anything in the sixth?
I'm getting buried here.
How you doing?
Nothing?
Yeah, okay.
You just save your winnings.
I'll see you later.
Let me see your driver's license, kid.
Sports Tie, next time put some booze in it.
Trainer Ralph Cripes, please report to the jockey's room.
You know that guy with the mustache?
The big guy who was just standing here?
- The guy talking about watery drinks?
- Yeah, you know him?
- He's a creep.
- Yeah?
Get me a beer, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen, in the ninth race, a jockey change.
Number Three, Fearless Fred, will be ridden by jockey Rick Carey.
Light Touch, where's my drink?
I left a drink here.
Where is it?
All right, forget it.
Give me straight Scotch.
Straight.
You can't fool around with that.
Take them home again, mama.
Thank you, sir.
That'll be $1, sir.
And you got it.
There's $1 for you, my man.
Thank you.
- A friend of yours?
- My cousin.
Watch where you're going, you little bastard.
Stupid little bum.
Handsome, I must talk to you.
Oh, my God!
What a punch.
Stupid clown.
It's the greatest punch I've ever been hit with.
You busted it clean, right?
Oh, beautiful, man.
You blow my mind.
Kick me in the nuts... you break my nose, rob my money.
You gotta be kidding.
Get out of my way or I'm gonna kill you.
Where're you going?
I mean, I wouldn't lie to you, that is...
Get the hell out of here!
It wasn't as good as yours, but I'll live with it.
Enough, man.
That's enough.
No.
You're a man who knows that ain't enough.
Do you wanna level your own goods?
Nose, ribs, cash.
I ain't such a funny man.
Looks like I hit me a round robin.
You creep... you stick a little toilet paper in your nose, it stops the bleeding.
You better call an ambulance.
The man lost the last race.
He tried to kill himself.
Lunatic.
$1,800.
$1,123.
You have $1,800.
Okay, here's $1,100, you put in $1,100 and then we're partners.
We're definitely partners.
I mean, we're total partners.
I'm putting in $1,800, you're putting in 1,100 'cause I'm not going to lose.
I'm gonna win.
That's the last time you've heard the word "lose."
Exactly.
The door opened the other way and hit me right on the nose.
It's an omen.
The snow is an omen and the toilet door is an omen.
Absolutely.
Hello, Reno.
Sun's coming out.
This rain could have been snow, William.
Very good vibes.
- Good sign.
- Yeah.
Feels good.
Red carpets on the street, right?
Men in orange suits.
Where else but in the USA, right?
But we got to stop off here and play a little slot machines.
Just a little bit, right?
No, you want to get straight to the game?
Gotcha.
Boy, you're walking fast, man.
Good.
Keeping going.
Gotta give you a little smile every now and then.
- I won't break your concentration.
- Concentration?
This must be the place, William.
You ask the guy over here.
- Which way to the poker room?
- To your left.
Charlie, please come here a minute.
Stop wasting time.
Look, I'm not superstitious... but touch Dumbo's trunk before we start to play.
For me, right?
Ever seen an elephant fly?
A little rub.
Okay.
Oh, yes.
We're all together.
Keno?
Keno.
We got to touch a little keno, too.
Who knows, we might get the $25,000 jackpot.
- This is it?
- I think this must be the place.
I don't know if these are past winners or losers.
- Deuce and pair.
- Ten?
William, I think it's heaven.
Hi, fellows.
What can I do you for?
I'll have some JB Scotch straight, with some soda water on the side.
William, have a drink.
It'll loosen you up.
No, I'll have some coffee.
- The coffee's right over there, honey.
- William, you are a straight dude.
Coffee.
Just keep it together.
Don't get in the way of the concentration.
Ace, you're the boss.
It's a sweet game, it is. $2,000 buy-in, right?
You fellows here to drink or play?
My partner here is the player and I guess I'm the drinker.
Hughie?
Player.
Next up.
You're low.
Let's run them down.
Let's start with the bald guy with the moustache.
- The tightest player there.
- Absolutely right.
Percentage player, doesn't take many chances, right?
No flair.
The guy I say is part of a two- or three-man combination.
No sweat, but if you find him after the fourth card, you're not in the hand... unless you've got the nuts.
Right.
Cowboy.
Lyndon Johnson is definitely his hero.
I figure he owns a piece of the town.
Haberdashery, looks like he sells cowboy hats.
He's got the rhythm of the game.
It's his rhythm, but with your natural ability and your strength... you don't have to let him have much.
Keep talking.
The kid?
He's seen The Cincinnati Kid too many times.
He's been trying to beat this game from before he was born, right?
I got him.
On to Specs.
He's a doctor and he's been here playing this game forever, right?
- He'd rather lose a patient than a hand.
- Very good.
Not much of a problem, he don't want to get involved too much.
Red Coat.
Red Coat.
My call is small-time, right?
That's your chair, right?
One-time buy-in and he used to be a cha-cha dancer.
I don't know, but that guy's falling out and that's where you're gonna sit.
Empty chair.
Who could tell?
Bit of luck.
Very tall stack of chips.
A little impressive, but unless it's Claude Rains in The Invisible Man... and you see your chips floating up away from you... you know the game is too tough for us and we go on till we hit something else.
How about Bright Eyes?
Man sitting there?
Deep drawl, Mississippi, best in the game.
I figure he learned to play in the Ku Klux Klan... with a big sheet over his head.
Tough man.
What's the Chinaman's story?
The Chinaman.
What can I say?
Looks like he's a royal prince.
His father probably made a fortune selling frozen egg rolls, right?
When he starts talking, when he starts yapping... you know he's cracking.
I got to have a drink.
Give me a double Scotch, will you?
I'm beginning to feel the pressure.
- You did very well.
- You want cognac in your coffee?
Keep passing.
Okay, he goes once more.
- I'm all in.
- He's all in for $70.
There goes the chair.
It's the one we picked.
Goodbye, Mr. Cha-cha.
I got a straight flush going to the deuce.
- Eight and seven.
- Six high.
- Doc is the winner.
You win it all, Doc.
- Too tough for me, gentlemen.
Sorry to see you go.
So long.
Seat open.
You're on, baby.
And a new player.
$2,000 buy-in.
Purples are $100, reds are $20 and the yellows are $5.
He's supposed to be playing, right?
- He's a dynamite poker player.
- Is he?
He needs to be dynamite in that company.
- I'm Bob Hood.
- How are you?
Bill Denny.
Good to see you, Bill.
Any major moves in the game?
Any big winners or losers?
Nothing much yet.
They only just got started yesterday.
Slim.
What can I do for you?
- When do you get a break?
- Couple of hours.
- You got time, do something for me.
- Sure.
Anything for you, Slim.
In the second race at Santa Anita, there's a horse running... and I need to make a little bet on it.
Right.
- What's the horse's name, Slim?
- Ole Blue out of chute Number Two.
- Ole Blue?
- Ole Blue out of chute Number Two.
No.
Second horse in the second race at Santa Anita.
- That's reliable information?
- Yes, sir.
- The second at Santa Anita?
- Yes, sir.
Great, thanks.
I'll put a little taste on that myself.
Good.
- You don't wanna risk it in that poker game?
- I'm playing right now.
- You're playing right now?
- That's me... that good-looking fellow in the brown coat.
Good luck to you.
I won't play hard at you.
- Let me know about the horse.
- Will do, Slim.
Is that guy for real?
Somebody told me a funny story about him.
That guy usually have that much money on him?
Yeah, he's got a roll.
- That's the most money I ever saw.
- Mellow roll.
I hope William takes it away from him.
Oh, look down look down
That lonesome road
Okay.
Before you travel on
Yeah, look up look up
And seek your maker
Before Gabriel blows his horn
I got a good one.
You're gonna like this.
Oh, look down look down Look down, your fly is open
No, that's not right.
Well, whatever.
You didn't like that?
I'm out.
Excuse me.
And suddenly I banged into this...
- You got a glass of ice water?
- Too hot for you in there?
William, you make a little...
Up a bit.
I can't settle down with you here.
- What are you saying?
- You got to go.
No.
I mean, I got to sit here.
I'm not in the action.
I got to watch.
Let me watch.
Right?
I gotta watch.
You're not telling me that I'm getting in the way of your concentration, are you?
You telling me I'm interfering with your game, right?
Oh, God.
Okay, then you got to lay $200 on me.
Give me $100, $50.
Give me $25 so I can play, get into some...
Ice.
Do you want in?
Yeah.
I want in.
Okay, he comes back.
We're not going to fight.
Put your coat back on.
- Now you mean business.
- I feel like playing awhile.
- Let's accelerate it a little.
- Come on, what are we here for?
- How do you do?
- Fine.
How are you?
I'm very well.
I'd like...
I'd like $1,000 worth of credit.
I have no account, what do I have to do?
You gotta loan on the house?
Well, I don't...
What do you have to do?
I'll tell you.
Then you just give me a roll of nickels... and I'll just kibbitz for awhile 'cause I ain't getting no credit here.
Doctor just calls.
Forty to you.
Are you raising?
I got a cherry.
I got two cherries.
Excuse me.
I got two cherries and nothing happened.
Pit boss?
Let me have a pit boss.
Is there a pit boss?
You know, I wouldn't do that.
- I'm here to win, Doctor.
- Okay.
No hard feelings.
No hard feelings at all.
A pleasure to do business with you.
Pleasure doing business with people who like to do business.
Not many do.
You don't think there'll be five?
I'll say that there will be five, okay, Steve?
- Coca-Cola, please.
- Yes, sir.
I feel like a winner, but I know I look like a loser.
We busted?
We got anything left?
What's up in that game?
- We're up $11,000.
- $11,000.
We are up $11,000.
Well, let us pack this place in.
Let's go back to LA now.
You're my hero.
My new hero.
$11,000.
We're rich. $5,500 each.
Let's go.
Know how long we can live at the track for that?
- I can beat the game for 15...
- Famous last words. 15, 20.
You're here now, right?
You won $11,000.
We could be at the track for 50 years with that kind of money, right?
Charlie, I got the heat.
You gotta give me $200 so I can play some roulette... or do something while you're in there.
Don't look at me like that.
You're not going... $50?
The man's having a good time.
I'm sitting here going...
Wait a second now.
Okay, knock 'em dead, William.
What are you doing?
- Sixty cents for the Coke.
- Wait a second.
He hardly even drank the Coke.
That's my keno money.
One time I made 14 parlays and let it ride.
And every time I'd do it in the bootleg days, I'd take a drink.
And I finally ended up with an old dealer around here who said:
"Doctor, you don't know what you had.
You had that house, had the whole point...
"from old Felix Terwiller and you just don't know what you had."
- And it ended up by me owing him $2,600.
- Ante up, gentlemen.
And that was back in 1926, and that was a lot of dough...
- and it took me six months to pay it off.
- Doc, ante, please.
You can win that much in this game if you hold the best hand.
We've been playing fine.
This game's getting good.
You just keep on playing, everything's going to be okay.
You talk with your cards and start breaking.
She owes me a blackjack.
I won $7,000 more.
I lost the rhythm of the game.
- I'm going to play some blackjack.
- $7,000 more?
- $18,000.
- Lucky man.
- I'm a rich man.
- I should say you are.
You're being kibbitzed by a very wealthy man.
- Good luck.
- I'm going to tell you, Chester...
- you just hang on to your cards.
- $18,000.
Boy!
- Money, please.
- $18,000.
William, you're...
What a streak.
You put me in the game, okay?
Put me in, I'll go play poker...
- and you can knock this table...
- What'll you play with?
You're going to give me some of my money.
William, I got no nails.
I'm going to throw...
A 10!
How could you do a 10 like that?
Never bust nothing.
I guess you think I did that?
I come over here and sit and you're gonna lose.
I'm having a nervous breakdown.
The money can't do me nothing... 'cause I ain't got none.
Just keep on winning, okay?
Jimmy, can I get a little credit here?
- What do I gotta do to have credit?
- Go to the cashier.
He said I couldn't do it anymore.
What's happening?
Why did you disappear from the blackjack?
Is that all that's left of our money?
All that cash?
- How're you doing?
- Very good.
What's very good?
How much did you win?
- What do you have...
- I did very good.
Very good could be something or nothing.
- What is happening?
- It bounced out of 22!
What the hell is that?
What do you want to know?
Ask me what you want to know.
You're over here, ask me!
What do you want to know?
- Bounced out of 22.
- That's right.
Will you get out of here?
You're gonna kill the streak!
Nobody's drinking this.
I'll bet a Milky Way.
Sorry, sir.
The limit's $1.
You just finish this hand and then you see.
You want to bet a Milky Way.
You're liable to get hungry.
Twenty-nine is not mine!
How much money is in there if he wins?
I'll take $1 million on the field and I'm coming.
Twenty-six.
How much are those chips worth?
- Do you mind?
- How's my field coming... with my lucky Milky Way on the field?
Give me a field on the hard way.
$100 a number.
Where's my lucky...
Twenty-six!
We gotta shoot craps.
William, I'm not going to get in your way no more.
- You come with me.
- No.
- No, I'm shooting, you're betting.
- I'll bet $100 on 11.
Okay, that stuff will just wash the dice off.
Number 11.
- Twelve, your line away.
- Look, maybe I ought to go.
No, you stay right here.
Charlie, now you stay right here.
And we start now.
Okay, we start now.
Okay, table, we're starting now.
I got it, Charlie.
Let me see it.
Nine the winner.
He's got us out there, William.
I never saw so many bumble-bee chips in my life.
$100 chips.
They give us real money for this?
Numbers!
Easy eight, okay.
Eight!
It is eight!
Okay, that's number two.
Come on.
Let's have the dice.
Come on, we're all with you, everyone.
Don't worry now.
Numbers.
Eight!
Give me a pair of fours.
A pair of fours and I'll shit in my drawers.
Put your money on double four, lady.
This man's going all the way.
$500 chips!
I never saw $500 chips.
Seventy-five!
Three 11s in a row.
I wanna bet a million dollars. 14-to-1.
- You making that kind of money?
- You bet I am.
Don't distract the man.
Just stay right on the table, William.
Eleven.
Four 11s in a row.
The man throws four 11s in a row.
Where's my $14 million?
I meant what I said.
$1 million on the line for an 11.
Nine!
Nine!
The man throws nines, eights, sixes.
Wake up the world, William.
Roll these numbers till it comes down.
Aren't you going to change the pit guys now?
You guys aren't getting tired, are you?
Hard six.
You get a hard six, they'll put your picture up here.
- Try it.
- Hard six.
Hard eight.
Come on.
Hard six.
Have you ever seen a greater roll than this?
I think you're not gonna believe what I've seen.
This the biggest one you ever see?
- Almost.
- Almost?
We gotta make it the biggest one.
Excuse me.
Can I put $1 on number seven?
What is that?
$1 on seven.
Here, lady, you got $100 to get out of town.
Give that lady $100, tell her to go play that, all right?
Come on, shoot.
Nine.
Come on, 66.
I don't believe it.
- You won't be here next game.
- That's right.
That's your comeback.
- You are the shooter.
- Well, man, okay.
- All right, I'll pass the dice to the lady.
- Okay.
- You are the shooter, ma'am.
- Let's go check out.
Is that the longest roll you've ever been here for?
That man is unconscious.
That's what they said.
- Don't you go grabbing none of these.
- How many points?
Could you buy us a drink?
Here.
Give this to the sweeper.
- Thank you very much.
- Excuse me.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.
- There he is.
- No, we's about even now.
He's in there.
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
These chips, they're just falling out.
William, you okay?
I suddenly got very tired.
I know, I could see that.
I was amazed.
You walked away from the table and you left all your chips.
But I scooped them up.
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We'll get a suite, a couple of outfits, some new clothes.
Maybe we'll hit the old Mustang Ranch, right?
We'll get a couple of little ladies.
Have a ball, right?
Then maybe we'll come down, go to Vegas... hire a limousine, get a driver, hit every track in the world.
Right?
We haven't even started yet, Mr. Denny.
I haven't even picked up the dice.
You just showed me how to win, right?
Conviction, right?
Conviction and control.
I'm going to take a rest.
You and me are going to rest up... then we're back to the tables and I'll be hitting it this time, too.
First, I gotta empty my pockets.
Just chock-full, all these here chips.
I'll go to the cashier now and pick up a little cash.
You just sit right there and take it easy.
La cucaracha, la cucaracha
Just Billy and me
I've got a fortune right here, fellows.
You'd better call for some money.
We got a lot of money here.
Keep everybody back.
Everybody back.
Have a pretzel.
We have pretzels all over the place.
Rack them up.
Call Howard Hughes and tell him we're gonna break his bank, too.
You can do me a favor.
I got a hole in my shoe.
You know where I can get this fixed?
No, I'll cash my shoe in, too.
You give me something for that?
No, we don't give nothing for old shoes.
Don't drop no chips down on the floor, now.
What do you think we got here?
How much money we got?
I think we got quite a few here.
- I just need a...
...any help with the money.
Well, I got a lot of pockets.
Now I want a very good smile.
I want a smile from you.
$82,000 on the button.
New shoes.
Cheese and crackers!
$40,000.
You see, I've been shooting crap games.
Smile, now.
You ain't smiling.
That's right.
Well, then you tell Mr. Hughes that we're gonna break the rest of his things, too.
Look, how much is that now?
- That's $60,000, sir.
- $60,000, sir.
I've been shooting.
I have a knack with numbers.
I just, you know...
Craps happens to be one of my games.
Don't want to take advantage of the house and win too much.
- $70,000.
- $70,000?
Four, six...
- It is unreal, but it's $80,000.
- $82,000.
$82,000.
Thank you very much.
We'll probably see you again.
Excuse us.
Pathway, please.
No, I don't need any police.
No, ain't nobody taking this money from me.
William, $82,000.
William, $41,000 apiece.
Gonna split it up right now, all right?
Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, for you.
Those people there, they want autographs, they want to take pictures.
The Reno Gazette, they want to do a whole feature story... but I said, "No, we're going to be resting until we come back." Right?
Okay, $40,000.
$41,000.
Make sure of this.
Even split.
Eight, nine, and 10.
$41,000.
You always take a big win this hard?
Charlie, there was no special feeling in it.
I just said there was.
Yeah, I know that.
Everybody knows that.
Check this out.
We're heroes here, right?
This lady, Norma Walker, works near the cashier, gave me this:
"If it takes a watermelon five minutes to water...
"how long will it take a sweet pea to pee?
"As long as it takes a pair of dice to crap."
Don't mean a fucking thing, does it?
Charlie, I have to go home.
Oh, yeah?
Where do you live?
I'll see you.
A new game starting, five draw.
Five and ten draw.
Get in the game starting with R.B., J.L., L.B., S. G...
R.M., R.P., G.C., G.W., B.F., and J.B.
Five and ten draw, get in, the game's starting.
Come right in.
Five draw.
L.B. five draw.
Five and ten draw.
L.B.
Feeling lucky?
All right, sir.
Double T.
Hello, Bill.
- Put you on at five?
- Put me on at ten.
On at ten.
Poker has been around for a long time.
It sure has.
But it isn't like this anymore.
The saloon has been replaced by this... with a game that can be played in comfort and with full confidence in the management.
And here is the man who is responsible for that confidence:
Mr. Murry Shepherd.
Welcome to the California Club, where your pleasure is our business.
It has been said that nearly everyone in America understands poker... or wants to.
It is one of America's most popular games.
And since you have shown an obvious interest by coming here... we have prepared a short film to teach you the fundamentals... of the game as we play it here.
Service is our only commodity.
This film is part of that service.
The object of the game is to win the pot.
- Hope I remember that.
- There are two variations of this game:
- High draw.
The highest ranking hand wins.
- Don't give me that.
- Low draw...
- There's my baby.
...where the winning hand holds the lowest possible ranking combination of cards.
As you enter the club, the reservation and game board is located in the card room.
You must stop here and tell the boardman of your game preference.
He will enter your initials on the board... and you will be called and directed to a table by a floorman.
The floorman puts the games together... interprets and applies the rules of poker.
His decisions are final.
C. W. ten blind.
C. W. in the coffee shop.
C.W., ten blind.
C.W., double his money.
The management of the club has no financial interest in any game.
There is no house deal.
Each player plays for himself.
And each in turn acts as a dealer.
When you are seated at the game, you'll be asked to pay a rental fee... which will be collected thereafter at the beginning of each half hour.
B.D. ten blind.
B.D., ten, twenty low.
You must have a full buy-in when you are seated to begin playing.
Chips must be purchased from the chip girl.
The buy-in is determined by the limit of the game you choose to play.
You must ante before you receive cards.
The ante is placed on the number directly in front of you.
The number is also your seat number at the table.
What do you do, Lew?
I'll call.
Acquiring the knowledge and skill to play card games such as poker... is a social asset.
To make the most of this asset... it is simply good judgment to be wanted at the card table.
Shit.
Don't be a spoilsport now.
- Who's the bettor?
- $20 to you.
Me.
You're so pretty I'm going to fold.
- Is everybody out?
- That's it.
You mean I've got a goddamn six and everybody's out?
This depends even more on good manners than upon the skill of the player.
The following principle should increase one's popularity as a card player.
I need one little, teensy...
Sit erect.
- Maintain a quiet bearing.
- Come on, get on with it.
Come on, sweetheart.
- Avoid nervous habits.
- $40.
I have a seat for you.
Now come on in.
During the game, avoid conversation regarding matters not relating to the game.
I'll just have to call you.
An appearance of awkwardness and clumsiness...
I didn't think you were that good.
...gives a bad impression of one's ability to play.
Wait a minute.
What do you think you're doing?
What do you mean, "wait a minute"?
You said it was good.
No, I said that I didn't think that you were that good.
I got a seven-four.
When a hand has gone very well for you, don't talk about it.
The film you've just been viewing cannot instantly make you a good poker player.
The more skilled you become, the more pleasurable you will find the game.
- I had a feeling...
- Next year.
Raise.
Pass.
- I call.
- Well, I'll raise the raise.
- Goodbye.
- I'm out.
Out.
And one more time to you.
What a pot.
- Another $20, huh?
- The table is so slow.
- You wanted one of these.
- Go ahead, I call.
- Cards?
- Pat.
Pat.
Very interesting.
Come on.
Do you mind picking the cards up and dealing them the regular way?
You did stay pat?
You are pat?
Come on.
Wait a second, lady.
I got a big decision to make here.
I'm gonna let you break me down.
I'll let you break me down.
Two cards.
- Two beauts.
- That's very nice.
- Oh, my!
- Great catch.
- Hey, pal, that card's dead.
- What are you talking about?
- The card went off the table.
It's a dead card.
- You're absolutely right, chief.
My gratitude for your knowledge of the rules... except the card never left the table.
The card went off the table, it's a dead card.
Did you see that card go off the table?
- I didn't see nothing at all.
- It's stupid of me to ask you.
- What about you?
Did you see it?
- All I see is the time passing.
- Pop, did you see it?
- Nothing.
How much you bet?
Somebody must have seen it.
- Kenny, this is ridiculous.
- I want to change my table.
- What's the problem?
- The problem is the card went off the table... and hit the floor and he won't give it up.
There's nothing to give up.
The card never hit the floor.
- I caught it before it did.
- All right, take it easy.
Who else saw it?
- Ma'am, did you see what happened?
- I didn't see it.
- How about you, sir?
- I saw a card bounce.
I don't know what happened back here.
You dealt the hand.
You ought to know what happened.
I dealt the second one a little hard.
It never hit the floor, not even close.
Not even close?
All right, that settles it, Lew.
The rule is if the card doesn't hit the floor it plays.
Continue the hand.
- I don't have another table...
- You got your ruling, play!
Just take it easy.
It's not even close. 20-20.
20-20.
The flying card didn't stop you from betting?
40-40.
I raise.
Raise.
What could be cozier than this?
I mean, this is perfection, isn't it?
- You and me in this hand...
- That's pretty.
Just do something!
How much money you got?
How much you got left?
$17.
Not enough for the maximum bet. $3 shy.
- I bet you $17.
- Call.
- Seven smooth.
- No good.
I got a six perfect.
Sorry about...
Damn it.
That last card that went off the table was a joker.
- That's why you wouldn't give it up.
- You're ridiculous.
- You said it wasn't even close.
- That's yesterday's news.
You two are working together.
You're partners.
You two motherfucking creeps are partners.
They should put a muzzle on him.
That's it?
- That man is absolutely ridiculous.
- What's going on here?
What's going on with you guys?
- These two are working partners together.
- I never saw that man before in my life.
I saw him nobble the joker out on the last deal.
The man is totally out of line.
They've been smiling at each other all night.
Come on, will you?
- Sit down and settle down.
- Get control.
Come on.
All right.
- All right, now who else saw this?
- I didn't see it.
- What about you?
- What do you want me to say?
The man calls you a cheater.
The man doesn't know how to play poker.
The man is bad.
He's a complete asshole.
We all know that, right?
The man goes broke, he can't handle it.
The man is on tilt.
You want to hear any more?
- Not me.
- Come on, now.
You'd better just take it easy, sport, 'cause the security's liable to let you go!
Put that guy in a horror show.
That's it!
Any more fighting, and you guys go out of here for good, all right?
All right!
Miriam, what do you say?
I say I can do without any more of that language.
- Right.
- You think there's any cheating going on?
I wouldn't like to say about that.
They've been consistent winners.
And I'm a big loser.
And you know I know how to play poker.
Sour grapes, honey.
All right, let's get it back to normal.
Lousy punk.
- You're not that good.
- Up yours.
Sir, would you like another beer?
...I bet it on Notre Dame 'cause I got a feeling Notre Dame would pull it off.
They beat UCLA when they had so many games going straight.
Yeah, it's kind of similar to the Miami Dolphins.
- This particular game is duck soup.
- They won 17 games straight last year.
Come on.
I can beat that goddamn miserable game.
Don't make me beg for a stinking $30.
I'm sorry.
You know, your attitude just pisses me off sometimes, Button-nose.
Don't call me that.
Now look.
There you go again.
I'm not doing anything.
I need about $80 to get to the track.
Not bad.
- Sir, can I help you?
- Cold beer.
Keg draft.
I'm buying that man sitting over there a beer.
Turned out to be a drinking man?
Nothing personal, but I already got a beer.
Thanks.
Great.
- So, you think the Knicks are gonna win?
- Yeah.
No, Knicks ain't going to win nothing.
Willis is hurting.
Knicks ain't winning.
Celtics, this year.
You follow pro basketball?
- Anything, right?
- Whatever's going.
Yeah, me too.
Action.
Are you gonna give me the $30 or not?
I have to buy this man a drink.
Will you have a beer?
I will definitely have a beer.
Give my friend here a beer.
$1 says you don't know who Glenn Riggs is.
- What's your name?
- Vince.
The name's Vince.
Glenn Riggs was the announcer for Hop Harrigan.
- What do you want $30 for?
- I need it for that girl I got in the bathroom.
I'm only the relief bartender.
I don't go in the cash register.
- Where's Jack?
What is this?
- Jack went to a funeral.
I've been working here for one year, right?
Just give me a piece of paper, a chit.
"$30, Renee. " Okay?
If I give you $30 and I come up short, it'll be your ass.
Baby, you were born short.
And it's always my ass.
Captain Midnight!
This guy giving you trouble?
He ain't the regular man.
- $30.
- I wouldn't sign anything.
Don't sign a thing.
Don't sign anything.
What did you get her to sign?
- Here, Mother.
- Thanks, baby.
You won't be sorry.
Don't worry now, I can beat it.
Goodbye.
$20 says you can't name the Seven Dwarfs.
- I know I can name three or four of them.
- Seven.
I got seven.
- Doc.
- That's one.
- Dopey.
- That's two.
- Snoopy.
- There is no Snoopy.
There ain't no Snoopy.
I know there's Doc... there's Dopey, there's Grumpy, there's...
- You don't have $20 here.
- Wait a second.
I got $20 right here.
- I need a little help here.
What about...
- Here comes seven like a Gatling gun.
- Seven Dwarfs, I'm ready.
- Sleepy, Grumpy, Doc.
- That's four.
- That's three.
- I'm with you.
- Wait a second.
Sleepy, Grumpy, Doc.
Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey.
- Dopey.
- We got Dumbo.
- There's no Dumbo.
- Dumbo wasn't in that cast?
- No Dumbo.
- Gotcha.
- Dumbo flew.
- Well, we both lose?
Remember when Dumbo flew?
They set that little house on fire.
I've seen an elephant walk, but I never seen an elephant fly.
- My God.
- I know.
Dumbo flew.
A lot of black folks said that was bad news... seeing a black crow sing about a big flying elephant.
What's that?
It's taboo.
No black crows.
Judgment day, you know, I know
Aristis, Arastis, Johnson Brown
What you gonna do when the rent come round?
You in the park?
No, I haven't got a car.
I just live...
Not far.
I like to live close to the action, you know, William?
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
You're going to give me a lift?
That's a good idea.
You know, I know the rent means dough
Landlord gonna throw us in the co-co snow
Aroostis, Arastis, Johnson Brown
What you gonna do when the rent comes round?
What you gonna say?
How you gonna pay?
William, you're a minstrel?
Man, I hate key stuff.
Look in his side pocket.
He's got my goddamn money somewhere.
Right here.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
I hope you loved that, Funny Man.
Okay, folks, will you just relax and follow me, please?
What is this, a hospital or a jail?
What's going on?
This is William.
This is Barbara.
She's getting us out of here.
Thanks a lot.
You ever been in jail in New York?
They give you powdered eggs.
Powdered, shitty...
The shittiest food in the world.
I can't believe you haven't been in jail.
What are you doing?
Just trying some of the hot one.
It really works.
Here, you want to try some?
Come on, the heat makes it feel good.
Listen to me, I got experience.
Yeah, easy.
Just don't touch it with the can.
Easy now.
- Not bad?
- That's nice.
That's okay.
Last year, year and a half, I must have hit... about 30 different racetracks in every little town and city I've been to.
- Yeah, how'd you do?
- Tapioca time.
El Busto.
I'll give you a great ace in the hole.
If you find yourself busted in a small town...
Say, is there anything I should know about this?
Listen, fellows, it's breakfast time.
We got Lucky Charms and...
- What's with this?
- Froot Loops.
- Froot Loops?
Have some waffles...
- I'll take some coffee.
Blueberry pancakes.
You'd still be in jail if that guy hadn't given me that $50.
But... chicken.
...a strange town you head straight to the ice cream people... and pick yourself up an ice cream cart.
They got lots of them.
They don't care who you are or what you look like.
- Something to eat.
It's roughage.
- Believe me, nothing.
Desperate people.
They give you a funny little white jacket and you're on your way.
How much do you make in a thing like that?
You could pick up a snappy $25 in less than an hour.
- How do you do that?
- You keep it all.
You don't think I'm talking about working this job legit?
- Your favorite:
Lucky Charms.
- Can I have a beer, honey?
- You want a cold beer?
- No, thanks.
It goes good with your Froot Loops.
- Get some milk, honey.
- Got it.
That shaving cream's not going to stain your white sweater.
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to tell your mother.
Just put it down and it'll all wash out.
Let me taste it for you.
- What is this?
- That crap.
- Come on, we got company.
- I tried to make it look nice.
That looks better.
Here, baby.
One time, right, I had this job selling ad space in a labor union magazine.
Non-existent.
Just get on the telephone, call people and say:
"Do you want to buy some space?"
- Help yourself.
Ain't bad.
Just last night's.
- I just need the spoon.
A little pâté de foie garbage.
Then you get to keep 45% of what you pick up.
How come you don't get to keep all of it if it's non-existent?
I'm not picking it up, I'm just talking on the telephone.
- Yeah, right.
- What do you do?
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm with a magazine.
- You a writer?
- Yeah.
Say!
Do you remember the first bet you ever made on a sport event?
- Do you?
- I bet a nickel... in the 1945 World Series.
The Cubs and Tigers.
Don't laugh.
I lost.
Susan's home.
Five-cent bet and I lost.
- I didn't expect to lose.
- Susan, honey.
I didn't have the nickel, right?
So this guy Mikey asked my mother.
I've been trying to beat it ever since.
What is it?
- Did he hurt your feelings?
- No.
- You can scratch him off the book, honey.
- I don't want to scratch him off my book.
Here's the baby of the house now.
Sweetheart, would you like some Froot Loops?
- Come on.
Therapy.
- No therapy.
What's shaking, baby?
I just want to go to bed.
Take your coat off, sweetheart.
Come on, now, you're starting to get that Halloween look on your face.
It was just...
He was really different.
- Guy wasn't out of line with you, was he?
- No.
- We had such a good time.
- Yeah?
Guy was fresh, was he?
You know what he did?
He gave me $50.
- That was the deal, wasn't it?
- No, the deal was for $30.
He liked you a lot, too, sweetheart.
- How come you were picked up?
- Drunk and disorderly.
- Well, Charlie's not too good with cops.
- He certainly lets them know it.
This is the truth.
You're an animal lover, right?
The great blue whale, right?
You know about a great blue whale?
- That wrestling guy?
- No, it's a big fish.
There's only about two or three left in the world.
And the truth, the tongue of the great blue whale... weighs more than a full-grown African elephant.
- No, it's not true.
- You don't believe it?
You're just making it up to make me feel better.
'Cause you don't like to see me cry.
You feel a little better?
- Yeah, I do.
- Good.
- Who's that guy out there?
- Billy?
He's a poker friend.
- You want to meet him?
- No.
He'd spent his rent money on us.
Yeah, so we brought him home.
The girl's fine.
She just fell in love again.
She'll be okay in the morning.
Listen, William, I'm going to crash.
You can use the sofa if you want.
Thank you.
- I got to crash, too.
- Okay.
- Good night, baby.
- Good night.
I got to get my car.
I can't get my car.
There's nobody up there.
I was just looking for the Guide.
Go back to sleep.
It's Happy, Bashful, Dopey, Doc, Grumpy...
Fuck them.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Denny.
- Hello, Barbara.
This information came in for you from Chino this morning.
- Thank you, Barbara.
The dauphin in yet?
- Since 9:00 a. m.
He wanted to see you.
- What's the matter with your body?
- I had a little automobile trouble, Barbara.
- Is that him?
- It was, sir.
- Did you tell him I wanted to see him?
- I did, sir.
- What'd he say?
- He said, "Thank you. "
- He did?
- He did.
Thank you.
You're most welcome.
- These are the colors on the antique article.
- Oh, right.
I didn't know what time you'd be in, so I just picked out a few.
- I think they're your best bet.
- Thanks, Barbara.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
- Good.
How about some coffee?
- Love some.
Everybody's named Barbara.
- Hello?
- Barbara?
- Yes.
- This is Bill Denny.
Bill!
Hi.
- Is the Ice Cream Man around?
- He sure is.
Charlie, it's Bill.
- William, what's shaking?
- Hey, Charlie.
I'm at the office.
I'm reviewing things.
It sounds like a bore.
You want to track it with me?
Believe me, I'd like to... only I cannot get out.
I'm really all jammed up here.
You let a man rub some hot shaving cream on your ribs... you can take a shot with him at the track.
Listen, I know you're right, but you know, I cannot steal any more time from here.
We'll play it your way, but if you should change your mind...
I'll be at the bar in the grandstand... right above the finish line, near the $100 window, all right?
Yeah, I know the spot.
Okay, listen.
If I can, I can.
I hope you do.
Listen Charlie, thanks for an interesting evening.
Knock them dead.
Okay, I will.
Okay, so long.
It's different.
It's not my favorite, but it is different.
Who in their right mind would put a graveyard...
- on the front of the California...
- Our boss.
I mean, that's not going to sell any magazines.
Well, it's not doing so badly.
Excuse me.
Could we change seats?
No way, lady.
I'm sorry.
The last time I sat facing the rear, I never won a race.
I get sick if I ride that way.
It gets me dizzy.
Hey, miss, this lady here is going to throw up if she sits in this chair.
- Would you mind changing with her?
- I never change seats.
It's bad luck.
- She'll never change seats.
- Lady, I don't mind changing.
This lady here will change with you.
Thank you.
Great.
This lady will change with that lady, but she needs a window seat.
You change there, and I could...
- Everything okay?
Wonderful.
- Great.
Super day for the track.
- Do me a favor?
- Do you want to change seats again?
Would you see what Egyptian Femme looks like?
She's in the fourth.
- Egyptian Femme?
- Femme.
Jerry Weintraub is their manager, and he's got to have something.
Just stock, publicity stills, on, you know...
- What do you want, some 8x10s?
- Yeah.
Egyptian Femme.
The horse has run twice in two years, right?
Each time she stiffed out.
Now she steps up in class... goes up against colts, draws an inside post position in a sprint... and ain't got no speed of her own to get out there.
Is all that in there?
If you know how to read these things.
It says a lot more.
I thought I'd spare you all the gory stuff.
Egyptian Femme?
The lady's going to cap out on Egyptian Femme?
Pretty funny.
Forget that horse, lady.
I hate to see her get away.
She owes me money from last year.
Then you make a bet on her and she'll owe you money from this year.
How far is it to Chino?
- An hour and a half.
- I'm going up there.
They got it all wrong.
If you hear from the dauphin... tell him, "Much luck. "
Well, I'm holding my own.
Just don't bet the chalk.
No chalk betting here.
- Later, Ben.
- All right.
The weight factor, see?
It's the weight factor.
Excuse me.
- Hey, babe, what's happening?
- How's it going?
- How'd you do the first race?
- Not too good.
I like to stay away from the daily doubles, too.
Any info?
- Not as yet.
- If you get any information, I'll be at the bar.
- Andrew, que pasa?
- Hey, Big Charlie, what's going on?
You got a winner today?
Not yet?
Me neither.
Are you sure Egyptian Femme is not going to win?
- You want a beer?
- I don't.
I think you ought to bet on Egyptian Femme.
You're right.
Yeah?
Then why do you have four underlined?
I don't know.
I used to like Banks, the jockey, but I changed my mind.
- You're putting me on.
- Who will you bet?
- Not Egyptian Femme, I'll tell you that much.
- I'm glad you're definite.
Who do you like in the fourth, pal?
William, you made it.
Glad to see you, William.
How you feeling?
Not bad.
I got a little pain here and here, otherwise I couldn't be better.
- Give my friend a beer.
- Want to give my friend here a beer?
I asked first.
I'm telling you another half inch to the left of center...
- That's no good here, Charlie.
- No, this is on me.
- It's on me.
You just keep it all.
- Any time.
You keep it all.
Your money's no good here, pal.
Don't you appreciate a man who gets you in the goodies?
He gave me a kick where I'm breathing and I'm pretty lucky to be here.
Now, how did you manage it?
How'd you get away from work?
I wish I was as good at this as I am at getting away from work.
Razzle-dazzle.
The minstrel man strikes again.
I know.
After today you're gonna have enough money to open up a string of parking lots.
- It looks that good?
- 20-to-1 in the morning line ain't tin.
- You really like it?
- Fucking gold, babe.
- Who's the horse?
- Número uno.
Egyptian Femme.
Tough to figure, right?
He doesn't seem to like to run a lot.
- She, it's a lady.
- Right.
It's beautiful.
Just right.
They've been shopping for a big price... today we're going to nail them.
- Not much to recommend.
- The rest are a bunch of dogs, too, right?
Believe me, she'll pay.
$4 million and change.
If you think the inside post position is bad, she's got a lot of speed, wire to wire.
You're really not worried, are you?
This horse owes me and owes my friend, owes everybody around here.
- We're taking down today, my friend.
- I'd like to toast that, pal.
- Let's go see a man about a horse.
- A man about a horse.
Excuse me.
Where is she?
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Come on.
Don't stop!
Go!
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Stay up there!
- Come on, Valdez!
- Who's Valdez?
Valdez is the jockey!
Come on, Valdez.
Come on, Valdez.
Keep it up there.
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
He'll make a move now.
- Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Stay up there!
- Come on, Valdez!
And he wins!
Take it down.
Come on, we win this race.
We won that race going away.
That was a race.
Did you see that race?
- I mean, Valdez...
That race was fantastic.
- We didn't see the tote board.
- Did you see the other horse?
- We win this race.
I've never done this.
I've never come out...
- Will you trust me?
We won.
- Let's see the photo, man.
Photo finish?
We won going away.
- What were you watching?
- I was watching this race.
Just a little razzle-dazzle.
Can you be happy now?
- I've never done this before.
- The horse wins.
- We're a winner.
- The horse did not win!
Nobody says that.
This is called counting your chickens.
- Chickens and counting chickens?
- Before they're hatched.
You spend a whole life out here and you have a 20-to-1 shot...
Come on, fellows.
Will you get it up here?
I'm telling you, we win the race.
- What is it?
- Goddamn one horse.
Egyptian Femme!
Egyptian Femme won!
Where've you been?
That's what I said.
I can't believe this!
I had that horse!
You rotten creep!
Hey, you!
You said Egyptian Femme had no chance!
The horse won!
Whose money is that?
Had no chance?
- Lady, don't throw oranges.
- The horse had no chance?
The horse had no chance?
You knew it all along!
Are you crazy?
God damn it, lady, you don't throw oranges on an escalator!
Come on, lady, get back!
How's that, lady?
- That's my hat!
- Now, you stop throwing oranges.
Stop it!
- Give me my goddamn hat!
- Stop it!
- You thief!
- You want your purse?
That horse owes me more money!
Here, you want your money?
Take your goddamn...
You asshole, you can't even throw!
Wonder where he's going to take us for dinner tonight?
Who knows?
But wherever it is, it'll be delicious.
- I hope it's the Scala.
- That'd be great.
We can have all that Italian food we love.
We can have mozzarella marinara... and eggplant parmigiana...
- Honey, there he is.
- Zabaglione for dessert.
Now sit down, act natural.
Say, what is this?
Surprise!
No, it's not.
- Hey, baby.
- We're going to make it.
Here you are, Mr. Tenor, and thank you.
- That was delightful.
- Birthday greetings!
Go on.
- Who's that wonderful guy out there?
- That man's a tenor.
- We want you to have the big evening...
- We can't have the big evening tonight.
- She and I got a date.
- What are you talking about?
- You're not working tonight?
- Yes, we are.
I saw you eating your breakfast.
Now I think I'm going to play the piano.
Which way is it?
Honey, sweetheart, it's a very important party.
It's very, very important...
Okay, that's it.
That's it now.
All right, stop it now.
All right.
Stop the music.
Stop.
We're expecting Mr. Kramer.
We loved all the gifts.
We love everything.
- Are we out of here?
- Yeah.
...should've been there when you came to the door.
But it's $150 apiece for the evening for dinner.
- What?
- This evening at $150 each.
- Are we out of here?
- $150.
All we have to do is go to dinner.
Maybe Mr. Kramer wants to give Bill and me $75 apiece.
- Bill's awful pretty to show off.
- I don't know how to take that.
Not at all.
We can tell him we're sick.
Now I get the feeling I'm being mugged by my friend.
- No, this is not right.
- All right, Bill, out the door.
I'm waiting to say goodbye.
You ladies, now, I mean, we're gonna...
- It sure was nice.
- Go in there.
- Sit down and act natural.
- I think you're unfair.
Susan and Barbara must not be deprived of our companionship tonight.
Certainly not.
- They were looking super.
- Should we look inside?
Absolutely.
Mr. Kramer must be some funny dude.
- Hi.
- It's me.
Do you remember me?
- Of course I remember you.
- Is there anyone else?
- No, there's just us.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
- Okay.
- Sweetheart, you look terrific.
- Do you like it?
Yeah.
- You smell wonderful.
- Thank you.
I'm so glad you like it.
- What are you wearing?
- Thank you.
What are you...
- It's Joy, isn't it?
- No, it's Shalimar.
- Shalimar.
- Do you like it?
- Oh, God.
- Mr. Chan!
- Shalimar is my favorite perfume.
- It's mine, too.
Do you like the dress?
I had it...
Yes, I had it made in Omaha.
Yeah, but I just...
I just never had the balls to wear it, you know, outside.
- Well, honey, it's sexy...
- I love the dress.
- Listen to me.
- Dignified.
- Elegant.
- It is.
It's elegant.
Listen, tonight we're gonna go to Chasen's.
Chasen's tonight.
- And then I've got a great big surprise.
- What is it?
After Chasen's, what?
- I don't know if I should tell you.
- Tell us.
A little hint.
- Tell, please.
- Go ahead.
- It has something to do with music.
- Music.
You know?
Listen, before we go, let's have a cocktail.
I made us some daiquiris.
- How about it?
- Thank you.
- I'll get yours.
- Thanks.
You're my best friends.
- Really?
- Thank you, Helen.
Yeah, now you want to give this to Helen.
Honey, don't drink it.
Give it to Helen.
It's just taking forever.
What is that?
I might have to take the top off.
Okay, give this one to Helen.
Shake it up a bit.
That's for Helen now.
That's good.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Hurry, Barbara, I want to make a toast.
- Okay.
Great.
To Helen and her new look.
- Yes, you look great.
- Elegant.
- Yes, elegant.
- Thank you.
- Wonderful.
- Who's that?
- Wait a minute.
Are you expecting anyone?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.
Don't worry, honey, I can take care of it.
Don't worry.
- She can take care of it.
- I hope so.
She can take care of it.
She takes care of everything.
She does, really.
I'll take care of you.
- Okay, ladies, Vice.
We're Vice.
- Vice?
Detective Waters and this is Detective Denny.
Which one of you girls is Barbara Miller?
- Barbara, you didn't say...
- The young one must be Susan Peters.
You damn cops just can't come in here...
Be quiet, and don't call us damn cops.
- What's your name, honey?
- Brown.
- Brown, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- First name?
- Helen.
- Helen Gurley Brown?
- No, sir.
What's going...
Hey, come on now.
- It's not a laughing matter, girls.
- Close the door, will you?
- The door.
- Close the door.
And check the premises for any marijuana or pot or firearms.
- I'm gonna check.
- I do not like the feel of this.
- You can't search this house without...
- You just be quiet, lady.
We'll run you downtown.
You feel like being frisked?
- No.
- You can't frisk a sweet old woman...
Yeah, well.
- Shalimar?
- Yes, sir.
- Smells good.
- Thank you.
- You got a cold?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, yeah.
- Here's a sourball.
- No, thank you.
- It's good for your throat.
- I don't even want this drink.
- Take a sourball.
- Got one for me?
Yeah, I got one for you.
You're like a more responsible older woman than these girls.
- Are you misleading these young girls?
- No, I'm not.
- She's just a friend.
- They're not friends.
They're not?
Why are you here?
- I'm a friend of their aunt's.
- Don't talk like that.
Shut up.
We'll take them downtown and book them.
- Run them right downtown.
- Let's take them in.
- Charlie, let me have a word with you.
- You stay right there.
Be quiet.
They're not friends of mine.
I'm a friend of their aunt's.
- What do you think, pal?
- The one in the middle looks dangerous.
- Her mouth turns down...
- I know.
I don't trust her.
I think we ought to take her down and book her.
How about we book the two on the end and let the one in the middle go?
- You're feeling sorry for her, huh?
- I think so.
I'll make an exception.
You're sure?
Helen, stand back and look at me when I talk to you.
Sorry.
- You look like a very well-dressed woman.
- I am.
- Good background.
Well-educated.
- That's right.
Religious.
My partner and I are gonna believe that you had nothing to do with...
- what's going on on the premises and that...
- I'm just a friend.
Believe me.
But we do feel that you should vacate the premises immediately.
- Bless you.
- Bye, Helen.
Take care of your cold, sweetheart.
Shut the door, Helen.
Bye.
- You people ought to be arrested.
- Jesus Christ!
- I can't believe you did that.
- What was that?
I love your brown shawl.
- Now, let's get...
- You're not really a policeman, are you?
No.
Do you think if I was a cop I would arrest you?
People, now how does Mexican food sound to you?
- Mexican food.
- That sounds delicious.
Do we have time to change our clothes?
Get out of your work clothes and into something comfortable.
Don't take too much time or we'll take Helen.
Excuse me.
And here we go.
You're crazy.
It's a bet.
The black guy over there.
What's his name?
The black guy?
- Take him out with a good punch.
- Come on, baby.
Boy, do we got Morgan.
Place your bet.
What do you want to bet?
$40 and $60.
I bet you even your man don't stop my man.
- You got it.
- Even money.
Come on, sit down, lady, sit down.
Come on, Roy.
We got the first round now.
You got the money they're floating you, right?
$15 on Collins.
Yeah.
Okay.
Collins is a wonderful guy.
Got good marks in school.
I know him.
He just don't fight too good, though.
He ought to be playing baseball or something.
Want another $15 on this?
No, I got one bet left.
I'm gonna bet for your hat, man.
I wanna win your hat.
My man's gonna win this fight, yeah.
- You want my hat?
My Bell Helmet hat?
- Yeah, right.
- Give it to him.
- Here, you got it.
- $10.
Right.
- For your shirt.
- Get in there!
- Keep working!
Get in there!
I think that we won all three rounds.
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.
I'll take the hat now.
You've seen Sugar Ray knock out Foreman.
Come on, people.
Thank you very much.
Come on, let's get out of here now.
Okay, you lay me 10-to-5.
I got suit and you got the lumberjack.
You gotta be nuts.
Why, lumberjack has got to be 2- to-1 over a suit, anytime.
- Okay.
They both can't fight.
- Come on.
- $1,580.
- We're all winning.
Winning all over the place now.
The moon is shining high
Definitely, we'll have to take care of you girls to make up for that silly old man.
But we're gonna make up for Mr. Helen Gurley.
- What's the agenda?
- Right now we're off to the Latin Quarter.
Now, Latin Quarter.
We'll go dancing.
We'll go anywhere you say now.
I mean, you and me are knocking them dead with this $1,580.
Stick 'em up.
I'm sorry I hit your...
- Put her in the car, man.
- Stick 'em up, man.
I don't believe it.
It's hard to believe.
Wait a second.
Put the money on the table.
I can hardly believe this right now.
I'll blow your fucking face off.
- Don't you believe it?
- Will you do what he tells you?
- I don't believe this.
Relax.
- I'll blow your fucking head off.
Wait.
You're not blowing nothing off.
I don't believe it.
We're getting robbed two nights in a row.
- Put the money on the table.
- Do what he tells you.
Please, Charlie.
Wait a second now.
Okay, here's $780, man.
That's it.
You got half and we're taking half.
Take the money and run.
Go ahead, $780, man.
Don't think about it.
Take the money and go.
Get out of here, you fucking bum!
Get out of here, man!
Cut our winnings in half.
- I call.
- I call.
- Take your hand off my knee, will you?
- I dropped a card.
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Your hand is dead.
- I can't help it, I dropped it.
- Then your hand is dead.
Hand's dead.
- Come on, let's go.
- What do you want?
She was aces full.
And what did you have, four what?
Hey, let her play her own cards.
Come on, girls.
This ain't Santa Anita.
You're playing poker.
You girls are sure getting good cards, huh?
You girls friends from way back?
You two?
- No, we don't even know each other.
- I've never seen her before.
I don't care how old you are.
Right in the choppers, lady.
- Come on, be nice, will you?
- The lowest you can get.
- I fold.
- I will raise you.
I call.
I don't want you to see it.
- All right, let's ante up.
- All right.
- All right, everybody in.
- That's right.
Why don't you go home...
You're burying me here.
Get a Chinaman in this game.
- We're falling apart.
- I fold.
Man, I don't even understand what you were trying to tell me.
You figure you're entitled to a free shot...
- I never said I was entitled to a free...
- Then what are we talking about?
When have I never paid you your money, Spark?
- Laying the thug routine on you?
- It's not the question of paying.
You do not pay me on time and time is the thing.
- You know, week to week I pay you...
- I understand that, Spark.
Why do you think you can do that stuff?
You've owed me for nine months.
All right, I did.
Let's make a deal.
Tell him you're sending him some Green Stamps.
How many times have I told you I do not wish to be interrupted... when I'm in conference with Mr. Waters?
- Listen.
You told me four times.
- Get out of here, will you?
- He wants to see you now.
- Tell him he's talking to a thug.
Tell him he'll get his legs broke.
I'll tell him his legs are broken, that's why he can't see him.
Here is the deal:
Ten days.
You don't cut me off for 10 days... and you got your money in your hands.
That's it.
That's my word.
Okay, let me tell you my situation.
All right?
- You wanna hear that?
You care?
- Okay, Spark.
I am getting buried at this point.
I mean, it's been a very bad day.
I understand that, Spark.
I cannot carry you for more than 10 days.
Ten days, that's it.
- I mean, if it's 11 days...
- No 11 days.
- It cannot be.
- Right.
No stories, nothing.
Ten days.
- What if you lose more money?
- Even if I should lose more money.
- You're gonna be able to handle that?
- Right.
Tell him to get Preparation H. Do him good.
Will you give me a break?
- You're going to get it?
No stories?
- I've got it.
I just didn't wanna tap the source...
I didn't want to do it that way, but I'm gonna.
- What do you want?
- What are the Lakers?
Five and a half.
Okay, Spark, I'll call you back.
Five and a half will make you laugh.
Bet your house on this game... lay the five and a half, you get out tonight.
- I don't know, Charlie.
- I know.
If I had an estate in the country I would lay it and tap out on the Lakers.
They're covering tonight.
- This game scares me, Charlie.
- No, don't be frightened.
Now Mr. West, Mr. Goodrich, Mr. Cook's Forum, tonight... they blow the Suns out.
Where do you get your confidence?
The Lakers have been playing crappy... and the Suns are hot.
- Come on, so the Lakers lose two in a row.
- Four in a row.
Right.
And, believe me, it doesn't matter.
- Phoenix wins two or three in a row.
- Five.
Five in a row?
Playing pretty good.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
- Don't matter.
This is the double reverse.
You lay the five and a half... and you bet your house on it.
You've been saying this for weeks.
I'm lucky I don't own much property.
Barbara, I really like these red Christmas bulbs.
You think next year we should do the whole Christmas tree in them?
Don't you think that's a bit on the nose?
- Hi.
How are you?
- How you been?
Fine.
- I was just driving by, thought I'd say hello.
- Good.
- What are you all doing?
- I'm cleaning out the car.
I'm putting up the Christmas tree lights.
- Charlie up yet?
- No.
- Yeah.
Up and gone.
- Yeah?
Where'd he go?
I don't know.
He got up so early I couldn't believe it.
- Listen, come on in for some coffee.
- No, I can't.
Thanks.
Just one cup of coffee.
I'll take a rain check.
- All right.
Bye, Bill.
- Nice seeing you.
- How are you?
- Bill Denny.
What are you doing here?
I checked at the other store and they said you might be over here.
Wait a minute.
Don't tell me why you came.
I'm getting a flash.
You see, I have a good amount of ESP.
I'm blessed with it.
My wife kids me about it, but she respects it when I get these flashes.
Let me see how close I can get to what's going on here.
I get that you're probably back with your old lady... and you want to paint your garage door, perhaps even the whole front of your house.
Yes, I'm getting the color.
It's a greenish color.
Right?
How close did I get?
I need a loan, Harvey.
- A loan?
- Yeah.
- How are you?
- Terrific.
- What's your name?
- Larry.
Larry, I know you're going in here to win a bundle.
Why don't you come and see me when you come out?
- He would like to see Nugie, please.
- Okay, come on in.
Just go on in through the kitchen.
They're in the other room.
- Nugie, there's a guy here.
- Yeah.
- Howdy.
- Howdy, Nugie.
- Trouble finding this place?
- No, it's fine.
There's some crap in the kitchen if you want...
- No.
I'm fine.
- Grab a chair.
- Three, six, nine.
- What've you got?
Jack, five, seven.
I don't know who you know here.
This is Bill.
Four, five, six.
What're you doing?
You're gonna play chess.
I call.
Six card low ball.
Forced to bet the first high card.
$3 the third and fourth card. $6...
Let's keep the game moving.
Three.
Bet him, Nugie.
Terrific.
True love never runs smooth.
- I bet $3.
- Force the bet to $30.
I raise it $3.
First high card. $3 the third and fourth card.
Fifth card six. $12.
- No check and raise.
- Check and raise.
- Three dollars to you, he raised you.
- What's the buy-in?
$200 buy-in.
Help the man.
$3.
I don't know.
How about this?
- Very nice.
- Feel free, man.
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, anytime.
They get me, man.
Don't worry.
Next week you'll beat their brains in.
There you go.
Would you like to see a menu?
No.
- Hi, Sparkie.
- How are you, honey?
Right over here.
- Hiya, baby.
- What happened to your leg?
Dumbness.
Don't play ball after 15 years, I can tell you that.
I didn't know you played ball.
- Actually, I did, you know.
With the Pirates.
- You're kidding.
No, nothing important.
No, I don't want the menu.
- Give me the real hot chili.
All right?
- Sure.
- Sangria?
- All right.
- You want some chili?
- No, I'm fine.
They got great zucchini in here.
You want that?
- Class-A boy?
- No.
I had a shot for...
Well, it wasn't a shot, it was just...
What do you make my figure to be?
As your carry-over I got you down for $2,200.
It's a tough week, baby.
No, that's okay.
I'll tell you... this guy, Lloyd Harris, who's the honcho where I work... he had a very good Christmas season.
What he's created is a slush fund...
You're not telling me a story now, are you?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Come on...
I mean, I carried you one year.
Am I right?
- Was there any pressure put on you?
- No, you were very nice.
Forget nice.
I don't give a fuck about nice.
You know that that year...
Please just forget about this.
Now the point is, this is totally different.
- It's strictly on a cash basis.
I told you that.
- Right.
Did I tell you that I got hurt in two busts, that my parents were here... that I'm getting killed all over the fucking place?
I mean, I told you this up front.
Did I not tell you that?
I'm asking you a question.
Did I not tell you that?
Okay, I beat you.
Ten days later you come to me... and you don't have any money.
You're out of line already... but I extend that.
I mean, I extended it to you.
You said you'd have the cash.
You got things going.
I don't know what you're saying.
But you're gonna have the money, you have a way to get it.
I mean, did you not say that?
What you're trying to tell me is, come payoff day... you don't have dollar one, plus you owe me more.
Man, I've heard it before.
You don't have dollar one, do you?
You think I'm some stupid schmuck you're dealing with.
I got to tell you something, pal.
In my line of thinking, you took a total, out and out shot at me...
- Look, Spark, that's not it at all.
- What is it then?
Listen to me.
I got $700 for you tomorrow.
Why didn't you say that in the beginning?
Why didn't you say it?
Because you didn't give me a chance.
- What about the other $1,500?
- One week.
I'll tell you, boy...
What's wrong, Sparkie?
Don't you want your chili?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.
- What?
- Want some chili?
Sport, you wanna fill this up?
Give Sergio something?
You gonna fill this up or not?
Thanks.
- Righto.
- You know Jenny Carr?
Coming.
She's shacking up with my old man.
He gave me this watch for Christmas.
I don't ever take it off.
Ain't it pretty?
You can even wear it in the tub with you.
What are you having?
Cognac?
I don't believe these guys fucking around the way they do.
Jesus, I'd never do anything like that.
Nobody's even going today.
- You, where'd you get that tee-shirt?
- Playing softball.
- What position do you play?
- Any position.
Yeah?
I like shortstop myself.
I got this neat dog.
It's all fluffy and darling.
Did you hear me?
I hear you.
You got a dog.
What the fuck am I doing in this dump anyway?
You should've seen the place where I was last night.
It was really classy.
- Any chance you could go back there?
- No, classy places don't open this early.
The only trouble with my dog is, he shits on the floor... and I don't know what to do about it.
What do you do about it?
You know?
- You try cleaning it up?
- Yeah, I tried that.
It didn't do any good.
He just sits there and looks at me.
Just some dumb fuck like all the men around here.
Bunch of faggots.
I bet they can't even get it up.
Shit.
What am I doing here?
Fuck you, faggot!
You want some more nuts?
Is that you, Barbara?
- It's Bill.
- Come in.
- Come in?
- Yeah, the door's unlocked.
Come in.
Right.
- Is Barbara not here?
- She's out on a date.
- What are you doing?
- Reading my book.
I don't like to stay in my room at night when no one's here.
We're going to Hawaii tomorrow for two weeks.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we're really excited about it, too.
I'll bet.
Charlie never did come back.
Do you know what happened to him?
Do you want to come in and sit down?
Yeah, okay.
You're married, aren't you?
What difference does it make?
It doesn't make any difference.
- We're separated.
- Yeah?
Who are you going to Hawaii with?
Just a couple of guys.
These friends of Barbara's.
- I don't even know them.
- You don't even know them?
Suppose you don't like them?
Those are the chances you have to take.
You wanna make love to me?
Right now?
- It has crossed my mind.
- It has?
This sounds silly, but I don't have any money.
That's okay.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I mean, I really like you.
I mean...
- it's different.
- It's different?
Why is it different?
I mean, I really like you.
I really like you a lot.
You brought me that dog.
Took me to the fights.
It was like a real date.
I think I'm gonna kiss you.
- Isn't this Barbara's room?
- She doesn't care.
- Having trouble?
- Not anymore.
- It's okay, I'll do it.
- I got it.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
You're taking so long.
You didn't unzip it all the way.
You can't take my foot off with the boot.
No.
You gotta unzip it first.
You're kind of clumsy.
I can get it.
Do you want me to do it?
- I can do it.
- I'll do it.
- It's all right.
- I'll do it.
- What you doing?
- We're going to use your bed, okay?
Great.
I just have to find my TV Guide.
I think it's under the bed.
I think it's under here.
Shit, I can't tell you what a crappy evening I had.
Son of a bitch almost threw up all over me.
Damn guy.
Well, he already paid me, so I guess it's...
- How was your evening?
- Great.
I'm having a good time.
Good.
One of us is lucking out.
There it is.
Got it.
Here, I got it.
Got it.
- Where did he go?
- He's gone.
Darling, come on.
Come on, sweetheart.
That's a girl.
That's a girl.
There.
- He didn't really like me.
- Of course he did.
No, he didn't.
Not really.
Honey, think about tomorrow.
I met the guy you're going with tonight.
What's he look like?
He's dark, he has a five o' clock shadow.
- Is he young?
- Yes.
- And good-looking?
- Yes, he is.
- Do you really think I'm going to like him?
- I think you'll love him.
Really?
...over here at high post, to Meyers, open at 15, hits.
David Meyers, 92-65.
Clay up the middle Shumate getting it out of backcourt himself... dribbles all the way, blocked by Drollinger...
- Who is it?
- Does a William Denny live here?
Who is it?
- You William Denny?
- Who wants to know?
Well, open the door, we'll talk.
- Who are you?
- Friend of Spark.
Listen, I checked with Spark, and we're straight.
So what's the problem?
I'm straight with Spark.
Why don't you check with Spark and then check back?
Where the hell have you been?
Three guesses.
I'll give you this much, my hat is a clue.
Son of a bitch!
Why didn't you tell me you were going?
It was a spur of the minute thing, William.
I had this incredible dream, right?
I'm in Tijuana, at the dog track.
And I sweep the card.
Every dog I bet on, William... wins like a champ.
What do you know about dogs?
But whatever I'm feeling, William, winner.
Fantastic.
Taking down the cash.
Why didn't you tell me?
Maybe I would've liked to go with you!
You don't know what it's been like.
You want to get to Tijuana, right?
El Sweepo.
I don't win one fucking race.
Maybe if I'd been there you would have.
You weren't in the dream, William.
My parrot was in the dream.
It was a hell of a handicap.
He said, "Bet number four.
Polly want a four. "
He doesn't eat nothing, doesn't dirty nothing.
It's going to be all right.
I just need the typewriter.
What have I got?
Packing it all up and moving to Europe to paint?
Yeah.
I'm going to Reno.
I think they've changed the rule, you can't bet your typewriter.
Cash, you know.
Well, a guy told me they got 40-80 low-ball stud game... and a man can win a lot of money.
Sounds interesting.
But why Reno?
Vegas figures to have the same kind of game and it's closer.
Fine.
You go to Vegas, I'll go to Reno.
Reno.
Sounds like you might have a nice shot in a game like that...
- if you have enough money behind you.
- I'm going to win.
- I don't know, William.
- I do.
Reno, that game.
Sounds like a tough game, tough action, William... with a lot of these lumberjacks going up there.
Cowboys, rich guys.
- Tough action, William.
It's a tough game.
- Nobody's asking you to play, pal.
What's with you?
I don't like you coming in here with all your pessimistic shit.
- I don't know what's bugging you...
- I know how I feel.
Let's see...
Yeah, how do you feel?
- Pal, I'm going to win!
- Yeah?
So win!
Who the fuck is stopping you?
Go ahead and win.
- Stop interfering.
I don't interfere with you.
- Who's interfering with you?
I ain't interfering with you.
Look, I know how I feel.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Is that clear?
Because I know how I feel.
Baby, I'm gonna win.
I believe you.
William, did I ever show you my one-armed piccolo player?
The man is a classic.
The man is world-renowned.
William, you got to check this out.
William, for me.
You got to check this out, William.
The man is known all over the world.
Now listen.
Just watch me.
When I reach my crescendo, for me, you got to give me a little hand.
A little applause, William.
Okay?
Right?
Ladies and gentlemen, your beloved, world-renowned, one-armed piccolo player.
The hand, now.
A little applause.
Come on.
Thank you very much.
- You need a partner?
- What?
- A partner?
- Yeah.
I think so.
- You going to take it away now?
- I'm going to stab myself, William.
Get on him.
Good shot.
Fourteen all.
Come on, they're killing us.
- Too quick for the old people.
- I got him.
- Fourteen all.
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
- Way off.
- Free throws.
Free throws.
Get it up.
Shit.
Rebound.
Yours, yours.
- You got a lot of merchandise.
- Yeah, and I want a lot of money.
Here you go.
Are you selling it or making a loan?
- Which is going to give me more money?
- If you sell it.
I'm selling it.
Move faster.
Here we go.
- That's game.
- Nice shot.
You jerk.
- Way to work on the old man.
- Come on, careful, old man.
The man beat you by 20 points.
I'll tell you what.
Do I need a handicap?
I'll play one on one for whatever you got in your pockets.
- For real money?
- Real money, right.
- For real dollars.
- For real dollars?
I don't see no Walt Frazier or Jerry West here.
You're going to lose your money.
That's what I'm here to do is to lose.
You choose.
Get your money together.
Don't go anywhere, man.
Stay right there.
- I'm standing right under the hoop.
- Fine.
You got some money?
- I got $10.
- I got it.
What have you got?
- You got the money?
- I got it.
You know, this is stupid.
I can't believe this sucker.
I got $10.
- What've you got?
- Got $30.
- I got $10.
- That's $40.
- I've got $5.
- $49.
- That's $49.
- Look at him pulling up his socks.
You got some money, old man?
- What you guys get together?
- We got $49.
- You been returning your deposits?
- That's right.
$49?
You got $1?
I got $50 here.
Okay, here's the game.
You're holding, right?
- Who am I playing?
- You got me, buddy.
- I got the shooter?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Hit or miss for the ball.
- I got the ball.
What is it, 11 hoops?
- That's all right.
Eleven hoops?
- Don't worry about it.
- Come on.
Come on, Russ.
- Now beat him.
- Good.
What's that?
Five?
Come on, man.
What do you think you are doing?
The Blue Book gives $2,400.
- But I can't give you $2,400.
- What do you mean?
With this gas shortage, more people are buying little motorcycles... and bicycles than they are cars.
I'm afraid I just can't find a buyer.
The result is official.
No, man, I got to sell it today.
I tell you, I just can't do it today.
I'll give you $2,200.
- $2,200?
That's the best you can do?
- Final offer.
- Let's go.
- Follow me.
My man!
What's happening?
Any big winners?
You like anything in the sixth?
I'm getting buried here.
How you doing?
Nothing?
Yeah, okay.
You just save your winnings.
I'll see you later.
Let me see your driver's license, kid.
Sports Tie, next time put some booze in it.
Trainer Ralph Cripes, please report to the jockey's room.
You know that guy with the mustache?
The big guy who was just standing here?
- The guy talking about watery drinks?
- Yeah, you know him?
- He's a creep.
- Yeah?
Get me a beer, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen, in the ninth race, a jockey change.
Number Three, Fearless Fred, will be ridden by jockey Rick Carey.
Light Touch, where's my drink?
I left a drink here.
Where is it?
All right, forget it.
Give me straight Scotch.
Straight.
You can't fool around with that.
Take them home again, mama.
Thank you, sir.
That'll be $1, sir.
And you got it.
There's $1 for you, my man.
Thank you.
- A friend of yours?
- My cousin.
Watch where you're going, you little bastard.
Stupid little bum.
Handsome, I must talk to you.
Oh, my God!
What a punch.
Stupid clown.
It's the greatest punch I've ever been hit with.
You busted it clean, right?
Oh, beautiful, man.
You blow my mind.
Kick me in the nuts... you break my nose, rob my money.
You gotta be kidding.
Get out of my way or I'm gonna kill you.
Where're you going?
I mean, I wouldn't lie to you, that is...
Get the hell out of here!
It wasn't as good as yours, but I'll live with it.
Enough, man.
That's enough.
No.
You're a man who knows that ain't enough.
Do you wanna level your own goods?
Nose, ribs, cash.
I ain't such a funny man.
Looks like I hit me a round robin.
You creep... you stick a little toilet paper in your nose, it stops the bleeding.
You better call an ambulance.
The man lost the last race.
He tried to kill himself.
Lunatic.
$1,800.
$1,123.
You have $1,800.
Okay, here's $1,100, you put in $1,100 and then we're partners.
We're definitely partners.
I mean, we're total partners.
I'm putting in $1,800, you're putting in 1,100 'cause I'm not going to lose.
I'm gonna win.
That's the last time you've heard the word "lose. "
Exactly.
The door opened the other way and hit me right on the nose.
It's an omen.
The snow is an omen and the toilet door is an omen.
Absolutely.
Hello, Reno.
Sun's coming out.
This rain could have been snow, William.
Very good vibes.
- Good sign.
- Yeah.
Feels good.
Red carpets on the street, right?
Men in orange suits.
Where else but in the USA, right?
But we got to stop off here and play a little slot machines.
Just a little bit, right?
No, you want to get straight to the game?
Gotcha.
Boy, you're walking fast, man.
Good.
Keeping going.
Gotta give you a little smile every now and then.
- I won't break your concentration.
- Concentration?
This must be the place, William.
You ask the guy over here.
- Which way to the poker room?
- To your left.
Charlie, please come here a minute.
Stop wasting time.
Look, I'm not superstitious... but touch Dumbo's trunk before we start to play.
For me, right?
Ever seen an elephant fly?
A little rub.
Okay.
Oh, yes.
We're all together.
Keno?
Keno.
We got to touch a little keno, too.
Who knows, we might get the $25,000 jackpot.
- This is it?
- I think this must be the place.
I don't know if these are past winners or losers.
- Deuce and pair.
- Ten?
William, I think it's heaven.
Hi, fellows.
What can I do you for?
I'll have some JB Scotch straight, with some soda water on the side.
William, have a drink.
It'll loosen you up.
No, I'll have some coffee.
- The coffee's right over there, honey.
- William, you are a straight dude.
Coffee.
Just keep it together.
Don't get in the way of the concentration.
Ace, you're the boss.
It's a sweet game, it is. $2,000 buy-in, right?
You fellows here to drink or play?
My partner here is the player and I guess I'm the drinker.
Hughie?
Player.
Next up.
You're low.
Let's run them down.
Let's start with the bald guy with the moustache.
- The tightest player there.
- Absolutely right.
Percentage player, doesn't take many chances, right?
No flair.
The guy I say is part of a two- or three-man combination.
No sweat, but if you find him after the fourth card, you're not in the hand... unless you've got the nuts.
Right.
Cowboy.
Lyndon Johnson is definitely his hero.
I figure he owns a piece of the town.
Haberdashery, looks like he sells cowboy hats.
He's got the rhythm of the game.
It's his rhythm, but with your natural ability and your strength... you don't have to let him have much.
Keep talking.
The kid?
He's seen The Cincinnati Kid too many times.
He's been trying to beat this game from before he was born, right?
I got him.
On to Specs.
He's a doctor and he's been here playing this game forever, right?
- He'd rather lose a patient than a hand.
- Very good.
Not much of a problem, he don't want to get involved too much.
Red Coat.
Red Coat.
My call is small-time, right?
That's your chair, right?
One-time buy-in and he used to be a cha-cha dancer.
I don't know, but that guy's falling out and that's where you're gonna sit.
Empty chair.
Who could tell?
Bit of luck.
Very tall stack of chips.
A little impressive, but unless it's Claude Rains in The Invisible Man... and you see your chips floating up away from you... you know the game is too tough for us and we go on till we hit something else.
How about Bright Eyes?
Man sitting there?
Deep drawl, Mississippi, best in the game.
I figure he learned to play in the Ku Klux Klan... with a big sheet over his head.
Tough man.
What's the Chinaman's story?
The Chinaman.
What can I say?
Looks like he's a royal prince.
His father probably made a fortune selling frozen egg rolls, right?
When he starts talking, when he starts yapping... you know he's cracking.
I got to have a drink.
Give me a double Scotch, will you?
I'm beginning to feel the pressure.
- You did very well.
- You want cognac in your coffee?
Keep passing.
Okay, he goes once more.
- I'm all in.
- He's all in for $70.
There goes the chair.
It's the one we picked.
Goodbye, Mr. Cha-cha.
I got a straight flush going to the deuce.
- Eight and seven.
- Six high.
- Doc is the winner.
You win it all, Doc.
- Too tough for me, gentlemen.
Sorry to see you go.
So long.
Seat open.
You're on, baby.
And a new player.
$2,000 buy-in.
Purples are $100, reds are $20 and the yellows are $5.
He's supposed to be playing, right?
- He's a dynamite poker player.
- Is he?
He needs to be dynamite in that company.
- I'm Bob Hood.
- How are you?
Bill Denny.
Good to see you, Bill.
Any major moves in the game?
Any big winners or losers?
Nothing much yet.
They only just got started yesterday.
Slim.
What can I do for you?
- When do you get a break?
- Couple of hours.
- You got time, do something for me.
- Sure.
Anything for you, Slim.
In the second race at Santa Anita, there's a horse running... and I need to make a little bet on it.
Right.
- What's the horse's name, Slim?
- Ole Blue out of chute Number Two.
- Ole Blue?
- Ole Blue out of chute Number Two.
No.
Second horse in the second race at Santa Anita.
- That's reliable information?
- Yes, sir.
- The second at Santa Anita?
- Yes, sir.
Great, thanks.
I'll put a little taste on that myself.
Good.
- You don't wanna risk it in that poker game?
- I'm playing right now.
- You're playing right now?
- That's me... that good-looking fellow in the brown coat.
Good luck to you.
I won't play hard at you.
- Let me know about the horse.
- Will do, Slim.
Is that guy for real?
Somebody told me a funny story about him.
That guy usually have that much money on him?
Yeah, he's got a roll.
- That's the most money I ever saw.
- Mellow roll.
I hope William takes it away from him.
Oh, look down look down
That lonesome road
Okay.
Before you travel on
Yeah, look up look up
And seek your maker
Before Gabriel blows his horn
I got a good one.
You're gonna like this.
Oh, look down look down Look down, your fly is open
No, that's not right.
Well, whatever.
You didn't like that?
I'm out.
Excuse me.
And suddenly I banged into this...
- You got a glass of ice water?
- Too hot for you in there?
William, you make a little...
Up a bit.
I can't settle down with you here.
- What are you saying?
- You got to go.
No.
I mean, I got to sit here.
I'm not in the action.
I got to watch.
Let me watch.
Right?
I gotta watch.
You're not telling me that I'm getting in the way of your concentration, are you?
You telling me I'm interfering with your game, right?
Oh, God.
Okay, then you got to lay $200 on me.
Give me $100, $50.
Give me $25 so I can play, get into some...
Ice.
Do you want in?
Yeah.
I want in.
Okay, he comes back.
We're not going to fight.
Put your coat back on.
- Now you mean business.
- I feel like playing awhile.
- Let's accelerate it a little.
- Come on, what are we here for?
- How do you do?
- Fine.
How are you?
I'm very well.
I'd like...
I'd like $1,000 worth of credit.
I have no account, what do I have to do?
You gotta loan on the house?
Well, I don't...
What do you have to do?
I'll tell you.
Then you just give me a roll of nickels... and I'll just kibbitz for awhile 'cause I ain't getting no credit here.
Doctor just calls.
Forty to you.
Are you raising?
I got a cherry.
I got two cherries.
Excuse me.
I got two cherries and nothing happened.
Pit boss?
Let me have a pit boss.
Is there a pit boss?
You know, I wouldn't do that.
- I'm here to win, Doctor.
- Okay.
No hard feelings.
No hard feelings at all.
A pleasure to do business with you.
Pleasure doing business with people who like to do business.
Not many do.
You don't think there'll be five?
I'll say that there will be five, okay, Steve?
- Coca-Cola, please.
- Yes, sir.
I feel like a winner, but I know I look like a loser.
We busted?
We got anything left?
What's up in that game?
- We're up $11,000.
- $11,000.
We are up $11,000.
Well, let us pack this place in.
Let's go back to LA now.
You're my hero.
My new hero.
$11,000.
We're rich. $5,500 each.
Let's go.
Know how long we can live at the track for that?
- I can beat the game for 15...
- Famous last words. 15, 20.
You're here now, right?
You won $11,000.
We could be at the track for 50 years with that kind of money, right?
Charlie, I got the heat.
You gotta give me $200 so I can play some roulette... or do something while you're in there.
Don't look at me like that.
You're not going... $50?
The man's having a good time.
I'm sitting here going...
Wait a second now.
Okay, knock 'em dead, William.
What are you doing?
- Sixty cents for the Coke.
- Wait a second.
He hardly even drank the Coke.
That's my keno money.
One time I made 14 parlays and let it ride.
And every time I'd do it in the bootleg days, I'd take a drink.
And I finally ended up with an old dealer around here who said:
"Doctor, you don't know what you had.
You had that house, had the whole point...
"from old Felix Terwiller and you just don't know what you had. "
- And it ended up by me owing him $2,600.
- Ante up, gentlemen.
And that was back in 1926, and that was a lot of dough...
- and it took me six months to pay it off.
- Doc, ante, please.
You can win that much in this game if you hold the best hand.
We've been playing fine.
This game's getting good.
You just keep on playing, everything's going to be okay.
You talk with your cards and start breaking.
She owes me a blackjack.
I won $7,000 more.
I lost the rhythm of the game.
- I'm going to play some blackjack.
- $7,000 more?
- $18,000.
- Lucky man.
- I'm a rich man.
- I should say you are.
You're being kibbitzed by a very wealthy man.
- Good luck.
- I'm going to tell you, Chester...
- you just hang on to your cards.
- $18,000.
Boy!
- Money, please.
- $18,000.
William, you're...
What a streak.
You put me in the game, okay?
Put me in, I'll go play poker...
- and you can knock this table...
- What'll you play with?
You're going to give me some of my money.
William, I got no nails.
I'm going to throw...
A 10!
How could you do a 10 like that?
Never bust nothing.
I guess you think I did that?
I come over here and sit and you're gonna lose.
I'm having a nervous breakdown.
The money can't do me nothing... 'cause I ain't got none.
Just keep on winning, okay?
Jimmy, can I get a little credit here?
- What do I gotta do to have credit?
- Go to the cashier.
He said I couldn't do it anymore.
What's happening?
Why did you disappear from the blackjack?
Is that all that's left of our money?
All that cash?
- How're you doing?
- Very good.
What's very good?
How much did you win?
- What do you have...
- I did very good.
Very good could be something or nothing.
- What is happening?
- It bounced out of 22!
What the hell is that?
What do you want to know?
Ask me what you want to know.
You're over here, ask me!
What do you want to know?
- Bounced out of 22.
- That's right.
Will you get out of here?
You're gonna kill the streak!
Nobody's drinking this.
I'll bet a Milky Way.
Sorry, sir.
The limit's $1.
You just finish this hand and then you see.
You want to bet a Milky Way.
You're liable to get hungry.
Twenty-nine is not mine!
How much money is in there if he wins?
I'll take $1 million on the field and I'm coming.
Twenty-six.
How much are those chips worth?
- Do you mind?
- How's my field coming... with my lucky Milky Way on the field?
Give me a field on the hard way.
$100 a number.
Where's my lucky...
Twenty-six!
We gotta shoot craps.
William, I'm not going to get in your way no more.
- You come with me.
- No.
- No, I'm shooting, you're betting.
- I'll bet $100 on 11.
Okay, that stuff will just wash the dice off.
Number 11.
- Twelve, your line away.
- Look, maybe I ought to go.
No, you stay right here.
Charlie, now you stay right here.
And we start now.
Okay, we start now.
Okay, table, we're starting now.
I got it, Charlie.
Let me see it.
Nine the winner.
He's got us out there, William.
I never saw so many bumble-bee chips in my life.
$100 chips.
They give us real money for this?
Numbers!
Easy eight, okay.
Eight!
It is eight!
Okay, that's number two.
Come on.
Let's have the dice.
Come on, we're all with you, everyone.
Don't worry now.
Numbers.
Eight!
Give me a pair of fours.
A pair of fours and I'll shit in my drawers.
Put your money on double four, lady.
This man's going all the way.
$500 chips!
I never saw $500 chips.
Seventy-five!
Three 11s in a row.
I wanna bet a million dollars. 14-to-1.
- You making that kind of money?
- You bet I am.
Don't distract the man.
Just stay right on the table, William.
Eleven.
Four 11s in a row.
The man throws four 11s in a row.
Where's my $14 million?
I meant what I said.
$1 million on the line for an 11.
Nine!
Nine!
The man throws nines, eights, sixes.
Wake up the world, William.
Roll these numbers till it comes down.
Aren't you going to change the pit guys now?
You guys aren't getting tired, are you?
Hard six.
You get a hard six, they'll put your picture up here.
- Try it.
- Hard six.
Hard eight.
Come on.
Hard six.
Have you ever seen a greater roll than this?
I think you're not gonna believe what I've seen.
This the biggest one you ever see?
- Almost.
- Almost?
We gotta make it the biggest one.
Excuse me.
Can I put $1 on number seven?
What is that?
$1 on seven.
Here, lady, you got $100 to get out of town.
Give that lady $100, tell her to go play that, all right?
Come on, shoot.
Nine.
Come on, 66.
I don't believe it.
- You won't be here next game.
- That's right.
That's your comeback.
- You are the shooter.
- Well, man, okay.
- All right, I'll pass the dice to the lady.
- Okay.
- You are the shooter, ma'am.
- Let's go check out.
Is that the longest roll you've ever been here for?
That man is unconscious.
That's what they said.
- Don't you go grabbing none of these.
- How many points?
Could you buy us a drink?
Here.
Give this to the sweeper.
- Thank you very much.
- Excuse me.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.
- There he is.
- No, we's about even now.
He's in there.
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
These chips, they're just falling out.
William, you okay?
I suddenly got very tired.
I know, I could see that.
I was amazed.
You walked away from the table and you left all your chips.
But I scooped them up.
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We'll get a suite, a couple of outfits, some new clothes.
Maybe we'll hit the old Mustang Ranch, right?
We'll get a couple of little ladies.
Have a ball, right?
Then maybe we'll come down, go to Vegas... hire a limousine, get a driver, hit every track in the world.
Right?
We haven't even started yet, Mr. Denny.
I haven't even picked up the dice.
You just showed me how to win, right?
Conviction, right?
Conviction and control.
I'm going to take a rest.
You and me are going to rest up... then we're back to the tables and I'll be hitting it this time, too.
First, I gotta empty my pockets.
Just chock-full, all these here chips.
I'll go to the cashier now and pick up a little cash.
You just sit right there and take it easy.
La cucaracha, la cucaracha
Just Billy and me
I've got a fortune right here, fellows.
You'd better call for some money.
We got a lot of money here.
Keep everybody back.
Everybody back.
Have a pretzel.
We have pretzels all over the place.
Rack them up.
Call Howard Hughes and tell him we're gonna break his bank, too.
You can do me a favor.
I got a hole in my shoe.
You know where I can get this fixed?
No, I'll cash my shoe in, too.
You give me something for that?
No, we don't give nothing for old shoes.
Don't drop no chips down on the floor, now.
What do you think we got here?
How much money we got?
I think we got quite a few here.
- I just need a...
... any help with the money.
Well, I got a lot of pockets.
Now I want a very good smile.
I want a smile from you.
$82,000 on the button.
New shoes.
Cheese and crackers!
$40,000.
You see, I've been shooting crap games.
Smile, now.
You ain't smiling.
That's right.
Well, then you tell Mr. Hughes that we're gonna break the rest of his things, too.
Look, how much is that now?
- That's $60,000, sir.
- $60,000, sir.
I've been shooting.
I have a knack with numbers.
I just, you know...
Craps happens to be one of my games.
Don't want to take advantage of the house and win too much.
- $70,000.
- $70,000?
Four, six...
- It is unreal, but it's $80,000.
- $82,000.
$82,000.
Thank you very much.
We'll probably see you again.
Excuse us.
Pathway, please.
No, I don't need any police.
No, ain't nobody taking this money from me.
William, $82,000.
William, $41,000 apiece.
Gonna split it up right now, all right?
Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, for you.
Those people there, they want autographs, they want to take pictures.
The Reno Gazette, they want to do a whole feature story... but I said, "No, we're going to be resting until we come back. " Right?
Okay, $40,000.
$41,000.
Make sure of this.
Even split.
Eight, nine, and 10.
$41,000.
You always take a big win this hard?
Charlie, there was no special feeling in it.
I just said there was.
Yeah, I know that.
Everybody knows that.
Check this out.
We're heroes here, right?
This lady, Norma Walker, works near the cashier, gave me this:
"If it takes a watermelon five minutes to water...
"how long will it take a sweet pea to pee?
"As long as it takes a pair of dice to crap. "
Don't mean a fucking thing, does it?
Charlie, I have to go home.
Oh, yeah?
Where do you live?
I'll see you.
A new game starting, five draw.
Five and ten draw.
Get in the game starting with R.B., J.L., L.B., S. G...
R.M., R.P., G.C., G.W., B.F., and J.B.
Five and ten draw, get in, the game's starting.
Come right in.
Five draw.
L.B. five draw.
Five and ten draw.
L.B.
Feeling lucky?
All right, sir.
Double T.
Hello, Bill.
- Put you on at five?
- Put me on at ten.
On at ten.
Poker has been around for a long time.
It sure has.
But it isn't like this anymore.
The saloon has been replaced by this... with a game that can be played in comfort and with full confidence in the management.
And here is the man who is responsible for that confidence:
Mr. Murry Shepherd.
Welcome to the California Club, where your pleasure is our business.
It has been said that nearly everyone in America understands poker... or wants to.
It is one of America's most popular games.
And since you have shown an obvious interest by coming here... we have prepared a short film to teach you the fundamentals... of the game as we play it here.
Service is our only commodity.
This film is part of that service.
The object of the game is to win the pot.
- Hope I remember that.
- There are two variations of this game:
- High draw.
The highest ranking hand wins.
- Don't give me that.
- Low draw...
- There's my baby.
...where the winning hand holds the lowest possible ranking combination of cards.
As you enter the club, the reservation and game board is located in the card room.
You must stop here and tell the boardman of your game preference.
He will enter your initials on the board... and you will be called and directed to a table by a floorman.
The floorman puts the games together... interprets and applies the rules of poker.
His decisions are final.
C. W. ten blind.
C. W. in the coffee shop.
C.W., ten blind.
C.W., double his money.
The management of the club has no financial interest in any game.
There is no house deal.
Each player plays for himself.
And each in turn acts as a dealer.
When you are seated at the game, you'll be asked to pay a rental fee... which will be collected thereafter at the beginning of each half hour.
B.D. ten blind.
B.D., ten, twenty low.
You must have a full buy-in when you are seated to begin playing.
Chips must be purchased from the chip girl.
The buy-in is determined by the limit of the game you choose to play.
You must ante before you receive cards.
The ante is placed on the number directly in front of you.
The number is also your seat number at the table.
What do you do, Lew?
I'll call.
Acquiring the knowledge and skill to play card games such as poker... is a social asset.
To make the most of this asset... it is simply good judgment to be wanted at the card table.
Shit.
Don't be a spoilsport now.
- Who's the bettor?
- $20 to you.
Me.
You're so pretty I'm going to fold.
- Is everybody out?
- That's it.
You mean I've got a goddamn six and everybody's out?
This depends even more on good manners than upon the skill of the player.
The following principle should increase one's popularity as a card player.
I need one little, teensy...
Sit erect.
- Maintain a quiet bearing.
- Come on, get on with it.
Come on, sweetheart.
- Avoid nervous habits.
- $40.
I have a seat for you.
Now come on in.
During the game, avoid conversation regarding matters not relating to the game.
I'll just have to call you.
An appearance of awkwardness and clumsiness...
I didn't think you were that good.
...gives a bad impression of one's ability to play.
Wait a minute.
What do you think you're doing?
What do you mean, "wait a minute"?
You said it was good.
No, I said that I didn't think that you were that good.
I got a seven-four.
When a hand has gone very well for you, don't talk about it.
The film you've just been viewing cannot instantly make you a good poker player.
The more skilled you become, the more pleasurable you will find the game.
- I had a feeling...
- Next year.
Raise.
Pass.
- I call.
- Well, I'll raise the raise.
- Goodbye.
- I'm out.
Out.
And one more time to you.
What a pot.
- Another $20, huh?
- The table is so slow.
- You wanted one of these.
- Go ahead, I call.
- Cards?
- Pat.
Pat.
Very interesting.
Come on.
Do you mind picking the cards up and dealing them the regular way?
You did stay pat?
You are pat?
Come on.
Wait a second, lady.
I got a big decision to make here.
I'm gonna let you break me down.
I'll let you break me down.
Two cards.
- Two beauts.
- That's very nice.
- Oh, my!
- Great catch.
- Hey, pal, that card's dead.
- What are you talking about?
- The card went off the table.
It's a dead card.
- You're absolutely right, chief.
My gratitude for your knowledge of the rules... except the card never left the table.
The card went off the table, it's a dead card.
Did you see that card go off the table?
- I didn't see nothing at all.
- It's stupid of me to ask you.
- What about you?
Did you see it?
- All I see is the time passing.
- Pop, did you see it?
- Nothing.
How much you bet?
Somebody must have seen it.
- Kenny, this is ridiculous.
- I want to change my table.
- What's the problem?
- The problem is the card went off the table... and hit the floor and he won't give it up.
There's nothing to give up.
The card never hit the floor.
- I caught it before it did.
- All right, take it easy.
Who else saw it?
- Ma'am, did you see what happened?
- I didn't see it.
- How about you, sir?
- I saw a card bounce.
I don't know what happened back here.
You dealt the hand.
You ought to know what happened.
I dealt the second one a little hard.
It never hit the floor, not even close.
Not even close?
All right, that settles it, Lew.
The rule is if the card doesn't hit the floor it plays.
Continue the hand.
- I don't have another table...
- You got your ruling, play!
Just take it easy.
It's not even close. 20-20.
20-20.
The flying card didn't stop you from betting?
40-40.
I raise.
Raise.
What could be cozier than this?
I mean, this is perfection, isn't it?
- You and me in this hand...
- That's pretty.
Just do something!
How much money you got?
How much you got left?
$17.
Not enough for the maximum bet. $3 shy.
- I bet you $17.
- Call.
- Seven smooth.
- No good.
I got a six perfect.
Sorry about...
Damn it.
That last card that went off the table was a joker.
- That's why you wouldn't give it up.
- You're ridiculous.
- You said it wasn't even close.
- That's yesterday's news.
You two are working together.
You're partners.
You two motherfucking creeps are partners.
They should put a muzzle on him.
That's it?
- That man is absolutely ridiculous.
- What's going on here?
What's going on with you guys?
- These two are working partners together.
- I never saw that man before in my life.
I saw him nobble the joker out on the last deal.
The man is totally out of line.
They've been smiling at each other all night.
Come on, will you?
- Sit down and settle down.
- Get control.
Come on.
All right.
- All right, now who else saw this?
- I didn't see it.
- What about you?
- What do you want me to say?
The man calls you a cheater.
The man doesn't know how to play poker.
The man is bad.
He's a complete asshole.
We all know that, right?
The man goes broke, he can't handle it.
The man is on tilt.
You want to hear any more?
- Not me.
- Come on, now.
You'd better just take it easy, sport, 'cause the security's liable to let you go!
Put that guy in a horror show.
That's it!
Any more fighting, and you guys go out of here for good, all right?
All right!
Miriam, what do you say?
I say I can do without any more of that language.
- Right.
- You think there's any cheating going on?
I wouldn't like to say about that.
They've been consistent winners.
And I'm a big loser.
And you know I know how to play poker.
Sour grapes, honey.
All right, let's get it back to normal.
Lousy punk.
- You're not that good.
- Up yours.
Sir, would you like another beer?
...I bet it on Notre Dame 'cause I got a feeling Notre Dame would pull it off.
They beat UCLA when they had so many games going straight.
Yeah, it's kind of similar to the Miami Dolphins.
- This particular game is duck soup.
- They won 17 games straight last year.
Come on.
I can beat that goddamn miserable game.
Don't make me beg for a stinking $30.
I'm sorry.
You know, your attitude just pisses me off sometimes, Button-nose.
Don't call me that.
Now look.
There you go again.
I'm not doing anything.
I need about $80 to get to the track.
Not bad.
- Sir, can I help you?
- Cold beer.
Keg draft.
I'm buying that man sitting over there a beer.
Turned out to be a drinking man?
Nothing personal, but I already got a beer.
Thanks.
Great.
- So, you think the Knicks are gonna win?
- Yeah.
No, Knicks ain't going to win nothing.
Willis is hurting.
Knicks ain't winning.
Celtics, this year.
You follow pro basketball?
- Anything, right?
- Whatever's going.
Yeah, me too.
Action.
Are you gonna give me the $30 or not?
I have to buy this man a drink.
Will you have a beer?
I will definitely have a beer.
Give my friend here a beer.
$1 says you don't know who Glenn Riggs is.
- What's your name?
- Vince.
The name's Vince.
Glenn Riggs was the announcer for Hop Harrigan.
- What do you want $30 for?
- I need it for that girl I got in the bathroom.
I'm only the relief bartender.
I don't go in the cash register.
- Where's Jack?
What is this?
- Jack went to a funeral.
I've been working here for one year, right?
Just give me a piece of paper, a chit.
$30, Renee.
Okay?
If I give you $30 and I come up short, it'll be your ass.
Baby, you were born short.
And it's always my ass.
Captain Midnight!
This guy giving you trouble?
He ain't the regular man.
- $30.
- I wouldn't sign anything.
Don't sign a thing.
Don't sign anything.
What did you get her to sign?
- Here, Mother.
- Thanks, baby.
You won't be sorry.
Don't worry now, I can beat it.
Goodbye.
$20 says you can't name the Seven Dwarfs.
- I know I can name three or four of them.
- Seven.
I got seven.
- Doc.
- That's one.
- Dopey.
- That's two.
- Snoopy.
- There is no Snoopy.
There ain't no Snoopy.
I know there's Doc... there's Dopey, there's Grumpy, there's...
- You don't have $20 here.
- Wait a second.
I got $20 right here.
- I need a little help here.
What about...
- Here comes seven like a Gatling gun.
- Seven Dwarfs, I'm ready.
- Sleepy, Grumpy, Doc.
- That's four.
- That's three.
- I'm with you.
- Wait a second.
Sleepy, Grumpy, Doc.
Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey.
- Dopey.
- We got Dumbo.
- There's no Dumbo.
- Dumbo wasn't in that cast?
- No Dumbo.
- Gotcha.
- Dumbo flew.
- Well, we both lose?
Remember when Dumbo flew?
They set that little house on fire.
I've seen an elephant walk, but I never seen an elephant fly.
- My God.
- I know.
Dumbo flew.
A lot of black folks said that was bad news... seeing a black crow sing about a big flying elephant.
What's that?
It's taboo.
No black crows.
~ Judgment day, you know, I know ~
~ Aristis, Arastis, Johnson Brown ~
~ What you gonna do when the rent come round?
~
You in the park?
No, I haven't got a car.
I just live...
Not far.
I like to live close to the action, you know, William?
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
You're going to give me a lift?
That's a good idea.
~ You know, I know the rent means dough ~
~ Landlord gonna throw us in the co-co snow ~
~ Aroostis, Arastis, Johnson Brown ~
~ What you gonna do when the rent comes round?
~
~ What you gonna say?
How you gonna pay?
~
William, you're a minstrel?
Man, I hate key stuff.
Look in his side pocket.
He's got my goddamn money somewhere.
Right here.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
I hope you loved that, Funny Man.
Okay, folks, will you just relax and follow me, please?
What is this, a hospital or a jail?
What's going on?
This is William.
This is Barbara.
She's getting us out of here.
Thanks a lot.
You ever been in jail in New York?
They give you powdered eggs.
Powdered, shitty...
The shittiest food in the world.
I can't believe you haven't been in jail.
What are you doing?
Just trying some of the hot one.
It really works.
Here, you want to try some?
Come on, the heat makes it feel good.
Listen to me, I got experience.
Yeah, easy.
Just don't touch it with the can.
Easy now.
- Not bad?
- That's nice.
That's okay.
Last year, year and a half, I must have hit... about 30 different racetracks in every little town and city I've been to.
- Yeah, how'd you do?
- Tapioca time.
El Busto.
I'll give you a great ace in the hole.
If you find yourself busted in a small town...
Say, is there anything I should know about this?
Listen, fellows, it's breakfast time.
We got Lucky Charms and...
- What's with this?
- Froot Loops.
- Froot Loops?
Have some waffles...
- I'll take some coffee.
Blueberry pancakes.
You'd still be in jail if that guy hadn't given me that $50.
But... chicken.
...a strange town you head straight to the ice cream people... and pick yourself up an ice cream cart.
They got lots of them.
They don't care who you are or what you look like.
- Something to eat.
It's roughage.
- Believe me, nothing.
Desperate people.
They give you a funny little white jacket and you're on your way.
How much do you make in a thing like that?
You could pick up a snappy $25 in less than an hour.
- How do you do that?
- You keep it all.
You don't think I'm talking about working this job legit?
- Your favorite:
Lucky Charms.
- Can I have a beer, honey?
- You want a cold beer?
- No, thanks.
It goes good with your Froot Loops.
- Get some milk, honey.
- Got it.
That shaving cream's not going to stain your white sweater.
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to tell your mother.
Just put it down and it'll all wash out.
Let me taste it for you.
- What is this?
- That crap.
- Come on, we got company.
- I tried to make it look nice.
That looks better.
Here, baby.
One time, right, I had this job selling ad space in a labor union magazine.
Non-existent.
Just get on the telephone, call people and say:
"Do you want to buy some space?"
- Help yourself.
Ain't bad.
Just last night's.
- I just need the spoon.
A little pâté de foie garbage.
Then you get to keep 45% of what you pick up.
How come you don't get to keep all of it if it's non-existent?
I'm not picking it up, I'm just talking on the telephone.
- Yeah, right.
- What do you do?
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm with a magazine.
- You a writer?
- Yeah.
Say!
Do you remember the first bet you ever made on a sport event?
- Do you?
- I bet a nickel... in the 1945 World Series.
The Cubs and Tigers.
Don't laugh.
I lost.
Susan's home.
Five-cent bet and I lost.
- I didn't expect to lose.
- Susan, honey.
I didn't have the nickel, right?
So this guy Mikey asked my mother.
I've been trying to beat it ever since.
What is it?
- Did he hurt your feelings?
- No.
- You can scratch him off the book, honey.
- I don't want to scratch him off my book.
Here's the baby of the house now.
Sweetheart, would you like some Froot Loops?
- Come on.
Therapy.
- No therapy.
What's shaking, baby?
I just want to go to bed.
Take your coat off, sweetheart.
Come on, now, you're starting to get that Halloween look on your face.
It was just...
He was really different.
- Guy wasn't out of line with you, was he?
- No.
- We had such a good time.
- Yeah?
Guy was fresh, was he?
You know what he did?
He gave me $50.
- That was the deal, wasn't it?
- No, the deal was for $30.
He liked you a lot, too, sweetheart.
- How come you were picked up?
- Drunk and disorderly.
- Well, Charlie's not too good with cops.
- He certainly lets them know it.
This is the truth.
You're an animal lover, right?
The great blue whale, right?
You know about a great blue whale?
- That wrestling guy?
- No, it's a big fish.
There's only about two or three left in the world.
And the truth, the tongue of the great blue whale... weighs more than a full-grown African elephant.
- No, it's not true.
- You don't believe it?
You're just making it up to make me feel better.
'Cause you don't like to see me cry.
You feel a little better?
- Yeah, I do.
- Good.
- Who's that guy out there?
- Billy?
He's a poker friend.
- You want to meet him?
- No.
He'd spent his rent money on us.
Yeah, so we brought him home.
The girl's fine.
She just fell in love again.
She'll be okay in the morning.
Listen, William, I'm going to crash.
You can use the sofa if you want.
Thank you.
- I got to crash, too.
- Okay.
- Good night, baby.
- Good night.
I got to get my car.
I can't get my car.
There's nobody up there.
I was just looking for the...
the Guide.
Go back to sleep.
It's Happy, Bashful, Dopey, Doc, Grumpy...
Fuck them.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Denny.
- Hello, Barbara.
This information came in for you from Chino this morning.
- Thank you, Barbara.
The dauphin in yet?
- Since 9:00 a.m. He wanted to see you.
- What's the matter with your body?
- I had a little automobile trouble, Barbara.
- Is that him?
- It was, sir.
- Did you tell him I wanted to see him?
- I did, sir.
- What'd he say?
- He said, "Thank you."
- He did?
- He did.
Thank you.
You're most welcome.
- These are the colors on the antique article.
- Oh, right.
I didn't know what time you'd be in, so I just picked out a few.
- I think they're your best bet.
- Thanks, Barbara.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
- Good.
How about some coffee?
- Love some.
Everybody's named Barbara.
- Hello?
- Barbara?
- Yes.
- This is Bill Denny.
Bill!
Hi.
- Is the Ice Cream Man around?
- He sure is.
Charlie, it's Bill.
- William, what's shaking?
- Hey, Charlie.
I'm at the office.
I'm reviewing things.
It sounds like a bore.
You want to track it with me?
Believe me, I'd like to... only I cannot get out.
I'm really all jammed up here.
You let a man rub some hot shaving cream on your ribs... you can take a shot with him at the track.
Listen, I know you're right, but you know, I cannot steal any more time from here.
We'll play it your way, but if you should change your mind...
I'll be at the bar in the grandstand... right above the finish line, near the $100 window, all right?
Yeah, I know the spot.
Okay, listen.
If I can, I can.
I hope you do.
Listen Charlie, thanks for an interesting evening.
Knock them dead.
Okay, I will.
Okay, so long.
It's different.
It's not my favorite, but it is different.
Who in their right mind would put a graveyard...
- on the front of the California...
- Our boss.
I mean, that's not going to sell any magazines.
Well, it's not doing so badly.
Excuse me.
Could we change seats?
No way, lady.
I'm sorry.
The last time I sat facing the rear, I never won a race.
I get sick if I ride that way.
It gets me dizzy.
Hey, miss, this lady here is going to throw up if she sits in this chair.
- Would you mind changing with her?
- I never change seats.
It's bad luck.
- She'll never change seats.
- Lady, I don't mind changing.
This lady here will change with you.
Thank you.
Great.
This lady will change with that lady, but she needs a window seat.
You change there, and I could...
- Everything okay?
Wonderful.
- Great.
Super day for the track.
- Do me a favor?
- Do you want to change seats again?
Would you see what Egyptian Femme looks like?
She's in the fourth.
- Egyptian Femme?
- Femme.
Jerry Weintraub is their manager, and he's got to have something.
Just stock, publicity stills, on, you know...
- What do you want, some 8x10s?
- Yeah.
Egyptian Femme.
The horse has run twice in two years, right?
Each time she stiffed out.
Now she steps up in class... goes up against colts, draws an inside post position in a sprint... and ain't got no speed of her own to get out there.
Is all that in there?
If you know how to read these things.
It says a lot more.
I thought I'd spare you all the gory stuff.
Egyptian Femme?
The lady's going to cap out on Egyptian Femme?
Pretty funny.
Forget that horse, lady.
I hate to see her get away.
She owes me money from last year.
Then you make a bet on her and she'll owe you money from this year.
How far is it to Chino?
- An hour and a half.
- I'm going up there.
They got it all wrong.
If you hear from the dauphin... tell him, "Much luck."
Well, I'm holding my own.
Just don't bet the chalk.
No chalk betting here.
- Later, Ben.
- All right.
The weight factor, see?
It's the weight factor.
Excuse me.
- Hey, babe, what's happening?
- How's it going?
- How'd you do the first race?
- Not too good.
I like to stay away from the daily doubles, too.
Any info?
- Not as yet.
- If you get any information, I'll be at the bar.
- Andrew, que pasa?
- Hey, Big Charlie, what's going on?
You got a winner today?
Not yet?
Me neither.
Are you sure Egyptian Femme is not going to win?
- You want a beer?
- I don't.
I think you ought to bet on Egyptian Femme.
You're right.
Yeah?
Then why do you have four underlined?
I don't know.
I used to like Banks, the jockey, but I changed my mind.
- You're putting me on.
- Who will you bet?
- Not Egyptian Femme, I'll tell you that much.
- I'm glad you're definite.
Who do you like in the fourth, pal?
William, you made it.
Glad to see you, William.
How you feeling?
Not bad.
I got a little pain here and here, otherwise I couldn't be better.
- Give my friend a beer.
- Want to give my friend here a beer?
I asked first.
I'm telling you another half inch to the left of center...
- That's no good here, Charlie.
- No, this is on me.
- It's on me.
You just keep it all.
- Any time.
You keep it all.
Your money's no good here, pal.
Don't you appreciate a man who gets you in the goodies?
He gave me a kick where I'm breathing and I'm pretty lucky to be here.
Now, how did you manage it?
How'd you get away from work?
I wish I was as good at this as I am at getting away from work.
Razzle-dazzle.
The minstrel man strikes again.
I know.
After today you're gonna have enough money to open up a string of parking lots.
- It looks that good?
- 20-to-1 in the morning line ain't tin.
- You really like it?
- Fucking gold, babe.
- Who's the horse?
- Número uno.
Egyptian Femme.
Tough to figure, right?
He doesn't seem to like to run a lot.
- She, it's a lady.
- Right.
It's beautiful.
Just right.
They've been shopping for a big price... today we're going to nail them.
- Not much to recommend.
- The rest are a bunch of dogs, too, right?
Believe me, she'll pay.
$4 million and change.
If you think the inside post position is bad, she's got a lot of speed, wire to wire.
You're really not worried, are you?
This horse owes me and owes my friend, owes everybody around here.
- We're taking down today, my friend.
- I'd like to toast that, pal.
- Let's go see a man about a horse.
- A man about a horse.
Excuse me.
Where is she?
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Come on.
Don't stop!
Go!
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Stay up there!
- Come on, Valdez!
- Who's Valdez?
Valdez is the jockey!
Come on, Valdez.
Come on, Valdez.
Keep it up there.
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
He'll make a move now.
- Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Stay up there!
- Come on, Valdez!
And he wins!
Take it down.
Come on, we win this race.
We won that race going away.
That was a race.
Did you see that race?
- I mean, Valdez...
That race was fantastic.
- We didn't see the tote board.
- Did you see the other horse?
- We win this race.
I've never done this.
I've never come out...
- Will you trust me?
We won.
- Let's see the photo, man.
Photo finish?
We won going away.
- What were you watching?
- I was watching this race.
Just a little razzle-dazzle.
Can you be happy now?
- I've never done this before.
- The horse wins.
- We're a winner.
- The horse did not win!
Nobody says that.
This is called counting your chickens.
- Chickens and counting chickens?
- Before they're hatched.
You spend a whole life out here and you have a 20-to-1 shot...
Come on, fellows.
Will you get it up here?
I'm telling you, we win the race.
- What is it?
- Goddamn one horse.
Egyptian Femme!
Egyptian Femme won!
Where've you been?
That's what I said.
I can't believe this!
I had that horse!
You rotten creep!
Hey, you!
You said Egyptian Femme had no chance!
The horse won!
Whose money is that?
Had no chance?
- Lady, don't throw oranges.
- The horse had no chance?
The horse had no chance?
You knew it all along!
Are you crazy?
God damn it, lady, you don't throw oranges on an escalator!
Come on, lady, get back!
How's that, lady?
- That's my hat!
- Now, you stop throwing oranges.
Stop it!
- Give me my goddamn hat!
- Stop it!
- You thief!
- You want your purse?
That horse owes me more money!
Here, you want your money?
Take your goddamn...
You asshole, you can't even throw!
Wonder where he's going to take us for dinner tonight?
Who knows?
But wherever it is, it'll be delicious.
- I hope it's the Scala.
- That'd be great.
We can have all that Italian food we love.
We can have mozzarella marinara... and eggplant parmigiana...
- Honey, there he is.
- Zabaglione for dessert.
Now sit down, act natural.
Say, what is this?
Surprise!
No, it's not.
- Hey, baby.
- We're going to make it.
Here you are, Mr. Tenor, and thank you.
- That was delightful.
- Birthday greetings!
Go on.
- Who's that wonderful guy out there?
- That man's a tenor.
- We want you to have the big evening...
- We can't have the big evening tonight.
- She and I got a date.
- What are you talking about?
- You're not working tonight?
- Yes, we are.
I saw you eating your breakfast.
Now I think I'm going to play the piano.
Which way is it?
Honey, sweetheart, it's a very important party.
It's very, very important...
Okay, that's it.
That's it now.
All right, stop it now.
All right.
Stop the music.
Stop.
We're expecting Mr. Kramer.
We loved all the gifts.
We love everything.
- Are we out of here?
- Yeah.
...should've been there when you came to the door.
But it's $150 apiece for the evening for dinner.
- What?
- This evening at $150 each.
- Are we out of here?
- $150.
All we have to do is go to dinner.
Maybe Mr. Kramer wants to give Bill and me $75 apiece.
- Bill's awful pretty to show off.
- I don't know how to take that.
Not at all.
We can tell him we're sick.
Now I get the feeling I'm being mugged by my friend.
- No, this is not right.
- All right, Bill, out the door.
I'm waiting to say goodbye.
You ladies, now, I mean, we're gonna...
- It sure was nice.
- Go in there.
- Sit down and act natural.
- I think you're unfair.
Susan and Barbara must not be deprived of our companionship tonight.
Certainly not.
- They were looking super.
- Should we look inside?
Absolutely.
Mr. Kramer must be some funny dude.
- Hi.
- It's me.
Do you remember me?
- Of course I remember you.
- Is there anyone else?
- No, there's just us.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
- Okay.
- Sweetheart, you look terrific.
- Do you like it?
Yeah.
- You smell wonderful.
- Thank you.
I'm so glad you like it.
- What are you wearing?
- Thank you.
What are you...
- It's Joy, isn't it?
- No, it's Shalimar.
- Shalimar.
- Do you like it?
- Oh, God.
- Mr. Chan!
- Shalimar is my favorite perfume.
- It's mine, too.
Do you like the dress?
I had it...
Yes, I had it made in Omaha.
Yeah, but I just...
I just never had the balls to wear it, you know, outside.
- Well, honey, it's sexy...
- I love the dress.
- Listen to me.
- Dignified.
- Elegant.
- It is.
It's elegant.
Listen, tonight we're gonna go to Chasen's.
Chasen's tonight.
- And then I've got a great big surprise.
- What is it?
After Chasen's, what?
- I don't know if I should tell you.
- Tell us.
A little hint.
- Tell, please.
- Go ahead.
- It has something to do with music.
- Music.
You know?
Listen, before we go, let's have a cocktail.
I made us some daiquiris.
- How about it?
- Thank you.
- I'll get yours.
- Thanks.
You're my best friends.
- Really?
- Thank you, Helen.
Yeah, now you want to give this to Helen.
Honey, don't drink it.
Give it to Helen.
It's just taking forever.
What is that?
I might have to take the top off.
Okay, give this one to Helen.
Shake it up a bit.
That's for Helen now.
That's good.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Hurry, Barbara, I want to make a toast.
- Okay.
Great.
To Helen and her new look.
- Yes, you look great.
- Elegant.
- Yes, elegant.
- Thank you.
- Wonderful.
- Who's that?
- Wait a minute.
Are you expecting anyone?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.
Don't worry, honey, I can take care of it.
Don't worry.
- She can take care of it.
- I hope so.
She can take care of it.
She takes care of everything.
She does, really.
I'll take care of you.
- Okay, ladies, Vice.
We're Vice.
- Vice?
Detective Waters and this is Detective Denny.
Which one of you girls is Barbara Miller?
- Barbara, you didn't say...
- The young one must be Susan Peters.
You damn cops just can't come in here...
Be quiet, and don't call us damn cops.
- What's your name, honey?
- Brown.
- Brown, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- First name?
- Helen.
- Helen Gurley Brown?
- No, sir.
What's going...
Hey, come on now.
- It's not a laughing matter, girls.
- Close the door, will you?
- The door.
- Close the door.
And check the premises for any marijuana or pot or firearms.
- I'm gonna check.
- I do not like the feel of this.
- You can't search this house without...
- You just be quiet, lady.
We'll run you downtown.
You feel like being frisked?
- No.
- You can't frisk a sweet old woman...
Yeah, well.
- Shalimar?
- Yes, sir.
- Smells good.
- Thank you.
- You got a cold?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, yeah.
- Here's a sourball.
- No, thank you.
- It's good for your throat.
- I don't even want this drink.
- Take a sourball.
- Got one for me?
Yeah, I got one for you.
You're like a more responsible older woman than these girls.
- Are you misleading these young girls?
- No, I'm not.
- She's just a friend.
- They're not friends.
They're not?
Why are you here?
- I'm a friend of their aunt's.
- Don't talk like that.
Shut up.
We'll take them downtown and book them.
- Run them right downtown.
- Let's take them in.
- Charlie, let me have a word with you.
- You stay right there.
Be quiet.
They're not friends of mine.
I'm a friend of their aunt's.
- What do you think, pal?
- The one in the middle looks dangerous.
- Her mouth turns down...
- I know.
I don't trust her.
I think we ought to take her down and book her.
How about we book the two on the end and let the one in the middle go?
- You're feeling sorry for her, huh?
- I think so.
I'll make an exception.
You're sure?
Helen, stand back and look at me when I talk to you.
Sorry.
- You look like a very well-dressed woman.
- I am.
- Good background.
Well-educated.
- That's right.
Religious.
My partner and I are gonna believe that you had nothing to do with...
- what's going on on the premises and that...
- I'm just a friend.
Believe me.
But we do feel that you should vacate the premises immediately.
- Bless you.
- Bye, Helen.
Take care of your cold, sweetheart.
Shut the door, Helen.
Bye.
- You people ought to be arrested.
- Jesus Christ!
- I can't believe you did that.
- What was that?
I love your brown shawl.
- Now, let's get...
- You're not really a policeman, are you?
No.
Do you think if I was a cop I would arrest you?
People, now how does Mexican food sound to you?
- Mexican food.
- That sounds delicious.
Do we have time to change our clothes?
Get out of your work clothes and into something comfortable.
Don't take too much time or we'll take Helen.
Excuse me.
And here we go.
You're crazy.
It's a bet.
The black guy over there.
What's his name?
The black guy?
- Take him out with a good punch.
- Come on, baby.
Boy, do we got Morgan.
Place your bet.
What do you want to bet?
$40 and $60.
I bet you even your man don't stop my man.
- You got it.
- Even money.
Come on, sit down, lady, sit down.
Come on, Roy.
We got the first round now.
You got the money they're floating you, right?
$15 on Collins.
Yeah.
Okay.
Collins is a wonderful guy.
Got good marks in school.
I know him.
He just don't fight too good, though.
He ought to be playing baseball or something.
Want another $15 on this?
No, I got one bet left.
I'm gonna bet for your hat, man.
I wanna win your hat.
My man's gonna win this fight, yeah.
- You want my hat?
My Bell Helmet hat?
- Yeah, right.
- Give it to him.
- Here, you got it.
- $10.
Right.
- For your shirt.
- Get in there!
- Keep working!
Get in there!
I think that we won all three rounds.
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.
I'll take the hat now.
You've seen Sugar Ray knock out Foreman.
Come on, people.
Thank you very much.
Come on, let's get out of here now.
Okay, you lay me 10-to-5.
I got suit and you got the lumberjack.
You gotta be nuts.
Why, lumberjack has got to be 2- to-1 over a suit, anytime.
- Okay.
They both can't fight.
- Come on.
- $1,580.
- We're all winning.
Winning all over the place now.
~ The moon is shining high ~
Definitely, we'll have to take care of you girls to make up for that silly old man.
But we're gonna make up for Mr. Helen Gurley.
- What's the agenda?
- Right now we're off to the Latin Quarter.
Now, Latin Quarter.
We'll go dancing.
We'll go anywhere you say now.
I mean, you and me are knocking them dead with this $1,580.
Stick 'em up.
I'm sorry I hit your...
- Put her in the car, man.
- Stick 'em up, man.
I don't believe it.
It's hard to believe.
Wait a second.
Put the money on the table.
I can hardly believe this right now.
I'll blow your fucking face off.
- Don't you believe it?
- Will you do what he tells you?
- I don't believe this.
Relax.
- I'll blow your fucking head off.
Wait.
You're not blowing nothing off.
I don't believe it.
We're getting robbed two nights in a row.
- Put the money on the table.
- Do what he tells you.
Please, Charlie.
Wait a second now.
Okay, here's $780, man.
That's it.
You got half and we're taking half.
Take the money and run.
Go ahead, $780, man.
Don't think about it.
Take the money and go.
Get out of here, you fucking bum!
Get out of here, man!
Cut our winnings in half.
- I call.
- I call.
- Take your hand off my knee, will you?
- I dropped a card.
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Your hand is dead.
- I can't help it, I dropped it.
- Then your hand is dead.
Hand's dead.
- Come on, let's go.
- What do you want?
She was aces full.
And what did you have, four what?
Hey, let her play her own cards.
Come on, girls.
This ain't Santa Anita.
You're playing poker.
You girls are sure getting good cards, huh?
You girls friends from way back?
You two?
- No, we don't even know each other.
- I've never seen her before.
I don't care how old you are.
Right in the choppers, lady.
- Come on, be nice, will you?
- The lowest you can get.
- I fold.
- I will raise you.
I call.
I don't want you to see it.
- All right, let's ante up.
- All right.
- All right, everybody in.
- That's right.
Why don't you go home...
You're burying me here.
Get a Chinaman in this game.
- We're falling apart.
- I fold.
Man, I don't even understand what you were trying to tell me.
You figure you're entitled to a free shot...
- I never said I was entitled to a free...
- Then what are we talking about?
When have I never paid you your money, Spark?
- Laying the thug routine on you?
- It's not the question of paying.
You do not pay me on time and time is the thing.
- You know, week to week I pay you...
- I understand that, Spark.
Why do you think you can do that stuff?
You've owed me for nine months.
All right, I did.
Let's make a deal.
Tell him you're sending him some Green Stamps.
How many times have I told you I do not wish to be interrupted... when I'm in conference with Mr. Waters?
- Listen.
You told me four times.
- Get out of here, will you?
- He wants to see you now.
- Tell him he's talking to a thug.
Tell him he'll get his legs broke.
I'll tell him his legs are broken, that's why he can't see him.
Here is the deal:
Ten days.
You don't cut me off for 10 days... and you got your money in your hands.
That's it.
That's my word.
Okay, let me tell you my situation.
All right?
- You wanna hear that?
You care?
- Okay, Spark.
I am getting buried at this point.
I mean, it's been a very bad day.
I understand that, Spark.
I cannot carry you for more than 10 days.
Ten days, that's it.
- I mean, if it's 11 days...
- No 11 days.
- It cannot be.
- Right.
No stories, nothing.
Ten days.
- What if you lose more money?
- Even if I should lose more money.
- You're gonna be able to handle that?
- Right.
Tell him to get Preparation H. Do him good.
Will you give me a break?
- You're going to get it?
No stories?
- I've got it.
I just didn't wanna tap the source...
I didn't want to do it that way, but I'm gonna.
- What do you want?
- What are the Lakers?
- Five and a half.
- Five and a half.
Okay, Spark, I'll call you back.
Five and a half will make you laugh.
Bet your house on this game... lay the five and a half, you get out tonight.
- I don't know, Charlie.
- I know.
If I had an estate in the country I would lay it and tap out on the Lakers.
They're covering tonight.
- This game scares me, Charlie.
- No, don't be frightened.
Now Mr. West, Mr. Goodrich, Mr. Cook's Forum, tonight... they blow the Suns out.
Where do you get your confidence?
The Lakers have been playing crappy... and the Suns are hot.
- Come on, so the Lakers lose two in a row.
- Four in a row.
Right.
And, believe me, it doesn't matter.
- Phoenix wins two or three in a row.
- Five.
Five in a row?
Playing pretty good.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
- Don't matter.
This is the double reverse.
You lay the five and a half... and you bet your house on it.
You've been saying this for weeks.
I'm lucky I don't own much property.
Barbara, I really like these red Christmas bulbs.
You think next year we should do the whole Christmas tree in them?
Don't you think that's a bit on the nose?
- Hi.
How are you?
- How you been?
Fine.
- I was just driving by, thought I'd say hello.
- Good.
- What are you all doing?
- I'm cleaning out the car.
I'm putting up the Christmas tree lights.
- Charlie up yet?
- No.
- Yeah.
Up and gone.
- Yeah?
Where'd he go?
I don't know.
He got up so early I couldn't believe it.
- Listen, come on in for some coffee.
- No, I can't.
Thanks.
Just one cup of coffee.
I'll take a rain check.
- All right.
Bye, Bill.
- Nice seeing you.
- How are you?
- Bill Denny.
What are you doing here?
I checked at the other store and they said you might be over here.
Wait a minute.
Don't tell me why you came.
I'm getting a flash.
You see, I have a good amount of ESP.
I'm blessed with it.
My wife kids me about it, but she respects it when I get these flashes.
Let me see how close I can get to what's going on here.
I get that you're probably back with your old lady... and you want to paint your garage door, perhaps even the whole front of your house.
Yes, I'm getting the color.
It's a greenish color.
Right?
How close did I get?
I need a loan, Harvey.
- A loan?
- Yeah.
- How are you?
- Terrific.
- What's your name?
- Larry.
Larry, I know you're going in here to win a bundle.
Why don't you come and see me when you come out?
- He would like to see Nugie, please.
- Okay, come on in.
Just go on in through the kitchen.
They're in the other room.
- Nugie, there's a guy here.
- Yeah.
- Howdy.
- Howdy, Nugie.
- Trouble finding this place?
- No, it's fine.
There's some crap in the kitchen if you want...
- No.
I'm fine.
- Grab a chair.
- Three, six, nine.
- What've you got?
Jack, five, seven.
I don't know who you know here.
This is Bill.
Four, five, six.
What're you doing?
You're gonna play chess.
I call.
Six card low ball.
Forced to bet the first high card.
$3 the third and fourth card. $6...
Let's keep the game moving.
Three.
Bet him, Nugie.
Terrific.
True love never runs smooth.
- I bet $3.
- Force the bet to $30.
I raise it $3.
First high card. $3 the third and fourth card.
Fifth card six. $12.
- No check and raise.
- Check and raise.
- Three dollars to you, he raised you.
- What's the buy-in?
$200 buy-in.
Help the man.
$3.
I don't know.
How about this?
- Very nice.
- Feel free, man.
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, anytime.
They get me, man.
Don't worry.
Next week you'll beat their brains in.
There you go.
Would you like to see a menu?
No.
- Hi, Sparkie.
- How are you, honey?
Right over here.
- Hiya, baby.
- What happened to your leg?
Dumbness.
Don't play ball after 15 years, I can tell you that.
I didn't know you played ball.
- Actually, I did, you know.
With the Pirates.
- You're kidding.
No, nothing important.
No, I don't want the menu.
- Give me the real hot chili.
All right?
- Sure.
- Sangria?
- All right.
- You want some chili?
- No, I'm fine.
They got great zucchini in here.
You want that?
- Class-A boy?
- No.
I had a shot for...
Well, it wasn't a shot, it was just...
What do you make my figure to be?
As your carry-over I got you down for $2,200.
It's a tough week, baby.
No, that's okay.
I'll tell you... this guy, Lloyd Harris, who's the honcho where I work... he had a very good Christmas season.
What he's created is a slush fund...
You're not telling me a story now, are you?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Come on...
I mean, I carried you one year.
Am I right?
- Was there any pressure put on you?
- No, you were very nice.
Forget nice.
I don't give a fuck about nice.
You know that that year...
Please just forget about this.
Now the point is, this is totally different.
- It's strictly on a cash basis.
I told you that.
- Right.
Did I tell you that I got hurt in two busts, that my parents were here... that I'm getting killed all over the fucking place?
I mean, I told you this up front.
Did I not tell you that?
I'm asking you a question.
Did I not tell you that?
Okay, I beat you.
Ten days later you come to me... and you don't have any money.
You're out of line already... but I extend that.
I mean, I extended it to you.
You said you'd have the cash.
You got things going.
I don't know what you're saying.
But you're gonna have the money, you have a way to get it.
I mean, did you not say that?
What you're trying to tell me is, come payoff day... you don't have dollar one, plus you owe me more.
Man, I've heard it before.
You don't have dollar one, do you?
You think I'm some stupid schmuck you're dealing with.
I got to tell you something, pal.
In my line of thinking, you took a total, out and out shot at me...
- Look, Spark, that's not it at all.
- What is it then?
Listen to me.
I got $700 for you tomorrow.
Why didn't you say that in the beginning?
Why didn't you say it?
Because you didn't give me a chance.
- What about the other $1,500?
- One week.
I'll tell you, boy...
What's wrong, Sparkie?
Don't you want your chili?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.
- What?
- Want some chili?
Sport, you wanna fill this up?
Give Sergio something?
You gonna fill this up or not?
Thanks.
- Righto.
- You know Jenny Carr?
Coming.
She's shacking up with my old man.
He gave me this watch for Christmas.
I don't ever take it off.
Ain't it pretty?
You can even wear it in the tub with you.
What are you having?
Cognac?
I don't believe these guys fucking around the way they do.
Jesus, I'd never do anything like that.
Nobody's even going today.
- You, where'd you get that tee-shirt?
- Playing softball.
- What position do you play?
- Any position.
Yeah?
I like shortstop myself.
I got this neat dog.
It's all fluffy and darling.
Did you hear me?
I hear you.
You got a dog.
What the fuck am I doing in this dump anyway?
You should've seen the place where I was last night.
It was really classy.
- Any chance you could go back there?
- No, classy places don't open this early.
The only trouble with my dog is, he shits on the floor... and I don't know what to do about it.
What do you do about it?
You know?
- You try cleaning it up?
- Yeah, I tried that.
It didn't do any good.
He just sits there and looks at me.
Just some dumb fuck like all the men around here.
Bunch of faggots.
I bet they can't even get it up.
Shit.
What am I doing here?
Fuck you, faggot!
You want some more nuts?
Is that you, Barbara?
- It's Bill.
- Come in.
- Come in?
- Yeah, the door's unlocked.
Come in.
Right.
- Is Barbara not here?
- She's out on a date.
- What are you doing?
- Reading my book.
I don't like to stay in my room at night when no one's here.
We're going to Hawaii tomorrow for two weeks.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we're really excited about it, too.
I'll bet.
Charlie never did come back.
Do you know what happened to him?
Do you want to come in and sit down?
Yeah, okay.
You're married, aren't you?
What difference does it make?
It doesn't make any difference.
- We're separated.
- Yeah?
Who are you going to Hawaii with?
Just a couple of guys.
These friends of Barbara's.
- I don't even know them.
- You don't even know them?
Suppose you don't like them?
Those are the chances you have to take.
You wanna make love to me?
Right now?
- It has crossed my mind.
- It has?
This sounds silly, but I don't have any money.
That's okay.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I mean, I really like you.
I mean...
- it's different.
- It's different?
Why is it different?
I mean, I really like you.
I really like you a lot.
You brought me that dog.
Took me to the fights.
It was like a real date.
I think I'm gonna kiss you.
- Isn't this Barbara's room?
- She doesn't care.
- Having trouble?
- Not anymore.
- It's okay, I'll do it.
- I got it.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
You're taking so long.
You didn't unzip it all the way.
You can't take my foot off with the boot.
No.
You gotta unzip it first.
You're kind of clumsy.
I can get it.
Do you want me to do it?
- I can do it.
- I'll do it.
- It's all right.
- I'll do it.
- What you doing?
- We're going to use your bed, okay?
Great.
I just have to find my TV Guide.
I think it's under the bed.
I think it's under here.
Shit, I can't tell you what a crappy evening I had.
Son of a bitch almost threw up all over me.
Damn guy.
Well, he already paid me, so I guess it's...
- How was your evening?
- Great.
I'm having a good time.
Good.
One of us is lucking out.
There it is.
Got it.
Here, I got it.
Got it.
- Where did he go?
- He's gone.
Darling, come on.
Come on, sweetheart.
That's a girl.
That's a girl.
There.
- He didn't really like me.
- Of course he did.
No, he didn't.
Not really.
Honey, think about tomorrow.
I met the guy you're going with tonight.
What's he look like?
He's dark, he has a five o' clock shadow.
- Is he young?
- Yes.
- And good-looking?
- Yes, he is.
- Do you really think I'm going to like him?
- I think you'll love him.
Really?
...over here at high post, to Meyers, open at 15, hits.
...over here at high post, to Meyers, open at 15, hits.
David Meyers, 92-65.
Clay up the middle Shumate getting it out of backcourt himself... dribbles all the way, blocked by Drollinger...
- Who is it?
- Does a William Denny live here?
Who is it?
- You William Denny?
- Who wants to know?
Well, open the door, we'll talk.
- Who are you?
- Friend of Spark.
Listen, I checked with Spark, and we're straight.
So what's the problem?
I'm straight with Spark.
Why don't you check with Spark and then check back?
Where the hell have you been?
Three guesses.
I'll give you this much, my hat is a clue.
Son of a bitch!
Why didn't you tell me you were going?
It was a spur of the minute thing, William.
I had this incredible dream, right?
I'm in Tijuana, at the dog track.
And I sweep the card.
Every dog I bet on, William... wins like a champ.
What do you know about dogs?
But whatever I'm feeling, William, winner.
Fantastic.
Taking down the cash.
Why didn't you tell me, you were going?
Maybe I would've liked to go with you!
You don't know what it's been like.
You want to get to Tijuana, right?
El Sweepo.
I don't win one fucking race.
Maybe if I'd been there you would have.
You weren't in the dream, William.
My parrot was in the dream.
It was a hell of a handicap.
He said, "Bet number four.
Polly want a four."
He doesn't eat nothing, doesn't dirty nothing.
It's going to be all right.
I just need the typewriter.
What have I got?
Packing it all up and moving to Europe to paint?
Yeah.
I'm going to Reno.
I think they've changed the rule, you can't bet your typewriter.
Cash, you know.
Well, a guy told me they got 40-80 low-ball stud game... and a man can win a lot of money.
Sounds interesting.
But why Reno?
Vegas figures to have the same kind of game and it's closer.
Fine.
You go to Vegas, I'll go to Reno.
Reno.
Sounds like you might have a nice shot in a game like that...
- if you have enough money behind you.
- I'm going to win.
- I don't know, William.
- I do.
Reno, that game.
Sounds like a tough game, tough action, William... with a lot of these lumberjacks going up there.
Cowboys, rich guys.
- Tough action, William.
It's a tough game.
- Nobody's asking you to play, pal.
What's with you?
I don't like you coming in here with all your pessimistic shit.
- I don't know what's bugging you...
- I know how I feel.
Let's see...
Yeah, how do you feel?
- Pal, I'm going to win!
- Yeah?
So win!
Who the fuck is stopping you?
Go ahead and win.
- Stop interfering.
I don't interfere with you.
- Who's interfering with you?
I ain't interfering with you.
Look, I know how I feel.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Is that clear?
Because I know how I feel.
Baby, I'm gonna win.
I believe you.
William, did I ever show you my one-armed piccolo player?
The man is a classic.
The man is world-renowned.
William, you got to check this out.
William, for me.
You got to check this out, William.
The man is known all over the world.
Now listen.
Just watch me.
When I reach my crescendo, for me, you got to give me a little hand.
A little applause, William.
Okay?
Right?
Ladies and gentlemen, your beloved, world-renowned, one-armed piccolo player.
The hand, now.
A little applause.
Come on.
Thank you very much.
- You need a partner?
- What?
- A partner?
- Yeah.
I think so.
- You going to take it away now?
- I'm going to stab myself, William.
Get on him.
Good shot.
Fourteen all.
Come on, they're killing us.
- Too quick for the old people.
- I got him.
- Fourteen all.
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
- Way off.
- Free throws.
Free throws.
Get it up.
Shit.
Rebound.
Yours, yours.
- You got a lot of merchandise.
- Yeah, and I want a lot of money.
Here you go.
Are you selling it or making a loan?
- Which is going to give me more money?
- If you sell it.
I'm selling it.
Move faster.
Here we go.
- That's game.
- Nice shot.
You jerk.
- Way to work on the old man.
- Come on, careful, old man.
The man beat you by 20 points.
I'll tell you what.
Do I need a handicap?
I'll play one on one for whatever you got in your pockets.
- For real money?
- Real money, right.
- For real dollars.
- For real dollars?
I don't see no Walt Frazier or Jerry West here.
You're going to lose your money.
That's what I'm here to do is to lose.
You choose.
Get your money together.
Don't go anywhere, man.
Stay right there.
- I'm standing right under the hoop.
- Fine.
You got some money?
- I got $10.
- I got it.
What have you got?
- You got the money?
- I got it.
You know, this is stupid.
I can't believe this sucker.
I got $10.
- What've you got?
- Got $30.
- I got $10.
- That's $40.
- I've got $5.
- $49.
- That's $49.
- Look at him pulling up his socks.
You got some money, old man?
- What you guys get together?
- We got $49.
- You been returning your deposits?
- That's right.
$49?
You got $1?
I got $50 here.
Okay, here's the game.
You're holding, right?
- Who am I playing?
- You got me, buddy.
- I got the shooter?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Hit or miss for the ball.
- I got the ball.
What is it, 11 hoops?
- That's all right.
Eleven hoops?
- Don't worry about it.
- Come on.
Come on, Russ.
- Now beat him.
- Good.
What's that?
Five?
Come on, man.
What do you think you are doing?
The Blue Book gives $2,400.
- But I can't give you $2,400.
- What do you mean?
With this gas shortage, more people are buying little motorcycles... and bicycles than they are cars.
I'm afraid I just can't find a buyer.
The result is official.
No, man, I got to sell it today.
I tell you, I just can't do it today.
I'll give you $2,200.
- $2,200?
That's the best you can do?
- Final offer.
- Let's go.
- Follow me.
My man!
What's happening?
Any big winners?
You like anything in the sixth?
I'm getting buried here.
How you doing?
Nothing?
Yeah, okay.
You just save your winnings.
I'll see you later.
Let me see your driver's license, kid.
Sports Tie, next time put some booze in it.
Trainer Ralph Cripes, please report to the jockey's room.
You know that guy with the mustache?
The big guy who was just standing here?
- The guy talking about watery drinks?
- Yeah, you know him?
- He's a creep.
- Yeah?
Get me a beer, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen, in the ninth race, a jockey change.
Number Three, Fearless Fred, will be ridden by jockey Rick Carey.
Light Touch, where's my drink?
I left a drink here.
Where is it?
All right, forget it.
Give me straight Scotch.
Straight.
You can't fool around with that.
Take them home again, mama.
Thank you, sir.
That'll be $1, sir.
And you got it.
There's $1 for you, my man.
Thank you.
- A friend of yours?
- My cousin.
Watch where you're going, you little bastard.
Stupid little bum.
Handsome, I must talk to you.
Oh, my God!
What a punch.
Stupid clown.
It's the greatest punch I've ever been hit with.
You busted it clean, right?
Oh, beautiful, man.
You blow my mind.
Kick me in the nuts... you break my nose, rob my money.
You gotta be kidding.
Get out of my way or I'm gonna kill you.
Where're you going?
I mean, I wouldn't lie to you, that is...
Get the hell out of here!
It wasn't as good as yours, but I'll live with it.
Enough, man.
That's enough.
No.
You're a man who knows that ain't enough.
Do you wanna level your own goods?
Nose, ribs, cash.
I ain't such a funny man.
Looks like I hit me a round robin.
You creep... you stick a little toilet paper in your nose, it stops the bleeding.
You better call an ambulance.
The man lost the last race.
He tried to kill himself.
Lunatic.
$1,800.
$1,123.
You have $1,800.
Okay, here's $1,100, you put in $1,100 and then we're partners.
We're definitely partners.
I mean, we're total partners.
I'm putting in $1,800, you're putting in 1,100 'cause I'm not going to lose.
I'm gonna win.
That's the last time you've heard the word "lose."
Exactly.
The door opened the other way and hit me right on the nose.
It's an omen.
The snow is an omen and the toilet door is an omen.
Absolutely.
Hello, Reno.
Sun's coming out.
This rain could have been snow, William.
Very good vibes.
- Good sign.
- Yeah.
Feels good.
Red carpets on the street, right?
Men in orange suits.
Where else but in the USA, right?
But we got to stop off here and play a little slot machines.
Just a little bit, right?
No, you want to get straight to the game?
Gotcha.
Boy, you're walking fast, man.
Good.
Keeping going.
Gotta give you a little smile every now and then.
- I won't break your concentration.
- Concentration?
This must be the place, William.
You ask the guy over here.
- Which way to the poker room?
- To your left.
Charlie, please come here a minute.
Stop wasting time.
Look, I'm not superstitious... but touch Dumbo's trunk before we start to play.
For me, right?
Ever seen an elephant fly?
A little rub.
Okay.
Oh, yes.
We're all together.
Keno?
Keno.
We got to touch a little keno, too.
Who knows, we might get the $25,000 jackpot.
- This is it?
- I think this must be the place.
I don't know if these are past winners or losers.
- Deuce and pair.
- Ten?
William, I think it's heaven.
Hi, fellows.
What can I do you for?
I'll have some JB Scotch straight, with some soda water on the side.
William, have a drink.
It'll loosen you up.
No, I'll have some coffee.
- The coffee's right over there, honey.
- William, you are a straight dude.
Coffee.
Just keep it together.
Don't get in the way of the concentration.
Ace, you're the boss.
It's a sweet game, it is. $2,000 buy-in, right?
You fellows here to drink or play?
My partner here is the player and I guess I'm the drinker.
Hughie?
Player.
Next up.
You're low.
Let's run them down.
Let's start with the bald guy with the moustache.
- The tightest player there.
- Absolutely right.
Percentage player, doesn't take many chances, right?
No flair.
The guy I say is part of a two- or three-man combination.
No sweat, but if you find him after the fourth card, you're not in the hand... unless you've got the nuts.
Right.
Cowboy.
Lyndon Johnson is definitely his hero.
I figure he owns a piece of the town.
Haberdashery, looks like he sells cowboy hats.
He's got the rhythm of the game.
It's his rhythm, but with your natural ability and your strength... you don't have to let him have much.
Keep talking.
The kid?
He's seen The Cincinnati Kid too many times.
He's been trying to beat this game from before he was born, right?
I got him.
On to Specs.
He's a doctor and he's been here playing this game forever, right?
- He'd rather lose a patient than a hand.
- Very good.
Not much of a problem, he don't want to get involved too much.
Red Coat.
Red Coat.
My call is small-time, right?
That's your chair, right?
One-time buy-in and he used to be a cha-cha dancer.
I don't know, but that guy's falling out and that's where you're gonna sit.
Empty chair.
Who could tell?
Bit of luck.
Very tall stack of chips.
A little impressive, but unless it's Claude Rains in The Invisible Man... and you see your chips floating up away from you... you know the game is too tough for us and we go on till we hit something else.
How about Bright Eyes?
Man sitting there?
Deep drawl, Mississippi, best in the game.
I figure he learned to play in the Ku Klux Klan... with a big sheet over his head.
Tough man.
What's the Chinaman's story?
The Chinaman.
What can I say?
Looks like he's a royal prince.
His father probably made a fortune selling frozen egg rolls, right?
When he starts talking, when he starts yapping... you know he's cracking.
I got to have a drink.
Give me a double Scotch, will you?
I'm beginning to feel the pressure.
- You did very well.
- You want cognac in your coffee?
Keep passing.
Okay, he goes once more.
- I'm all in.
- He's all in for $70.
There goes the chair.
It's the one we picked.
Goodbye, Mr. Cha-cha.
I got a straight flush going to the deuce.
- Eight and seven.
- Six high.
- Doc is the winner.
You win it all, Doc.
- Too tough for me, gentlemen.
Sorry to see you go.
So long.
Seat open.
You're on, baby.
And a new player.
$2,000 buy-in.
Purples are $100, reds are $20 and the yellows are $5.
He's supposed to be playing, right?
- He's a dynamite poker player.
- Is he?
He needs to be dynamite in that company.
- I'm Bob Hood.
- How are you?
Bill Denny.
Good to see you, Bill.
Any major moves in the game?
Any big winners or losers?
Nothing much yet.
They only just got started yesterday.
Slim.
What can I do for you?
- When do you get a break?
- Couple of hours.
- You got time, do something for me.
- Sure.
Anything for you, Slim.
In the second race at Santa Anita, there's a horse running... and I need to make a little bet on it.
Right.
- What's the horse's name, Slim?
- Ole Blue out of chute Number Two.
- Ole Blue?
- Ole Blue out of chute Number Two.
No.
Second horse in the second race at Santa Anita.
- That's reliable information?
- Yes, sir.
- The second at Santa Anita?
- Yes, sir.
Great, thanks.
I'll put a little taste on that myself.
Good.
- You don't wanna risk it in that poker game?
- I'm playing right now.
- You're playing right now?
- That's me... that good-looking fellow in the brown coat.
Good luck to you.
I won't play hard at you.
- Let me know about the horse.
- Will do, Slim.
Is that guy for real?
Somebody told me a funny story about him.
That guy usually have that much money on him?
Yeah, he's got a roll.
- That's the most money I ever saw.
- Mellow roll.
I hope William takes it away from him.
~ Oh, look down look down ~
~ That lonesome road ~
Okay.
~ Before you travel on ~
~ Yeah, look up look up ~
~ And seek your maker ~
~ Before Gabriel blows his horn ~
I got a good one.
You're gonna like this.
~ Oh, look down look down Look down, your fly is open ~
No, that's not right.
Well, whatever.
You didn't like that?
I'm out.
Excuse me.
And suddenly I banged into this...
- You got a glass of ice water?
- Too hot for you in there?
William, you make a little...
Up a bit.
I can't settle down with you here.
- What are you saying?
- You got to go.
No.
I mean, I got to sit here.
I'm not in the action.
I got to watch.
Let me watch.
Right?
I gotta watch.
You're not telling me that I'm getting in the way of your concentration, are you?
You telling me I'm interfering with your game, right?
Oh, God.
Okay, then you got to lay $200 on me.
Give me $100, $50.
Give me $25 so I can play, get into some...
Ice.
Do you want in?
Yeah.
I want in.
Okay, he comes back.
We're not going to fight.
Put your coat back on.
- Now you mean business.
- I feel like playing awhile.
- Let's accelerate it a little.
- Come on, what are we here for?
- How do you do?
- Fine.
How are you?
I'm very well.
I'd like...
I'd like $1,000 worth of credit.
I have no account, what do I have to do?
You gotta loan on the house?
Well, I don't...
What do you have to do?
I'll tell you.
Then you just give me a roll of nickels... and I'll just kibbitz for awhile 'cause I ain't getting no credit here.
Doctor just calls.
Forty to you.
Are you raising?
I got a cherry.
I got two cherries.
Excuse me.
I got two cherries and nothing happened.
Pit boss?
Let me have a pit boss.
Is there a pit boss?
You know, I wouldn't do that.
- I'm here to win, Doctor.
- Okay.
No hard feelings.
No hard feelings at all.
A pleasure to do business with you.
Pleasure doing business with people who like to do business.
Not many do.
You don't think there'll be five?
I'll say that there will be five, okay, Steve?
- Coca-Cola, please.
- Yes, sir.
I feel like a winner, but I know I look like a loser.
We busted?
We got anything left?
What's up in that game?
- We're up $11,000.
- $11,000.
We are up $11,000.
Well, let us pack this place in.
Let's go back to LA now.
You're my hero.
My new hero.
$11,000.
We're rich. $5,500 each.
Let's go.
Know how long we can live at the track for that?
- I can beat the game for 15...
- Famous last words. 15, 20.
You're here now, right?
You won $11,000.
We could be at the track for 50 years with that kind of money, right?
Charlie, I got the heat.
You gotta give me $200 so I can play some roulette... or do something while you're in there.
Don't look at me like that.
You're not going... $50?
The man's having a good time.
I'm sitting here going...
Wait a second now.
Okay, knock 'em dead, William.
What are you doing?
- Sixty cents for the Coke.
- Wait a second.
He hardly even drank the Coke.
That's my keno money.
One time I made 14 parlays and let it ride.
And every time I'd do it in the bootleg days, I'd take a drink.
And I finally ended up with an old dealer around here who said:
"Doctor, you don't know what you had.
You had that house, had the whole point...
"from old Felix Terwiller and you just don't know what you had."
- And it ended up by me owing him $2,600.
- Ante up, gentlemen.
And that was back in 1926, and that was a lot of dough...
- and it took me six months to pay it off.
- Doc, ante, please.
You can win that much in this game if you hold the best hand.
We've been playing fine.
This game's getting good.
You just keep on playing, everything's going to be okay.
You talk with your cards and start breaking.
She owes me a blackjack.
I won $7,000 more.
I lost the rhythm of the game.
- I'm going to play some blackjack.
- $7,000 more?
- $18,000.
- Lucky man.
- I'm a rich man.
- I should say you are.
You're being kibbitzed by a very wealthy man.
- Good luck.
- I'm going to tell you, Chester...
- you just hang on to your cards.
- $18,000.
Boy!
- Money, please.
- $18,000.
William, you're...
What a streak.
You put me in the game, okay?
Put me in, I'll go play poker...
- and you can knock this table...
- What'll you play with?
You're going to give me some of my money.
William, I got no nails.
I'm going to throw...
A 10!
How could you do a 10 like that?
Never bust nothing.
I guess you think I did that?
I come over here and sit and you're gonna lose.
I'm having a nervous breakdown.
The money can't do me nothing... 'cause I ain't got none.
Just keep on winning, okay?
Jimmy, can I get a little credit here?
- What do I gotta do to have credit?
- Go to the cashier.
He said I couldn't do it anymore.
Hey, Bill.
What's happening?
Why did you disappear from the blackjack?
Is that all that's left of our money?
All that cash?
- How're you doing?
- Very good.
What's very good?
How much did you win?
- What do you have...
- I did very good.
Very good could be something or nothing.
- What is happening?
- It bounced out of 22!
What the hell is that?
What do you want to know?
Ask me what you want to know.
You're over here, ask me!
What do you want to know?
- Bounced out of 22.
- That's right.
Will you get out of here?
You're gonna kill the streak!
Nobody's drinking this.
I'll bet a Milky Way.
Sorry, sir.
The limit's $1.
You just finish this hand and then you see.
You want to bet a Milky Way.
You're liable to get hungry.
Twenty-nine is not mine!
How much money is in there if he wins?
I'll take $1 million on the field and I'm coming.
Twenty-six.
How much are those chips worth?
- Do you mind?
- How's my field coming... with my lucky Milky Way on the field?
Give me a field on the hard way.
$100 a number.
Where's my lucky...
Twenty-six!
We gotta shoot craps.
William, I'm not going to get in your way no more.
- You come with me.
- No.
- No, I'm shooting, you're betting.
- I'll bet $100 on 11.
Okay, that stuff will just wash the dice off.
Number 11.
- Twelve, your line away.
- Look, maybe I ought to go.
No, you stay right here.
Charlie, now you stay right here.
And we start now.
Okay, we start now.
Okay, table, we're starting now.
I got it, Charlie.
Let me see it.
Nine the winner.
He's got us out there, William.
I never saw so many bumble-bee chips in my life.
$100 chips.
They give us real money for this?
Numbers!
Easy eight, okay.
Eight!
It is eight!
Okay, that's number two.
Come on.
Let's have the dice.
Come on, we're all with you, everyone.
Don't worry now.
Numbers.
Eight!
Give me a pair of fours.
A pair of fours and I'll shit in my drawers.
Put your money on double four, lady.
This man's going all the way.
$500 chips!
I never saw $500 chips.
Seventy-five!
Three 11s in a row.
I wanna bet a million dollars. 14-to-1.
- You making that kind of money?
- You bet I am.
Don't distract the man.
Just stay right on the table, William.
Eleven.
Four 11s in a row.
The man throws four 11s in a row.
Where's my $14 million?
I meant what I said.
$1 million on the line for an 11.
Nine!
Nine!
The man throws nines, eights, sixes.
Wake up the world, William.
Roll these numbers till it comes down.
Aren't you going to change the pit guys now?
You guys aren't getting tired, are you?
Hard six.
You get a hard six, they'll put your picture up here.
- Try it.
- Hard six.
Hard eight.
Come on.
Hard six.
Have you ever seen a greater roll than this?
I think you're not gonna believe what I've seen.
This the biggest one you ever see?
- Almost.
- Almost?
We gotta make it the biggest one.
Excuse me.
Can I put $1 on number seven?
What is that?
$1 on seven.
Here, lady, you got $100 to get out of town.
Give that lady $100, tell her to go play that, all right?
Come on, shoot.
Nine.
Come on, 66.
I don't believe it.
- You won't be here next game.
- That's right.
That's your comeback.
- You are the shooter.
- Well, man, okay.
- All right, I'll pass the dice to the lady.
- Okay.
- You are the shooter, ma'am.
- Let's go check out.
Is that the longest roll you've ever been here for?
That man is unconscious.
That's what they said.
- Don't you go grabbing none of these.
- How many points?
Could you buy us a drink?
Here.
Give this to the sweeper.
- Thank you very much.
- Excuse me.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.
- There he is.
- No, we's about even now.
He's in there.
~ I've got the world on a string ~
~ Sitting on a rainbow ~
These chips, they're just falling out.
William, you okay?
I suddenly got very tired.
I know, I could see that.
I was amazed.
You walked away from the table and you left all your chips.
But I scooped them up.
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We'll get a suite, a couple of outfits, some new clothes.
Maybe we'll hit the old Mustang Ranch, right?
We'll get a couple of little ladies.
Have a ball, right?
Then maybe we'll come down, go to Vegas... hire a limousine, get a driver, hit every track in the world.
Right?
We haven't even started yet, Mr. Denny.
I haven't even picked up the dice.
You just showed me how to win, right?
Conviction, right?
Conviction and control.
I'm going to take a rest.
You and me are going to rest up... then we're back to the tables and I'll be hitting it this time, too.
First, I gotta empty my pockets.
Just chock-full, all these here chips.
I'll go to the cashier now and pick up a little cash.
You just sit right there and take it easy.
~ La cucaracha, la cucaracha ~
~ Just Billy and me ~
I've got a fortune right here, fellows.
You'd better call for some money.
We got a lot of money here.
Keep everybody back.
Everybody back.
Have a pretzel.
We have pretzels all over the place.
Rack them up.
Call Howard Hughes and tell him we're gonna break his bank, too.
You can do me a favor.
I got a hole in my shoe.
You know where I can get this fixed?
No, I'll cash my shoe in, too.
You give me something for that?
No, we don't give nothing for old shoes.
Don't drop no chips down on the floor, now.
What do you think we got here?
How much money we got?
I think we got quite a few here.
- I just need a...
- ...any help with the money.
Well, I got a lot of pockets.
Now I want a very good smile.
I want a smile from you.
$82,000 on the button.
New shoes.
Cheese and crackers!
$40,000.
You see, I've been shooting crap games.
Smile, now.
You ain't smiling.
That's right.
Well, then you tell Mr. Hughes that we're gonna break the rest of his things, too.
Look, how much is that now?
- That's $60,000, sir.
- $60,000, sir.
I've been shooting.
I have a knack with numbers.
I just, you know...
Craps happens to be one of my games.
Don't want to take advantage of the house and win too much.
- $70,000.
- $70,000?
Four, six...
- It is unreal, but it's $80,000.
- $82,000.
$82,000.
Thank you very much.
We'll probably see you again.
Excuse us.
Pathway, please.
No, I don't need any police.
No, ain't nobody taking this money from me.
William, $82,000.
William, $41,000 apiece.
Gonna split it up right now, all right?
Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, for you.
Those people there, they want autographs, they want to take pictures.
The Reno Gazette, they want to do a whole feature story... but I said, "No, we're going to be resting until we come back." Right?
Okay, $40,000.
$41,000.
Make sure of this.
Even split.
Eight, nine, and 10.
$41,000.
You always take a big win this hard?
Charlie, there was no special feeling in it.
I just said there was.
Yeah, I know that.
Everybody knows that.
Check this out.
We're heroes here, right?
This lady, Norma Walker, works near the cashier, gave me this:
"If it takes a watermelon five minutes to water..."
"...how long will it take a sweet pea to pee?
"As long as it takes a pair of dice to crap."
Don't mean a fucking thing, does it?
Charlie, I have to go home.
Oh, yeah?
Where do you live?
I'll see you.
A new game starting, five draw.
Five and ten draw.
Get in the game starting with R.B., J.L., L.B., S. G...
R.M., R.P., G.C., G.W., B.F., and J.B.
Five and ten draw, get in, the game's starting.
Come right in.
Five draw.
L.B. five draw.
Five and ten draw.
L.B.
Feeling lucky?
All right, sir.
Double T.
Hello, Bill.
- Put you on at five?
- Put me on at ten.
On at ten.
Poker has been around for a long time.
It sure has.
But it isn't like this anymore.
The saloon has been replaced by this... with a game that can be played in comfort and with full confidence in the management.
And here is the man who is responsible for that confidence:
Mr. Murry Shepherd.
Welcome to the California Club, where your pleasure is our business.
It has been said that nearly everyone in America understands poker... or wants to.
It is one of America's most popular games.
And since you have shown an obvious interest by coming here... we have prepared a short film to teach you the fundamentals... of the game as we play it here.
Service is our only commodity.
This film is part of that service.
The object of the game is to win the pot.
- Hope I remember that.
- There are two variations of this game:
- High draw.
The highest ranking hand wins.
- Don't give me that.
- Low draw...
- There's my baby.
...where the winning hand holds the lowest possible ranking combination of cards.
As you enter the club, the reservation and game board is located in the card room.
You must stop here and tell the boardman of your game preference.
He will enter your initials on the board... and you will be called and directed to a table by a floorman.
The floorman puts the games together... interprets and applies the rules of poker.
His decisions are final.
C. W. ten blind.
C. W. in the coffee shop.
C.W., ten blind.
C.W., double his money.
The management of the club has no financial interest in any game.
There is no house deal.
Each player plays for himself.
And each in turn acts as a dealer.
When you are seated at the game, you'll be asked to pay a rental fee... which will be collected thereafter at the beginning of each half hour.
B.D. ten blind.
B.D., ten, twenty low.
You must have a full buy-in when you are seated to begin playing.
Chips must be purchased from the chip girl.
The buy-in is determined by the limit of the game you choose to play.
You must ante before you receive cards.
The ante is placed on the number directly in front of you.
The number is also your seat number at the table.
What do you do, Lew?
I'll call.
Acquiring the knowledge and skill to play card games such as poker... is a social asset.
To make the most of this asset... it is simply good judgment to be wanted at the card table.
Shit.
Don't be a spoilsport now.
- Who's the bettor?
- $20 to you.
Me.
You're so pretty I'm going to fold.
- Is everybody out?
- That's it.
You mean I've got a goddamn six and everybody's out?
This depends even more on good manners than upon the skill of the player.
The following principle should increase one's popularity as a card player.
I need one little, teensy...
Sit erect.
- Maintain a quiet bearing.
- Come on, get on with it.
Come on, sweetheart.
- Avoid nervous habits.
- $40.
I have a seat for you.
Now come on in.
During the game, avoid conversation regarding matters not relating to the game.
I'll just have to call you.
An appearance of awkwardness and clumsiness...
I didn't think you were that good.
...gives a bad impression of one's ability to play.
Wait a minute.
What do you think you're doing?
What do you mean, "wait a minute"?
You said it was good.
No, I said that I didn't think that you were that good.
I got a seven-four.
When a hand has gone very well for you, don't talk about it.
The film you've just been viewing cannot instantly make you a good poker player.
The more skilled you become, the more pleasurable you will find the game.
- I had a feeling...
- Next year.
Raise.
Pass.
- I call.
- Well, I'll raise the raise.
- Goodbye.
- I'm out.
Out.
And one more time to you.
What a pot.
- Another $20, huh?
- The table is so slow.
- You wanted one of these.
- Go ahead, I call.
- Cards?
- Pat.
Pat.
Very interesting.
Come on.
Do you mind picking the cards up and dealing them the regular way?
You did stay pat?
You are pat?
Come on.
Wait a second, lady.
I got a big decision to make here.
I'm gonna let you break me down.
I'll let you break me down.
Two cards.
- Two beauts.
- That's very nice.
- Oh, my!
- Great catch.
- Hey, pal, that card's dead.
- What are you talking about?
- The card went off the table.
It's a dead card.
- You're absolutely right, chief.
My gratitude for your knowledge of the rules... except the card never left the table.
The card went off the table, it's a dead card.
Did you see that card go off the table?
- I didn't see nothing at all.
- It's stupid of me to ask you.
- What about you?
Did you see it?
- All I see is the time passing.
- Pop, did you see it?
- Nothing.
How much you bet?
Somebody must have seen it.
- Kenny, this is ridiculous.
- I want to change my table.
- What's the problem?
- The problem is the card went off the table... and hit the floor and he won't give it up.
There's nothing to give up.
The card never hit the floor.
- I caught it before it did.
- All right, take it easy.
Who else saw it?
- Ma'am, did you see what happened?
- I didn't see it.
- How about you, sir?
- I saw a card bounce.
I don't know what happened back here.
You dealt the hand.
You ought to know what happened.
I dealt the second one a little hard.
It never hit the floor, not even close.
Not even close?
All right, that settles it, Lew.
The rule is if the card doesn't hit the floor it plays.
Continue the hand.
- I don't have another table...
- You got your ruling, play!
Just take it easy.
It's not even close. 20-20.
20-20.
The flying card didn't stop you from betting?
40-40.
I raise.
Raise.
What could be cozier than this?
I mean, this is perfection, isn't it?
- You and me in this hand...
- That's pretty.
Just do something!
How much money you got?
How much you got left?
$17.
Not enough for the maximum bet. $3 shy.
- I bet you $17.
- Call.
- Seven smooth.
- No good.
I got a six perfect.
Sorry about...
Damn it.
That last card that went off the table was a joker.
- That's why you wouldn't give it up.
- You're ridiculous.
- You said it wasn't even close.
- That's yesterday's news.
You two are working together.
You're partners.
You two motherfucking creeps are partners.
They should put a muzzle on him.
That's it?
- That man is absolutely ridiculous.
- What's going on here?
What's going on with you guys?
- These two are working partners together.
- I never saw that man before in my life.
I saw him nobble the joker out on the last deal.
The man is totally out of line.
They've been smiling at each other all night.
Come on, will you?
- Sit down and settle down.
- Get control.
Come on.
All right.
- All right, now who else saw this?
- I didn't see it.
- What about you?
- What do you want me to say?
The man calls you a cheater.
The man doesn't know how to play poker.
The man is bad.
He's a complete asshole.
We all know that, right?
The man goes broke, he can't handle it.
The man is on tilt.
You want to hear any more?
- Not me.
- Come on, now.
You'd better just take it easy, sport, 'cause the security's liable to let you go!
Put that guy in a horror show.
That's it!
Any more fighting, and you guys go out of here for good, all right?
All right!
Miriam, what do you say?
I say I can do without any more of that language.
- Right.
- You think there's any cheating going on?
I wouldn't like to say about that.
They've been consistent winners.
And I'm a big loser.
And you know I know how to play poker.
Sour grapes, honey.
All right, let's get it back to normal.
Lousy punk.
- You're not that good.
- Up yours.
Sir, would you like another beer?
...I bet it on Notre Dame 'cause I got a feeling Notre Dame would pull it off.
They beat UCLA when they had so many games going straight.
Yeah, it's kind of similar to the Miami Dolphins.
- This particular game is duck soup.
- They won 17 games straight last year.
Come on.
I can beat that goddamn miserable game.
Don't make me beg for a stinking $30.
I'm sorry.
You know, your attitude just pisses me off sometimes, Button-nose.
Don't call me that.
Now look.
There you go again.
I'm not doing anything.
I need about $80 to get to the track.
Not bad.
- Sir, can I help you?
- Cold beer.
Keg draft.
I'm buying that man sitting over there a beer.
Turned out to be a drinking man?
Nothing personal, but I already got a beer.
Thanks.
Great.
- So, you think the Knicks are gonna win?
- Yeah.
No, Knicks ain't going to win nothing.
Willis is hurting.
Knicks ain't winning.
Celtics, this year.
You follow pro basketball?
- Anything, right?
- Whatever's going.
Yeah, me too.
Action.
Are you gonna give me the $30 or not?
I have to buy this man a drink.
Will you have a beer?
I will definitely have a beer.
Give my friend here a beer.
$1 says you don't know who Glenn Riggs is.
- What's your name?
- Vince.
The name's Vince.
Glenn Riggs was the announcer for Hop Harrigan.
- What do you want $30 for?
- I need it for that girl I got in the bathroom.
I'm only the relief bartender.
I don't go in the cash register.
- Where's Jack?
What is this?
- Jack went to a funeral.
I've been working here for one year, right?
Just give me a piece of paper, a chit.
"$30, Renee. " Okay?
If I give you $30 and I come up short, it'll be your ass.
Baby, you were born short.
And it's always my ass.
Captain Midnight!
This guy giving you trouble?
He ain't the regular man.
- $30.
- I wouldn't sign anything.
Don't sign a thing.
Don't sign anything.
What did you get her to sign?
- Here, Mother.
- Thanks, baby.
You won't be sorry.
Don't worry now, I can beat it.
Goodbye.
$20 says you can't name the Seven Dwarfs.
- I know I can name three or four of them.
- Seven.
I got seven.
- Doc.
- That's one.
- Dopey.
- That's two.
- Snoopy.
- There is no Snoopy.
There ain't no Snoopy.
I know there's Doc... there's Dopey, there's Grumpy, there's...
- You don't have $20 here.
- Wait a second.
I got $20 right here.
- I need a little help here.
What about...
- Here comes seven like a Gatling gun.
- Seven Dwarfs, I'm ready.
- Sleepy, Grumpy, Doc.
- That's four.
- That's three.
- I'm with you.
- Wait a second.
Sleepy, Grumpy, Doc.
Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey.
- Dopey.
- We got Dumbo.
- There's no Dumbo.
- Dumbo wasn't in that cast?
- No Dumbo.
- Gotcha.
- Dumbo flew.
- Well, we both lose?
Remember when Dumbo flew?
They set that little house on fire.
I've seen an elephant walk, but I never seen an elephant fly.
- My God.
- I know.
Dumbo flew.
A lot of black folks said that was bad news... seeing a black crow sing about a big flying elephant.
What's that?
It's taboo.
No black crows.
Judgment day, you know, I know
Aristis, Arastis, Johnson Brown
What you gonna do when the rent come round?
You in the park?
No, I haven't got a car.
I just live...
Not far.
I like to live close to the action, you know, William?
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
You're going to give me a lift?
That's a good idea.
You know, I know the rent means dough
Landlord gonna throw us in the co-co snow
Aroostis, Arastis, Johnson Brown
What you gonna do when the rent comes round?
What you gonna say?
How you gonna pay?
William, you're a minstrel?
Man, I hate key stuff.
Look in his side pocket.
He's got my goddamn money somewhere.
Right here.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
I hope you loved that, Funny Man.
Okay, folks, will you just relax and follow me, please?
What is this, a hospital or a jail?
What's going on?
This is William.
This is Barbara.
She's getting us out of here.
Thanks a lot.
You ever been in jail in New York?
They give you powdered eggs.
Powdered, shitty...
The shittiest food in the world.
I can't believe you haven't been in jail.
What are you doing?
Just trying some of the hot one.
It really works.
Here, you want to try some?
Come on, the heat makes it feel good.
Listen to me, I got experience.
Yeah, easy.
Just don't touch it with the can.
Easy now.
- Not bad?
- That's nice.
That's okay.
Last year, year and a half, I must have hit... about 30 different racetracks in every little town and city I've been to.
- Yeah, how'd you do?
- Tapioca time.
El Busto.
I'll give you a great ace in the hole.
If you find yourself busted in a small town...
Say, is there anything I should know about this?
Listen, fellows, it's breakfast time.
We got Lucky Charms and...
- What's with this?
- Froot Loops.
- Froot Loops?
Have some waffles...
- I'll take some coffee.
Blueberry pancakes.
You'd still be in jail if that guy hadn't given me that $50.
But... chicken.
...a strange town you head straight to the ice cream people... and pick yourself up an ice cream cart.
They got lots of them.
They don't care who you are or what you look like.
- Something to eat.
It's roughage.
- Believe me, nothing.
Desperate people.
They give you a funny little white jacket and you're on your way.
How much do you make in a thing like that?
You could pick up a snappy $25 in less than an hour.
- How do you do that?
- You keep it all.
You don't think I'm talking about working this job legit?
- Your favorite:
Lucky Charms.
- Can I have a beer, honey?
- You want a cold beer?
- No, thanks.
It goes good with your Froot Loops.
- Get some milk, honey.
- Got it.
That shaving cream's not going to stain your white sweater.
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to tell your mother.
Just put it down and it'll all wash out.
Let me taste it for you.
- What is this?
- That crap.
- Come on, we got company.
- I tried to make it look nice.
That looks better.
Here, baby.
One time, right, I had this job selling ad space in a labor union magazine.
Non-existent.
Just get on the telephone, call people and say:
"Do you want to buy some space?"
- Help yourself.
Ain't bad.
Just last night's.
- I just need the spoon.
A little pâté de foie garbage.
Then you get to keep 45% of what you pick up.
How come you don't get to keep all of it if it's non-existent?
I'm not picking it up, I'm just talking on the telephone.
- Yeah, right.
- What do you do?
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm with a magazine.
- You a writer?
- Yeah.
Say!
Do you remember the first bet you ever made on a sport event?
- Do you?
- I bet a nickel... in the 1945 World Series.
The Cubs and Tigers.
Don't laugh.
I lost.
Susan's home.
Five-cent bet and I lost.
- I didn't expect to lose.
- Susan, honey.
I didn't have the nickel, right?
So this guy Mikey asked my mother.
I've been trying to beat it ever since.
What is it?
- Did he hurt your feelings?
- No.
- You can scratch him off the book, honey.
- I don't want to scratch him off my book.
Here's the baby of the house now.
Sweetheart, would you like some Froot Loops?
- Come on.
Therapy.
- No therapy.
What's shaking, baby?
I just want to go to bed.
Take your coat off, sweetheart.
Come on, now, you're starting to get that Halloween look on your face.
It was just...
He was really different.
- Guy wasn't out of line with you, was he?
- No.
- We had such a good time.
- Yeah?
Guy was fresh, was he?
You know what he did?
He gave me $50.
- That was the deal, wasn't it?
- No, the deal was for $30.
He liked you a lot, too, sweetheart.
- How come you were picked up?
- Drunk and disorderly.
- Well, Charlie's not too good with cops.
- He certainly lets them know it.
This is the truth.
You're an animal lover, right?
The great blue whale, right?
You know about a great blue whale?
- That wrestling guy?
- No, it's a big fish.
There's only about two or three left in the world.
And the truth, the tongue of the great blue whale... weighs more than a full-grown African elephant.
- No, it's not true.
- You don't believe it?
You're just making it up to make me feel better.
'Cause you don't like to see me cry.
You feel a little better?
- Yeah, I do.
- Good.
- Who's that guy out there?
- Billy?
He's a poker friend.
- You want to meet him?
- No.
He'd spent his rent money on us.
Yeah, so we brought him home.
The girl's fine.
She just fell in love again.
She'll be okay in the morning.
Listen, William, I'm going to crash.
You can use the sofa if you want.
Thank you.
- I got to crash, too.
- Okay.
- Good night, baby.
- Good night.
I got to get my car.
I can't get my car.
There's nobody up there.
I was just looking for the Guide.
Go back to sleep.
It's Happy, Bashful, Dopey, Doc, Grumpy...
Fuck them.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Denny.
- Hello, Barbara.
This information came in for you from Chino this morning.
- Thank you, Barbara.
The dauphin in yet?
- Since 9:00 a. m.
He wanted to see you.
- What's the matter with your body?
- I had a little automobile trouble, Barbara.
- Is that him?
- It was, sir.
- Did you tell him I wanted to see him?
- I did, sir.
- What'd he say?
- He said, "Thank you. "
- He did?
- He did.
Thank you.
You're most welcome.
- These are the colors on the antique article.
- Oh, right.
I didn't know what time you'd be in, so I just picked out a few.
- I think they're your best bet.
- Thanks, Barbara.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
- Good.
How about some coffee?
- Love some.
Everybody's named Barbara.
- Hello?
- Barbara?
- Yes.
- This is Bill Denny.
Bill!
Hi.
- Is the Ice Cream Man around?
- He sure is.
Charlie, it's Bill.
- William, what's shaking?
- Hey, Charlie.
I'm at the office.
I'm reviewing things.
It sounds like a bore.
You want to track it with me?
Believe me, I'd like to... only I cannot get out.
I'm really all jammed up here.
You let a man rub some hot shaving cream on your ribs... you can take a shot with him at the track.
Listen, I know you're right, but you know, I cannot steal any more time from here.
We'll play it your way, but if you should change your mind...
I'll be at the bar in the grandstand... right above the finish line, near the $100 window, all right?
Yeah, I know the spot.
Okay, listen.
If I can, I can.
I hope you do.
Listen Charlie, thanks for an interesting evening.
Knock them dead.
Okay, I will.
Okay, so long.
It's different.
It's not my favorite, but it is different.
Who in their right mind would put a graveyard...
- on the front of the California...
- Our boss.
I mean, that's not going to sell any magazines.
Well, it's not doing so badly.
Excuse me.
Could we change seats?
No way, lady.
I'm sorry.
The last time I sat facing the rear, I never won a race.
I get sick if I ride that way.
It gets me dizzy.
Hey, miss, this lady here is going to throw up if she sits in this chair.
- Would you mind changing with her?
- I never change seats.
It's bad luck.
- She'll never change seats.
- Lady, I don't mind changing.
This lady here will change with you.
Thank you.
Great.
This lady will change with that lady, but she needs a window seat.
You change there, and I could...
- Everything okay?
Wonderful.
- Great.
Super day for the track.
- Do me a favor?
- Do you want to change seats again?
Would you see what Egyptian Femme looks like?
She's in the fourth.
- Egyptian Femme?
- Femme.
Jerry Weintraub is their manager, and he's got to have something.
Just stock, publicity stills, on, you know...
- What do you want, some 8x10s?
- Yeah.
Egyptian Femme.
The horse has run twice in two years, right?
Each time she stiffed out.
Now she steps up in class... goes up against colts, draws an inside post position in a sprint... and ain't got no speed of her own to get out there.
Is all that in there?
If you know how to read these things.
It says a lot more.
I thought I'd spare you all the gory stuff.
Egyptian Femme?
The lady's going to cap out on Egyptian Femme?
Pretty funny.
Forget that horse, lady.
I hate to see her get away.
She owes me money from last year.
Then you make a bet on her and she'll owe you money from this year.
How far is it to Chino?
- An hour and a half.
- I'm going up there.
They got it all wrong.
If you hear from the dauphin... tell him, "Much luck. "
Well, I'm holding my own.
Just don't bet the chalk.
No chalk betting here.
- Later, Ben.
- All right.
The weight factor, see?
It's the weight factor.
Excuse me.
- Hey, babe, what's happening?
- How's it going?
- How'd you do the first race?
- Not too good.
I like to stay away from the daily doubles, too.
Any info?
- Not as yet.
- If you get any information, I'll be at the bar.
- Andrew, que pasa?
- Hey, Big Charlie, what's going on?
You got a winner today?
Not yet?
Me neither.
Are you sure Egyptian Femme is not going to win?
- You want a beer?
- I don't.
I think you ought to bet on Egyptian Femme.
You're right.
Yeah?
Then why do you have four underlined?
I don't know.
I used to like Banks, the jockey, but I changed my mind.
- You're putting me on.
- Who will you bet?
- Not Egyptian Femme, I'll tell you that much.
- I'm glad you're definite.
Who do you like in the fourth, pal?
William, you made it.
Glad to see you, William.
How you feeling?
Not bad.
I got a little pain here and here, otherwise I couldn't be better.
- Give my friend a beer.
- Want to give my friend here a beer?
I asked first.
I'm telling you another half inch to the left of center...
- That's no good here, Charlie.
- No, this is on me.
- It's on me.
You just keep it all.
- Any time.
You keep it all.
Your money's no good here, pal.
Don't you appreciate a man who gets you in the goodies?
He gave me a kick where I'm breathing and I'm pretty lucky to be here.
Now, how did you manage it?
How'd you get away from work?
I wish I was as good at this as I am at getting away from work.
Razzle-dazzle.
The minstrel man strikes again.
I know.
After today you're gonna have enough money to open up a string of parking lots.
- It looks that good?
- 20-to-1 in the morning line ain't tin.
- You really like it?
- Fucking gold, babe.
- Who's the horse?
- Número uno.
Egyptian Femme.
Tough to figure, right?
He doesn't seem to like to run a lot.
- She, it's a lady.
- Right.
It's beautiful.
Just right.
They've been shopping for a big price... today we're going to nail them.
- Not much to recommend.
- The rest are a bunch of dogs, too, right?
Believe me, she'll pay.
$4 million and change.
If you think the inside post position is bad, she's got a lot of speed, wire to wire.
You're really not worried, are you?
This horse owes me and owes my friend, owes everybody around here.
- We're taking down today, my friend.
- I'd like to toast that, pal.
- Let's go see a man about a horse.
- A man about a horse.
Excuse me.
Where is she?
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Come on.
Don't stop!
Go!
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Stay up there!
- Come on, Valdez!
- Who's Valdez?
Valdez is the jockey!
Come on, Valdez.
Come on, Valdez.
Keep it up there.
Come on, Egyptian Femme!
He'll make a move now.
- Come on, Egyptian Femme!
Stay up there!
- Come on, Valdez!
And he wins!
Take it down.
Come on, we win this race.
We won that race going away.
That was a race.
Did you see that race?
- I mean, Valdez...
That race was fantastic.
- We didn't see the tote board.
- Did you see the other horse?
- We win this race.
I've never done this.
I've never come out...
- Will you trust me?
We won.
- Let's see the photo, man.
Photo finish?
We won going away.
- What were you watching?
- I was watching this race.
Just a little razzle-dazzle.
Can you be happy now?
- I've never done this before.
- The horse wins.
- We're a winner.
- The horse did not win!
Nobody says that.
This is called counting your chickens.
- Chickens and counting chickens?
- Before they're hatched.
You spend a whole life out here and you have a 20-to-1 shot...
Come on, fellows.
Will you get it up here?
I'm telling you, we win the race.
- What is it?
- Goddamn one horse.
Egyptian Femme!
Egyptian Femme won!
Where've you been?
That's what I said.
I can't believe this!
I had that horse!
You rotten creep!
Hey, you!
You said Egyptian Femme had no chance!
The horse won!
Whose money is that?
Had no chance?
- Lady, don't throw oranges.
- The horse had no chance?
The horse had no chance?
You knew it all along!
Are you crazy?
God damn it, lady, you don't throw oranges on an escalator!
Come on, lady, get back!
How's that, lady?
- That's my hat!
- Now, you stop throwing oranges.
Stop it!
- Give me my goddamn hat!
- Stop it!
- You thief!
- You want your purse?
That horse owes me more money!
Here, you want your money?
Take your goddamn...
You asshole, you can't even throw!
Wonder where he's going to take us for dinner tonight?
Who knows?
But wherever it is, it'll be delicious.
- I hope it's the Scala.
- That'd be great.
We can have all that Italian food we love.
We can have mozzarella marinara... and eggplant parmigiana...
- Honey, there he is.
- Zabaglione for dessert.
Now sit down, act natural.
Say, what is this?
Surprise!
No, it's not.
- Hey, baby.
- We're going to make it.
Here you are, Mr. Tenor, and thank you.
- That was delightful.
- Birthday greetings!
Go on.
- Who's that wonderful guy out there?
- That man's a tenor.
- We want you to have the big evening...
- We can't have the big evening tonight.
- She and I got a date.
- What are you talking about?
- You're not working tonight?
- Yes, we are.
I saw you eating your breakfast.
Now I think I'm going to play the piano.
Which way is it?
Honey, sweetheart, it's a very important party.
It's very, very important...
Okay, that's it.
That's it now.
All right, stop it now.
All right.
Stop the music.
Stop.
We're expecting Mr. Kramer.
We loved all the gifts.
We love everything.
- Are we out of here?
- Yeah.
...should've been there when you came to the door.
But it's $150 apiece for the evening for dinner.
- What?
- This evening at $150 each.
- Are we out of here?
- $150.
All we have to do is go to dinner.
Maybe Mr. Kramer wants to give Bill and me $75 apiece.
- Bill's awful pretty to show off.
- I don't know how to take that.
Not at all.
We can tell him we're sick.
Now I get the feeling I'm being mugged by my friend.
- No, this is not right.
- All right, Bill, out the door.
I'm waiting to say goodbye.
You ladies, now, I mean, we're gonna...
- It sure was nice.
- Go in there.
- Sit down and act natural.
- I think you're unfair.
Susan and Barbara must not be deprived of our companionship tonight.
Certainly not.
- They were looking super.
- Should we look inside?
Absolutely.
Mr. Kramer must be some funny dude.
- Hi.
- It's me.
Do you remember me?
- Of course I remember you.
- Is there anyone else?
- No, there's just us.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
- Okay.
- Sweetheart, you look terrific.
- Do you like it?
Yeah.
- You smell wonderful.
- Thank you.
I'm so glad you like it.
- What are you wearing?
- Thank you.
What are you...
- It's Joy, isn't it?
- No, it's Shalimar.
- Shalimar.
- Do you like it?
- Oh, God.
- Mr. Chan!
- Shalimar is my favorite perfume.
- It's mine, too.
Do you like the dress?
I had it...
Yes, I had it made in Omaha.
Yeah, but I just...
I just never had the balls to wear it, you know, outside.
- Well, honey, it's sexy...
- I love the dress.
- Listen to me.
- Dignified.
- Elegant.
- It is.
It's elegant.
Listen, tonight we're gonna go to Chasen's.
Chasen's tonight.
- And then I've got a great big surprise.
- What is it?
After Chasen's, what?
- I don't know if I should tell you.
- Tell us.
A little hint.
- Tell, please.
- Go ahead.
- It has something to do with music.
- Music.
You know?
Listen, before we go, let's have a cocktail.
I made us some daiquiris.
- How about it?
- Thank you.
- I'll get yours.
- Thanks.
You're my best friends.
- Really?
- Thank you, Helen.
Yeah, now you want to give this to Helen.
Honey, don't drink it.
Give it to Helen.
It's just taking forever.
What is that?
I might have to take the top off.
Okay, give this one to Helen.
Shake it up a bit.
That's for Helen now.
That's good.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Hurry, Barbara, I want to make a toast.
- Okay.
Great.
To Helen and her new look.
- Yes, you look great.
- Elegant.
- Yes, elegant.
- Thank you.
- Wonderful.
- Who's that?
- Wait a minute.
Are you expecting anyone?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.
Don't worry, honey, I can take care of it.
Don't worry.
- She can take care of it.
- I hope so.
She can take care of it.
She takes care of everything.
She does, really.
I'll take care of you.
- Okay, ladies, Vice.
We're Vice.
- Vice?
Detective Waters and this is Detective Denny.
Which one of you girls is Barbara Miller?
- Barbara, you didn't say...
- The young one must be Susan Peters.
You damn cops just can't come in here...
Be quiet, and don't call us damn cops.
- What's your name, honey?
- Brown.
- Brown, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- First name?
- Helen.
- Helen Gurley Brown?
- No, sir.
What's going...
Hey, come on now.
- It's not a laughing matter, girls.
- Close the door, will you?
- The door.
- Close the door.
And check the premises for any marijuana or pot or firearms.
- I'm gonna check.
- I do not like the feel of this.
- You can't search this house without...
- You just be quiet, lady.
We'll run you downtown.
You feel like being frisked?
- No.
- You can't frisk a sweet old woman...
Yeah, well.
- Shalimar?
- Yes, sir.
- Smells good.
- Thank you.
- You got a cold?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, yeah.
- Here's a sourball.
- No, thank you.
- It's good for your throat.
- I don't even want this drink.
- Take a sourball.
- Got one for me?
Yeah, I got one for you.
You're like a more responsible older woman than these girls.
- Are you misleading these young girls?
- No, I'm not.
- She's just a friend.
- They're not friends.
They're not?
Why are you here?
- I'm a friend of their aunt's.
- Don't talk like that.
Shut up.
We'll take them downtown and book them.
- Run them right downtown.
- Let's take them in.
- Charlie, let me have a word with you.
- You stay right there.
Be quiet.
They're not friends of mine.
I'm a friend of their aunt's.
- What do you think, pal?
- The one in the middle looks dangerous.
- Her mouth turns down...
- I know.
I don't trust her.
I think we ought to take her down and book her.
How about we book the two on the end and let the one in the middle go?
- You're feeling sorry for her, huh?
- I think so.
I'll make an exception.
You're sure?
Helen, stand back and look at me when I talk to you.
Sorry.
- You look like a very well-dressed woman.
- I am.
- Good background.
Well-educated.
- That's right.
Religious.
My partner and I are gonna believe that you had nothing to do with...
- what's going on on the premises and that...
- I'm just a friend.
Believe me.
But we do feel that you should vacate the premises immediately.
- Bless you.
- Bye, Helen.
Take care of your cold, sweetheart.
Shut the door, Helen.
Bye.
- You people ought to be arrested.
- Jesus Christ!
- I can't believe you did that.
- What was that?
I love your brown shawl.
- Now, let's get...
- You're not really a policeman, are you?
No.
Do you think if I was a cop I would arrest you?
People, now how does Mexican food sound to you?
- Mexican food.
- That sounds delicious.
Do we have time to change our clothes?
Get out of your work clothes and into something comfortable.
Don't take too much time or we'll take Helen.
Excuse me.
And here we go.
You're crazy.
It's a bet.
The black guy over there.
What's his name?
The black guy?
- Take him out with a good punch.
- Come on, baby.
Boy, do we got Morgan.
Place your bet.
What do you want to bet?
$40 and $60.
I bet you even your man don't stop my man.
- You got it.
- Even money.
Come on, sit down, lady, sit down.
Come on, Roy.
We got the first round now.
You got the money they're floating you, right?
$15 on Collins.
Yeah.
Okay.
Collins is a wonderful guy.
Got good marks in school.
I know him.
He just don't fight too good, though.
He ought to be playing baseball or something.
Want another $15 on this?
No, I got one bet left.
I'm gonna bet for your hat, man.
I wanna win your hat.
My man's gonna win this fight, yeah.
- You want my hat?
My Bell Helmet hat?
- Yeah, right.
- Give it to him.
- Here, you got it.
- $10.
Right.
- For your shirt.
- Get in there!
- Keep working!
Get in there!
I think that we won all three rounds.
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.
I'll take the hat now.
You've seen Sugar Ray knock out Foreman.
Come on, people.
Thank you very much.
Come on, let's get out of here now.
Okay, you lay me 10-to-5.
I got suit and you got the lumberjack.
You gotta be nuts.
Why, lumberjack has got to be 2- to-1 over a suit, anytime.
- Okay.
They both can't fight.
- Come on.
- $1,580.
- We're all winning.
Winning all over the place now.
The moon is shining high
Definitely, we'll have to take care of you girls to make up for that silly old man.
But we're gonna make up for Mr. Helen Gurley.
- What's the agenda?
- Right now we're off to the Latin Quarter.
Now, Latin Quarter.
We'll go dancing.
We'll go anywhere you say now.
I mean, you and me are knocking them dead with this $1,580.
Stick 'em up.
I'm sorry I hit your...
- Put her in the car, man.
- Stick 'em up, man.
I don't believe it.
It's hard to believe.
Wait a second.
Put the money on the table.
I can hardly believe this right now.
I'll blow your fucking face off.
- Don't you believe it?
- Will you do what he tells you?
- I don't believe this.
Relax.
- I'll blow your fucking head off.
Wait.
You're not blowing nothing off.
I don't believe it.
We're getting robbed two nights in a row.
- Put the money on the table.
- Do what he tells you.
Please, Charlie.
Wait a second now.
Okay, here's $780, man.
That's it.
You got half and we're taking half.
Take the money and run.
Go ahead, $780, man.
Don't think about it.
Take the money and go.
Get out of here, you fucking bum!
Get out of here, man!
Cut our winnings in half.
- I call.
- I call.
- Take your hand off my knee, will you?
- I dropped a card.
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Your hand is dead.
- I can't help it, I dropped it.
- Then your hand is dead.
Hand's dead.
- Come on, let's go.
- What do you want?
She was aces full.
And what did you have, four what?
Hey, let her play her own cards.
Come on, girls.
This ain't Santa Anita.
You're playing poker.
You girls are sure getting good cards, huh?
You girls friends from way back?
You two?
- No, we don't even know each other.
- I've never seen her before.
I don't care how old you are.
Right in the choppers, lady.
- Come on, be nice, will you?
- The lowest you can get.
- I fold.
- I will raise you.
I call.
I don't want you to see it.
- All right, let's ante up.
- All right.
- All right, everybody in.
- That's right.
Why don't you go home...
You're burying me here.
Get a Chinaman in this game.
- We're falling apart.
- I fold.
Man, I don't even understand what you were trying to tell me.
You figure you're entitled to a free shot...
- I never said I was entitled to a free...
- Then what are we talking about?
When have I never paid you your money, Spark?
- Laying the thug routine on you?
- It's not the question of paying.
You do not pay me on time and time is the thing.
- You know, week to week I pay you...
- I understand that, Spark.
Why do you think you can do that stuff?
You've owed me for nine months.
All right, I did.
Let's make a deal.
Tell him you're sending him some Green Stamps.
How many times have I told you I do not wish to be interrupted... when I'm in conference with Mr. Waters?
- Listen.
You told me four times.
- Get out of here, will you?
- He wants to see you now.
- Tell him he's talking to a thug.
Tell him he'll get his legs broke.
I'll tell him his legs are broken, that's why he can't see him.
Here is the deal:
Ten days.
You don't cut me off for 10 days... and you got your money in your hands.
That's it.
That's my word.
Okay, let me tell you my situation.
All right?
- You wanna hear that?
You care?
- Okay, Spark.
I am getting buried at this point.
I mean, it's been a very bad day.
I understand that, Spark.
I cannot carry you for more than 10 days.
Ten days, that's it.
- I mean, if it's 11 days...
- No 11 days.
- It cannot be.
- Right.
No stories, nothing.
Ten days.
- What if you lose more money?
- Even if I should lose more money.
- You're gonna be able to handle that?
- Right.
Tell him to get Preparation H. Do him good.
Will you give me a break?
- You're going to get it?
No stories?
- I've got it.
I just didn't wanna tap the source...
I didn't want to do it that way, but I'm gonna.
- What do you want?
- What are the Lakers?
Five and a half.
Okay, Spark, I'll call you back.
Five and a half will make you laugh.
Bet your house on this game... lay the five and a half, you get out tonight.
- I don't know, Charlie.
- I know.
If I had an estate in the country I would lay it and tap out on the Lakers.
They're covering tonight.
- This game scares me, Charlie.
- No, don't be frightened.
Now Mr. West, Mr. Goodrich, Mr. Cook's Forum, tonight... they blow the Suns out.
Where do you get your confidence?
The Lakers have been playing crappy... and the Suns are hot.
- Come on, so the Lakers lose two in a row.
- Four in a row.
Right.
And, believe me, it doesn't matter.
- Phoenix wins two or three in a row.
- Five.
Five in a row?
Playing pretty good.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
- Don't matter.
This is the double reverse.
You lay the five and a half... and you bet your house on it.
You've been saying this for weeks.
I'm lucky I don't own much property.
Barbara, I really like these red Christmas bulbs.
You think next year we should do the whole Christmas tree in them?
Don't you think that's a bit on the nose?
- Hi.
How are you?
- How you been?
Fine.
- I was just driving by, thought I'd say hello.
- Good.
- What are you all doing?
- I'm cleaning out the car.
I'm putting up the Christmas tree lights.
- Charlie up yet?
- No.
- Yeah.
Up and gone.
- Yeah?
Where'd he go?
I don't know.
He got up so early I couldn't believe it.
- Listen, come on in for some coffee.
- No, I can't.
Thanks.
Just one cup of coffee.
I'll take a rain check.
- All right.
Bye, Bill.
- Nice seeing you.
- How are you?
- Bill Denny.
What are you doing here?
I checked at the other store and they said you might be over here.
Wait a minute.
Don't tell me why you came.
I'm getting a flash.
You see, I have a good amount of ESP.
I'm blessed with it.
My wife kids me about it, but she respects it when I get these flashes.
Let me see how close I can get to what's going on here.
I get that you're probably back with your old lady... and you want to paint your garage door, perhaps even the whole front of your house.
Yes, I'm getting the color.
It's a greenish color.
Right?
How close did I get?
I need a loan, Harvey.
- A loan?
- Yeah.
- How are you?
- Terrific.
- What's your name?
- Larry.
Larry, I know you're going in here to win a bundle.
Why don't you come and see me when you come out?
- He would like to see Nugie, please.
- Okay, come on in.
Just go on in through the kitchen.
They're in the other room.
- Nugie, there's a guy here.
- Yeah.
- Howdy.
- Howdy, Nugie.
- Trouble finding this place?
- No, it's fine.
There's some crap in the kitchen if you want...
- No.
I'm fine.
- Grab a chair.
- Three, six, nine.
- What've you got?
Jack, five, seven.
I don't know who you know here.
This is Bill.
Four, five, six.
What're you doing?
You're gonna play chess.
I call.
Six card low ball.
Forced to bet the first high card.
$3 the third and fourth card. $6...
Let's keep the game moving.
Three.
Bet him, Nugie.
Terrific.
True love never runs smooth.
- I bet $3.
- Force the bet to $30.
I raise it $3.
First high card. $3 the third and fourth card.
Fifth card six. $12.
- No check and raise.
- Check and raise.
- Three dollars to you, he raised you.
- What's the buy-in?
$200 buy-in.
Help the man.
$3.
I don't know.
How about this?
- Very nice.
- Feel free, man.
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, anytime.
They get me, man.
Don't worry.
Next week you'll beat their brains in.
There you go.
Would you like to see a menu?
No.
- Hi, Sparkie.
- How are you, honey?
Right over here.
- Hiya, baby.
- What happened to your leg?
Dumbness.
Don't play ball after 15 years, I can tell you that.
I didn't know you played ball.
- Actually, I did, you know.
With the Pirates.
- You're kidding.
No, nothing important.
No, I don't want the menu.
- Give me the real hot chili.
All right?
- Sure.
- Sangria?
- All right.
- You want some chili?
- No, I'm fine.
They got great zucchini in here.
You want that?
- Class-A boy?
- No.
I had a shot for...
Well, it wasn't a shot, it was just...
What do you make my figure to be?
As your carry-over I got you down for $2,200.
It's a tough week, baby.
No, that's okay.
I'll tell you... this guy, Lloyd Harris, who's the honcho where I work... he had a very good Christmas season.
What he's created is a slush fund...
You're not telling me a story now, are you?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Come on...
I mean, I carried you one year.
Am I right?
- Was there any pressure put on you?
- No, you were very nice.
Forget nice.
I don't give a fuck about nice.
You know that that year...
Please just forget about this.
Now the point is, this is totally different.
- It's strictly on a cash basis.
I told you that.
- Right.
Did I tell you that I got hurt in two busts, that my parents were here... that I'm getting killed all over the fucking place?
I mean, I told you this up front.
Did I not tell you that?
I'm asking you a question.
Did I not tell you that?
Okay, I beat you.
Ten days later you come to me... and you don't have any money.
You're out of line already... but I extend that.
I mean, I extended it to you.
You said you'd have the cash.
You got things going.
I don't know what you're saying.
But you're gonna have the money, you have a way to get it.
I mean, did you not say that?
What you're trying to tell me is, come payoff day... you don't have dollar one, plus you owe me more.
Man, I've heard it before.
You don't have dollar one, do you?
You think I'm some stupid schmuck you're dealing with.
I got to tell you something, pal.
In my line of thinking, you took a total, out and out shot at me...
- Look, Spark, that's not it at all.
- What is it then?
Listen to me.
I got $700 for you tomorrow.
Why didn't you say that in the beginning?
Why didn't you say it?
Because you didn't give me a chance.
- What about the other $1,500?
- One week.
I'll tell you, boy...
What's wrong, Sparkie?
Don't you want your chili?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.
- What?
- Want some chili?
Sport, you wanna fill this up?
Give Sergio something?
You gonna fill this up or not?
Thanks.
- Righto.
- You know Jenny Carr?
Coming.
She's shacking up with my old man.
He gave me this watch for Christmas.
I don't ever take it off.
Ain't it pretty?
You can even wear it in the tub with you.
What are you having?
Cognac?
I don't believe these guys fucking around the way they do.
Jesus, I'd never do anything like that.
Nobody's even going today.
- You, where'd you get that tee-shirt?
- Playing softball.
- What position do you play?
- Any position.
Yeah?
I like shortstop myself.
I got this neat dog.
It's all fluffy and darling.
Did you hear me?
I hear you.
You got a dog.
What the fuck am I doing in this dump anyway?
You should've seen the place where I was last night.
It was really classy.
- Any chance you could go back there?
- No, classy places don't open this early.
The only trouble with my dog is, he shits on the floor... and I don't know what to do about it.
What do you do about it?
You know?
- You try cleaning it up?
- Yeah, I tried that.
It didn't do any good.
He just sits there and looks at me.
Just some dumb fuck like all the men around here.
Bunch of faggots.
I bet they can't even get it up.
Shit.
What am I doing here?
Fuck you, faggot!
You want some more nuts?
Is that you, Barbara?
- It's Bill.
- Come in.
- Come in?
- Yeah, the door's unlocked.
Come in.
Right.
- Is Barbara not here?
- She's out on a date.
- What are you doing?
- Reading my book.
I don't like to stay in my room at night when no one's here.
We're going to Hawaii tomorrow for two weeks.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we're really excited about it, too.
I'll bet.
Charlie never did come back.
Do you know what happened to him?
Do you want to come in and sit down?
Yeah, okay.
You're married, aren't you?
What difference does it make?
It doesn't make any difference.
- We're separated.
- Yeah?
Who are you going to Hawaii with?
Just a couple of guys.
These friends of Barbara's.
- I don't even know them.
- You don't even know them?
Suppose you don't like them?
Those are the chances you have to take.
You wanna make love to me?
Right now?
- It has crossed my mind.
- It has?
This sounds silly, but I don't have any money.
That's okay.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I mean, I really like you.
I mean...
- it's different.
- It's different?
Why is it different?
I mean, I really like you.
I really like you a lot.
You brought me that dog.
Took me to the fights.
It was like a real date.
I think I'm gonna kiss you.
- Isn't this Barbara's room?
- She doesn't care.
- Having trouble?
- Not anymore.
- It's okay, I'll do it.
- I got it.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
You're taking so long.
You didn't unzip it all the way.
You can't take my foot off with the boot.
No.
You gotta unzip it first.
You're kind of clumsy.
I can get it.
Do you want me to do it?
- I can do it.
- I'll do it.
- It's all right.
- I'll do it.
- What you doing?
- We're going to use your bed, okay?
Great.
I just have to find my TV Guide.
I think it's under the bed.
I think it's under here.
Shit, I can't tell you what a crappy evening I had.
Son of a bitch almost threw up all over me.
Damn guy.
Well, he already paid me, so I guess it's...
- How was your evening?
- Great.
I'm having a good time.
Good.
One of us is lucking out.
There it is.
Got it.
Here, I got it.
Got it.
- Where did he go?
- He's gone.
Darling, come on.
Come on, sweetheart.
That's a girl.
That's a girl.
There.
- He didn't really like me.
- Of course he did.
No, he didn't.
Not really.
Honey, think about tomorrow.
I met the guy you're going with tonight.
What's he look like?
He's dark, he has a five o' clock shadow.
- Is he young?
- Yes.
- And good-looking?
- Yes, he is.
- Do you really think I'm going to like him?
- I think you'll love him.
Really?

...over here at high post, to Meyers, open at 15, hits.
David Meyers, 92-65.
Clay up the middle Shumate getting it out of backcourt himself... dribbles all the way, blocked by Drollinger...
- Who is it?
- Does a William Denny live here?
Who is it?
- You William Denny?
- Who wants to know?
Well, open the door, we'll talk.
- Who are you?
- Friend of Spark.
Listen, I checked with Spark, and we're straight.
So what's the problem?
I'm straight with Spark.
Why don't you check with Spark and then check back?
Where the hell have you been?
Three guesses.
I'll give you this much, my hat is a clue.
Son of a bitch!
Why didn't you tell me you were going?
It was a spur of the minute thing, William.
I had this incredible dream, right?
I'm in Tijuana, at the dog track.
And I sweep the card.
Every dog I bet on, William... wins like a champ.
What do you know about dogs?
But whatever I'm feeling, William, winner.
Fantastic.
Taking down the cash.
Why didn't you tell me?
Maybe I would've liked to go with you!
You don't know what it's been like.
You want to get to Tijuana, right?
El Sweepo.
I don't win one fucking race.
Maybe if I'd been there you would have.
You weren't in the dream, William.
My parrot was in the dream.
It was a hell of a handicap.
He said, "Bet number four.
Polly want a four. "
He doesn't eat nothing, doesn't dirty nothing.
It's going to be all right.
I just need the typewriter.
What have I got?
Packing it all up and moving to Europe to paint?
Yeah.
I'm going to Reno.
I think they've changed the rule, you can't bet your typewriter.
Cash, you know.
Well, a guy told me they got 40-80 low-ball stud game... and a man can win a lot of money.
Sounds interesting.
But why Reno?
Vegas figures to have the same kind of game and it's closer.
Fine.
You go to Vegas, I'll go to Reno.
Reno.
Sounds like you might have a nice shot in a game like that...
- if you have enough money behind you.
- I'm going to win.
- I don't know, William.
- I do.
Reno, that game.
Sounds like a tough game, tough action, William... with a lot of these lumberjacks going up there.
Cowboys, rich guys.
- Tough action, William.
It's a tough game.
- Nobody's asking you to play, pal.
What's with you?
I don't like you coming in here with all your pessimistic shit.
- I don't know what's bugging you...
- I know how I feel.
Let's see...
Yeah, how do you feel?
- Pal, I'm going to win!
- Yeah?
So win!
Who the fuck is stopping you?
Go ahead and win.
- Stop interfering.
I don't interfere with you.
- Who's interfering with you?
I ain't interfering with you.
Look, I know how I feel.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Is that clear?
Because I know how I feel.
Baby, I'm gonna win.
I believe you.
William, did I ever show you my one-armed piccolo player?
The man is a classic.
The man is world-renowned.
William, you got to check this out.
William, for me.
You got to check this out, William.
The man is known all over the world.
Now listen.
Just watch me.
When I reach my crescendo, for me, you got to give me a little hand.
A little applause, William.
Okay?
Right?
Ladies and gentlemen, your beloved, world-renowned, one-armed piccolo player.
The hand, now.
A little applause.
Come on.
Thank you very much.
- You need a partner?
- What?
- A partner?
- Yeah.
I think so.
- You going to take it away now?
- I'm going to stab myself, William.
Get on him.
Good shot.
Fourteen all.
Come on, they're killing us.
- Too quick for the old people.
- I got him.
- Fourteen all.
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
- Way off.
- Free throws.
Free throws.
Get it up.
Shit.
Rebound.
Yours, yours.
- You got a lot of merchandise.
- Yeah, and I want a lot of money.
Here you go.
Are you selling it or making a loan?
- Which is going to give me more money?
- If you sell it.
I'm selling it.
Move faster.
Here we go.
- That's game.
- Nice shot.
You jerk.
- Way to work on the old man.
- Come on, careful, old man.
The man beat you by 20 points.
I'll tell you what.
Do I need a handicap?
I'll play one on one for whatever you got in your pockets.
- For real money?
- Real money, right.
- For real dollars.
- For real dollars?
I don't see no Walt Frazier or Jerry West here.
You're going to lose your money.
That's what I'm here to do is to lose.
You choose.
Get your money together.
Don't go anywhere, man.
Stay right there.
- I'm standing right under the hoop.
- Fine.
You got some money?
- I got $10.
- I got it.
What have you got?
- You got the money?
- I got it.
You know, this is stupid.
I can't believe this sucker.
I got $10.
- What've you got?
- Got $30.
- I got $10.
- That's $40.
- I've got $5.
- $49.
- That's $49.
- Look at him pulling up his socks.
You got some money, old man?
- What you guys get together?
- We got $49.
- You been returning your deposits?
- That's right.
$49?
You got $1?
I got $50 here.
Okay, here's the game.
You're holding, right?
- Who am I playing?
- You got me, buddy.
- I got the shooter?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Hit or miss for the ball.
- I got the ball.
What is it, 11 hoops?
- That's all right.
Eleven hoops?
- Don't worry about it.
- Come on.
Come on, Russ.
- Now beat him.
- Good.
What's that?
Five?
Come on, man.
What do you think you are doing?
The Blue Book gives $2,400.
- But I can't give you $2,400.
- What do you mean?
With this gas shortage, more people are buying little motorcycles... and bicycles than they are cars.
I'm afraid I just can't find a buyer.
The result is official.
No, man, I got to sell it today.
I tell you, I just can't do it today.
I'll give you $2,200.
- $2,200?
That's the best you can do?
- Final offer.
- Let's go.
- Follow me.
My man!
What's happening?
Any big winners?
You like anything in the sixth?
I'm getting buried here.
How you doing?
Nothing?
Yeah, okay.
You just save your winnings.
I'll see you later.
Let me see your driver's license, kid.
Sports Tie, next time put some booze in it.
Trainer Ralph Cripes, please report to the jockey's room.
You know that guy with the mustache?
The big guy who was just standing here?
- The guy talking about watery drinks?
- Yeah, you know him?
- He's a creep.
- Yeah?
Get me a beer, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen, in the ninth race, a jockey change.
Number Three, Fearless Fred, will be ridden by jockey Rick Carey.
Light Touch, where's my drink?
I left a drink here.
Where is it?
All right, forget it.
Give me straight Scotch.
Straight.
You can't fool around with that.
Take them home again, mama.
Thank you, sir.
That'll be $1, sir.
And you got it.
There's $1 for you, my man.
Thank you.
- A friend of yours?
- My cousin.
Watch where you're going, you little bastard.
Stupid little bum.
Handsome, I must talk to you.
Oh, my God!
What a punch.
Stupid clown.
It's the greatest punch I've ever been hit with.
You busted it clean, right?
Oh, beautiful, man.
You blow my mind.
Kick me in the nuts... you break my nose, rob my money.
You gotta be kidding.
Get out of my way or I'm gonna kill you.
Where're you going?
I mean, I wouldn't lie to you, that is...
Get the hell out of here!
It wasn't as good as yours, but I'll live with it.
Enough, man.
That's enough.
No.
You're a man who knows that ain't enough.
Do you wanna level your own goods?
Nose, ribs, cash.
I ain't such a funny man.
Looks like I hit me a round robin.
You creep... you stick a little toilet paper in your nose, it stops the bleeding.
You better call an ambulance.
The man lost the last race.
He tried to kill himself.
Lunatic.
$1,800.
$1,123.
You have $1,800.
Okay, here's $1,100, you put in $1,100 and then we're partners.
We're definitely partners.
I mean, we're total partners.
I'm putting in $1,800, you're putting in 1,100 'cause I'm not going to lose.
I'm gonna win.
That's the last time you've heard the word "lose. "
Exactly.
The door opened the other way and hit me right on the nose.
It's an omen.
The snow is an omen and the toilet door is an omen.
Absolutely.
Hello, Reno.
Sun's coming out.
This rain could have been snow, William.
Very good vibes.
- Good sign.
- Yeah.
Feels good.
Red carpets on the street, right?
Men in orange suits.
Where else but in the USA, right?
But we got to stop off here and play a little slot machines.
Just a little bit, right?
No, you want to get straight to the game?
Gotcha.
Boy, you're walking fast, man.
Good.
Keeping going.
Gotta give you a little smile every now and then.
- I won't break your concentration.
- Concentration?
This must be the place, William.
You ask the guy over here.
- Which way to the poker room?
- To your left.
Charlie, please come here a minute.
Stop wasting time.
Look, I'm not superstitious... but touch Dumbo's trunk before we start to play.
For me, right?
Ever seen an elephant fly?
A little rub.
Okay.
Oh, yes.
We're all together.
Keno?
Keno.
We got to touch a little keno, too.
Who knows, we might get the $25,000 jackpot.
- This is it?
- I think this must be the place.
I don't know if these are past winners or losers.
- Deuce and pair.
- Ten?
William, I think it's heaven.
Hi, fellows.
What can I do you for?
I'll have some JB Scotch straight, with some soda water on the side.
William, have a drink.
It'll loosen you up.
No, I'll have some coffee.
- The coffee's right over there, honey.
- William, you are a straight dude.
Coffee.
Just keep it together.
Don't get in the way of the concentration.
Ace, you're the boss.
It's a sweet game, it is. $2,000 buy-in, right?
You fellows here to drink or play?
My partner here is the player and I guess I'm the drinker.
Hughie?
Player.
Next up.
You're low.
Let's run them down.
Let's start with the bald guy with the moustache.
- The tightest player there.
- Absolutely right.
Percentage player, doesn't take many chances, right?
No flair.
The guy I say is part of a two- or three-man combination.
No sweat, but if you find him after the fourth card, you're not in the hand... unless you've got the nuts.
Right.
Cowboy.
Lyndon Johnson is definitely his hero.
I figure he owns a piece of the town.
Haberdashery, looks like he sells cowboy hats.
He's got the rhythm of the game.
It's his rhythm, but with your natural ability and your strength... you don't have to let him have much.
Keep talking.
The kid?
He's seen The Cincinnati Kid too many times.
He's been trying to beat this game from before he was born, right?
I got him.
On to Specs.
He's a doctor and he's been here playing this game forever, right?
- He'd rather lose a patient than a hand.
- Very good.
Not much of a problem, he don't want to get involved too much.
Red Coat.
Red Coat.
My call is small-time, right?
That's your chair, right?
One-time buy-in and he used to be a cha-cha dancer.
I don't know, but that guy's falling out and that's where you're gonna sit.
Empty chair.
Who could tell?
Bit of luck.
Very tall stack of chips.
A little impressive, but unless it's Claude Rains in The Invisible Man... and you see your chips floating up away from you... you know the game is too tough for us and we go on till we hit something else.
How about Bright Eyes?
Man sitting there?
Deep drawl, Mississippi, best in the game.
I figure he learned to play in the Ku Klux Klan... with a big sheet over his head.
Tough man.
What's the Chinaman's story?
The Chinaman.
What can I say?
Looks like he's a royal prince.
His father probably made a fortune selling frozen egg rolls, right?
When he starts talking, when he starts yapping... you know he's cracking.
I got to have a drink.
Give me a double Scotch, will you?
I'm beginning to feel the pressure.
- You did very well.
- You want cognac in your coffee?
Keep passing.
Okay, he goes once more.
- I'm all in.
- He's all in for $70.
There goes the chair.
It's the one we picked.
Goodbye, Mr. Cha-cha.
I got a straight flush going to the deuce.
- Eight and seven.
- Six high.
- Doc is the winner.
You win it all, Doc.
- Too tough for me, gentlemen.
Sorry to see you go.
So long.
Seat open.
You're on, baby.
And a new player.
$2,000 buy-in.
Purples are $100, reds are $20 and the yellows are $5.
He's supposed to be playing, right?
- He's a dynamite poker player.
- Is he?
He needs to be dynamite in that company.
- I'm Bob Hood.
- How are you?
Bill Denny.
Good to see you, Bill.
Any major moves in the game?
Any big winners or losers?
Nothing much yet.
They only just got started yesterday.
Slim.
What can I do for you?
- When do you get a break?
- Couple of hours.
- You got time, do something for me.
- Sure.
Anything for you, Slim.
In the second race at Santa Anita, there's a horse running... and I need to make a little bet on it.
Right.
- What's the horse's name, Slim?
- Ole Blue out of chute Number Two.
- Ole Blue?
- Ole Blue out of chute Number Two.
No.
Second horse in the second race at Santa Anita.
- That's reliable information?
- Yes, sir.
- The second at Santa Anita?
- Yes, sir.
Great, thanks.
I'll put a little taste on that myself.
Good.
- You don't wanna risk it in that poker game?
- I'm playing right now.
- You're playing right now?
- That's me... that good-looking fellow in the brown coat.
Good luck to you.
I won't play hard at you.
- Let me know about the horse.
- Will do, Slim.
Is that guy for real?
Somebody told me a funny story about him.
That guy usually have that much money on him?
Yeah, he's got a roll.
- That's the most money I ever saw.
- Mellow roll.
I hope William takes it away from him.
Oh, look down look down
That lonesome road
Okay.
Before you travel on
Yeah, look up look up
And seek your maker
Before Gabriel blows his horn
I got a good one.
You're gonna like this.
Oh, look down look down Look down, your fly is open
No, that's not right.
Well, whatever.
You didn't like that?
I'm out.
Excuse me.
And suddenly I banged into this...
- You got a glass of ice water?
- Too hot for you in there?
William, you make a little...
Up a bit.
I can't settle down with you here.
- What are you saying?
- You got to go.
No.
I mean, I got to sit here.
I'm not in the action.
I got to watch.
Let me watch.
Right?
I gotta watch.
You're not telling me that I'm getting in the way of your concentration, are you?
You telling me I'm interfering with your game, right?
Oh, God.
Okay, then you got to lay $200 on me.
Give me $100, $50.
Give me $25 so I can play, get into some...
Ice.
Do you want in?
Yeah.
I want in.
Okay, he comes back.
We're not going to fight.
Put your coat back on.
- Now you mean business.
- I feel like playing awhile.
- Let's accelerate it a little.
- Come on, what are we here for?
- How do you do?
- Fine.
How are you?
I'm very well.
I'd like...
I'd like $1,000 worth of credit.
I have no account, what do I have to do?
You gotta loan on the house?
Well, I don't...
What do you have to do?
I'll tell you.
Then you just give me a roll of nickels... and I'll just kibbitz for awhile 'cause I ain't getting no credit here.
Doctor just calls.
Forty to you.
Are you raising?
I got a cherry.
I got two cherries.
Excuse me.
I got two cherries and nothing happened.
Pit boss?
Let me have a pit boss.
Is there a pit boss?
You know, I wouldn't do that.
- I'm here to win, Doctor.
- Okay.
No hard feelings.
No hard feelings at all.
A pleasure to do business with you.
Pleasure doing business with people who like to do business.
Not many do.
You don't think there'll be five?
I'll say that there will be five, okay, Steve?
- Coca-Cola, please.
- Yes, sir.
I feel like a winner, but I know I look like a loser.
We busted?
We got anything left?
What's up in that game?
- We're up $11,000.
- $11,000.
We are up $11,000.
Well, let us pack this place in.
Let's go back to LA now.
You're my hero.
My new hero.
$11,000.
We're rich. $5,500 each.
Let's go.
Know how long we can live at the track for that?
- I can beat the game for 15...
- Famous last words. 15, 20.
You're here now, right?
You won $11,000.
We could be at the track for 50 years with that kind of money, right?
Charlie, I got the heat.
You gotta give me $200 so I can play some roulette... or do something while you're in there.
Don't look at me like that.
You're not going... $50?
The man's having a good time.
I'm sitting here going...
Wait a second now.
Okay, knock 'em dead, William.
What are you doing?
- Sixty cents for the Coke.
- Wait a second.
He hardly even drank the Coke.
That's my keno money.
One time I made 14 parlays and let it ride.
And every time I'd do it in the bootleg days, I'd take a drink.
And I finally ended up with an old dealer around here who said:
"Doctor, you don't know what you had.
You had that house, had the whole point...
"from old Felix Terwiller and you just don't know what you had. "
- And it ended up by me owing him $2,600.
- Ante up, gentlemen.
And that was back in 1926, and that was a lot of dough...
- and it took me six months to pay it off.
- Doc, ante, please.
You can win that much in this game if you hold the best hand.
We've been playing fine.
This game's getting good.
You just keep on playing, everything's going to be okay.
You talk with your cards and start breaking.
She owes me a blackjack.
I won $7,000 more.
I lost the rhythm of the game.
- I'm going to play some blackjack.
- $7,000 more?
- $18,000.
- Lucky man.
- I'm a rich man.
- I should say you are.
You're being kibbitzed by a very wealthy man.
- Good luck.
- I'm going to tell you, Chester...
- you just hang on to your cards.
- $18,000.
Boy!
- Money, please.
- $18,000.
William, you're...
What a streak.
You put me in the game, okay?
Put me in, I'll go play poker...
- and you can knock this table...
- What'll you play with?
You're going to give me some of my money.
William, I got no nails.
I'm going to throw...
A 10!
How could you do a 10 like that?
Never bust nothing.
I guess you think I did that?
I come over here and sit and you're gonna lose.
I'm having a nervous breakdown.
The money can't do me nothing... 'cause I ain't got none.
Just keep on winning, okay?
Jimmy, can I get a little credit here?
- What do I gotta do to have credit?
- Go to the cashier.
He said I couldn't do it anymore.
What's happening?
Why did you disappear from the blackjack?
Is that all that's left of our money?
All that cash?
- How're you doing?
- Very good.
What's very good?
How much did you win?
- What do you have...
- I did very good.
Very good could be something or nothing.
- What is happening?
- It bounced out of 22!
What the hell is that?
What do you want to know?
Ask me what you want to know.
You're over here, ask me!
What do you want to know?
- Bounced out of 22.
- That's right.
Will you get out of here?
You're gonna kill the streak!
Nobody's drinking this.
I'll bet a Milky Way.
Sorry, sir.
The limit's $1.
You just finish this hand and then you see.
You want to bet a Milky Way.
You're liable to get hungry.
Twenty-nine is not mine!
How much money is in there if he wins?
I'll take $1 million on the field and I'm coming.
Twenty-six.
How much are those chips worth?
- Do you mind?
- How's my field coming... with my lucky Milky Way on the field?
Give me a field on the hard way.
$100 a number.
Where's my lucky...
Twenty-six!
We gotta shoot craps.
William, I'm not going to get in your way no more.
- You come with me.
- No.
- No, I'm shooting, you're betting.
- I'll bet $100 on 11.
Okay, that stuff will just wash the dice off.
Number 11.
- Twelve, your line away.
- Look, maybe I ought to go.
No, you stay right here.
Charlie, now you stay right here.
And we start now.
Okay, we start now.
Okay, table, we're starting now.
I got it, Charlie.
Let me see it.
Nine the winner.
He's got us out there, William.
I never saw so many bumble-bee chips in my life.
$100 chips.
They give us real money for this?
Numbers!
Easy eight, okay.
Eight!
It is eight!
Okay, that's number two.
Come on.
Let's have the dice.
Come on, we're all with you, everyone.
Don't worry now.
Numbers.
Eight!
Give me a pair of fours.
A pair of fours and I'll shit in my drawers.
Put your money on double four, lady.
This man's going all the way.
$500 chips!
I never saw $500 chips.
Seventy-five!
Three 11s in a row.
I wanna bet a million dollars. 14-to-1.
- You making that kind of money?
- You bet I am.
Don't distract the man.
Just stay right on the table, William.
Eleven.
Four 11s in a row.
The man throws four 11s in a row.
Where's my $14 million?
I meant what I said.
$1 million on the line for an 11.
Nine!
Nine!
The man throws nines, eights, sixes.
Wake up the world, William.
Roll these numbers till it comes down.
Aren't you going to change the pit guys now?
You guys aren't getting tired, are you?
Hard six.
You get a hard six, they'll put your picture up here.
- Try it.
- Hard six.
Hard eight.
Come on.
Hard six.
Have you ever seen a greater roll than this?
I think you're not gonna believe what I've seen.
This the biggest one you ever see?
- Almost.
- Almost?
We gotta make it the biggest one.
Excuse me.
Can I put $1 on number seven?
What is that?
$1 on seven.
Here, lady, you got $100 to get out of town.
Give that lady $100, tell her to go play that, all right?
Come on, shoot.
Nine.
Come on, 66.
I don't believe it.
- You won't be here next game.
- That's right.
That's your comeback.
- You are the shooter.
- Well, man, okay.
- All right, I'll pass the dice to the lady.
- Okay.
- You are the shooter, ma'am.
- Let's go check out.
Is that the longest roll you've ever been here for?
That man is unconscious.
That's what they said.
- Don't you go grabbing none of these.
- How many points?
Could you buy us a drink?
Here.
Give this to the sweeper.
- Thank you very much.
- Excuse me.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.
- There he is.
- No, we's about even now.
He's in there.
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
These chips, they're just falling out.
William, you okay?
I suddenly got very tired.
I know, I could see that.
I was amazed.
You walked away from the table and you left all your chips.
But I scooped them up.
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We'll get a suite, a couple of outfits, some new clothes.
Maybe we'll hit the old Mustang Ranch, right?
We'll get a couple of little ladies.
Have a ball, right?
Then maybe we'll come down, go to Vegas... hire a limousine, get a driver, hit every track in the world.
Right?
We haven't even started yet, Mr. Denny.
I haven't even picked up the dice.
You just showed me how to win, right?
Conviction, right?
Conviction and control.
I'm going to take a rest.
You and me are going to rest up... then we're back to the tables and I'll be hitting it this time, too.
First, I gotta empty my pockets.
Just chock-full, all these here chips.
I'll go to the cashier now and pick up a little cash.
You just sit right there and take it easy.
La cucaracha, la cucaracha
Just Billy and me
I've got a fortune right here, fellows.
You'd better call for some money.
We got a lot of money here.
Keep everybody back.
Everybody back.
Have a pretzel.
We have pretzels all over the place.
Rack them up.
Call Howard Hughes and tell him we're gonna break his bank, too.
You can do me a favor.
I got a hole in my shoe.
You know where I can get this fixed?
No, I'll cash my shoe in, too.
You give me something for that?
No, we don't give nothing for old shoes.
Don't drop no chips down on the floor, now.
What do you think we got here?
How much money we got?
I think we got quite a few here.
- I just need a...
... any help with the money.
Well, I got a lot of pockets.
Now I want a very good smile.
I want a smile from you.
$82,000 on the button.
New shoes.
Cheese and crackers!
$40,000.
You see, I've been shooting crap games.
Smile, now.
You ain't smiling.
That's right.
Well, then you tell Mr. Hughes that we're gonna break the rest of his things, too.
Look, how much is that now?
- That's $60,000, sir.
- $60,000, sir.
I've been shooting.
I have a knack with numbers.
I just, you know...
Craps happens to be one of my games.
Don't want to take advantage of the house and win too much.
- $70,000.
- $70,000?
Four, six...
- It is unreal, but it's $80,000.
- $82,000.
$82,000.
Thank you very much.
We'll probably see you again.
Excuse us.
Pathway, please.
No, I don't need any police.
No, ain't nobody taking this money from me.
William, $82,000.
William, $41,000 apiece.
Gonna split it up right now, all right?
Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, for you.
Those people there, they want autographs, they want to take pictures.
The Reno Gazette, they want to do a whole feature story... but I said, "No, we're going to be resting until we come back. " Right?
Okay, $40,000.
$41,000.
Make sure of this.
Even split.
Eight, nine, and 10.
$41,000.
You always take a big win this hard?
Charlie, there was no special feeling in it.
I just said there was.
Yeah, I know that.
Everybody knows that.
Check this out.
We're heroes here, right?
This lady, Norma Walker, works near the cashier, gave me this:
"If it takes a watermelon five minutes to water...
"how long will it take a sweet pea to pee?
"As long as it takes a pair of dice to crap. "
Don't mean a fucking thing, does it?
Charlie, I have to go home.
Oh, yeah?
Where do you live?
I'll see you.
(Steam train)
(Train whistle)
Where are we?
Won't be long now.
The endless trek through the Sahara desert.
See the camels bravely plod through the sand.
Titty!
(Mother) At least camels don't need water.
When I was a child, we had thousands of sheep that died during the drought.
- in Australia?
- Yes.
Sheep must be quite pleased to be English.
Do they have sheep in China?
Of course.
Well, even if Daddy misses this holiday, he'll see Chinese sheep when he gets to Hong Kong.
Where is he now, Mother?
His boat's in Malta, waiting for orders to sail.
I expect he'd rather be with us.
Of course he would.
He loves the lakes.
He'd be showing you everything.
He'd say, "Just look at that scenery."
(Train whistle)
(Children laugh)
(Titty) Please, can we go exploring?
(Mother) it's a little late.
But it's still light.
We won't be long.
All right, but it'll soon be supper time.
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.
(John) 'Dear Father, we arrived safely.
'Mother says I am to ask your permission 'to build camp on the island on the lake.
'We have found a boat that will be quite suitable for the voyage.
'Hope you have a happy voyage to Hong Kong.
'Please answer soon.
Love, John.'
(Susan) 'PS.
And Susan.'
(Titty) 'lf we wreck ourselves on a coral reef, 'we will go down bravely.
'Not that we will.
'Please.
Love, Titty.'
(Roger) 'Please, Daddy, may I go too?
'
(Roger) Stand by to go about.
Ready, about.
(Birds chirping and bees buzzing)
(Cows mooing)
Stand by to go about.
Ready, about.
Roger!
Well sailed.
Is it the answer?
Does it say yes?
(Chickens clucking)
"Better drowned than duffers, if not duffers, won't drown."
- Does that mean yes?
- l think so.
But does that mean me too?
Yes, if John and Susan will take you.
And if you do as you're told.
- Shall I go and tell the others?
- All right.
Don't be late for supper.
(Dog barks)
And don't wake Vicky when you come in.
Dispatches.
It's yes, and for me too, so it must be for Titty as well.
Read it aloud.
"Better drowned than duffers, if not duffers, won't drown."
- Hurrah for Father!
- What does it mean?
It means that Father thinks we won't drown, but if we do, good riddance.
But what does "duffers, if not duffers" mean?
No, you're wrong.
It says if we were duffers we might as well be drowned.
Then it stops and starts again, saying as we are not duffers, we won't drown.
But why doesn't he just say yes?
(Susan) Mrs. Jackson, can we borrow a frying pan?
Yes, certainly, love.
I'm best at buttered eggs.
Are you really?
Most folk are best at boiled.
I don't really count boiled.
(Mother) You see, on rocky ground stones are better than pegs for holding tents down, except in a high wind.
Father and I often used to sleep in one when we were young.
Are you really old?
Not really, it's just I was younger then.
(Mother) Oh!
(Children laugh)
Da-dit... da-dit... da-dit-dit-dit.
(John) Hoist the sail, Mr. Mate.
(Susan) Aye aye, sir.
Here comes good Queen Bess to see us off on our voyage to the Pacific.
Captain Drake, pull the boom down.
That'll get those cross wrinkles out.
I wonder if the real Queen Elizabeth knew much about ships.
That Queen Elizabeth wasn't brought up close to Sydney harbour.
All aboard.
Come on, let's go.
Good night!
- Have you got everything?
- I've checked the list.
Everything?
One might almost say, "By gum, we couldn't have lit a fire without them."
Safe voyage.
- Bye-bye.
- (Children) Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Three cheers for the stay-at-homes.
Hip-hip...
Hooray!
- Hip-hip...
- Hooray!
Bye!
♪ Adieu and farewell
♪ To you fair Spanish ladies
♪ Adieu and farewell
♪ To you ladies of Spain
♪ For we're under orders
♪ For to sail to old England
♪ And we may never see you fair ladies again ♪
We will really, though.
Here we are, intrepid explorers making the first ever voyage into uncharted waters.
What mysteries shall they hold for us?
Dark secrets shall be revealed.
Look, John, over there.
- Steamer ahead.
- Stand by to go about.
Ready, about.
Natives!
(Roger) A ship!
A ship!
It's a houseboat.
What's a houseboat?
A boat which you live in, like a house.
I wish we lived in a houseboat all the year round.
- Father does.
- That's different.
He's in the Royal Navy.
A destroyer isn't like a houseboat.
They live in it all the same.
What's that man doing?
I can't see.
Why not?
I can't see anything.
Take the cap off the end.
(Roger) Oh, he's writing.
Let me have the telescope.
He's got a parrot.
He's probably a retired pirate.
(Roger) Pirates always have parrots.
(Titty) He's working on his devilish crimes.
It's my turn now.
He's got a cannon.
He is a pirate!
Keep still, you two.
You'll turn us over.
(Titty) There's another island.
They've got India rubber necks.
(Roger) What?
What can you see?
Cormorants.
We must be near the coast of China.
The Chinese have cormorants.
They train them to catch fish for them.
Daddy sent me a picture.
(Susan) They're fishing now.
Look!
Land ahoy!
Land ahoy!
Stand by to go about.
Ready, about.
Keep a lookout for a good landing place.
Aye aye, sir.
And keep a good lookout for savages too.
Boy Roger, sing out like anything if you see any rocks under the water.
Aye, sir.
How about there for a landing place?
(John) Let's try.
Stand by to go about.
Ready, about.
Get the painter.
Susan, you come forward and take this halyard.
Lower away.
Don't let's unpack now, let's explore.
(Seagulls cawing)
Might be a tidal wave.
Look!
Properly we ought to have a flagpole on the top.
What for?
To hoist a flag for a signal.
It would make a superb lighthouse.
If any of us were sailing home after dark we could hoist a lantern up there.
We've got a lantern.
- We haven't got any rope, though.
- We could get some.
Good idea.
Let's go look for a camp now.
OK, we'll split up.
Roger, you go that way, Susan, that way,
Titty, you go that way and I'll go this way.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What a lovely place for a camp.
Well done, Roger.
Natives.
Well, the natives certainly knew how to choose the right place.
Suppose they're still here.
These ashes look pretty old to me.
I think we're safe.
Come on, let's fetch the tents.
You'll need much more than that.
(Whistle)
(Muffled giggles)
Shh.
(All laugh)
Lovely.
You can see the fireplace from inside.
Everything's all right apart from the landing place.
Everybody can see it.
Titty, let's go and see if we can find a better harbour.
Oh, I'd better have the whistle.
Oh, can I come?
No, you fill a kettle while I unpack.
That's got scum in it.
Come on, I'll show you how to do it.
We ought to have brought machetes like Red Indians use.
Ow!
(John) Wow!
Come on, let's get Swallow.
Look, all you have to do is put the spout in the water and no scum comes in.
(Whistle)
I expect someone hid on the island hundreds and hundreds of years ago and kept their boat here.
(John) It's perfect for keeping Swallow safe at night.
(Susan) It's marvelous, but why didn't we see it before?
(John) Oh, the rocks go out so far.
John, why have you put this cross here?
I didn't.
It must have been here already.
Natives again.
Or cannibals.
This marks the spot where they ate six missionaries.
Oh, the tea 'I spoil.
Come on.
Ooh, sorry.
We can begin our chart tomorrow and put on it everything we discover.
We'll invent our own names.
(John) Of course we will.
Roger, eat your apple.
Must I?
Yes, Mother says we must eat plenty of green things or else we'll all get scurvy.
What is scurvy?
Sailors die from it like flies.
Are you all right?
Susan?
Titty
Aye aye, sir.
Is the boy all right?
He's all right, Mr. Mate.
You ready for lights out yet?
Yes.
Lights out.
Good night.
(Roger) Good night.
(Birds chirping)
Hello.
Hello.
Where's Susan?
Asleep.
No, she isn't.
And she's going bathing.
Time to get the milk, John.
It's cold.
No, it isn't, it's lovely.
Don't just splash, swim.
(Cows mooing)
(Dog barking)
Mind now.
If there's anything else you want, don't be afraid to come and ask for it.
Grand weather we're having.
Shoo.
You just get those dirty boots out of my clean dairy.
Ooh.
I've had a good morning.
Here, you want some?
- Tobacco?
- No, bless you.
Bait for when you go fishing.
Good bit of perch down by the weeds.
How far down is your hook, Susan?
Just about as far as my float will let me.
Mine's only three feet down.
That's no good.
It should be about a foot from the bottom.
Reel it in and I'll push your float up for you.
John, your float's gone!
It's a shark!
It's a shark!
- It's a shark!
It's a shark!
- Pull!
- Pull it hard!
- Go on, pull it in!
Go on!
Pull!
Do you think it's really safe to bathe in this place?
(Titty) I wouldn't like to be a fish.
(Roger) But I'd like to be a fish swimming underwater.
You'll be like that soon.
it'll have to be Arctic for the north and Antarctic for the south.
What shall we call the town?
(Titty) Why not Rio?
(Roger) Why Rio?
Because of the song.
"Away to Rio".
What about the bay where we fished?
Dixon's Bay.
It's very near the farm.
No, Shark Bay because of Roger's great fish.
What shall we call the place where we saw the houseboat?
in this bay here.
(Titty) Houseboat Bay.
(John) Hm.
I wonder if the retired pirate is working on his treasure charts.
(Typing)
(Roger) Do you think he's the only retired pirate on board?
(Titty) Oh, maybe others below deck.
Slaves he gets to do all the dirty work.
He has an easy life, I bet.
(Parrot squawks)
Come on!
- (Titty) He must have fired his cannon.
- Look over there!
- (Roger) Who are those two boys?
- Get down.
They may be enemies.
Ow!
They're pirates.
Let's chase them.
Let's.
Come on, then.
If they are pirates, why did the pirate on the houseboat fire at them?
- Perhaps he didn't.
- He must have.
He's got a cannon and the others haven't.
They're going round the island.
Let's go that way and head them off.
(Roger) Why is he waving?
(Titty) He's not waving, he's very angry.
(John) A-M...
Am...
A-Z-O-N...
Amazon!
Hurry!
Hurry!
We're losing them.
They must be making for Rio.
(♪ Band playing)
They've given us the slip.
Hm.
Let's go and explore Rio.
We could buy the rope for the lighthouse tree.
Roger, you stay here and look after Swallow.
Beware of natives.
(♪ Light music on radio)
And four bottles of grog, please.
Ginger beer.
(Man) It's a lovely day.
Yes, isn't it?
(Shop bell)
(♪ Band playing jaunty tune)
(Children playing)
That's a nice little ship you've got there.
Yes.
Anything to report, Boy Roger?
A native came along and said, "That's a fine boat you've got there."
What did you say?
I said, "Yes."
Roger, put them back, they're for supper.
Natives are quite good at some things.
You are a greedy little pig, Roger.
Why did the native on the houseboat shake his fist at us today?
Perhaps this is his island.
(Rustling)
What was that?
Oh, nothing.
Probably a bird.
If this is his island then why doesn't he live on it?
Much nicer for his parrot.
Don't touch the point, it might be poisoned.
Shh!
It's him again.
He's winged his arrows with that poor parrot's feathers.
Shut up, Titty.
We'll split up and search.
We'll need a signal.
One hoot like an owl means it's all right, three hoots means something's up.
- Come on, I'll take the landing place.
- Come on, Roger.
(Hoots once)
(Distant hoot)
Swallow's gone!
(Three distant hoots)
Me and Roger pulled her right up.
She couldn't have drifted off.
(Children's voices in distance) Hooray!
Hurrah!
(Child) Halt.
Hands up.
Down on your faces.
The Amazons.
They're girls.
Stand up.
Now hands up.
Before they reload, charge!
(All shout)
Halt.
A parley.
All right, then.
No tricks.
- What have you done with our ship?
- Where's Swallow?
She's our prize.
She's in our harbour.
Our harbour.
Your harbour?
How long have you been here?
Days and days.
This is Wildcat island.
It's been our island for years and years.
Who built the fireplace?
Who marked the harbour?
A white cross.
Anybody could put a white cross on a tree.
Shows it's our island.
You don't even know how the harbour's marked.
We...
We do.
Come on, then.
Let's parley.
Weapons down.
Peggy, you donkey, they've got our knife.
(Roger) I found it.
It's our knife.
It was a present from Uncle Jim.
We polished the cannon on his houseboat.
Shut up, Peggy.
Is he your uncle?
We thought he was a retired pirate.
That's quite a good thing for him to be, really.
He can be Captain Flint.
(Titty) But you're pirates too.
That's why he hates us.
He knows what pirates are.
It's time for the parley.
I'm John Walker, Master of the Swallow.
Susan, Mate, Able Seaman Titty and the Boy Roger.
I'm Nancy Blackett, Master and part-owner of the Amazon.
The terror of the seas.
This is Peggy Blackett,
Mate and part-owner of the same.
Her name isn't Nancy really, it's Ruth, but Uncle Jim says the Amazons were ruthless.
I'll shiver your timbers if you don't stop chattering.
Let's be allies against Captain Flint and all the natives.
You see, Captain Flint used to be friendly, but now he's worse than any native because he's writing a book and he says he hasn't time for us.
If we're allies it doesn't matter who the island belongs to.
You see, there ought to be two marks, but two white crosses would be too easy for anyone to guess.
So what's your other mark, then?
This tree here.
When you want to sail into the harbour, keep the cross here and the tree in a straight line and you'll come clean through the rocks.
(Peggy) He bought the parrot in Zanzibar.
He's been all over the world, you know.
Mother said he was the black sheep of the family.
Last year he came home and he said he'd gathered enough moss and meant to settle here.
Mother's his sister, you know.
Last year he was one of us and even bought us Amazon.
This year he said he was writing a book and refused to join in.
He's in league with the natives.
We've tried everything to wake him up, but it's no good.
It's ended by him forbidding us ever to go near him.
- Did he really fire at you today?
- No, that was us.
It was the most marvelous banger left over from last November.
It was a jolly good bang.
Let's plan a combined attack on Captain Flint.
- Who'll be captain?
- l will, of course.
John's our captain.
- (Peggy) There can only be one captain.
- Then it should be me.
There are more of us Swallows than there are you Amazons.
Let's fight for it.
We'll try and capture each other's ships.
That'll be good practice.
Whoever wins will be flagship.
- We'll win.
- But where do you keep your boat?
You go north across the wide open sea
- till you come to our river.
- The Amazon.
Then you'll see our boathouse, and that's where we live.
The only trouble is the Amazons know the lake much better than we do.
Yes, like those marks in the harbour.
If there was only something we could do and they couldn't, that would be a help.
Got it!
Leading lights.
Roger, go into our tent and get the lantern.
Oh, and bring a hammer and two large nails.
Look.
There they are.
Are they in line yet?
No, the top light's a little to the left of the lower.
Sing out when they're above each other.
Left a little.
Now!
Left.
Keep left.
Right.
(Boat scrapes on pebbles)
We've done it!
This will win us the war.
The Amazons think they're safe from us at night.
Oh, well.
No war today.
- We can row.
- Too far.
We'll have to wait until tomorrow.
We can do something else instead.
- What?
- We can go and explore.
- Where?
- Over there on the mainland.
(Titty) It must be Niagara.
We could get a barrel and bounce down it.
Not today.
- It's a real forest.
- A jungle, almost.
We'd better keep together.
It's almost as good as a monkey.
(Titty) lf only there were some parrots.
(Bird pecking)
Woodpeckers.
They'll do.
They're savage parrots.
They're saying "Pretty Polly" in savage language.
Look, a Red Indian wigwam.
Hello, you.
- Come to have a look, have you?
- Good morning.
(Sighs)
Oh, it's blowing up a bit.
Want to have a look inside, do you?
Folk generally want to.
May we?
(Coughs)
Sit down.
- Do you always live here?
- Aye.
When we're burning charcoal someone has to keep the fire down, like, day and night.
That way the charcoal is smooth and black and good to use.
For artists to draw masterpieces with?
(Laughs) That's right, lass.
Try a bit.
Would you like to see what we keep for luck?
What is it?
A snake.
Would you like to see it?
(All) Yes, please.
- You're sitting on it.
- (Titty gasps)
(Laughs)
(Old man coughs)
Young Billy!
Dad been showing you around, has he?
- Is he your son?
- That's right.
He doesn't look much like a son.
There.
Come on.
(Snake hisses)
Is it safe to touch?
I wouldn't.
Never go near an adder.
Mind how you're stepping in the woods.
There's plenty about.
If you happen to step on one, he'll bite.
But he'll get out of the way if he hears or sees you.
Oh, look there.
A little bit of a hole.
Out he comes.
Like the adder, is fire.
- Are you camping on the island?
- Yes.
You had those Blackett lasses with you yesterday, hadn't you?
We saw their little boat.
I can remember when their mother and Master Jim used to come up here.
They were no bigger than you are.
The man on the houseboat?
Aye.
Captain Flint.
We're going to fight with him.
Quiet, Roger.
You know, Dad, I think it'd be a good thing if we let him know what folks are saying.
Aye, you're right.
Will you be seeing those lasses again?
Yes, as soon as there's the wind for sailing.
What's wrong with today?
Well, this morning on the lake there was a dead calm.
Never mind.
You tell them to tell their Uncle Jim...
- But they can't, they're at war with him.
- They'll tell him right enough.
You tell 'em to tell him that Young Billy, that's me, sent him word to put a good, strong padlock on that houseboat of his if he's gonna leave it alone at nights.
in the pub there's too much talking about that houseboat and the valuables inside.
There's plenty of wild young lads that are up to anything without thinking twice.
We'll tell them.
Thank you very much for having us.
And thank you so much for letting us see your lovely serpent.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Here!
Thank you.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
(Susan) in!
in!
in!
Pull!
Go on, give it your back!
Go on, pull.
in!
Pull!
What is it, John?
How can I give a message to Captain Flint?
He's our enemy now.
"Called to tell you that you had jolly well better leave my houseboat alone.
"Once is quite enough.
"No joking.
James Turner."
But we never touched his horrible houseboat.
He is a beast.
You'd better go and see him, John.
Let's go and sink his beastly houseboat.
No, Susan's right.
I'll go and explain and give him his message.
And he's used my crayons too.
Now, look here, did you find my note?
Yes.
- Can you read?
- Yes.
- Did you read it?
- Yes.
I told you to leave my houseboat alone.
Now you're here again.
- Clear out fast.
- But I never...
And if you've got any more fireworks, the best thing you can do is drop them in the lake.
But I haven't.
Oh, that was the last one, was it?
Well, you did enough damage with it.
I've never had any fireworks.
At least not since last November.
Now, look here, that won't do.
And I've never been near your boat.
Well, never as near as this.
Then who did set fire to her?
Clear off.
I've nothing more to say to you.
I came to tell you...
Clear off.
I don't like talking to liars.
And don't let me see you here again.
Why do you wave your legs in the air, Titty
I'm trying to be a cormorant but it's quite difficult.
Look, there's John.
- Did you see the parrot?
- Did you capture the houseboat?
What did he say when you gave him the message?
I didn't give him the message.
He wouldn't let me.
Did you declare war on him?
No.
He called me a liar.
(Parrot squawks)
You can't get a fairer wind than this.
Can we attack, then?
in naval warfare two things are important, to know exactly what you want to do and to do it in the manner your enemy will least expect.
Amazons, beware.
It's a fair wind for the Swallows.
All we have to do when they do come is to keep out of sight.
And when they do come we'll slip away quietly, go to the island and when they return we'll take Swallow.
How do we manage all that?
Ah.
(Titty) Take care, John.
A fine place for a lookout.
Let me out some more rope.
Tie the lantern on as I said and then we'll hoist it up.
I still don't see how we surprise them.
Well, with this wind they expect us to attack them and do it early enough to get back here in daylight.
- (Susan) Yes, of course.
- But we don't.
Not until dark, when they think we've given up.
They don't know about our lights.
Then we sail up their river, find the boathouse and pinch their boat.
Then we sail both boats back here.
But what happens if they attack us first?
We'll watch and wait for them on the lake all day.
Except me.
I'll be staying here.
Are you sure you can manage all on your own, Titty
Of course.
I'd love to stay here.
You light the lighthouse lantern and hoist it up as soon as it starts to get dark.
The candles in the small lanterns won't last long so don't light them till you're sure we're coming.
We'll give you an owl call to let you know it's us and not the enemy.
Aye aye, sir.
What do I do when I've left you on the island?
It's obvious.
You sail on to the next bay while I wait for Swallow, capture her and then come and join you.
But I want to be there when you capture Swallow.
You can't be in two places at once.
It is the most exciting part.
What are you wearing?
You said put on two of everything on.
I said bring, not put on two of everything.
Pretend you're going to the North Pole.
- All aboard.
- Don't forget about the lights, Titty.
Aye aye, sir.
Oh, oughtn't I to have the telescope for keeping watch?
- Yes, I think you ought.
- Thank you.
Swallows forever!
(Roger) Good luck, Titty.
"25 years ago this day
"l, Robinson Crusoe, was wrecked
"on this desolate place."
(Bell rings)
(Wind howling)
(Banging and crashing)
(Birds cawing)
What a good place for a camp.
I'll build my hut here with branches and moss.
Can't be two tents for one shipwrecked mariner.
Better not.
I'll leave it for Man Friday...
when I find him.
Still a very Susan-ish tent.
(Animals growling)
I'll have to sleep up a tree for fear of ravenous beasts.
I'm not afraid of ravenous beasts anyway.
Time for a feast.
(John) Well, they can't have gone by.
Come on, sun.
Hurry up, sink.
I hope Titty's all right.
Man Friday!
(John) Well, here goes.
They must have had supper ages ago.
I wonder what they're up to.
It's going to be quite dark soon.
(Sizzling) I expect they've gone to meet the Blackett children.
I'd heard you'd met them.
Man Friday oughtn't to know anything about them.
Very well.
I won't.
What are you doing all by yourself?
Well, properly I'm in charge of the camp but while they're away it doesn't matter if I'm Robinson Crusoe instead.
Man Friday, would you mind telling me some of your life before you came to this island?
I was caught by some very savage... savages.
They put me in a huge stew pot and chanted strange songs.
Then what?
They lit a fire under the stew pot and began to dance all round me.
What did you do?
I waited till no one was looking, then I jumped out of the stew pot and escaped.
Were you scalded badly?
Badly, but I buttered the places that hurt most.
(Gasps)
What happens if they don't come?
They're bound to.
We just wait and watch.
(John) Now for the enemy stronghold.
Quiet, everyone.
Are you sure you'll be all right by yourself?
They'll be back soon.
Well, I hope so.
It'll be dark fairly soon.
Wouldn't you like to come back with me - just for tonight?
We can leave a note for John.
I'd rather stay, thank you.
All right.
Goodbye, Robinson Crusoe.
Goodbye, Man Friday.
Duffer.
That's for looking too hard.
Try the other eye.
(John) We're in the river.
(Susan) Any sign of the enemy's boathouse?
No, Mr. Mate.
Shh.
They mustn't hear us coming.
(Peggy quacks)
(Susan) What's that?
(John) A duck.
Stow it, you goat.
Don't overdo it.
There it is!
There it is!
"To the Swallows.
"Ha ha.
The Amazon pirates."
Quite simple.
They've hidden her up the river.
It's an old pirate trick.
- Shouldn't we be getting back, John?
- (Roger) No.
Let's go up the river.
Please, John.
It wouldn't take long.
We know they haven't put to sea.
We have been watching all day.
Wildcat Island and the Amazons forever!
We've done them fairly brown.
This must be the place they call the lagoon.
It's just the place for them to hide their ship.
Susan, you take the oars now.
I'll keep a lookout.
I wish it wasn't so dark, though.
Something's pulling at my oars.
It's all right, it's only water lilies.
It clings onto them like octopuses.
Perhaps they were octopuses.
Titty read out of a book how they put their arms out and grab people out of boats.
Nonsense, Roger, they're only flowers.
I...
I wouldn't mind even if they were octopuses.
Look.
Uncle Jim must be back.
(John) It's easier if you slope the oars down and forwards.
That way they don't go deep in the water and get stuck.
I can't move the tiller.
It... it's all stuck up with lily stalks between the rudder and the boat.
- They won't budge.
- Careful.
Try now.
There isn't any light at all.
We'll never find the Amazon now.
If we wait until morning we might find her.
And what about Titty
We'll go back.
She'll be worried.
(Peggy) Look.
What's that?
(Nancy) It's a lighthouse.
Very thoughtful of them.
- Stand by to jibe.
- Aye aye, sir.
(Owl hoot)
(Hoots)
- Are you cold, Roger?
- Rather.
(John) Thank goodness we can sail at last.
I'm going to raise the sail and reef.
Even Father said not to be ashamed to reef a small boat in the dark.
(Hoots)
Almost exactly southeast.
Now we'll have to tack all the way back, but short tacks so as not to hit the shore.
But how are we going to know how far we've gone?
I'll count 100 on each tack.
Susan, you'd better snuggle down now.
I'll take the main sheet.
I'll need your help among the islands off Rio.
One, two, three...
Six, seven, eight... (Nancy) Watch the boom, Peggy.
Jolly good idea of theirs to put lights on the marks.
What beats me is how they got here before us.
(Peggy) But they went up the river.
They must have rowed like smoke.
- It's unbelievable.
- Hey!
Why isn't Swallow in the harbour?
They must have left her in the landing place, lit the lights and then scooted off to camp.
I bet they'll pretend they've been there for hours and hours.
Come on, let's give them a fright.
Ahoy, Swallows!
Swallows, ahoy!
- Ahoy there, Swallows!
- Swallows, ahoy!
Swallows, ahoy!
Ahoy!
Swallows, ahoy!
Where on earth are they?
She must have drifted.
- You can't have beached her properly.
- Me?
She can't have drifted against the wind.
Then we've been done.
They've outwitted us.
- The Swallows?
- Who else, you chump-headed galoot?
What are we going to do?
We should be in bed.
- lf we don't go to breakfast...
- Oh, shut up, Peggy.
98, 99, 100.
Ready, about.
One, two...
Wouldn't Titty have liked this?
Liked what?
Sailing like this in the dark.
(John) Six, seven, eight...
Nine... 57, 58... 59, 60... 61 ...
(Wind blowing)
What's the matter?
Can't you hear it?
The wind in the trees.
We must be near the bank.
Quick, Susan, lower the sail.
Roger, catch the yard, it comes down.
Ow!
Give me the painter.
It's a landing stage, thank goodness.
What are we going to do now?
Stay here till first light.
What about Titty
She's at the camp.
She'll be all right.
She's got a tent.
(indistinct man's voice)
(Man) We must be near it now.
(Second man) Look at the light.
Those kids are on the other island.
Another 100 yards at least.
- Damn!
- Blast!
Give us a hand.
I don't see why we couldn't have taken it with us.
Ugh!
That motorbike...
We'll bring a car next week.
Blast it.
Why didn't you bring a chisel to smash it open?
It'll take more than a chisel.
I just hope it'll be worth it.
It's heavy enough.
Whatever he keeps in there must be worth having.
Come on, then.
Let's get away from here.
- It's Amazon.
- She's adrift.
No, she's at anchor.
- It's Amazon!
It's Amazon!
- Shh.
They must be asleep.
It's Titty!
It's Titty!
I've got her!
I've got her!
- Hooray!
Well done!
- Well done, Titty!
Hooray, we've won the war!
Ahoy, Swallows!
Ahoy!
Look!
(Nancy and Peggy) Ahoy, Swallows!
What are they doing?
(Titty) Nancy looks as if she's dancing with rage.
What's that thing fluttering there?
Swallows, ahoy!
It's one of our blankets.
They're surrendering!
It's a white flag.
It doesn't look very white to me.
Swallows!
Swallows!
Ready, about.
Hurry up.
Do you surrender?
We jolly well do.
But hurry up.
- No trickery.
- Honest pirate.
Honest Indian too?
Honest Indian.
Honest anything you like, but hurry up.
We're supposed to be in bed.
Captain Nancy, which ship is the flagship?
Swallow is.
Yours was a great plan.
It was luck, really.
(John) Titty was the real hero.
By thunder, Able Seaman, I wish you were in my crew.
Nancy, we must be going.
Goodness, I forgot.
We'll see you later.
Mother says we can come and camp here tonight.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Roger, time you were in bed.
But it's tomorrow.
I don't care if it's the day before yesterday.
Quick march.
Mother?
I think I ought to talk to you.
I'll say you should.
Why were you back so late last night?
You know, after I left Titty I spent a long time on the lookout for you.
We didn't get back till morning.
Oh, the Blacketts made you spend the night.
Poor Titty.
It wasn't poor Titty at all.
She did better than the rest of us.
She captured the Amazon all by herself.
Where were the Blacketts?
On Wildcat Island.
And where were you?
Well, we were up the Amazon River, where they live, and it got too dark.
We had to wait until it was light enough to see again.
Don't you think that was very nearly like being duffers?
Well... it was rather, but it was war and our only chance.
I promise we won't stay out at night again.
Anyway, there's no need.
The war's over and we've won.
And nobody caught a cold or anything.
All right.
But no more sailing at night and no more scrapes of any kind.
We've only got two days left and I don't want to hear of any of you getting into any more trouble.
Names and addresses, please.
My name is John Walker.
Name...
Walker.
- Address?
- Here.
- Where?
- Here.
Now, that won't do.
Where do you live?
in these tents.
Now, look here, stop this nonsense.
You've gone too far this time, I've had enough.
Enough of what, Uncle Jim?
What the devil are you two doing here?
What is going on?
Now, then, Miss Nancy, your uncle's houseboat was burgled last night.
He thinks these children done it.
What rot.
They never had anything to do with it.
- They weren't even here last night.
- We never did anything.
The charcoal burners told us to warn you.
And we rowed over to tell you.
And you wouldn't listen.
Well, what about that firework burning Mr. Turner's roof, then, eh?
- That was us, not the Swallows.
- You deserved it.
You haven't spoken to us all summer because of your stupid book.
They tried to warn you, but you wouldn't listen.
An now you've been burgled, it serves you right.
You've been an awful pig to John.
Young man, erm...
it's altogether my fault.
I should have known you were telling the truth.
Anyhow, I should have listened to you.
I'm very sorry.
It's all right now.
What a cross-grained, curmudgeonly idiot.
If I'd listened to John...
My boat looked as if half a hundred wildcats had had a scrimmage in it.
And of course they took my cabin trunk.
- Was it a heavy one?
- It was, rather.
Did it have gold ingots in it?
Afraid not.
Typewriter, diaries, old log books.
And worst of all, the book I've been writing.
About your pirate past?
Ah, well...
- (Titty) Was it a very good book?
- l doubt it.
Now I might just as well not have written it.
And been more friendly all summer.
Don't rub it in.
I didn't only come to warn you.
I came to declare war on you as well.
Oh, really?
That's very friendly of you.
Why not do it now?
Better late than never.
Or I'll do it for you.
I challenge you to capture my boat at 3pm tomorrow afternoon.
Accept, accept!
Blood and thunder, death or glory!
He can be a jolly good pirate when he wants to.
Well, I must be off.
- l know where the treasure's hidden.
- What?
I heard some pirates burying it last night.
Steady on, Titty.
They had a huge box.
It was very heavy.
You were dreaming.
I wasn't.
I heard them.
It was the middle of the night.
Captain Flint, you must believe me, it's true.
I only wish I could.
Well, goodbye, Swallows and Amazons.
(Children) Bye.
Goodbye.
Pull harder, Roger.
Ow!
My knee!
Which knee was it?
The one which I didn't scrape before.
At least, not the one which got scraped last but the other one.
Roger!
Look, the treasure must be here.
I found this.
One of the pirates must have dropped it.
(Gasps)
We've found it!
We've found it!
Lower sail as we come alongside.
Grapple and board him.
Swallow on port side, Amazon on starboard.
He can't go for both of us.
Fleet will now attack!
Amazons forever!
(All shout)
- Kill!
- Death to Captain Flint!
Death or glory!
Down with the plunderers!
Man the cutlasses!
Death to Captain Flint!
Swallows and Amazons forever!
Agh!
Down with the white elephant!
(Shouts)
Yield!
Not while my flag flies.
Elephants!
Elephants forever!
We've won!
Your flag is struck!
(Children cheer)
So it is.
Well, that was quick work.
Oh...
I surrender.
Bind him.
Come on, bind him.
(Jim) No.
(Groans and laughs)
Don't laugh.
Hands up for making him walk the plank.
Look here, no weakening now.
It's too good a plank to waste.
Shouldn't we untie his hands and give him a chance to swim for it?
All right, we agree.
All hands up.
Bandage his eyes and make him walk the plank.
A clean handkerchief, I hope.
Mine.
Well, it was clean yesterday.
Would someone help that pirate out of my helmet and put it on my head?
A last wish.
Whoops.
Mercy, mercy!
(Nancy) Now walk, you son of a sea dog.
Ohh!
(All cheer)
Perhaps he can't swim.
I never thought of that.
(Jim gasps)
Sharks!
Sharks!
The place is stiff with them.
Are there really sharks there?
A rope!
A rope!
Agh!
My foot!
Are they ready yet?
Nancy says, "Are you ready?"
Almost.
Just a moment.
A rope!
A rope!
You hard-hearted pirates!
A rope!
He's been in the water a good long time.
And you'll never be in league with the natives again?
Never.
A rope!
All right, Nancy.
We'll give you a rope.
I'd rather have a rope ladder.
There's one just there by the springboard.
I mean the plank.
A rope!
Chuck the end over.
(Jim groans)
Well, that's that.
(Coughs)
Even Amazons aren't ruthless enough to make a man walk the plank twice in one day.
Are all my sins forgiven?
If so, after every great sea battle there's always a big banquet and there's one waiting for you inside.
(All cheer)
Captain Flint, we've got a surprise for you.
And what's that, Able Seaman?
My book!
Goodness me.
What a find!
(Children laughing)
Say "Pieces of eight".
Come on. "Pieces of eight".
Pretty Polly.
Pretty Polly.
You're not fit to be a pirate's parrot.
The ices still seem pretty firm. I think we ought to start on them straightaway.
Excuse me.
Here you are, ladies.
- John.
- Thank you.
- Roger.
- Thank you.
You mustn't eat ices after walking the plank.
They'll give you a chill.
By Jove, I suppose I shouldn't.
You did walk the plank most awfully well.
Practice.
(All laugh)
- (Titty gasps) - (Roger) The Swallow and the Amazon!
That's what they're supposed to be.
There you are.
It's jolly well not fair.
It's schools and lessons for us while you junket about and enjoy yourself all the winter in Africa.
I'm not enjoying myself.
It's really quite a hard job.
I wish I was going to Africa.
I'd see forests full of parrots.
I'll bring you back one.
It's the least I can do.
Which kind do you prefer?
I like the green ones best.
Oh, I may as well bring one all round for you if that's what you want.
No, thank you.
Please may I have a monkey instead?
Oh!
With or without a tail?
Oh, with a tail, please.
The others are only apes.
It has been a grand holiday.
But much too short.
Oh, cheer up.
You're coming back next year, aren't you?
Next year and for all the other years for ever and ever.
Uncle Jim, do play your accordion.
Mm!
Say "Pieces of eight".
Just once.
Please.
(Parrot croaks)
Pieces of eight.
Well, shiver my timbers.
He never said it for us.
I say, Titty, it is a long time to wait till I come back in the spring.
Why not have Polly now?
You always said you liked green ones.
Am I really to take him?
Of course you are.
You've earned him ten thousand times over.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
But won't you be very lonely without him?
I have to think of him too, you know.
He is a young parrot and it's much better for him to be with young people like you than with an old retired pirate like me.
He's not so very old.
Come along, now.
All sing.

Bedad!
- Leave it, jerk!

- No, man.
What about, if you had done it !
- Stop!

- Yeah.
- While we were removing the bugs...
- Here I got one.
- Yeah, damn bugs.
My gosh, let's get dressed and go to village.
- Let's get dressed.
- Hey, you!
Hayret, what are you doing?
We love to wrestle.
I always beat my bros.
We always love to wrestle each other.
Come on Hayret.
Brother Himmet always wins.
They've gone...
See!
These guys behave wierd.
No dear, they're just wrestling...
After having gone to Istanbul, they became weird guys.
Here!
They're coming.
Shush!
They're staring at us.
Never reveal what we have.
See, how they got tired of wrestle!
What's the result of wrestle?
I've beaten Saffet.
What else could have been?
We have dodged dumbasses.
Why are you back to home earlier?
Why did come home early?
Whose long johns is it?
Mine!
What's inside there?
My brothers striped off from me.They filled.
What did they fill?
Well, shall I say?
Say!
Oh, My God !

Where are you?
Emine, Gülsüm!
Come here quickly.
Run, run here!
Good heavens.
- Plenty of fortune?
- Are they all ours?
Yeah, all of these gold are ours now.
- Are you serious, Himmet?
- Exactly.
Saffet, we're enormously rich now.
So are we, Emine.
Early bird gets the, err..
... always happy!
My God, Hayret, are we really rich now?
Not rich only, but millionaire!
What kind a prosperity is it?
I don't even have a long johns for my ass.
Take it, millionaire without underclothes.
So, what are gonna do with the golds now?
We can buy a lot of arable fields and properties of the village.
A lot of oxen, cows, cattles and so on.
You ignoramus!
Why should we keep living in the village with so much gold?
We would move to the big city.
Are we moving to city?
Are we going to be like city women?
Yeah.
But, if we try to cash these in the city,
Government may want to requisition from us.
- Oh!
- We'ld exchange them without notification to the authorities.
- To whom?
- Brother Himmet!
- What?
- He have a countryman in Ankara as jeweller.
What is his name?
Remember?
Ali Rıza, Ali Rıza!
He's our fellow, from our village.
- He wouldn't rat us, but exchange.
- Yeah.
How much would he pay?
How should I know, man.
- Let's count the quantity.
- OK.
1311, 1312, 1313... 1314, 1315, 1316, 1317...
-...1318, 1319.
-Himmet brother...
Shall we purchase a car?
Of course we will, man, even the biggest one.
Oh God, which number the last?
I told you to not talk, while counting!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ..
Brother Himmet, don't bother yourself, but...
Shall we purchase the apartment?
Sure, we'll buy it, man!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 4444, 4445, 4446, 4447, 4448.
Saffet!
Are we going to buy a TV?
I want a good watch to my wrist.
I want a fancy nightgown.
- ...4453
- Brother Himmet...
Our wives are nagging too much.
They would confuse you.
You did it already!
Shut up all!
Gülsüm, you shut up, too.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... 9995, 9996, 9997...
Brother Himmet.
- Brother Himmet. - 9999.
- Brother Himmet. - 10000.
- What the hell?
- Can we also find a beautiful girl for me to merry?
We will.
Alright?
We have a huge welfare hereafter.
Ten thousand golden coins.
The sack is brilliant idea, ...nobody would think that golds are inside the sack.
When are we going to head to the city?
Four of us will head to city early in the morning.
Gee!
Are not you taking us?
Are you going to revel with coquettish women?
- You think that we would cheat you?
- Of course you would.
Relax, girls.
First, let's go to Ankara and find Ali Rıza, the jeweller.
Yeah, you will go and forget us, huh?
No way, we will come back soon...
If you ever fool, I'ld fink on you to the cops that you found a jug of golds which's property of government.
Shut up, we will come back.
If we'll not, you can fink on whomever you wish.
Gülsüm, come with me.
Go bring me a good costume to wear tomorrow.
- Why don't you pick yourself?
- Why?
I even don't go to WC, as tough I have a pee.
Shall I leave a sack of gold alone?
Go fetch it to me!
- Saffet.
- What?
You'll go far tomorrow,
Let's go home now.
- I can't?
- Why?
I can't leave the golds here.
- Would you bring my costume here?
- Alright.
I have to pee, bros.
- Go to piss.
- Go ahead to piss.
What if you snatch some coins from sack?
- Don't you trust us?
- Yeah?
Brother should trust his own brothers, shoudn't he?
Absolutely, he should.
Hey!
What are doing?
Don't you trust me?
- Don't assume it as distrust, but we also go.
- Yeah.
Do you also have pee?
We just want to keep company with you.
Gayret, get in!
Keep door open!
So we come in, too.
We can't fit here.
Brother Himmet!
Hullo!
It's OK.
Now, relax.
When graceless people make some money, ... they all jockey each other for a few bucks more.
- Yeah.
We're still so close-knit to each other, ...in spite of we've a sack of golden coins.
We even go to piss altogether.
Where are you going?
Were you not sleeping, bro?
I came to help you...
I don't want to make my dear brother tired by carrying heavy sack.
We'ld take care my dear brother.
- But, we would do two shares.
- Exactly.
Did you check our bros sleeping?
Yeah.
Muggins are asleep.
Have a nice morning.
Hush!
Be quiet!
Come down slowly.
You're outwitting me to leave here, right?
Hush!
Don't yell!
Could we outwit you, bro?
- Sure.
- We poked you to wake up, you were asleep.
Who poked me, crafties?
I woke up myself!
You're already awaken!
So what?
When we feel tired, you would carry the sack.
Should I?
- Absolutely you would.
- Got it, There will be three shares!
Saffet is sleeping, isn't he?
Yes, sucker's still sleeping!
Sucker is you, muttonhead!
Fellow, give us four tickets to Ankara!
- The third class?
- Gee.
Whom are you talking?
Give the most luxurious.
We're not the ordinary guys that you know.
Give first class tickets.
Himmet brother, you've spent all of our money to buy most expensive tickets.
Who cares?
We've a sack of golden coins.
Why couldn't we travel with 3rd class tickets?
Do Turkey's richest men deserve to travel with the shabby people, dumbass?
To be rich is very comfortable, my dears.
If we'd been travelling at economy class...
Our asses would have been chafed on the benches.
- So, have good journey for all.
Thanks.
- Have good journey.
Shoo!
Why are sitting down like that?
Our brother is right.
People doesn't sit cross-legged in the luxurious class.
They cross leg on other.
Give a try!
No.
Like this, you hick!
Like this?
Oh God!
I thought I arrived in Ankara.
We also thought that we arrived to Ankara.
What's gonna happen now?
We get on the next train to Ankara.
We don't have any money.
We would walk.
Can we find the way to Ankara?
Where does this railway go?
To Ankara.
Hey, fellow, what is going on here?
Why is this crowd?
It's republican day's parade.
Brother Himmet...
Shall we ask to cops over there that where we could find Ali Rıza?
Are you fool, man, why should we ever ask the police?
They would make requisition the golds and arrest us.
- Let's ask somebody else.
- Yes.
Excuse me fellow...
How can we find Ali Rıza?
Who is Ali Rıza?
Good heavens!
He doesn't know Ali Rıza?
- Probably he's not from here, maybe stranger.
- Yeah.
- Hey fellow, are you local?
- Yes.
Good.
- We're looking for uncle Ali Rıza.
- I don't know him.
What an ignorant man!
He doesn't know uncle Ali Rıza.
I think, we couldn't find Ali Rıza.
Why not?
If you aspire, you can find the needle in the haystack.
Let me ask.
Excuse me, fellow where is haystack?
Let's walk!
- It's not this jewellery shop.
Not this one.
- Not, not.
Here it is, Ali Rıza jewellery.
- Closed!
- Closed.
- Uncle Ali Rıza!
- Uncle Ali Rıza!
Hey guys, do not knock at.
There is nobody inside!
- Why?
- Today is the holiday, so, all shops are closed.
- Closed?
When will it be open?
- Tommorrow.
We have a sack of golds, but still stone-broke?
What the hell are we gonna do now, brother Himmet?
Let's go to a restaurant first, feed ourselves.
- How to pay?
We're stone-broke!
- Not any?
We have nothing!
So let's go to the restaurant and pay nothing.
My God!
Why did you get angry to me brother Himmet, I'm just...
You are the shame of family, fool.
It's you who proposed to make a good marble grave for our dead father with all savings?
Did I propose it?
...
Oh, yes.
People is watching parade.
We are wandering as stone-broke in misery.
It's only for tommorrow, bros.
Then, we'll be riches hereafter.
Brother Himmet, let me carry the sack.
You must have been tired.
No.
I'm the eldest.
I'll take care it.
Oh, there he is.
My dear, as I see your face...
I immediately recognized you.
Have you recognized us?
We are the Behçet's sons from village in Kayseri.
I am not mr.
Ali Rıza, but a salesman here.
- Where is he?
- Call him right here.
He's not here, went to Istanbul.
Did he go to Istanbul?
When will he be back?
Tomorrow.
Drink as much as you can, to feed yourself, man.
It lumps like a rock into my stomach.
We've turned to walking water ballons.
All have fatigued by severe hunger.
- Let's exchange one coin only.
- Yeah.
- To whom, dumbass?
Is Ali Rıza the only one jewelller here?
We exchange the coins to unfamiliar jeweller so that he'ld rat us to cops to snatch the golds?
- Would they do?
- Absolutely.
No other way to await Ali Rıza to cash!
Be careful.
You'll be run over by vehicles.
- My God.
Cop!
- Gee!
Cross the road.
- He's calling us.
- We're done!
- Keep cool!
Don't let him doubt us.
- Smile!
You can walk across the street, guys.
- Let's wave hands.
- Wave hands.
You can come across the street!
Argh!
Brother Himmet has fallen to ground!
Are you tired, Himmet brother?
If you want, I'll carry it.
No, I am the eldest brother.
Therefore, golds should be with me.
Give us a bagel for one lira!
Here it is!
Are you ripping off us, kid?
No. 1 lira for each, dude!
My gosh!
Take it Hayret, for you and you.
Feed yourselves good.
I'm still starving.
Brother Himmet, I have an idea.
- What is it?
- Shall we do some begging?
Yes, we shall.
Maybe, we could buy a few more bagels.
Never!
Should the richest men of Turkey do begging?
No way to begging!
I can't stand!
I can't stand anymore!
Gayret, what can't you stand?
To starving, I'm hungry.
Bear it!
Tomorrow Ali Rıza's coming.
I don't care.
I will not be able to meet him.
I will die because of hunger tonight.
He called and told that to stay one day more, coming tomorrow.
Tomorrow is too late.
I can't survive until tomorrow.
Grin and bear it.
See how I and Himmet brother've been enduring.
- Bullshit.
- We don't?
I've been starving to death.
Find a solution brother Himmet.
Let's look for a job and make some money to survive.
Oh!
Brother Himmet, I have no strenght to work because of fatigue.
Keep working, man.
Why did we get a job?
Because, I'll take you to best restaurants to feed.
We were digging, while we found golds, we are still keep digging.
Were we born to dig, men?
We are working by digging but for one day only.
Tommorrow Ali Rıza is coming.
Bullshit.
This jerk will never come.
Oh, I'm gonna die of hunger.
Brother Hayret what if we find another jug of golds?
Never mention it!
We're still broke with a sack of a golden coins.
If we'ld find more, we would be screwn up in misery.
Chef, what do you have to eat?
Kebaps, chicken skewers,..
...rice, beans, soups.
642, 643, 644, 645, 646..
- Himmet brother.
- 647...
What!
All meal were good, but kebab with bashed patatoes was excellent.
It's kebab with mashed patatoes, not bashed, man.
Screw your kebab.
Don't talk, when I count!
1, 2, 3..
8340, 8341, 8342, 8344... 8345, 8346.

Don't get butt-in, bloke!
We're looking for jackass named Ali Rıza.
Keep it clean!
I'm Ali Rıza!
Here is mr.
Ali Rıza.
Ali Rıza has already come!
Oh, our beloved!
Oh, our dear fellow uncle!
It's obvious that our dear fellow from Kayseri.
Allow us shake your hand.
Don't mention it!
Don't mention it!
Stop there.
Who are you, what do you want?
We came to, err..
We're going to exchange a golden coin.
Give it to me, let me check.
Here.
Oh!
Ancient Byzantine gold!
Where did you get it?
We found it somewhere.
How much does it cost?
It would cost a grand.
What!
A... a... thousand?
Give!
Take!
Hey!
- No!
- It's mine!
I'm the eldest brother, I will keep it.
Brother Himmet.
Let's buy some good costumes to dress up good and get rid of sleazy costumes.
Of course, we're gonna spruce up ourselves.
- A thousand is enough?
- Sure.
Even more than how much we need.
It'ld worth at least two thousand.
We made a thousand in the early hours of morning.
Boss, I think these guys have more golden coins.
Cut it off!
How could these bumpkins have?
Obviously they have got from somewhere.
Uncle Ali Rıza, here we are again.
What do you want?
We want to exchange four golden coins more.
Oh, welcome to my dear nephews.
I'm coming.
I've been thinking about you ever since.
My dear nephews visited me from upcountry.
I've been blaming myself because of why I didn't show my hospitality to my dears.
I'm so sorry fo my inconsiderateness.
Welcome, here you are.
Comfort yourselves, fellows.
Fetch some tea for us.
Quickly.
My precious guests.
Shall you exchange?
It's easy, I would do.
This's like merry-go-round.
What's up my nephews?
Don't hesitate.
Come in.
We can't get in, the door has kept revolving and threw us out.
Come one by one.
Come in, get in.
- You are welcome.
- Hello, there.
- You're welcome mr.
Ali Rıza.
- How are you?
Thank you, sir.
How can I help you?
We need four luxury rooms for my nephews.
- Sure, sir.
- We don't need four individual rooms?
A bigger room is enough for us.
We don't have a room with four bed, sir.
No problem.
We can fit in one room.
We have no application like this.
But it's OK for sake of mr.
Ali Rıza.
Take the gentlemen to room.
- Let me take it, sir.
- Hey?
- Don't ever touch it.
What are you staring at them astonished?
Apparently they have something very precious in the sack.
- Here is your room, take your key.
- Thanks.
This is the lavatory.
So, do you like?
Room is good, but why is the WC inside the room?
- Yes, no countryman pisses inside the room.
- Yeah.
WC is always next to room in luxury hotels.
Your room has a balcony over here.
- See, you have a good panaromic view.
- Yeah, yeah...
It's very high, I have vertigo.
I have a pee.
Let's go and piss.
Are you going to WC altogether?
We never leave each other.
Brothers!
I think Ali Rıza realised that golds are in a sack.
- Did he?
- Yeah.
Then, let's run away.
We need him to cash the golds.
Just be carefully.
Got it?
Let's spruce up, uncle Ali Rıza.
Don't worry.
I will take you to the most luxurious store, you will be dress up whatever you want.
Shall we call a cab?
No, my dear.
I've parked my car there, in front of the bakery shop.
Here it's my car.
Oh... is this your car?
Well, it's mine, get on.
Let's go.
Go, go.
We've been bothering you too much.
Never mention it, nephews.
It's a beautiful car, my dear.
Seats are also very soft and comfortable.
That's it, are we okay?
OK.
There it is!
Thanks for God's blessing.
Still here!
Yeah!
Thank you God.
Hey, guys, where are you taking away the sack of flour?
Come here!
- Bring my sack!
- He wants to have the golds.
Let's run away.
Leave the sack!
Hey!
Help!
Let's get on the bus!
Guys, to travel with sack is forbidden!
Why forbidden?
It's for human transportation only.
- Who forbids it?
- It's public transportation regulations, only passangers allowed.
Bullshit...
Sack is not allowed, huh?
If you had known what's inside the sack...
Anyway, it's your fault.
Why did you let clumsy to carry the sack?
Why didn't do it by yourself, idiot?
It's not my fault.
It's not me to blame but this jackass!
Hey!
Why am I to be blamed?
It's not me who forgotten the huge sack in front of the bakery shop, but this dumbass next to me!
Why are staring at me?
Didn't you meet any dumbass before?
Come on.
Hey!
Sack stuck the door!
- Open the door, driver!
- Knock at the door!
Open the door!
Bus is moving!
Hayret, don't leave it!
- Oh!
- Our beloved sack!
Welcome gentlemen.
Mr. Ali Rıza has telephoned for you, sir.
Thank you.
We lost way to be back to home, so, we're late.
When the sack was stuck in the bus some might have fallen out of sack.
Let's count to be sure.
Unload'em onto the bed!
Good heavens!
Good heavens!
As a flour-white?
...
My God?
!
What happened, sister-in law?
They run out of the hotel.
Their faces were as pale as flour.
They must have been ghastly upset, since they have lost the golden coins, dimwits.
Wife, I feel bad myself.
Whole golds are gone!
Have a good day, man!
We came for ..., err...
Sent by labor agency for vacant positions?
No.
We came by ourselves.
Good, we need employees.
- What job?
- Shut up!
What do you do with flours that you have?
Here's bakery shop.
We produce breads.
Hush!
What?
Shovel...
You're cooking it!
Let it be cooked, what should I do?
Hayret!
Send the dough!
It looks like this dough is a little runny?
Add some flour into it.
Hey, Hayret!
What?
Send us some dough.
Here it is, catch it brother.
Hey!
Check out the breads!
- What are we gonna do?
- We'ld be fired up to finding the golds.
Make them disappear.
Quickly!
These breads are a little bigger, aren't they?
Are they?
I would decrease.
How about this?
Gayret, send the dough.
No problem.
Gayret, send the dough.
The dough is over.
Let 's go upstairs to help to prepare some doughs.
Let's go.
You stupid, what kind of breads are you making?
Not good enough?
Step aside!
...
Load some flour with Gayret.
- Bring here more flour, Saffet.
- Alright.
Brother Himmet, brother Gayret.
- What?
- What's up, man?
Golds!
...
It's not time to think about golds while the boss is around.
Keep working.
No...
Our dumbass brother poured the golds into the raw dough.
- What?
Where did he pour the golds?
- Golds!
Clumsy man of family, stop it!
Pick them all..
Our golds!
What a beautiful golds!
I think he didn't recognize us...
Do you recognize us now?
Yes, he did already.
Thank you.
Here we go!
Yes mr.
Ali Rıza...
They've just arrived.
They were a little bit doughy.
No, not soggy, sir.
Just doughy...
Soggy but doughy.
Doughy but soggy.
A sack?
Yes, they have a sack with them.
These guys are my relatives from village.
Did you pick something nephews?
Yes.
We picked some cloths.
Wear them so that we could check.
Dressing room is there.
Here you are!
- Would you help them to dress up please.
- Gentlemen, welcome.
- Thank you.
- It's for one man, sir.
- They've been always together.
Please, I'll take care them by myself.
I'm here to help them.
Thanks.
- Listen to me.
- Yeah?
His eyes are on the sack.
We have to keep our eyes skinned and be vigilant..
Don't worry, brother, we'll see.
Your sack was stuck here.
So I just...
Oh, I see.
Let me take in.
Oh!
You all look like movie stars.
You're so cool handsome guys.
Let me see closer, my God!
You have an excellent appearance.
I want to invite you all to home for dinner tonight.
Well, we'll attend.
We'll become acquainted with family.
Hello!
- Ali Rıza has come to take us home.
- Let him wait us at reception.
Don't send him up, we're coming right now.
Hurry up, Ali Rıza might come to room.
Pockets are not deep enough.
Tailor charged us 100 liras to sew this.
Nothing else to do, man?
Ali Rıza clearly understood that what we have in the sack.
Got it, but, since we hide the golds on you why we are carrying the sack?
So that he could see what's in the sack and don't let him lurk around us, dumbass.
Yeah.
Let's go this way.
Our key.
Mr. Ali Rıza's awaiting you by his car.
- Alright!
- Brother Himmet!
- I can barely stand still.
Don't ever touch me!
Honey, see!
My nephews came to visit me from Kayseri.
This's the youngest, Gayret.
My wife.
- My sister in law.
- Welcome.
This is Saffet.
- Saffet, with the sack.
- Welcome boys.
- My sister in law.
- You're welcome.
And this is Hayret.
My wife.
My sister in law.
You're welcome.
- This is the eldest, Himmet.
Arrggh.
- What's happened?
- A burden suddenly collapsed onto me.
Stand up, brother Himmet!
Don't touch him uncle Ali Rıza.
Let him sit down to comfort himself, Ali Rıza.
Are you alright guys.
Need medical care?
Don't mention it, uncle Ali Rıza.
It happens occasionally.
Really?
Himmet, are you sure that you're OK?
Yeah...
Burden has been still with me.
Help me to rise!
- Sit down here.
- Slowly, guys.
- Is it durable enough?
- Yes, it is.
Slowly!
It's OK.
The chair is well-built and strong enough.
Here you are, please.
Don't hesitate.
Saffet, comfort yourselves, please.
Sit down here, please.
Right here.
Gayret, you also have a seat.
I'll sit down here.
Youngest is charmingly cute.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
That's the goods!
Saffet, don't bother yourself.
Release the sack to comfort yourself.
Don't worry.
That's OK.
They never leave the sack, wife.
There's a reason, uncle Ali Rıza.
A good reason.
I had told you wife.
See?
They're dining with the sack on the lap.
So what?
Let them do how they comfort themselves.
Leave them alone.
Ali Rıza!
...
You didn't mention me about nephews before.
Are you married, do you have children in the village?
Three of us are married, he's single.
Yes, I'm single.
Brother Himmet will find a city girl to marry me.
Hush!
Lady, as you all know, loneliness in the city is terrible bad.
We all do necessary stuffs, like laundry works by ourselves.
It 's very difficult for us which is we're not familiar.
Therefore, to live in the city seemed us easy.
But it's quite difficult for us to live alone.
Hey, be serious, man.
So, we have decided to go to village early in the morning... ..We will bring our wives to city, too.
Let them come here also.
It's a pleasure for me to host.... ...you all my dear nephews.
Uncle Ali Rıza, thank you for all...
To show our appreciation for your kindness,
We have brought a present from village for you.
Oh.
It's your kindness.
You deserve better ones.
- Saffet.
- What?
Hand over our present to uncle Ali Rıza.
Is this what you brought to me as a present?
Yeah!
Come on, open it so that he could see our present to him.
Ouch!
What is this?
Bacon!
Were there no golds in this sack?
- It's Kayseri's gold, more worthful...
- What?
He fainted.
- Rub my wrists.
- I'm just rubbing.
I'll kick them out, these stone-broke bumpkins!
My foolishness.
How could I have thought that...?
They might have hidden the stuffs in the village.
Shut up.
Otherwise I would kick you out, too.
Chubby bumpkin broke my chair.
Throw out the broken chair to garbage.
Alright.
I would throw it away.
Throw out me to garbage, too.
I'm an absolute sucker.
Why do you blame me, boss?
Why not?
It's you who told me that these bumpkins have a plenty of golden coins.
- Yes, I did but...
- Shut up!
Cut the crab.
You drove me to spend a lot of money to host the bumpkins.
Yes, but they're your fellow relatives.
Despicable these kind of fellows.
Damn these kind of...
-...folks.
- Uncle Ali Rıza, excuse me could you cash four coins more for us?
... I was saying just love these kind of folks.
Sure, I would cash, of course...
What are you gonna do with the money?
We may need on the way to village.
God!
How should I let you..
...go alone to village... while my car is at idle at the parking lot?
No way!
I never let you go, I will take you there by myself, your dear uncle.
Step aside, kids!
Be meak, kids.
Move away, move away.
Good Heavens!
Look at Behçet's sons!
These rural kids are very rude, my dear.
Yes, just like they haven't seen urban guys before.
Oh!
Hello guys.
How are you doing folks?
Where have you been for a couple of days?
We have been in Ankara.
- You found a treasure, right?
- No dear.
We just went to visit uncle Ali Rıza.
Oh!
Is he mr.
Ali Rıza?
Welcome.
Can we offer you glass of tea?
My gosh, Himmet has come back!
My husband came back.
My dear husband.
Here my wife is coming.
Himmet!
...
Oh!
What the hell is it?
You all dressed like you are urban gentlemen, huh?
- Welcome all.
- Thanks.
Oh!
Who is that girl?
She's my sister-in-law.
Is she?
Come on.
Let's go to home.
Welcome to us.
Thanks, you go first.
I'll chat with my fellows and drink some tea first.
You go with them.
Let's go sister-in-law, come on.
- Saffet has come back.
- Really?
Welcome, have a seat, please.
Excuse us for our humble village home.
Thank you.
Why are you standing?
Sit down.
No, it's alright.
Don't think that it's for dandyness.
Our trousers may wrinkle.
Let mine wrinkle.
I'll make re-ironed.
Hayret!
My gosh!
See?
We have a guest.
That's his wife.
You are welcome.
Thank you.
- Saffet!
- Emine!
- Saffet!
- Don't do it, honey.
Why not?
Look at who's sitting there.
Did you bring a paramour to home?
Are you nuts?
How could I cheat on you?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Mr. Ali Rıza, where did you know Behçet's sons?
How the hell could I know them?
They came to me.
What do they want from you?
They brought me some golden coins to cash.
Behold?
I told you that they've found burial golds.
What golds?
They've been obsessed with burial stuffs.
They had even go to Istanbul and search for buried treasures and golds.
Aperantly they must have a lot of golden stuffs.
Watch out, don't step onto turd!
Our costume are going to grimed here.
- Exactly.
Turds stinks everywhere.
- Yeah, exactly.
They are coming.
Where are my going nephews?
We are gonna visit our father's grave.
Good idea.
I'll come with you to pray for his soul at his grave.
There are so kind people in this world to build marble the tombstone.
You dumbass...
Excuse me father for my languange.
We paid the expenses, you fool.
- Did we make it done?
- You sucker.
Yes!
Argh!
Gayret, Saffet, come over here.
Ouch!
Come to help me!
Go!
I was almost to be buried alive.
A heavy burden collapsed onto me.
And then grave collapsed.
Leave him alone uncle Ali Rıza!
What kind of henna is this?
This is not henna.
- What is this?
- Nail lacquer.
- Nail lacquer?
- Gee!
She did also on toes!
Gorgeous!
Excuse me.
May I ask you that... .. if all women in city dress low-cut like you?
- Sure.
- I thought, fabric in the tailor was short for your dress.
Nephews, where are your wives?
They are about come.
Good, good...
You are right, sister-in-law.
They have plenty of golds.
- How did you realise?
- I heard that they have found a big quatity of buried golden stuffs in Istanbul.
- Fellow, you can plow our arable fields for your own.
- Alright.
Have our cattles, too.
- You make payment, whenever available.
- OK.
Where could they have hidden the stuffs?
In the chest.
Where else could be?
Which chest?
Look at there.
Oh!
What a huge chest!
Here we came our sweet home.
Go ahead.
Slowly, be careful.
Come on, go, go!
We could have gone hotel to stay.
We don't want to bother you, uncle Ali Rıza.
If you had been alone, I would have booked hotel room.
But when you're with your families, I never let you stay in hotel.
My home is at your service.
Go ahead girls.
Bring your chest.
Ali Rıza.
How should we host them all?
No individual bedrooms for all.
Hush.
They may hear us speaking.
Be patient and moderate for a few days.
Until I snatch the chest of golds.
Where are they going to sleep?
- We reserve our bedroom for men's use.
- Gosh!
Women are to live in sister-in-law's room.
What about us?
- Who cares it, idiot?
Be smart a little more.
- My gosh!
Oh!
You have a beautiful home.
Not big enough but it's OK.
Sorry that you're so far behind us.
No, you're so far in front of us.
Don't be bothered for us.
It's alright.
Come here honey.
We have precious guests.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
We didn't mean to bother you, lady...
Uncle Ali Rıza insisted very much to host us.
Nothing to bother me.
You're always welcome.
- Appreciate to you.
- Honey, these are my brides.
...Wives of my nephews.
Oh!
Very beautiful brides for family.
Welcome.
You are all welcome, girls.
Thanks for kindness.
My nephews, we have roasted lamp, after soup.
Feed yourselves good.
Excuse us, for bothering you, uncle Ali Rıza.
If you ever mention again, you would hurt me!
Never a botherness for me!
Oh!
Here's our salad.
Be carefully.
You were about to break the plate.
Why are you yelling at me?
Nothing broken.
I paid 20 thousands for it.
Shall I throw it to garbage the whole?
My God!
Does a plate cost 20 thousands?
No dear, Not just a plate, a whole set.
..Original Czechoslovakian porcelain 144 pieces...
But one of them broken, the whole set would be screwn-up.
The soup is very delicious, you made it excellently.
Be carefully, sucker.
You were about spoil the set of 20 thousands.
Why did put it plate so roughly like this, idiot?
He broke.
Plate has been broken!
You wasted the whole precious set to garbage.
You, dumbass,...
You broke it by yourself you to show the wife.
He broke, too.
I did, too.
Whole set totally screwn-up.
Uncle Ali Rıza, excuse us.
We unintentionally broke a few plates.
Doesn't matter, guys.
Let them broken.
As you keep breaking the plates.
Let me check that if lamp of chest, err..., damn it, ....roasted chest is ready in the kitchen.
830, 831, 832...
Hush!
834, 835, 836, 837,838.
Hush!
Dumbass Ali Rıza, dumbass Ali Rıza.
You stupid.
Hey, wife.
There must be exactly mistake in my family tree.
Hullo!
How did you come up with it?
'Cause, my Kayserian root can't have so stupid people.
It's right...
Absolutely.
I gave my own bedroom these flat-broke bumpkins.
I rough it myself on the chair.
Look at me, ...sister-in law.
It's all your fault.
Oh!
Why am I to be blamed, my dear?
You told me that they keep golden stuffs in the chest.
Why are you yelling at her?
You aspired to host them in the home.
Shut up!
You stupid.
Hush.
They may hear us.
Let them hear.
- I'll kick these bumkins out of my home.
- Talk to my hat!
I'll kick out.
I'll kick out.
9930, 9931, 9932.
9933.
See?
When everybody keep silence, I count accurately with no confusion.
1, 2...
You've bothered yourself to comfort us uncle.
You had us sleep on the good mattress.
But yourself, curl to sleep on the chair.
I mean it's a shame for us.
Yes, it's shameful!
...
I was going to talk to you.
My home isn't big enough for everybody.
You are my fellows, but I'm done.
That's it!
You have to sort yourselves out.
You're exactly right, uncle Ali Rıza.
We already have figured out the same.
We can bother you no more.
Cash us four golden coins more for accomodation expenses.
To find accomodation?
How can I let my dears to leave?
It's huge home, enough for us.
We don't want to discomfort you.
No way!
What discomfort?
You're my beloved relatives.
Check it out.
- What's this?
- Golden coin.
We have a plenty of it.
Where?
Brother Himmet keep all with himself.
- Really?
- Keep dancing.
My God, how I have couldn't figured out.
Of course...
Goldens have been always with them.
They keep the stuffs with themselves.
As he sat down on the chair, broke down the chair.
Why?
Because of weights of stuffs.
So it is.
He collapsed into recent grave in the village.
Why?
Because of weights of stuffs.
Well done, sister-in-law!
I'll buy whatever you wish as gift.
I wish nothing.
Here's the gold that he gave me, on my necklage.
You shouldn't have worn it.
What if one realises?
Hush!
Oh!
My dears you woke up early.
Did you sleep good?
My dears.
Come to dinner table, my nephews and pretty girls.
I'm alright but youngest of us still sleeping.
Night life of city gave us aching in my legs, uncle Ali Rıza.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
Gee!
Himmet, why are you standing up, sit down to have a breakfast.
No, it's OK.
I need to be back to our room.
Wake up, jerk!
What's going on?
Wake up, jerk!
You gave the golden to her, didn't you?
What golden?
He's stolen the golden.
No.
I didn't steal it.
It shown up from the bread.
Why didn't you tell us?
To give her as a present.
Why did you give her present?
To keep the secret.
Which secret, you mean?
That you keep the stuffs on you.
How could she know?
I told her.
Did you tell?
Yeah.
What's gonna happen when Ali Rıza will know it?
- We would hide.
- To where?
In the sack!
They had been already in the sack, dumbass.
We would bury the sack.
We would bury.
Where?
.
Brother Himmet!
Let's bury all somewhere in the city center.
We'ld be caught while we're digging.
What if we forget where we buried the golds?
We'ld bury in somewhere we know.
We make a sign to where we bury.
Ali Rıza may stalk us.
Let's keep an eye on our back.
Halt!
- I told you that Ali Reza'ld stalk us, didn't I?
- You did!
- He's following us, right behind.
- Where?
Gosh!
He's in disguise of a woman?
- Is he?
- You dimwit.
Go!
Brother Himmet, what about if we bury somewhere around here?
Fool.
Here's crowded with apartments and people.
Let's find somewhere deserted.
Brother Himmet!
...
I will say you something, if you don't get angry to me.
- Say it.
- Ali Rıza is after us.
Nobody!
Nobody?
Are you kidding us, dumbass?
Brother Himmet, don't care it.
Let's find somewhere to hide to stuffs.
Brother Himmet, My feet are tired to wandering around.
Is it easy to bury a sack of golds, bros?
What's up with you, man?
- I have a pee.
- Piss it.
- Where?
- Come with me.
Oh!
I've relaxed now!
Cool.
Damn you, suckers!
- Lather it more.
- Cool it!
No one pissed on me before.
What were you doing behind the bushes?
How did you have them piss on your face?
Hidden there so that none of them could see me after them.
Dumbasses came to piss on the bushes in front of me.
You burnt me.
Too hot!
Too hot!
46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
There we go.
Dig here, Hayret!
What if we forget the location?
Which fool could forget the location?
You stand in front of tree shaped like ball which is right between two poplar trees in front of white building.
You walk straight ahead for 50 steps.
That's where we hide the stuffs!
It's so easy.
Shake me firmly, shake good, bros.
Hold tight brother Himmet.
Peek around so that nobody spy upon us!
- Give the sack to me.
- Here it is.
OK.
Collect all into the sack.
Brother Himmet, you took only 5 golden coins, is it enough?
Whenever we need, we come and take more.
This is our bank.
What a bank!
Fill it up, bros.
Hurry up, go, go...
Compact it!
Let 's check it.
Alright.
Perfect!
No one can expose what's underground.
Perfectly hidden.
It's hard to figure out even for us.
We have a landmark here, dear.
My bros flipped their lid to me because of I told you.
How did they get it?
They saw golden coin in your necklage.
They told me that you would rat us to Ali Rıza.
Then, what did you do?
We buried all to hide.
Where?
If I tell you...
Shall you go away with me far from here?
Will your brothers let you go?
We'll go away without telling anyone.
All of golden coins is ours.
But never mention it to Ali Rıza.
If all will be ours, why should I mention?
Am I stupid?
Come on, tell me where did you bury?
- There's a white building between two poplar trees.
- So what?
When you turn your back to ball shaped tree in front of them.
- Listen to me carefully!
- What?
We'll wake up very early in the morning to take all stuffs and go.
- Gee!
What about your brothers?
Tell nothing to them!
You mention nothing to anybody.
We'll take all and go away.
My God.
Are you serious, Hayret?
Will all of the goldens be ours?
Of course!
Hush!
We'll go to get all early in the morning.
Be vigilant.
Never talk to others.
There's white tree between two ball shaped trees...
Walk there.
Turn you back and walk 50 steps more!
What if you can't find the exact location?
Why shouldn't I find it, am I an idiot?
I have memorized the location good.
Repeat it again.
When you ask suddenly,...
I get excited and can't say.
I can find it.
Don't worry.
Never mention it others.
Alright?
- Alright.
When we take the golds.
Let's go away as far as possible.
Why so far away?
If my brothers catch me..
I would hide you.
You don't know them, they can feel the smell of goldens from far.
Therefore, we'ld go to move to Istanbul.
Can't I find you in Istanbul, you, dumbass?
My brother!
You intend to snatch the golds, don't you?
No, I just...
Where are you going with shovel, brother?
Me?
You are already my youngest brother.
You know that I love you best.
We share them all.
- Yeah, we do.
- Right?
- Yes.
- Saffet.
- Emine.
What are you gonna do when we get the golds?
We will go to Istanbul and we live revel life together.
- My gosh!
- My gosh!
- Gayret?
- Brother Himmet!
- Saffet!
- Brother Saffet!
What a coincidence!
What's gonna happen now?
- We do three shares.
- Oh!
- Good...
Pray for God, since you have such a smart husband.
We will take all while dumbasses are sleeping.
The early bird catches the worm.
Bullshit!
I got up earliest, so what?
Brother Himmet, is that you?
Yeah.
Are Saffet and Gayret with you?
Here we are.
Understood, we will do four shares.
Come on, let's go ahead, bros.
Here's the ball shaped tree.
Eveything is there!
Here is the white building.
Here are the poplar trees.
When we turn back to this direction...
What the hell!
A fair was built on the golds!
Did you bury golds in the amusement park?
Gee!
There was no amusement park here.
What's gonna happen now?
Well, we'll go and dig to get all.
Let's go.
Go ahead!
28, 29, 30, 31.

We can buy a lot of arable fields and properties of the village.
A lot of oxen, cows, cattles and so on.
You ignoramus!
Why should we keep living in the village with so much gold?
We would move to the big city.
Are we moving to city?
Are we going to be like city women?
Yeah.
But, if we try to cash these in the city,
Government may want to requisition from us.
- Oh!
- We'ld exchange them without notification to the authorities.

When are we going to head to the city?
Four of us will head to city early in the morning.
Gee!
Are not you taking us?
Are you going to revel with coquettish women?
- You think that we would cheat you?
- Of course you would.
Relax, girls.
First, let's go to Ankara and find Ali Rıza, the jeweller.
Yeah, you will go and forget us, huh?
No way, we will come back soon...
If you ever fool, I'ld fink on you to the cops that you found a jug of golds which's property of government.
Shut up, we will come back.
If we'll not, you can fink on whomever you wish.
Gülsüm, come with me.

- Why?
I can't leave the golds here.
- Would you bring my costume here?
- Alright.
I have to pee, bros.
- Go to piss.
- Go ahead to piss.
What if you snatch some coins from sack?

Brother should trust his own brothers, shoudn't he?
Absolutely, he should.
Hey!
What are doing?
Don't you trust me?
- Don't assume it as distrust, but we also go.
- Yeah.
Do you also have pee?
We just want to keep company with you.
Gayret, get in!
Keep door open!
So we come in, too.
We can't fit here.
Brother Himmet!
Hullo!
It's OK.
Now, relax.
When graceless people make some money, ... they all jockey each other for a few bucks more.
- Yeah.
We're still so close-knit to each other, ...in spite of we've a sack of golden coins.
We even go to piss altogether.
Where are you going?
Were you not sleeping, bro?
I came to help you...
I don't want to make my dear brother tired by carrying heavy sack.
We'ld take care my dear brother.
- But, we would do two shares.
- Exactly.
Did you check our bros sleeping?
Yeah.
Muggins are asleep.
Have a nice morning.
Hush!
Be quiet!
Come down slowly.
You're outwitting me to leave here, right?
Hush!
Don't yell!
Could we outwit you, bro?
- Sure.
- We poked you to wake up, you were asleep.
Who poked me, crafties?
I woke up myself!
You're already awaken!
So what?
When we feel tired, you would carry the sack.
Should I?
- Absolutely you would.
- Got it, There will be three shares!
Saffet is sleeping, isn't he?
Yes, sucker's still sleeping!
Sucker is you, muttonhead!
Fellow, give us four tickets to Ankara!
- The third class?
- Gee.
Whom are you talking?
Give the most luxurious.
We're not the ordinary guys that you know.
Give first class tickets.
Himmet brother, you've spent all of our money to buy most expensive tickets.
Who cares?
We've a sack of golden coins.
Why couldn't we travel with 3rd class tickets?
Do Turkey's richest men deserve to travel with the shabby people, dumbass?
To be rich is very comfortable, my dears.
If we'd been travelling at economy class...
Our asses would have been chafed on the benches.
- So, have good journey for all.
Thanks.
- Have good journey.
Shoo!
Why are sitting down like that?
Our brother is right.
People doesn't sit cross-legged in the luxurious class.
They cross leg on other.
Give a try!
No.
Like this, you hick!
Like this?
Oh God!
I thought I arrived in Ankara.
We also thought that we arrived to Ankara.
What's gonna happen now?
We get on the next train to Ankara.
We don't have any money.
We would walk.
Can we find the way to Ankara?
Where does this railway go?
To Ankara.
Hey, fellow, what is going on here?
Why is this crowd?
It's republican day's parade.
Brother Himmet...
Shall we ask to cops over there that where we could find Ali Rıza?
Are you fool, man, why should we ever ask the police?
They would make requisition the golds and arrest us.
- Let's ask somebody else.
- Yes.
Excuse me fellow...
How can we find Ali Rıza?
Who is Ali Rıza?
Good heavens!
He doesn't know Ali Rıza?
- Probably he's not from here, maybe stranger.
- Yeah.
- Hey fellow, are you local?
- Yes.
Good.
- We're looking for uncle Ali Rıza.
- I don't know him.
What an ignorant man!
He doesn't know uncle Ali Rıza.
I think, we couldn't find Ali Rıza.
Why not?
If you aspire, you can find the needle in the haystack.
Let me ask.
Excuse me, fellow where is haystack?
Let's walk!
- It's not this jewellery shop.
Not this one.
- Not, not.
Here it is, Ali Rıza jewellery.
- Closed!
- Closed.
- Uncle Ali Rıza!
- Uncle Ali Rıza!
Hey guys, do not knock at.
There is nobody inside!
- Why?
- Today is the holiday, so, all shops are closed.
- Closed?
When will it be open?
- Tommorrow.
We have a sack of golds, but still stone-broke?
What the hell are we gonna do now, brother Himmet?
Let's go to a restaurant first, feed ourselves.
- How to pay?
We're stone-broke!
- Not any?
We have nothing!
So let's go to the restaurant and pay nothing.
My God!
Why did you get angry to me brother Himmet, I'm just...
You are the shame of family, fool.
It's you who proposed to make a good marble grave for our dead father with all savings?
Did I propose it?
...
Oh, yes.
People is watching parade.
We are wandering as stone-broke in misery.
It's only for tommorrow, bros.
Then, we'll be riches hereafter.
Brother Himmet, let me carry the sack.
You must have been tired.
No.
I'm the eldest.
I'll take care it.
Oh, there he is.
My dear, as I see your face...
I immediately recognized you.
Have you recognized us?
We are the Behçet's sons from village in Kayseri.
I am not mr.
Ali Rıza, but a salesman here.
- Where is he?
- Call him right here.
He's not here, went to Istanbul.
Did he go to Istanbul?
When will he be back?
Tomorrow.
Drink as much as you can, to feed yourself, man.
It lumps like a rock into my stomach.
We've turned to walking water ballons.
All have fatigued by severe hunger.
- Let's exchange one coin only.
- Yeah.
- To whom, dumbass?
Is Ali Rıza the only one jewelller here?
We exchange the coins to unfamiliar jeweller so that he'ld rat us to cops to snatch the golds?
- Would they do?
- Absolutely.
No other way to await Ali Rıza to cash!
Be careful.
You'll be run over by vehicles.
- My God.
Cop!
- Gee!
Cross the road.
- He's calling us.
- We're done!
- Keep cool!
Don't let him doubt us.
- Smile!
You can walk across the street, guys.
- Let's wave hands.
- Wave hands.
You can come across the street!
Argh!
Brother Himmet has fallen to ground!
Are you tired, Himmet brother?
If you want, I'll carry it.
No, I am the eldest brother.
Therefore, golds should be with me.
Give us a bagel for one lira!
Here it is!
Are you ripping off us, kid?
No. 1 lira for each, dude!
My gosh!
Take it Hayret, for you and you.
Feed yourselves good.
I'm still starving.
Brother Himmet, I have an idea.
- What is it?
- Shall we do some begging?
Yes, we shall.
Maybe, we could buy a few more bagels.
Never!
Should the richest men of Turkey do begging?
No way to begging!
I can't stand!
I can't stand anymore!
Gayret, what can't you stand?
To starving, I'm hungry.
Bear it!
Tomorrow Ali Rıza's coming.
I don't care.
I will not be able to meet him.
I will die because of hunger tonight.
He called and told that to stay one day more, coming tomorrow.
Tomorrow is too late.
I can't survive until tomorrow.
Grin and bear it.
See how I and Himmet brother've been enduring.
- Bullshit.
- We don't?
I've been starving to death.
Find a solution brother Himmet.
Let's look for a job and make some money to survive.
Oh!
Brother Himmet, I have no strenght to work because of fatigue.
Keep working, man.
Why did we get a job?
Because, I'll take you to best restaurants to feed.
We were digging, while we found golds, we are still keep digging.
Were we born to dig, men?
We are working by digging but for one day only.
Tommorrow Ali Rıza is coming.
Bullshit.
This jerk will never come.
Oh, I'm gonna die of hunger.
Brother Hayret what if we find another jug of golds?
Never mention it!
We're still broke with a sack of a golden coins.
If we'ld find more, we would be screwn up in misery.
Chef, what do you have to eat?
Kebaps, chicken skewers,..
...rice, beans, soups.
642, 643, 644, 645, 646..
- Himmet brother.
- 647...
What!
All meal were good, but kebab with bashed patatoes was excellent.
It's kebab with mashed patatoes, not bashed, man.
Screw your kebab.
Don't talk, when I count!

Why are you yelling at in the shop, dudes?
Don't get butt-in, bloke!
We're looking for jackass named Ali Rıza.
Keep it clean!
I'm Ali Rıza!
Here is mr.
Ali Rıza.
Ali Rıza has already come!
Oh, our beloved!
Oh, our dear fellow uncle!
It's obvious that our dear fellow from Kayseri.
Allow us shake your hand.
Don't mention it!
Don't mention it!
Stop there.
Who are you, what do you want?
We came to, err..
We're going to exchange a golden coin.
Give it to me, let me check.
Here.
Oh!
Ancient Byzantine gold!
Where did you get it?
We found it somewhere.
How much does it cost?
It would cost a grand.
What!
A... a... thousand?
Give!
Take!
Hey!
- No!
- It's mine!
I'm the eldest brother, I will keep it.
Brother Himmet.
Let's buy some good costumes to dress up good and get rid of sleazy costumes.
Of course, we're gonna spruce up ourselves.
- A thousand is enough?
- Sure.
Even more than how much we need.
It'ld worth at least two thousand.
We made a thousand in the early hours of morning.
Boss, I think these guys have more golden coins.
Cut it off!
How could these bumpkins have?
Obviously they have got from somewhere.
Uncle Ali Rıza, here we are again.
What do you want?
We want to exchange four golden coins more.
Oh, welcome to my dear nephews.
I'm coming.
I've been thinking about you ever since.
My dear nephews visited me from upcountry.
I've been blaming myself because of why I didn't show my hospitality to my dears.
I'm so sorry fo my inconsiderateness.
Welcome, here you are.
Comfort yourselves, fellows.
Fetch some tea for us.
Quickly.
My precious guests.
Shall you exchange?
It's easy, I would do.
This's like merry-go-round.
What's up my nephews?
Don't hesitate.
Come in.
We can't get in, the door has kept revolving and threw us out.
Come one by one.
Come in, get in.
- You are welcome.
- Hello, there.
- You're welcome mr.
Ali Rıza.
- How are you?
Thank you, sir.
How can I help you?
We need four luxury rooms for my nephews.
- Sure, sir.
- We don't need four individual rooms?
A bigger room is enough for us.
We don't have a room with four bed, sir.
No problem.
We can fit in one room.
We have no application like this.
But it's OK for sake of mr.
Ali Rıza.
Take the gentlemen to room.
- Let me take it, sir.
- Hey?
- Don't ever touch it.
What are you staring at them astonished?
Apparently they have something very precious in the sack.
- Here is your room, take your key.
- Thanks.
This is the lavatory.
So, do you like?
Room is good, but why is the WC inside the room?
- Yes, no countryman pisses inside the room.
- Yeah.
WC is always next to room in luxury hotels.
Your room has a balcony over here.
- See, you have a good panaromic view.
- Yeah, yeah...
It's very high, I have vertigo.
I have a pee.
Let's go and piss.
Are you going to WC altogether?
We never leave each other.
Brothers!
I think Ali Rıza realised that golds are in a sack.
- Did he?
- Yeah.
Then, let's run away.
We need him to cash the golds.
Just be carefully.
Got it?
Let's spruce up, uncle Ali Rıza.
Don't worry.
I will take you to the most luxurious store, you will be dress up whatever you want.
Shall we call a cab?
No, my dear.
I've parked my car there, in front of the bakery shop.
Here it's my car.
Oh... is this your car?
Well, it's mine, get on.
Let's go.
Go, go.
We've been bothering you too much.
Never mention it, nephews.
It's a beautiful car, my dear.
Seats are also very soft and comfortable.
That's it, are we okay?
OK.
There it is!
Thanks for God's blessing.
Still here!
Yeah!
Thank you God.
Hey, guys, where are you taking away the sack of flour?
Come here!
- Bring my sack!
- He wants to have the golds.
Let's run away.
Leave the sack!
Hey!
Help!
Let's get on the bus!
Guys, to travel with sack is forbidden!
Why forbidden?
It's for human transportation only.
- Who forbids it?
- It's public transportation regulations, only passangers allowed.
Bullshit...
Sack is not allowed, huh?
If you had known what's inside the sack...
Anyway, it's your fault.
Why did you let clumsy to carry the sack?
Why didn't do it by yourself, idiot?
It's not my fault.
It's not me to blame but this jackass!
Hey!
Why am I to be blamed?
It's not me who forgotten the huge sack in front of the bakery shop, but this dumbass next to me!
Why are staring at me?
Didn't you meet any dumbass before?
Come on.
Hey!
Sack stuck the door!
- Open the door, driver!
- Knock at the door!
Open the door!
Bus is moving!
Hayret, don't leave it!
- Oh!
- Our beloved sack!
Welcome gentlemen.
Mr. Ali Rıza has telephoned for you, sir.
Thank you.
We lost way to be back to home, so, we're late.
When the sack was stuck in the bus some might have fallen out of sack.
Let's count to be sure.
Unload'em onto the bed!
Good heavens!
Good heavens!
As a flour-white?
...
My God?
!
What happened, sister-in law?
They run out of the hotel.
Their faces were as pale as flour.
They must have been ghastly upset, since they have lost the golden coins, dimwits.
Wife, I feel bad myself.
Whole golds are gone!
Have a good day, man!
We came for ..., err...
Sent by labor agency for vacant positions?
No.
We came by ourselves.
Good, we need employees.
- What job?
- Shut up!
What do you do with flours that you have?
Here's bakery shop.
We produce breads.
Hush!
What?
Shovel...
You're cooking it!
Let it be cooked, what should I do?
Hayret!
Send the dough!
It looks like this dough is a little runny?
Add some flour into it.
Hey, Hayret!
What?
Send us some dough.
Here it is, catch it brother.
Hey!
Check out the breads!
- What are we gonna do?
- We'ld be fired up to finding the golds.
Make them disappear.
Quickly!
These breads are a little bigger, aren't they?
Are they?
I would decrease.
How about this?
Gayret, send the dough.
No problem.
Gayret, send the dough.
The dough is over.
Let 's go upstairs to help to prepare some doughs.
Let's go.
You stupid, what kind of breads are you making?
Not good enough?
Step aside!
...
Load some flour with Gayret.
- Bring here more flour, Saffet.
- Alright.
Brother Himmet, brother Gayret.
- What?
- What's up, man?
Golds!
...
It's not time to think about golds while the boss is around.
Keep working.
No...
Our dumbass brother poured the golds into the raw dough.
- What?
Where did he pour the golds?
- Golds!
Clumsy man of family, stop it!
Pick them all..
Our golds!
What a beautiful golds!
I think he didn't recognize us...
Do you recognize us now?
Yes, he did already.
Thank you.
Here we go!
Yes mr.
Ali Rıza...
They've just arrived.
They were a little bit doughy.
No, not soggy, sir.
Just doughy...
Soggy but doughy.
Doughy but soggy.
A sack?
Yes, they have a sack with them.
These guys are my relatives from village.
Did you pick something nephews?
Yes.
We picked some cloths.
Wear them so that we could check.
Dressing room is there.
Here you are!
- Would you help them to dress up please.
- Gentlemen, welcome.
- Thank you.
- It's for one man, sir.
- They've been always together.
Please, I'll take care them by myself.
I'm here to help them.
Thanks.
- Listen to me.
- Yeah?
His eyes are on the sack.
We have to keep our eyes skinned and be vigilant..
Don't worry, brother, we'll see.
Your sack was stuck here.
So I just...
Oh, I see.
Let me take in.
Oh!
You all look like movie stars.
You're so cool handsome guys.
Let me see closer, my God!
You have an excellent appearance.
I want to invite you all to home for dinner tonight.
Well, we'll attend.
We'll become acquainted with family.
Hello!
- Ali Rıza has come to take us home.
- Let him wait us at reception.
Don't send him up, we're coming right now.
Hurry up, Ali Rıza might come to room.
Pockets are not deep enough.
Tailor charged us 100 liras to sew this.
Nothing else to do, man?
Ali Rıza clearly understood that what we have in the sack.
Got it, but, since we hide the golds on you why we are carrying the sack?
So that he could see what's in the sack and don't let him lurk around us, dumbass.
Yeah.
Let's go this way.
Our key.
Mr. Ali Rıza's awaiting you by his car.
- Alright!
- Brother Himmet!
- I can barely stand still.
Don't ever touch me!
Honey, see!
My nephews came to visit me from Kayseri.
This's the youngest, Gayret.
My wife.
- My sister in law.
- Welcome.
This is Saffet.
- Saffet, with the sack.
- Welcome boys.
- My sister in law.
- You're welcome.
And this is Hayret.
My wife.
My sister in law.
You're welcome.
- This is the eldest, Himmet.
Arrggh.
- What's happened?
- A burden suddenly collapsed onto me.
Stand up, brother Himmet!
Don't touch him uncle Ali Rıza.
Let him sit down to comfort himself, Ali Rıza.
Are you alright guys.
Need medical care?
Don't mention it, uncle Ali Rıza.
It happens occasionally.
Really?
Himmet, are you sure that you're OK?
Yeah...
Burden has been still with me.
Help me to rise!
- Sit down here.
- Slowly, guys.
- Is it durable enough?
- Yes, it is.
Slowly!
It's OK.
The chair is well-built and strong enough.
Here you are, please.
Don't hesitate.
Saffet, comfort yourselves, please.
Sit down here, please.
Right here.
Gayret, you also have a seat.
I'll sit down here.
Youngest is charmingly cute.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
That's the goods!
Saffet, don't bother yourself.
Release the sack to comfort yourself.
Don't worry.
That's OK.
They never leave the sack, wife.
There's a reason, uncle Ali Rıza.
A good reason.
I had told you wife.
See?
They're dining with the sack on the lap.
So what?
Let them do how they comfort themselves.
Leave them alone.
Ali Rıza!
...
You didn't mention me about nephews before.
Are you married, do you have children in the village?
Three of us are married, he's single.
Yes, I'm single.
Brother Himmet will find a city girl to marry me.
Hush!
Lady, as you all know, loneliness in the city is terrible bad.
We all do necessary stuffs, like laundry works by ourselves.
It 's very difficult for us which is we're not familiar.
Therefore, to live in the city seemed us easy.
But it's quite difficult for us to live alone.
Hey, be serious, man.
So, we have decided to go to village early in the morning... ..We will bring our wives to city, too.
Let them come here also.
It's a pleasure for me to host.... ...you all my dear nephews.
Uncle Ali Rıza, thank you for all...
To show our appreciation for your kindness,
We have brought a present from village for you.
Oh.
It's your kindness.
You deserve better ones.
- Saffet.
- What?
Hand over our present to uncle Ali Rıza.
Is this what you brought to me as a present?
Yeah!
Come on, open it so that he could see our present to him.
Ouch!
What is this?
Bacon!
Were there no golds in this sack?
- It's Kayseri's gold, more worthful...
- What?
He fainted.
- Rub my wrists.
- I'm just rubbing.
I'll kick them out, these stone-broke bumpkins!
My foolishness.
How could I have thought that...?
They might have hidden the stuffs in the village.
Shut up.
Otherwise I would kick you out, too.
Chubby bumpkin broke my chair.
Throw out the broken chair to garbage.
Alright.
I would throw it away.
Throw out me to garbage, too.
I'm an absolute sucker.
Why do you blame me, boss?
Why not?
It's you who told me that these bumpkins have a plenty of golden coins.
- Yes, I did but...
- Shut up!
Cut the crab.
You drove me to spend a lot of money to host the bumpkins.
Yes, but they're your fellow relatives.
Despicable these kind of fellows.
Damn these kind of...
-...folks.
- Uncle Ali Rıza, excuse me could you cash four coins more for us?
... I was saying just love these kind of folks.
Sure, I would cash, of course...
What are you gonna do with the money?
We may need on the way to village.
God!
How should I let you..
...go alone to village... while my car is at idle at the parking lot?
No way!
I never let you go, I will take you there by myself, your dear uncle.
Step aside, kids!
Be meak, kids.
Move away, move away.
Good Heavens!
Look at Behçet's sons!
These rural kids are very rude, my dear.
Yes, just like they haven't seen urban guys before.
Oh!
Hello guys.
How are you doing folks?
Where have you been for a couple of days?
We have been in Ankara.
- You found a treasure, right?
- No dear.
We just went to visit uncle Ali Rıza.
Oh!
Is he mr.
Ali Rıza?
Welcome.
Can we offer you glass of tea?
My gosh, Himmet has come back!
My husband came back.
My dear husband.
Here my wife is coming.
Himmet!
...
Oh!
What the hell is it?
You all dressed like you are urban gentlemen, huh?
- Welcome all.
- Thanks.
Oh!
Who is that girl?
She's my sister-in-law.
Is she?
Come on.
Let's go to home.
Welcome to us.
Thanks, you go first.
I'll chat with my fellows and drink some tea first.
You go with them.
Let's go sister-in-law, come on.
- Saffet has come back.
- Really?
Welcome, have a seat, please.
Excuse us for our humble village home.
Thank you.
Why are you standing?
Sit down.
No, it's alright.
Don't think that it's for dandyness.
Our trousers may wrinkle.
Let mine wrinkle.
I'll make re-ironed.
Hayret!
My gosh!
See?
We have a guest.
That's his wife.
You are welcome.
Thank you.
- Saffet!
- Emine!
- Saffet!
- Don't do it, honey.
Why not?
Look at who's sitting there.
Did you bring a paramour to home?
Are you nuts?
How could I cheat on you?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Mr. Ali Rıza, where did you know Behçet's sons?
How the hell could I know them?
They came to me.
What do they want from you?
They brought me some golden coins to cash.
Behold?
I told you that they've found burial golds.
What golds?
They've been obsessed with burial stuffs.
They had even go to Istanbul and search for buried treasures and golds.
Aperantly they must have a lot of golden stuffs.
Watch out, don't step onto turd!
Our costume are going to grimed here.
- Exactly.
Turds stinks everywhere.
- Yeah, exactly.
They are coming.
Where are my going nephews?
We are gonna visit our father's grave.
Good idea.
I'll come with you to pray for his soul at his grave.
There are so kind people in this world to build marble the tombstone.
You dumbass...
Excuse me father for my languange.
We paid the expenses, you fool.
- Did we make it done?
- You sucker.
Yes!
Argh!
Gayret, Saffet, come over here.
Ouch!
Come to help me!
Go!
I was almost to be buried alive.
A heavy burden collapsed onto me.
And then grave collapsed.
Leave him alone uncle Ali Rıza!
What kind of henna is this?
This is not henna.
- What is this?
- Nail lacquer.
- Nail lacquer?
- Gee!
She did also on toes!
Gorgeous!
Excuse me.
May I ask you that... .. if all women in city dress low-cut like you?
- Sure.
- I thought, fabric in the tailor was short for your dress.
Nephews, where are your wives?
They are about come.
Good, good...
You are right, sister-in-law.
They have plenty of golds.
- How did you realise?
- I heard that they have found a big quatity of buried golden stuffs in Istanbul.
- Fellow, you can plow our arable fields for your own.
- Alright.
Have our cattles, too.
- You make payment, whenever available.
- OK.
Where could they have hidden the stuffs?
In the chest.
Where else could be?
Which chest?
Look at there.
Oh!
What a huge chest!
Here we came our sweet home.
Go ahead.
Slowly, be careful.
Come on, go, go!
We could have gone hotel to stay.
We don't want to bother you, uncle Ali Rıza.
If you had been alone, I would have booked hotel room.
But when you're with your families, I never let you stay in hotel.
My home is at your service.
Go ahead girls.
Bring your chest.
Ali Rıza.
How should we host them all?
No individual bedrooms for all.
Hush.
They may hear us speaking.
Be patient and moderate for a few days.
Until I snatch the chest of golds.
Where are they going to sleep?
- We reserve our bedroom for men's use.
- Gosh!
Women are to live in sister-in-law's room.
What about us?
- Who cares it, idiot?
Be smart a little more.
- My gosh!
Oh!
You have a beautiful home.
Not big enough but it's OK.
Sorry that you're so far behind us.
No, you're so far in front of us.
Don't be bothered for us.
It's alright.
Come here honey.
We have precious guests.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
We didn't mean to bother you, lady...
Uncle Ali Rıza insisted very much to host us.
Nothing to bother me.
You're always welcome.
- Appreciate to you.
- Honey, these are my brides.
...Wives of my nephews.
Oh!
Very beautiful brides for family.
Welcome.
You are all welcome, girls.
Thanks for kindness.
My nephews, we have roasted lamp, after soup.
Feed yourselves good.
Excuse us, for bothering you, uncle Ali Rıza.
If you ever mention again, you would hurt me!
Never a botherness for me!
Oh!
Here's our salad.
Be carefully.
You were about to break the plate.
Why are you yelling at me?
Nothing broken.
I paid 20 thousands for it.
Shall I throw it to garbage the whole?
My God!
Does a plate cost 20 thousands?
No dear, Not just a plate, a whole set.
..Original Czechoslovakian porcelain 144 pieces...
But one of them broken, the whole set would be screwn-up.
The soup is very delicious, you made it excellently.
Be carefully, sucker.
You were about spoil the set of 20 thousands.
Why did put it plate so roughly like this, idiot?
He broke.
Plate has been broken!
You wasted the whole precious set to garbage.
You, dumbass,...
You broke it by yourself you to show the wife.
He broke, too.
I did, too.
Whole set totally screwn-up.
Uncle Ali Rıza, excuse us.
We unintentionally broke a few plates.
Doesn't matter, guys.
Let them broken.
As you keep breaking the plates.
Let me check that if lamp of chest, err..., damn it, ....roasted chest is ready in the kitchen.
830, 831, 832...
Hush!
834, 835, 836, 837,838.
Hush!
Dumbass Ali Rıza, dumbass Ali Rıza.
You stupid.
Hey, wife.
There must be exactly mistake in my family tree.
Hullo!
How did you come up with it?
'Cause, my Kayserian root can't have so stupid people.
It's right...
Absolutely.
I gave my own bedroom these flat-broke bumpkins.
I rough it myself on the chair.
Look at me, ...sister-in law.
It's all your fault.
Oh!
Why am I to be blamed, my dear?
You told me that they keep golden stuffs in the chest.
Why are you yelling at her?
You aspired to host them in the home.
Shut up!
You stupid.
Hush.
They may hear us.
Let them hear.
- I'll kick these bumkins out of my home.
- Talk to my hat!
I'll kick out.
I'll kick out.
9930, 9931, 9932.
9933.
See?
When everybody keep silence, I count accurately with no confusion.
1, 2...
You've bothered yourself to comfort us uncle.
You had us sleep on the good mattress.
But yourself, curl to sleep on the chair.
I mean it's a shame for us.
Yes, it's shameful!
...
I was going to talk to you.
My home isn't big enough for everybody.
You are my fellows, but I'm done.
That's it!
You have to sort yourselves out.
You're exactly right, uncle Ali Rıza.
We already have figured out the same.
We can bother you no more.
Cash us four golden coins more for accomodation expenses.
To find accomodation?
How can I let my dears to leave?
It's huge home, enough for us.
We don't want to discomfort you.
No way!
What discomfort?
You're my beloved relatives.
Check it out.
- What's this?
- Golden coin.
We have a plenty of it.
Where?
Brother Himmet keep all with himself.
- Really?
- Keep dancing.
My God, how I have couldn't figured out.
Of course...
Goldens have been always with them.
They keep the stuffs with themselves.
As he sat down on the chair, broke down the chair.
Why?
Because of weights of stuffs.
So it is.
He collapsed into recent grave in the village.
Why?
Because of weights of stuffs.
Well done, sister-in-law!
I'll buy whatever you wish as gift.
I wish nothing.
Here's the gold that he gave me, on my necklage.
You shouldn't have worn it.
What if one realises?
Hush!
Oh!
My dears you woke up early.
Did you sleep good?
My dears.
Come to dinner table, my nephews and pretty girls.
I'm alright but youngest of us still sleeping.
Night life of city gave us aching in my legs, uncle Ali Rıza.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
Gee!
Himmet, why are you standing up, sit down to have a breakfast.
No, it's OK.
I need to be back to our room.
Wake up, jerk!
What's going on?
Wake up, jerk!
You gave the golden to her, didn't you?
What golden?
He's stolen the golden.
No.
I didn't steal it.
It shown up from the bread.
Why didn't you tell us?
To give her as a present.
Why did you give her present?
To keep the secret.
Which secret, you mean?
That you keep the stuffs on you.
How could she know?
I told her.
Did you tell?
Yeah.
What's gonna happen when Ali Rıza will know it?
- We would hide.
- To where?
In the sack!
They had been already in the sack, dumbass.
We would bury the sack.
We would bury.
Where?
.
Brother Himmet!
Let's bury all somewhere in the city center.
We'ld be caught while we're digging.
What if we forget where we buried the golds?
We'ld bury in somewhere we know.
We make a sign to where we bury.
Ali Rıza may stalk us.
Let's keep an eye on our back.
Halt!
- I told you that Ali Reza'ld stalk us, didn't I?
- You did!
- He's following us, right behind.
- Where?
Gosh!
He's in disguise of a woman?
- Is he?
- You dimwit.
Go!
Brother Himmet, what about if we bury somewhere around here?
Fool.
Here's crowded with apartments and people.
Let's find somewhere deserted.
Brother Himmet!
...
I will say you something, if you don't get angry to me.
- Say it.
- Ali Rıza is after us.
Nobody!
Nobody?
Are you kidding us, dumbass?
Brother Himmet, don't care it.
Let's find somewhere to hide to stuffs.
Brother Himmet, My feet are tired to wandering around.
Is it easy to bury a sack of golds, bros?
What's up with you, man?
- I have a pee.
- Piss it.
- Where?
- Come with me.
Oh!
I've relaxed now!
Cool.
Damn you, suckers!
- Lather it more.
- Cool it!
No one pissed on me before.
What were you doing behind the bushes?
How did you have them piss on your face?
Hidden there so that none of them could see me after them.
Dumbasses came to piss on the bushes in front of me.
You burnt me.
Too hot!
Too hot!
46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
There we go.
Dig here, Hayret!
What if we forget the location?
Which fool could forget the location?
You stand in front of tree shaped like ball which is right between two poplar trees in front of white building.
You walk straight ahead for 50 steps.
That's where we hide the stuffs!
It's so easy.
Shake me firmly, shake good, bros.
Hold tight brother Himmet.
Peek around so that nobody spy upon us!
- Give the sack to me.
- Here it is.
OK.
Collect all into the sack.
Brother Himmet, you took only 5 golden coins, is it enough?
Whenever we need, we come and take more.
This is our bank.
What a bank!
Fill it up, bros.
Hurry up, go, go...
Compact it!
Let 's check it.
Alright.
Perfect!
No one can expose what's underground.
Perfectly hidden.
It's hard to figure out even for us.
We have a landmark here, dear.
My bros flipped their lid to me because of I told you.
How did they get it?
They saw golden coin in your necklage.
They told me that you would rat us to Ali Rıza.
Then, what did you do?
We buried all to hide.
Where?
If I tell you...
Shall you go away with me far from here?
Will your brothers let you go?
We'll go away without telling anyone.
All of golden coins is ours.
But never mention it to Ali Rıza.
If all will be ours, why should I mention?
Am I stupid?
Come on, tell me where did you bury?
- There's a white building between two poplar trees.
- So what?
When you turn your back to ball shaped tree in front of them.
- Listen to me carefully!
- What?
We'll wake up very early in the morning to take all stuffs and go.
- Gee!
What about your brothers?
Tell nothing to them!
You mention nothing to anybody.
We'll take all and go away.
My God.
Are you serious, Hayret?
Will all of the goldens be ours?
Of course!
Hush!
We'll go to get all early in the morning.
Be vigilant.
Never talk to others.
There's white tree between two ball shaped trees...
Walk there.
Turn you back and walk 50 steps more!
What if you can't find the exact location?
Why shouldn't I find it, am I an idiot?
I have memorized the location good.
Repeat it again.
When you ask suddenly,...
I get excited and can't say.
I can find it.
Don't worry.
Never mention it others.
Alright?
- Alright.
When we take the golds.
Let's go away as far as possible.
Why so far away?
If my brothers catch me..
I would hide you.
You don't know them, they can feel the smell of goldens from far.
Therefore, we'ld go to move to Istanbul.
Can't I find you in Istanbul, you, dumbass?
My brother!
You intend to snatch the golds, don't you?
No, I just...
Where are you going with shovel, brother?
Me?
You are already my youngest brother.
You know that I love you best.
We share them all.
- Yeah, we do.
- Right?
- Yes.
- Saffet.
- Emine.
What are you gonna do when we get the golds?
We will go to Istanbul and we live revel life together.
- My gosh!
- My gosh!
- Gayret?
- Brother Himmet!
- Saffet!
- Brother Saffet!
What a coincidence!
What's gonna happen now?
- We do three shares.
- Oh!
- Good...
Pray for God, since you have such a smart husband.
We will take all while dumbasses are sleeping.
The early bird catches the worm.
Bullshit!
I got up earliest, so what?
Brother Himmet, is that you?
Yeah.
Are Saffet and Gayret with you?
Here we are.
Understood, we will do four shares.
Come on, let's go ahead, bros.
Here's the ball shaped tree.
Eveything is there!
Here is the white building.
Here are the poplar trees.
When we turn back to this direction...
What the hell!
A fair was built on the golds!
Did you bury golds in the amusement park?
Gee!
There was no amusement park here.
What's gonna happen now?
Well, we'll go and dig to get all.
Let's go.
Go ahead!
28, 29, 30, 31.
35, 36, 37, 38.
39, 40.
Gee!
See that?
Uncle Ali Rıza's stealing our golds.
Catch him.
Screw it!
Where are you heading?
My God!
Something is happening me to puke.
Here, he's coming!
Catch him!
Saffet!
Brother Himmet caught it!
Saffet!

Bumping car has hit brother Himmet.

I'm also looking for it.

Soccer player with a hat?
Here they are!
Emine, let's run away.

No one can find us here.

- Did Gayret catch it?
Who knocked out me?
Stop it!
Someone stop it!
I just...
Gayret, stop!
No one can catch us!
See my sack!
My God!
Fallen!
Catch him!
Ali Rıza is stealing all.
Oh!
My God!
Leave me Himmet...
Go, get it!
Don't leave me alone, Saffet!
I can't stop myself, Emine!
- He's running!
- Go, catch him!
- Don't let him go!
- Stop!
You buster!
Don't come over me!
Get it!
Take me, too, brother Himmet!
No!

I'm your bro, man.

Oh!
Brother Hayret!
Let's move to catch him!
Where's thesack now?
Still way to go!
Stop!
I'm tired.
Hey!
Where are you taking me?
Hey, operator?
Land me somewhere!
It's swinging!
I'm tired to death.
OK.
Land here!
Good, good!
OK!
Hullo!
Ouch!
I got all, now!
My God!
Give it to me!
- No, I can't.
Leave me alone.
- Leave it to me.
Catch him, Hayret!
Hayret, leave me alone!
Where are you going with sack?
I'll catch you!
Gee!
- Huh, I got it!
- Leave it to me, jerk!
I said to leave it to me.
- No, it's mine!
- Leave it to me!
Leave it to me!
You leave it to me!
Go ahead guys!
Pull stronger, bros.
Stronger!
Go ahead.
Stronger.
Brother Himmet, We shouldn't have sold our oxen.
Yeah.
It's difficult to plow by ourselves.

THE END
While handing over his throne to Xia Yu...
Di Shun had few words of wisdom for him
Yao Di's full name is Fangxun Yiqi.
Na Cha...
The people are scared...
Na Cha, what are you up to?
I need to take a leak.
Yao Di is the son of Di Ku
When passing his throne to Xia Yu
Di Shun had few words for Yu.
Yao Di's whole name is Fangxun Yiqi.
Sit down.
Yao Di passed his throne to Di Shun.
Di Shun Passed his throne to Xia Yu.
When passing his throne to Xia Yu...
Di Shun had few words for Yu.
Na Cha, sit properly
and listen carefully to... these core words of rule passing from...
Yao to Shun and continually to King T ang
Di Shun told Xia Yu
The people are scared and Taoism is weak
The only solution is concentration.
People's heart refers to one's desire.
Like you sitting here,
What you want is to have fun.
You've to restrain your desire... and sit here properly.
Only then can you practice T aoism well.
Sit well...
like your brothers Jin Zha and Mu Zha.
T aoism can't develop in your restless heart
Had enough of this heart and T aoism!
You...
I need to teach you a lesson.
You really make me angry.
You...
Na Cha...
He...
Excuse us, master.
I'll take care of him
Kneel
Knees down!
Why?
I don't understand.
You disrespect your master.
It means you disrespect the heaven.
Kneel down now!
Then the master ought to do the same too.
Nonsense!
It's said the heaven ordered Cang Xie... to create letters on bamboo.
The master hit me with bamboo.
He has no respect too.
You...
Don't plead for this naughty kid.
He's so young and been down for a while
What good will he be without his lessons!
Pardon him this time
Hey kid
Na Cha.
Go on
How come?
Put it down...
Sir...
Sir, what are you doing?
What are you fooling with?
Sir, don't be unreasonable...
My pears...!
Sir, you're really too much.
This is the only means of my livelihood
What's this all about?
What the hell!
I make a living with this.
I'm so grateful to you both
Third Prince...
Use magic to enter the gate to save time or the King Dragon will worry about us.
Nonsense!
We're in the world of humans
T o act like normal human beings... will be interesting
What have you got inside?
Fish.
Open it up.
Okay.
Look.
This fish seems big and why is it slippery and hard to hold!
Let me grab it for ya
No...save some...
What for?
What are you doing?
Fight!
Don't always watch!
Do it.
I'll help whoever loses.
Little lady, I'll hit him real hard.
Who asked you to hit him?
Not fair.
You're armed, but he's not.
Screw you!
Fight.
No way... hit harder!
He stands no match for him!
You're tall but useless.
What...
Li Gen, take my turn.
Y es.
Come on
Unreasonable...
Help.
Something happened!
What is it?
Let me go.
It's the demons!
Demons?
Where are they?
He was right here!
Have you seen the demons?
The nation is peaceful.
The king is a strong leader.
How dare you fool the people?
Catch him.
Yes.
Go.
I just asked a question!
I didn't make up the news, but he did.
I didn't.
You're a liar.
You did say it.
Catch him.
Yes.
Please don't.
I didn't saying nothin'
He's making trouble.
There's no demon
I must say, you did harm Chen San
Who's Chen San?
The one who just got caught.
I'm afraid his wife and little daughter... have to become slaves of officials... in order to escape death.
Is being an official that fierce?
Who's senior?
That official or captain?
Don't say this or you'll be in trouble.
What trouble again?
Don't go.
I've questions to ask you.
T alk to me.
Leave me alone
If the coral isn't good, I've got a pearl
You...
I've lost her with you blocking the way
You should make it up for me.
How can they hit someone as they like?
It's lucky they're alive despite such torture!
Two of my sons died here!
Go.
Demons, fairies, soldiers... it's all the same!
Let's move on
I'll show you something else over there.
I suffered when entering the gate... and suffered again while leaving it.
No matter how hard you work, it's these guys who have the last laugh!
When I entered the gate this morning,
I helped one of the officials... to catch fish from a basket.
Go.
Mister
Why are they so polite to them?
I'm afraid they're the sons of officials.
You're wrong this time.
So what if they're officials' sons?
My father is an official too
T o tell you the truth...
My dad is the captain of Chentang Gate.
What?
Rascal, where've you been?
I just went out for a walk.
Brother is still naive.
Please forgive him.
I intended to go out for fun, but I learnt many things this time.
If I got stuck there, I'd learn nothing!
Father, I've something to ask you.
Follow me inside.
Inside...
Kneel down.
I've something to say.
Kneel down first
Say it.
What do you want to say?
Do the fairies, demons and officials... specialize in terrorizing people?
Answer me.
Father, please don't be angry.
You're full of nonsense.
You'll make... big trouble if I don't look after you.
I just seek an answer
Have more people keep an eye on him
Kids are naughty...
Who?
Master T aiyi from Mount Qianyuan
Fairies from heaven, officials on earth;
they're all the same!
Shao Tsou was ruthless.
But there will be a good leader.
You're a fairy.
Why don't you save the suffering people?
Na Cha, you saw the people suffering.
Why did you just watch?
!
I was alone.
I couldn't cope with the soldiers.
Want me to teach you some skills?
Master, please...
Please... 3rd Prince...
You are a horny fellow, eh!
There're pretty women in Dragon Palace, but those on earth are different.
These two are nothing special.
Yeah.
I saw one that day...
Lost her later in the woods.
Haven't laid eyes on her again!
Say, you're good at magic and stuff
It'd be easy to find out where she is.
What do you know!
T o act as a human is fun.
Yes...
You stinking kid, what are you doing?
I smell, so I'm having a bath.
Get out of the water or you're dead.
Is the river yours?
Wherever there's water it's mine!
There's some water in my belly.
Is it yours too?
Stop it.
Stop fighting.
I've told you not to fool around.
Who the hell is this?
You're a hunk.
Why're you so weak in fighting?
I did tell you not to fool around.
3rd Prince, how are you?
There's been a murder!
Someone will pay for it.
These people don't want to live anymore.
He killed someone.
He died for nothing.
I sentence you to lifetime slavery
Go.
Who'd dare to kill... the lmperial official of Heaven Palace?
Who dared to kill... the lmperial official of Heaven Palace?
Whoever comes from Heaven Palace, is an unreasonable bully.
Even harder to mention things on earth.
You cheated us.
Where did you go?
If master knows, he'll hit you hard.
I fooled around and made some trouble.
Little Master, What trouble did you make?
I killed an official from Heaven Palace
Sea Patrol Yecha.
Want to tell my dad, right?
Of course.
I've to.
My dad asked you to look after me.
You didn't do a good job.
If he knows, you'll be hit 300 times with a stick.
You...you...
T ough for you to avoid it
It's not enough if your lips are sealed
You'll have to beg me not to say a word.
Little master, please don't...
Only on one condition!
Don't follow me if I tell you to.
I wish to have fun on my own.
Never follow me.
I'll come home when I'm satisfied
Just take it as nothing.
Understand?
No?
Okay.
Or I'll tell my Dad what happened today.
About this incident you cannot say.
If master knows, we'll be in trouble.
I beg of you.
Please...
You couldn't say it.
Never...
I beg of you.
Please...
No matter what, you mustn't say it.
Never, okay?
It's a deal.
No regrets
Father, Y echa Li Gen was killed, but the killer hasn't been found.
Then go and find it out.
Yes.
Anything else?
I think someone who could kill Yecha... cannot be a commoner
If he's found, please tell me how I should handle it.
Hit to death.
No matter who he may be
Sure
3rd Prince, the killer has already left!
Where should we start?
What's the problem?
Little master has behaved well
We never left him.
Don't worry, master.
I ask you not to follow me.
We've been feeling scared for 3 days.
Please do us a favour.
No.
Don't pretend you're pitiful.
You're usually fierce to people.
I know you
I lost a fight with someone once
What are you playing so happily about?
Don't go.
Play with us.
I'd rather it'd be just us both
But I see you guys.
What?
You...
If you don't go, I'll make you a slave.
What?
What's this?
I think it's no loner fun.
You...
How can you hit people as you like?
Stop.
Stay away.
They want no disturbance.
You...
How can you hit anyone as you like?
I'll kill you.
Go, quickly.
Okay.
Don't bully people anymore.
I've taken out a tendon of the... devil dragon as my father's belt.
T ell Li that Aoguang of East Sea is here
Yes.
Master, Aoguang of East Sea is here.
Your good son...
What do you mean?
Your son killed Yecha Li Gen, then killed my third son.
He has got to make it up for them... or the mainland will be flooded with... the water of East Sea because of you.
Please release your hand.
Why do you say this?
Of my 3 sons, the first 2 are always good.
The youngest... is still small.
That's him.
Ask him to come here.
Ask Na Cha to come here.
Yes.
Please don't be angry.
If this is for true,
I won't spare this naughty son.
My son is the Rain God.
He's killed by your son's evil magic.
If the Heaven Emperor knows it, you all will be dead
Why didn't he come here?
Dad, I killed a devil dragon today, taken his tendon as a belt... for your war-robe.
What else do you want to say?
This devil dragon took women forcefully and wanted to kill me alive.
I just fought back and he couldn't stand
I couldn't help it, could I?
You...took his tendon out?
It's here.
I don't give it a damn!
Just give it back to him.
Li Jing, turn over your naughty son to me, or I'll report to Heaven Emperor.
Na Cha
Mother!
I bore you for 3 years and 6 months, and then gave birth to you.
Never thought, you would be the source of disaster for us.
What do you want?
You've to die to pay off my son's life or your entire family will be dead and I'll flood the land of Gate Chentang ...with the water of East Sea.
No one there can survive!
I'll pay for what I did.
I won't get my family... and the common people involved.
I'll pay with my life for killing your son.
Na Cha...my child...
Master, you can't watch our son...
This naughty son...better off be dead!
My son is the Rain God.
He's killed by a human being.
It's a disgrace for the Dragon Palace
You not only killed him, but also took out his tendon.
A quick death would be too nice for ya
I don't fear death
Neither do I care how I'm killed.
Let's gather people at the seaside.
I'll cut my belly open, scrape my meat for my mother and bones for father.
I won't do harm to my parents and people
What do you think?
Okay.
If you don't come tomorrow, don't blame that I'm ruthless.
Little master... new clothes made by madam for tomorrow.
Fellow citizens of Chentang Gate,
For justice, I, Na Cha killed... the 3rd son of King Dragon.
Aoguang threatened to report to Heaven
Emperor, to kill my entire family,... and to flood the land of Chentang.
So I've made a deal with him.
I'll cut my belly open here today.
My life for his son's!
T o scrape... my meat for mother and bones for my father
I'm no longer the member of Li family.
Aoguang, you've to keep your promise... not to harm my families, and the people of Chentang Gate.
Na Cha...
Aoguang, what do you say?
I won't cause trouble to others.
Okay.
It's a deal.
I may leave peacefully.
If Na Cha dies like this, what's the justice?
Master.
Do you think you died with injustice?
I was harmed by Aoguang to cut myself... for the people of Chentang Gate... and scrape to break away from my family
I died too miserably.
T ongzi, to pick lotus from Wulian Pond
T aiyi, you want to... resurrect Na Cha's spirit with lotus.
Careful!
You're acting vs. the heaven
Master...
Na Cha, your spirit is still weak.
Rest yourself at the inner cave.
I'll teach you T ao craft 49 days later.
Yes.
Yang Gen, this statue you made...
looks like that of Na Cha.
This statue is Mr. Na Cha.
He killed Prince Dragon to save us and was forced to cut his belly open.
He's the savior of Sujuan and I
I made this statue, so I can worship him.
Mr. Na Cha, I'd never forget your favour.
Would never forget you at the seaside... cutting your belly open.
He couldn't bear the suffering of... the citizens and sacrificed himself!
So we should give him a bow.
Right...bow...
How dare you block my lord's way?
We're worshiping the savior... and don't know the lord is here.
Y es
Who's he?
He's the 3rd son of Captain Li.
Our savior.
He got rid of the fierce Prince Dragon... for the people of Chentang Gate.
Poor Mr. Na Cha was... forced to kill himself by King Dragon
Captain Li carried him to the river.
Nonsense!
This is the Captain here.
Bastard, you made serious trouble... and almost harmed the whole family.
Couldn't be good even when you're dead
How dare you be worshipped by the people!
Mr. Captain...
Na Cha killed himself because... he didn't intend harm for his families.
How can you be so ruthless?
No more nonsense.
Forget it.
Don't argue with ignorant people like her
Get away...
Brother, you're really something!
What's father doing?
Playing chess with uncle Randang.
20 days already...still the same game.
I've something to say...
No.
Master doesn't allow you to leave.
Please...
I'll be right back.
Master is still at his game.
No one'd know if you keep mum
Oh boy, you sure are asking for trouble!
You don't know the wrong I suffered.
I must stop King Dragon harming people.
Please do me a favour.
Master already knows of this.
He said if you leave and anything... goes wrong, he won't save you again.
So what?
The worst is to die again.
You don't understand.
There is too much injustice in the world
I pretend seeing nothing if you insist.
What's wrong?
Na Cha is riding the Wind Fire Wheel, holding the Fire Spade, storming the sea
Most of our sea soldiers are finished.
It's raining blood!
How's Aoguang?
How's this possible?
Lord...
Help me down.
I'll take on Li Jing.
Go.
Don't take away from me.
Open up...
Look...
Look what's inside?
Put it down.
I'm conducting a deal
Egg.
Enough.
What's this?
Look what's crawling?
What are you laughing at?
No laughing.
What a shit!
You come over here.
Hand in half the goods when entering.
Got it. 2 of the 4 melons belong to you
You disrespect officials.
I'll take all.
Come over quick.
Come out.
What?
Gone...
A snake...there's a snake!
Savior, you make miracles.
Sujuan, don't be scared.
Savior was nice to us.
He won't harm us even when he's a ghost
If someone wasn't nice to me before, will they feel scared now?
Of course.
Don't go.
They're looking for you.
I died once.
What should I fear of?
Catch him.
Yes.
Seize and hit him
Beat...
I wonder how the soldiers would be like... realizing they're hitting their captain.
Relax, the official will take care of it
If I don't kill Na Cha,
I will feel restless.
If we lead Na Cha to the sea bottom, we can trap him with a net.
He's no fool.
Will he come?
Lord, 3rd Prince mentioned...
Na Cha had saved a couple.
The man is called Y ang Gen. If we...
Who are you?
Quick.
Want to die?
Quick.
Go on, hurry up
T o goof off?
Want to die...
Quickly...
Hit them hard.
Listen to me.
King Tsou is ruthless now.
The people in mainland are suffering.
Qi Zhou carries out a kind policy.
Leave at once and go to Qi Zhou.
Don't get caught and become enslaved
Thanks, lord...
Di Shun gave his throne to Xia Yu...
A Ghost...
The King must be mistaken.
Na Cha killed himself in front of you.
Could he be reborn from resurrection?
It's him definitely.
Well, even if he's re-born, he has nothing to do with me.
I'm afraid you've got the wrong person.
Li Jing, how convenient!
I think Na Cha will come to see you.
You may tell him
A woodcutter and a village woman... have been retained at my palace.
If he's got to fight for justice, ask him to come to me.
That's got nothing to do with me too
Lord, there's a ghost...
Lord, there've been reports...
Na Cha performed magic, busted the gate, and freed thousands of slaves.
I'm going to catch this scoundrel
Savior...
Be careful...
Thanks.
People of Chentang Gate took my advice.
They're heading for Qi Zhou.
You take the same road.
You'll catch up.
Okay.
Aoguang, see how you can make trouble?
Inside my Magic Ring, you'll be burnt to ashes quickly.
Look at your evil daring!
Show me 3 pieces of his scales.
I'm generous, but you can even spare me a few scales?
Okay...
Captain, where are you going?
Kneel at least when you see your father.
I've scraped myself to settle the debts
I've nothing to do with you.
My master transformed me from a lotus.
Why should I kneel down to you for?
Arrest him.
Yes.
You two thieves... always bullying the people around
I'll teach you a lesson today.
I know you lead the troop for the slaves
But I'm here.
Don't even think about it!
I think you'd better resign and, follow the people to Qi Zhou.
It's better than helping the cruel Tsou
How can you forget I'm your father?
When you broke my statue made by... the people, didn't you consider I'm your son!
Li, the tower can stop me for one time.
Unless uncle Randang always be with you!
Master...
I may pass this tower to you,
hold this tower and never put it down.
You can never comfort people with it.
But Na Cha is still young.
There must be something to stop him.
It's hard to determine who's right... and wrong between both of you.
All I can do is leave you this tower.
It really depends on you two... to become reconciled.
The underage girl
Oh!
No!
Oh!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Valeria?
Doctor Selmi is a wonderful man.
You can trust him.
Get ready!
The other girls are already dressed.
I'll wait for you downstairs.
Valeria Sanna!
Hurry up!
Doctor Selmi has no time to waste!
Get undressed!
Valeria Sanna.
Hmm.
Let's see.
Well?
What are you waiting for?
Get undressed!
Come here!
Lie here!
Get up.
Breathe.
All right.
Lie down.
Take off your panties.
Stop!
No!
Ah!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
I'll catch you!
You'll see, I will catch you!
No, you won't!
Hurry up, Angela, catch me!
Come on, catch me!
Come on, get up.
You couldn't get me.
Let me catch my breath.
My chest is burning.
How soft is your skin, Valeria.
It must be beautiful to love someone, and be loved.
Were you ever in love?
No.
With whom?
The gardener, doctor Selmi?
You could love anybody, don't you think?
The important thing is to love someone.
I don't know.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Sister Angela!
Turn in right away!
You'll explain later your behavior!
As for you, be careful: if I happen to find you behaving like this again,
I'll tell your parents right away!
Do you understand?
Valeria?
Valeria!
Valeria, stop dreaming!
You're always daydreaming!
Come on, let go back inside.
My bags are packed.
How about yours?
Not yet.
Are you impatient to go home?
I'm impatient to meet Federico, and to make love to him.
Do you like to make love?
There's nothing... more beautiful... in the world.
I think.
You'll see.
It will happen to you too.
It will have to be wonderful.
Il will be beautiful.
Count on it.
Valeria?
Valeria Sanna, as we consign to you this diploma that brings to an end an extremely important period of your ehtical and cultural upbringing,
I wish to remind you a deep truth:
school shapes the destiny of human beings, discipline determines it, knowledge makes it bright.
But as there is no real knowledge without faith making it strong, your knowledge, led to completeness in this institute, under the loving and motherly guide of its teachers, cannot but reflect the most enlightened purity of sentiments and the soundest christian ethics.
Soon you will face the world, and everything taught to you will render you able to comply with your future duties as a bride and a mother with deep, steadfast morals.
A mind free of impure thoughts is a luminous vision of the long road to travel, pursuantly to the moral law.
One day, not long ago, your mother too received from our same hands the acknowledgement of a achieved and full moral maturity.
Thus I hope that fulfilling your duties you will be worthy enough of the prestige of this insitute, as well as the bright example set by your mother and your family every day.
Dad!
Valeria!
Let me look at you!
You become a beautiful girl.
It's been a while since we last met, isn't it?
To what do I owe this surprise?
What surprise?
Weren't you due tomorrow?
No way!
I even sent you a telegram!
Really?
Maybe your mother made a date mixup.
Anyway, the importan thing is you're here with us.
Is mom inside?
Ehm..no.
Of course, she could not imagine you being here early, I mean today.
Anyway, Carlotta will take care of everything, wont' you, Carlotta?
Gladly, sir.
Well, then, you have to forgive me.
I have a very important meeting at the factory, and I can't miss it.
I'll see you later, ok?
Carlotta will accompany you to your room, and she'll take care of everything.
Bye, honey.
See you tonight, then!
Bye!
Come, miss!
This was your bedroom before you went to the boarding school, wasn't it?
Do you want me to help you unpack your bag?
It doesn't matter.
You can go.
Oh!
Oh!
I'm so sorry!
I'm so...
Hey!
Who the heck are you?
Is this the way you get into my bathroom?
This is my bathroom, and that is my bedroom.
And I will not leave unless you tell me who you are.
Your sister, moron!
Wait, wait!
You must be that hipless flat chested pimply faced fright!
Check this out!
You're a piece of ass to die for!
Couldn't you clean up your words?
Alright, sister!
I'll behave!
Still, some ass you got...
Lorenzo!
Ok, I'll rephrase, sister.
Buttocks.
Did all of you look like this at the boarding school?
Do you know where's mom?
She's always busy on Thursday's.
Busy with what?
Funnier things than wasting time with you.
Go to hell, idiot!
We are all really happy to have you back here among us.
Aren't we, Massimo?
What?
Oh, yes, sure!
Our little child.
Whom, in the meantime, has grown up a bit, apparently.
Exactly!
Often parents have a personal impression of their children.
I guess you have lots of thing to tell us about.
Balderdash!
Young people does not talk with their parents.
It's a way of defending their personality, I guess.
Valeria has no secrets for me.
Isn't it true, honey?
No.
I don't think so.
I believe she does have some, instead, and it's her right.
Intimacy has its limits.
The use of hands at the table has its limits too!
Could you pass the salad?
I hope you're glad you found your room just like you left it before going to the boarding school.
It used to be your favorite haven.
As you can see, nothing has changed here.
Where are you going?
Lunch is not over yet!
May I take your car, Dad?
The keys are on the shelf.
If he were my son, I'll slap his face!
Please, Carlo.
He's just a boy.
He's just a thug!
There you go.
Thank you.
Do you want anything?
No.
You know I don't drink.
As I was saying, I read the report of your accountant.
It's garbage.
The guy is useless.
Fire him.
But he's been working for me for twelve years!
Business is no place for feelings.
He's incompetent.
Fire him!
You know, dear, I think we should be closer.
You're a woman, now, and I have a lot of question for you.
Oh, forgetful me!
I didn't even ask how did your exams go.
Fine!
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting!
Sorry for barging in!
It got late 'cause the lecture started early.
So hello.
I'll say hello to you later.
Hi to the both of you!
Why...who's this girl?
Uncle, this is Valeria!
Valeria?
Valeria who?
But...
Valeria...
Valeria, your niece!
Ah!
Valeria!
Valeria, the niece!
Yeah, I heard that.
But...werent' you at the boarding school?
Yes, uncle, but she's back now.
You know, the Sisters of Christ....
Ah, the Sisters of Christ!
Yes, excellent, excellent religious order, isn't it?
(Christian)
A strong christian discipline and no funny business!
God bless you!
But, see, there's no time.
Because today, it't Pro Civitate...that's what I was saying 50th anniversary!
We can't be late!
Don't make me waste late (sic)
You're always in the way!
You stay here, you're fine here.
I need to speak to you instead.
Whenever you like!
No, I told you already, you can call me by my first name.
Yes!
Under the condition, obviously, that you open up your wallet!
Yes, because the magazine has to increase its circulation.
Well, actually we increased it five months ago...
So?
We'll increase it again!
We'll increase it!
Of course we'll increase it!
He's saying he'll increase it!
Do you want ahteism to choke us?
He wants ahteism to choke us.
Listen, son, I reserved a little spot for you up in the sky that...you'll see!
Stop prettying yourself up!
Let's move!
Let's go?
Are you coming or what?
Pro Civitate cannot wait!
Let's go!
Bye honey!
Move ahead!
Let's get out together...
Does a a real sense of family still exist, congressman?
No doubt about it!
The family institution is the strongest core upon which our nation lays its foundation.
Citizens can find in it a complete fulfilment and the achievement of every goal...
Hello?
Guess who, gorgeous?
How could you forget?
Who is it?
Hello?
So it's true!
You're nothing but a whore!
I should have known since the day I met you!
What a stupid prank!
I don't know you!
What do you want?
I do know you, instead, all too well.
I even know you have a mole... just below your belly button!
But...how the heck do you know...hello?
Who's speaking?
Hello?
It's me, your brother.
Move your behind, wherever you are, and join us.
The gang wants to meet you.
I was sleeping, idiot.
Leave me alone!
Don't be a drag, come on.
We're waiting for you.
Go to hell!
Quiet!
Be very quiet!
Let's get in from the backdoor!
Shut up!
No!
Not the girls!
Why?
Because I said so!
Well, at least leave whisky here!
Easy, guys!
Show me the money!
No cards or free tickets, got it?
These sum up to 80.000.
You still owe me 40.000 Lire, ok?
I'd rather cut off my balls than play poker again with you!
You know the way.
Make a noise and you're out!
Understood?
Sir.
Come on!
Turn on the light and take off your clothes!
Do I take off everything?
Everything!
You are like Daring Gordon!
He too makes Vanessa strip naked in "The return of the rapist"!
Did you read it?
No!
I told you to turn on the light!
But...isn't it better if...?
Not at all!
Light is important!
You are a bit of a pervert, though...
In "Sex and violence" the Man in the Mask always forces women to take off their clothes!
And then he whips them!
You dont' want to whip me, sir, do you?
I'll certainly do it if you don't turn on the light!
Come on!
Quiet, you morons, otherwise we can kiss goodbye to the show!
And no money back!
Understood?
What are you doing, sir?
I'm flipping the best panorama!
Panorama?
Damn, what a globe!
Shut up, idiot!
But, sir, what are you doing?
You are someone else tonight!
How many hands do you have?
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
What the hell are you doing?
Ehm...we were playing hyde and seek...
Oh yeah?
Well, all busted!
How about that?
They're coming!
My father!
Everybody out!
What do you mean "everybody"?
Come on, move!
Out!
The old guys!
They're coming!
Up the stairs!
Come on!
Move!
Gianluca!
Where is Gianluca?
Where is everyone else?
Down there.
They're inside!
Damn, where can I hyde?
Come with me!
Fantastic!
Come in!
What should I do?
Shhh!
Close your mouth.
If they find you here, you won't get away with it.
Do you think so?
I do.
Damn.
Valeria?
Valeria, are you awake?
Just a second, mom.
Out!
On the balcony?
Yes, yes, on the balcony!
What do you want?
Nothing...we thought we saw shadows in the garden.
You won't find him.
He's outside the window, on the balcony.
Outside what?
Come on, honey, you shouldn't evev say such things!
An angel like you...
Well, sweet dreams!
Goodnight.
Goddamn!
Hello!
Oh, it's you.
Right.
They almost caught me.
Where?
In your sister's bedroom.
And, tell me, what were you doing in my sister's bedroom in your underwear?
Well, I wasn't in my underwear...then.
It was...
later.
Shit!
Dad let the dogs out!
Come on, move!
Come on, jump over the wall!
Come on!
Don't move!
It's a beautiful shot!
Massimo!
Yes?
Stop reading the newspaper and help me.
What should I do?
Put lotion on my body.
Be gentle.
Gentleness has always been one of my best features.
Don't forget opportunism.
You would be injust by yourself.
My breasts too.
Technically impossible.
Untie it.
They could see you.
And catch us red-handed...
You're a bit cynical, dont' you think, my wife?
And you're a bit of an asshole.
Lotion!
I forgot how beautiful you are.
You could even make me ashamed!
Come on, lower!
Like that!
Easy!
Franca!
Yes?
What?
I was thinking...maybe we could have...
What?
Why we ended up like this?
Lotion me and shut up!
Enough!
Let's go for a ride on the motorboat!
Are you coming?
I'd rather not.
I get seasick, remember?
Oh, right.
I feel like swimming offshore.
What are you doing like that?
Are you crazy?
I was sunbathing.
What's wrong with it?
Somebody could see you.
Who?
Salvi?
Of course, Salvi too.
What would he think of us?
Right.
What would he think?
Come on, let's go.
I am not coming.
Well, I mean, what's going on today?
Everybody's acting weird!
I'm not weird.
I just don't feel like coming and that's it.
I just want to pick up seashells.
Do whatever you like.
I'll see you later.
Come on, stop it!
They could see us!
Who?
Seagulls?
Fish?
Or your conscience's eyes?
Stop talking like that.
Why?
Does it bother you?
I've stopped being bothered by the truth a long time ago.
You can afford it.
Of course I can.
I fought all my life to be rich enough to afford it.
Everything is about money, for you.
It is all about the money.
I know it, your husband knows it and you know it too, my sweet, beloved, wonderful whore.
Please, no...no...
And I say yes!
I like you because you're a well-to-do whore.
God-fearing...perfect mother and a damn whore!
Carlo!
Good morning.
Good morning!
I said good morning!
Yeah, yeah, I heard you!
Then why didn't you answer?
I was soldering an important piece.
Have a seat.
Where?
A bit sohpisticated, aren't we?
Wherever, on the sand, on the stove, or just stand.
Wow, how kind of you!
May I call you by your first name?
What's wrong with you?
I am working, by myself, and you just pop here and behave like you own the place.
And then you try to involve me in an argument about social relationships between middle-class people.
What are you talking about?
Have you become insane?
"Become insane" is not the proper expression.
To become insane means the transition from a state of normality to one of proven abnormality.
It's not me.
I have non "become insane".
I am insane.
Always been.
Since my birth.
Scared?
Not at all.
I knew it.
I don't scare anyone anymore.
Do you want a coffe?
Yes, please.
You're in luck!
If you got here ten minutes later, no coffee!
Crap!
What now?
There's a hole in the coffee pot.
No coffee.
No problem.
Right!
I'll solder it!
But I told you it doesn't matter.
How come you never get it?
There we go!
How do you like it?
You really are crazy.
Goodbye.
Come here.
Wait!
Why do you judge people before you get to understand it?
What's to understand about the coffee pot?
Nothing about the coffee pot.
But, the handlebar with the coffe pot...
A symbol.
A what?
A representation of reality through my eyes.
A sculpture, if you will.
I could sell it.
Take a walk.
You're crazier than I thought.
See, you need the handlebar to understand the coffee pot.
And then you need a price to understand coffee pot and handlebar.
Come here.
Come.
Get closer!
Here.
Look!
You can see a picture of two human beings that appear to be tied by a relationship.
They're alone, certain that no one can see them.
Are they in love?
Do they hate each other?
Are they about to kill each other?
There's still at least a missing key element to judge them.
Let's say that is the coffee pot that is missing.
Hey!
What the hell is going on with you?
Hey, come here!
Wait!
Wipe that long face!
It's not a funeral.
If you knew what's going through my mind...
All right.
I'll taky you home.
Forget it!
I'd rather stay with your friends.
You'll have fun, sister, I promise!
Fantastic, wonderful!
He's a great artist, he's been to America!
He studied acting at Actor's studio!
See, right now he's playing a tree.
He's personifying the spirit of a tree!
He can stay like this for eight hours, motionless, without breaking a sweat!
Incredible!
What do you say?
I think this is bullshit...
Me too...
Hi, people!
Hi!
How are you?
Hey!
Guys, this is Valeria, my sister.
Hello, beauty!
We met already, didn't we?
What...what are they doing?
It's the great innovation of the century.
The most excting form of gambling ever!
It's a sex slot machine.
We swapped cherries, oranges and lemons with porn drawings.
Every valid combination entitles to perform the drawing.
See?
Want any?
And you find it funny?
Well, there are more interesting conditions.
It all depends on the combination of the drawings.
Come on, let's go!
Oh, tough luck!
Let's see his score!
Three open mouths!
I scored three open mouths!
I won!
No, I'm out!
I don't do such things!
Knock it off!
The other day we caught you with Franco and you looked like a cannibal!
Silly!
What are you saying?
What about the jackpot?
You have to have sex with everybody.
The whole bunch.
Ok, got it.
Hi!
Look who's here.
It looks like you did it!
Well, it was a bit tough, but I managed.
Wanna jump in?
Do you want to go away already?
No!
The cars here are chairs and couches.
If you feel like chatting, you get in a car and sit down.
And if someone wants to have sex, he has to turn on the car lights.
Easy, isn't it?
Very!
Do you have a cigarette?
A cigarette...cigarette?
Do you stutter?
I though you meant something else.
What?
Forget it.
Are these ok?
Perfect.
Tell me, I'm curious.
What were you doing the other night at my house?
Do you really want to know?
Yes.
Well, they were peeking on Lorenzo and Carlotta.
And you find peeking so amusing?
I said "they were peeking".
You mean you don't like girls?
I mean I like to HAVE sex.
So what were you doing with the other guys?
We're all part of the gang.
Where else should I go?
It's a stupid excuse.
In fact, you're here tonight again.
I was me who told Lorenzo to take you along.
You?
Yes.
No, I didn't mean it...
They turned on by themselves!
Sorry, there are no free cars.
Don't worry, there is room enough.
Listen, Poppi, this time is serious.
I need them by the day after tomorrow.
I don't have them.
Where should I find 200.000 all at once?
Wait a moment!
I signed in my father's name.
It's no joke!
I must find the money!
Find it somewhere else.
I can't give it to you.
Valeria!
Valeria, wait!
Don't go.
I'm sorry if the whole matter shocked you.
I'm not shocked.
I'm bored.
Do you want me to come along?
No.
I'll catch a cab.
As you say.
Look, I never made trouble, but your factory is a complete mess.
Can you read a balance sheet?
I'm doing it since I was born.
And these numbers say it's a disaster.
It's the end of the world.
A galactic deflagration!
How is it my fault if the market is in a crisis?
Your brain is in a crisis!
There's no such thing as "the market"!
It's us who create it by producing at a competitive cost and forcing customers to buy!
Do you really believe people forks out money for nothing?
Obviously, I wasn't talking about us.
I'll go and rest for a while.
Good idea.
Why?
Is there something else, in life?
Please, Massimo.
I warned you many times about what you say in front of the boys.
All right, all right.
But he shouldn't take such attitude!
